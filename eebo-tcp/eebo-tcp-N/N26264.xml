            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <opener>THE MEMORIAL of William Cunningham, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Murdoch, James Robiſon, and John Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Junior, ſurviving partners of Andrew Coch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rane, William Cunningham, Robert Bogle, John Murdoch, Peter Murdoch, James Robiſon, Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Henderſon, William Reid, and John Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Junior,
<hi>RESPECTFULLY SHEWETH,</hi>

                  <p>THAT the ſaid Andrew Cochran, William Cunningham, Robert Bogle, John Murdoch, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Murdoch, James Robiſon, William Henderſon, William Reid and John Hamilton, junior, were ſubjects of his Britannic Majeſty carrying on buſineſs under the firm of William Cunningham and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and that the ſaid William Cunningham, Peter
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:034906_0003_0FFF9323EF8CB6D8"/>
Murdoch, James Robiſon and John Hamilton, jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ior, are the ſurvivors of the ſaid firm.</p>
                  <p>Your memorialiſts further beg leave to ſhew, that for many years previous to the fourth day of July one thouſand ſeven hundred and ſeventy-ſix, they carried on extenſive buſineſs as merchants in the then colony, now ſtate of Virginia, and had eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed ſeveral conſiderable ſtores in that country un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the management and direction of different fact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors and agents, among others the ſtore called Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Cunningham and company's Brunſwick Store, the accounts of which will be herein after more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly mentioned.</p>
                  <p>Your memorialiſts further beg leave to ſtate and ſhew, that from the earlieſt ſettlement of Virginia, the inhabitants, having very little circulating caſh among them, had no means of procuring neceſſaries from Europe but by the crops they annually made—hence aroſe a practice of obtaining goods upon credit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til their crops were reaped, and as the articles taken up at any one time were generally ſmall in value and quantity, being chiefly occaſional ſupplies for their families, it was never thought neceſſary to procure evidence of the facts, the moſt perfect and deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well grounded confidence, was placed by the planter in the books of the merchant; but in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of time, as the inhabitants became much more numerous, debtors ſometimes diſputed the accounts, which threatened deſtruction to that confidence which had hitherto ſubſiſted between the merchants and the planter, and which was eſſential to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of the inhabitants. This induced the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:034906_0004_0FFF932662F09480"/>
of Virginia in the year 1748 to paſs the act intituled "An act preſcribing the method of prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing book debts"—a copy of which act is laid before the board.</p>
                  <p>After the paſſage of this law the courſe of trade continued upon the ancient footing, the deciſions of the courts were equitable, and the practice of the bar liberal—a mutual confidence exiſted between the merchant and the planter, and in the public o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion few evidences were more reſpected than a merchant's books. From this temper and diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the parties, and the ſecurity which the law and the practices of the country afforded the credit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, ſuits were ſeldom brought unleſs the delay of payment was unconſcionable or the debtor declining in his circumſtances, in which caſes they were brought not to authenticate the debt, for that was conſidered as eſtabliſhed without, but merely to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force payment of the money. The revolution and its conſequent regulations, came therefor on your memorialiſts by ſurprize; but even if it had been foreſeen, it was not in their power to compel pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment after the twelfth day of April 1774, as the coſts of ſuit in Virginia were regulated by a tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry law called the Fee Bill, which expired on that day and was not revived again until other impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments hereafter to be mentioned began to exiſt. In this ſituation were things when a law was paſſed which obliged the creditors, their factors and agents to leave the country.</p>
                  <p>Your memorialiſts further beg leave to ſhew, that on the 4th day of October 1779, an act was paſſed
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:034906_0005_0FFF9329C4C10698"/>
in Virginia, intituled "An act for diſcouraging ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive credits, and repealing the act preſcribing the method of proving book debts"—a copy of which is alſo before the board. By the operations of this act and the deciſions under it, thoſe hopes which your memorialiſts had entertained, that on a return of peace they would have been permitted to prove their debts according to the exiſting mode at the time they were contracted, were entirely blaſted —for their books being no longer admitted as proof of the debt, and the factors, agents and ſtore-keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers who might in ſome caſes have proved them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing driven out of the ſtate, dead, or diſperſed into different parts of the world, your memorialiſts, in all caſes of this deſcription are without redreſs in the courts of the ſtate.</p>
                  <p>Your memorialiſts having made theſe few prelim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inaries, and in their opinion neceſſary obſervations, beg leave further to ſhew that prior to the fourth day of July 1776, they had eſtabliſhed (among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) a ſtore at  <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Your Memorialiſts further beg leave to ſhew that each, every and all of the debts ſtated on the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral papers marked as above, and forming part of this memorial, remained due and unpaid to your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morialiſts and their factor, at the time of their fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's leaving Virginia in obedience and conformity to the law before mentioned, And that no part or parts of the ſaid debts and demands, or any of them, have ſince been recovered or received by your Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morialiſts, or by any other perſon or perſons to their uſe, but that each, every and all of them, ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main due and unpaid.</p>
                  <p>Your Memorialiſts further beg leave to ſhew, that from a ſhort time after the definitive treaty of peace between Great-Britain and the United States, they have had an Agent in Virginia, and yet have, fully authorized and empowered to collect and give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittances for the debts due to them, but all the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors of their ſaid Agents were without effect, owing as well to the Impediments before ſtated as to others herein after mentioned. In fact your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morialiſts aſſert, that notwithſtanding the proviſion
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:034906_0007_0FFF932DB5D6F968"/>
contained in the 4th article of the ſaid treaty of peace, no judgment was or could be obtained in Virginia, at the ſuit of a Britiſh ſubject, for a debt due before the war, where a plea of Britiſh debts was put in and ſupported, until after the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the year 1793, which year the firſt judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was rendered, and the deciſions in many of the diſtricts and county courts were not effected ſooner than between two and three years afterwards.</p>
                  <p>The legal impediments which exiſted in Virginia ſince the peace, preventing the recovery of Britiſh Debts, are to be found in the following Acts of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, in addition to thoſe abovementioned, copies of which, in the following order, are before the Board.</p>

                  <p>This act is more generally known by the name of the Depreciation Law, and operates as an impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the following manner. The debts due to your Memorialiſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> were contracted before any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciation was known, but in many inſtances the Bonds were not taken for the ſaid debts until after the period at which this retroſpective law has fixed the commencement of the ſcale of depreciation. The bonds are taken for current money of Virginia; and as the courts of law refuſe to admit parol proof to alter the purport of what is under ſeal, theſe bonds are determined to have been taken for the money current at the date, and to be reduced accordingly.</p>
                  <p>Your Memorialiſts deem it unneceſſary herein par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to ſtate each and every Act of the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Virginia which created impediments to the recovery of their juſt demands; they will only add, that when the Aſſembly of that State on the 12th December 1787, paſſed
<q>an Act to repeal ſo much of all and every Act or Acts of Aſſembly as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits the recovery of Britiſh Debts.</q>

<pb n="10" facs="unknown:034906_0009_0FFF9334973C3248"/>
ſhall, by his Proclamation, notify to this State that Great-Britain hath delivered up to the United States the poſts therein now occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied by Britiſh troops, which poſts were ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to be given up to Congreſs immediately after the concluſion of peace, and is alſo taking meaſures for the further fulfilments of the ſaid treaty by delivering up the negroes belonging to the citizens of this State, taken away contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the ſeventh article of the treaty, or by making ſuch compenſation for them as ſhall be ſatisfactory to Congreſs.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Your Memorialiſts further ſhew, that by means of the impediments aforeſaid, no ſuits whatever could be maintained for debts due before the peace, in Virginia, to Britiſh ſubjects, until after the adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the preſent Conſtitution of the United States—That even ſince the adoption of the ſaid Conſtitution, no debt can be recovered where your Memorialiſts Store Books are the only evidence to ſupport the demand, and in many inſtances of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſory notes and ſigned ſettlements acknowledging the balance, the Act of Limitations has barred re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery.</p>
                  <p>That in ſuits upon obligations under ſeal, bearing intereſt, the juries in all caſes deduct at leaſt eight years intereſt, in many caſes they barely allow the principal, and in others allow intereſt only from the impetration of the writ—That during the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the impediments aforeſaid, many of your Memorialiſts' debtors have abſconded or become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvent, and from thoſe yet reputed ſolvent, and
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:034906_0010_0FFF9336191E38B8"/>
whoſe debts are evidenced by bonds or notes, your Memorialiſts cannot now actually have and receive the full value thereof in the ordinary courſe of judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial proceedings, as well owing to the deduction of intereſt as aforeſaid as to this further impediment, to wit, that at the time the ſaid debts were ſeverally contracted the difference between ſterling money of Great-Britain and the currency of Virginia was only 25 per cent, whereas by laws paſſed ſince, there is now a difference of 331/3; per cent.—</p>
                  <p>Your memorialiſts therefore pray that this their claim may be received to the amount of the ſeveral ſums of money principal and intereſt ſtated in the ſeveral ſchedules annexed to and forming part of this memorial, in which they have arranged the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral debtors to their Brunſwick ſtore, under the following claſſes.—</p>

                     <item>D. Debtors who have deceaſed and their property divided or ſquandered, or who have removed during the exiſtence of legal impediments, and whoſe preſent reſidence and circumſtances are unknown.</item>
                     <item>E. Loſſes ſuſtained by deductions of intereſt and the difference between the Currency of Virginia at the time certain debts were contracted, and the time they were paid.</item>

But if your Board ſhall think it conſiſtent with equity and juſtice, after the delays, loſſes and expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes already incurred, that the Agents of your Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morialiſts ſhould ſtill longer be detained in the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting the ſaid debtors yet remaining ſolvent, your Memorialiſts pray that a partial award may be made upon the whole of this claim, excepting the debts on ſheet C, together with ſuch further allowances as juſtice and equity ſhall require.</p>

                  <head>THE ANSWER. <hi>TO THE COMMISSIONERS</hi> For carrying into effect the Sixth Article of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween His Britannic Majeſty and the United States of America, concluded on the Nineteenth of November, 1794.</head>
                  <head type="sub">The anſwer of the United States by their agent to the claim of William Cunningham, Peter Murdoch, James Robiſon and John Hamilton, junior, ſurviv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing partners of Andrew Cochran, William Cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Robert Bogle, John Murdoch, Peter Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doch, James Robiſon, William Henderſon, William Reid and John Hamilton, junior.</head>
                  <p>SECTION I. AS this claim is conceived to ſubmit to the deciſion of the board of commiſſioners many of the important principles relative to the debts within the ſtate of Virginia, of which payment may be claimed under the treaty of 1794 from the treaſury of the United States, it ſeems neceſſary that it ſhould be diſtinctly and thoroughly examined in all its parts, and that every material principle which it involves ſhould be fully diſcuſſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="2" facs="unknown:034906_0016_0FFF93447B115680"/>
                     <note place="margin">Limited juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the Arbitrators.</note>The United States and his Britannic Majeſty have conſtituted by mutual conſent an extraordinary tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal for hearing and deciding the ſpecial caſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the 6th article of the treaty of 1794. As the cognizance of this tribunal is expreſsly limited to ſpecial caſes, nothing can be more indiſpenſably requiſite than to underſtand the limits which are ſet to it. In arbitraments between man and man under the municipal regulations of a ſtate, it is a rule that the arbitrators ought not to exceed their juriſdiction, and if they do, a remedy may be eaſily ſupplied in the ordinary courſe of juſtice, for by the civil as well as the common law an award upon a caſe to which the ſubmiſſion does not extend is void. In arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments between nation and nation the ſame rule pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails that the arbitrators ought not to exceed their juriſdiction, but if they do, there being no common controuling power to correct the error each nation has a juſt right to judge for itſelf, and may juſtly conſider as void every arbitrament upon a caſe out of their limited juriſdiction. This obſervation is made to impreſs on the commiſſioners the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary importance of underſtanding the limits which are preſcribed to them by the terms of the article: For ſhould an error unfortunately occur on this point it may lay a foundation for diſappointing all the good conſequences that have been expected from the article and perhaps for renewing the diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions between the two nations which it is ſo deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſhould be forever compoſed.</p>
                  <p>In expreſſing on the part of the United States their opinion, that it is neceſſarily reſerved to each
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:034906_0017_0FFF5F9F24E3DCE8"/>
nation to determine for itſelf whether an award is within the ſphere of the ſubmiſſion,<note place="margin">Limited juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the Arbitrators.</note> it is not meant to aſſert that the arbitrators are not to decide for themſelves whether a caſe is cognizable before them or not, but it is meant to aſſert <hi>that though they ſhall decide a caſe to be cognizable before them, yet if it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to either nation that it is not, either has a juſt right to diſregard the award.</hi> If this were not ſo, there would be no difference between a limited and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited ſubmiſſion. If this were not ſo, the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners might determine any and every queſtion upon any and every ſubject which concern the two nations. Though this opinion is ſo reaſonable in itſelf that it need not be ſupported by any authority, yet what a learned modern writer has ſaid upon this ſubject deſerves to be noticed. Vattel relative to the arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of national diſputes obſerves
<q>It may then happen, as in the example juſt alledged, that the arbitrators may exceed their power, and paſs their judgment on what has not been really ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to their deciſion: and being called to judge of the ſatisfaction a ſtate ought to make for an offence they may condemn it to become ſubject to the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Certainly that ſtate never gave them ſo exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive a power, and their abſurd ſentence is not bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. To avoid all difficulty, and to take away every pretence from bad faith, it is neceſſary to determine <hi>exactly in the compromiſe, the ſubject of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, the reſpective and oppoſite pretenſion, the demands of the one, and the oppoſitions of the other.</hi> This is what is ſubmitted to arbitrators, and upon this they promiſe to adhere to their judgment.
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:034906_0018_0FFF934A74C62D78"/>
If then their ſentence is confined within theſe bounds,<note place="margin">Limited juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the Arbitrators.</note> it is neceſſary to ſubmit to it. It cannot be ſaid that it is manifeſtly unjuſt, ſince it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced on a queſtion which the diſſention of the parties renders doubtful, <hi>and which has been ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as ſuch.</hi> In order to be free from <hi>ſuch</hi> a ſentence, it ſhould be proved by indubitable facts, that it was produced by corruption, or a flagrant partial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity.</q>

                     </gap>29.</p>
                  <p>Hence it appears if a caſe within the ſubmiſſion is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided by arbitrators, even though the ſentence is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be unjuſt it ought to be executed unleſs proceeding from corruption; but if the caſe be out of the ſubmiſſion then the ſentence is not obligatory.</p>
                  <p>When the treaty of 1794 was formed, the courts of juſtice in all the ſtates of America were open. This was well known to the negociators on both ſides as well as to both nations. But there were ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and extraordinary caſes in which complete juſtice was not attainab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e in the ordinary courſe of juſtice and to decide theſe a particular and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary tribunal was inſtituted. The treaty having been made between two nations who ſpeak the ſame language, who are alike in manners and morals, who till lately were united under the ſame empire and whoſe principles and ideas of juſtice are deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the ſame ſources, it may be hoped to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſame interpretation in both countries, and eſpecially that there will be no diſagreement reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the meaning of the 6th article among the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners who are ſelected to decide upon it. In
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:034906_0019_0FFF934BFAEBADE0"/>
the propoſed diſcuſſion much aid will be ſought by the agent for the United States from the rules and principles of equity recognized by the judicial de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations of the Britiſh courts, whoſe pure and wiſe adminiſtration of juſtice for many ages while it has been the ſource of happineſs to the people of that country, has alſo been an object of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt admiration among mankind.</p>
                  <p>It is a general rule that has prevailed at all times and which is acknowledged in all courts that the plaintiff or claimant muſt produce ſufficient proofs of his caſe to be entitled to the redreſs he ſeeks.<note place="margin">Claimant to prove his Caſe.</note> 
                     <hi>Melior eſt conditio defendentis</hi> is a maxim highly eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed becauſe it conduces to the ſecurity of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty and to the repoſe of ſociety. This rule applies to the claims which may be brought before the board with more than ordinary force from the nature of the tranſactions to be examined and proved, which in detail are unknown to the United States or their agent but which may be preſumed generally to be known to the claimants with all the material cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances belonging to each caſe. The proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of applying this rule with preciſion is further ſtrengthened by the terms of the agreement on the part of the United States who promiſe to make <hi>full</hi> compenſation for loſſes and damages in thoſe caſes only where full compenſation cannot be obtained in the ordinary courſe of judicial proceedings and which have been occaſioned by ſome lawful impediment, without the delay or negligence or wilful omiſſion of the claimant and without the inſolvency of the debtors or other cauſes as would equally have ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:034906_0020_0FFF934FAD4CB1E8"/>
to produce ſuch loſs if ſome legal impediment had not exiſted.<note place="margin">Claimant to prove his Caſe</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore the agent for the United States cannot omit to inſiſt that the United States ought not to be awarded to pay the debt of any citizen to the claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant until the latter ſhall produce ſatisfactory proof of every ingredient eſſential to a caſe of loſs and damage chageable to them under the ſtipulations in this article of the treaty. What thoſe ingredients are, will now be the ſubject of enquiry, for which purpoſe it will be convenient to recite the firſt clauſe of the article under conſideration which is as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows:</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Whereas it is alledged by divers Britiſh mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and other his majeſty's ſubjects, that debts to a conſiderable amount, which were bona fide con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted before the peace ſtill remain owing to them by citizens or inhabitants of the United States, and that by the operation of various lawful impediments ſince the peace, not only the full recovery of the ſaid debts has been delayed, but alſo the value and ſecurity thereof have been in ſeveral inſtances im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired and leſſened, <hi>ſo that by the ordinary courſe of judicial proceedings,</hi> the Britiſh creditors cannot now obtain, and actually have and receive <hi>full and adequate</hi> compenſation for the loſſes and damages which they have thereby ſuſtained. It is agreed, that in all <hi>ſuch</hi> caſes, where <hi>full</hi> compenſation for ſuch loſſes and damages cannot, for whatever reaſon, be actually obtained, had and received by the ſaid creditors in the ordinary courſe of juſtice, the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited States will make <hi>full and complete compenſation</hi>
                        <pb n="7" facs="unknown:034906_0021_0FFF9353F66942A0"/>
for the ſame to the ſaid creditors:<note place="margin">Claimant to prove his Caſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </note> But it is diſtinctly underſtood, that this proviſion is to extend to ſuch loſſes only as have been occaſioned by the lawful impediments aforeſaid, and is not to extend to loſſes occaſioned by ſuch inſolvency of the debtors, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſes as would equally have operated to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſuch loſs, if the ſaid impediments had not exiſted; nor to ſuch loſſes or damages as have been occaſioned by the manifeſt delay or negligence, or wilful omiſſion of the claimant.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>So brief and intelligible is this ſtipulation that it is difficult by any phraſeology to make it either more conciſe or plain. To attempt it let it be ſaid that every claim againſt the United States muſt be found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on a debt contracted before the peace and remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing due to a Britiſh ſubject on the 19th November 1794, from a citizen or inhabitant of the United States, which by the operation of ſome lawful im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment ſince the peace, has been either delayed as to recovery or leſſened in value or ſecurity, ſo that a loſs and damage has accrued to the creditor for which in the ordinary courſe of judicial proceedings <hi>full</hi> compenſation cannot be obtained and which loſs and damage was not occaſioned by the inſolvency of the debtor or any other cauſe that would have equally produced it, if a legal impediment had not exiſted, or by the manifeſt delay or negligence or wilful omiſſion of the claimant. For every ſuch loſs and damage, full and adequate compenſation is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed by the United States, and God forbid that a promiſe ſo juſt and ſo honorable ſhould not be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled with exemplary fidelity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="8" facs="unknown:034906_0022_0FFF93557A832040"/>
                     <note place="margin">Claimant to prove his Caſe.</note>Every remediable claim muſt be for a loſs of the ſpecial deſcription following:</p>
                  <p n="1">1ſt. There muſt have been a debt from a citizen of the United States to a Britiſh ſubject contracted before the peace of 1783.</p>

                  <p n="3">3d. The debtor muſt have been ſolvent at the date of the treaty of peace and during the exiſtence of ſome lawful impediment muſt have become inſolvent and be ſo yet.</p>
                  <p n="4">4th. Some loſs and damage to the creditor muſt have ariſen from ſome lawful impediment either by delaying the payment of it or leſſening its value or ſecurity, and the nature and extent of that loſs ſhould be deſcribed.</p>
                  <p n="5">5th. There muſt be an incompetency in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary tribunals of juſtice to compel the debtor to make full compenſation for the loſs and damage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned.</p>
                  <p>Theſe ſeveral ingredients it is incumbent on the claimant to prove to the ſatisfaction of the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners before an award can be juſtly made in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor; and moreover, if it ſhall appear from the proofs produced either that the loſs and damage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid had been occaſioned by the manifeſt delay or negligence or wilful omiſſion of the claimant or by the inſolvency of the debtor or other cauſe that would have equally. produced it, if no legal impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

                  <p>Nothing need be ſaid to ſhew the neceſſity of proving the firſt, ſecond and fourth particular nor to elucidate the reaſonableneſs of requiring that proof from the claimant. A few remarks however are expedient relative to the third and fifth.</p>
                  <p>As to theſe it may be obſerved the claimant is to be preſumed to know the circumſtances of the debt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, becauſe they are generally known when the credit is given, and the creditor having an intereſt in the affairs of his debtor, will naturally from time to time make enquiries concerning his tranſactions, ſo as to know how he has been employed, whether he has been thrifty or prodigal, what eſtate he poſſeſſed, what was done with it, where his domicil is, and many other particulars which need not be here enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated. If the agents of the United States were multiplied ſo as to fill every corner of the country this ſort of knowledge would be acquired by them in moſt inſtances with great difficulty and expenſe. This obſervation is ſpecially applicable to claims ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing out of debts contracted in America in the courſe of retail dealing. Therefore it ſeems on this account reaſonable that the claimant ſhould be required to prove the ſolvency of the debtor at the treaty of peace, and his inſolvency ſince, and the legal im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment to the recovery of the debt which has oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned a loſs. But another reaſon for requiring theſe proofs from the claimant ariſes from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the promiſe of the United States. It is a promiſe to pay out of their treaſury whatever ſum
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:034906_0024_0FFF935978874C58"/>
of money is neceſſary in certain caſes for doing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete juſtice to the creditor which the debtor ought to pay, but which cannot be got from him. They are reſponſible to pay, only if the debtor cannot ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by reaſon of inability or certain other cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes be compelled to make full compenſation, and have agreed to pay whatever deficiency of full com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation ſhall remain unattainable from the debtor in the ordinary courſe of judicial proceedings in the particular caſeS deſcribed in the article. The claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant therefore ought to prove what this deficiency is, which implies that he muſt alſo prove that he has diligently proſecuted all reaſonable means for recov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering from the debtor whatever it was poſſible to get from him in the ordinary courſe of juſtice. In the caſe of every particular <hi>debtor</hi> a queſtion will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe to be decided by the commiſſioners, whether the creditor has uſed reaſonable diligence to compel him to pay the debt. Hence it may be inferred as a <hi>general</hi> rule that the creditor ought to apply to the courts of juſtice againſt the debtor before he applies to the commiſſioners againſt the United States.</p>

Nor where the creditor from the conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of blood or friendſhip to the debtor, has omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſue for it till it has become irrecoverable, or would not now ſue for it if the debtor was able and might be compelled to pay it. That cannot be ſaid to be a loſs and damage, to which the party freely <hi>conſents.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8th. Nor where the creditor at <hi>the commencement of the war</hi> was barred according to the laws of the land by the judgment of a competent court or by any act of limitation or other cauſe, ſo that if the

Nor where the treaty of peace having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete operation, the juſtice and extent of the claim has been judicially decided and aſcertained accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thoſe rules of law and equity which prevailed when the contract was made and the judgment of the court has been fully ſatisfied and diſcharged. For inſtance, where verdicts founded on equity have been rendered for the defendant, or where in judicial proceedings off-ſets and credits have been juſtly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to reduce the debt, or where intereſt during the war in whole or in part has been diſallowed upon equitable conſiderations.</p>
                  <p>It is not attempted to enumerate here all the caſes which may be brought forward, containing ſome feature or other that excludes them from relief under the 6th article of the treaty, but thoſe are preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to view which ſeem leaſt liable to controverſy. This article muſt be admitted to have grown out of the 4th article of the treaty of peace, and was meant to retribute the loſſes and damages in certain caſes ariſing from a contravention or imperfect execution of it. If this be the policy of the ſtipulation, it may be laid down as a fundamental rule, that no loſs nor damage is reparable under the treaty of 1794 that is not grounded on a debt comprehended in the 4th article of the treaty of 1783 and has not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the violation or non execution thereof. This leads to an enquiry as to the true meaning of the laſtmentioned article and particularly whether it meant to provide for the payment of intereſt during
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:034906_0027_0FFF9364C77B9E70"/>
the war, and if it did not, then it muſt be contended that compenſation ought not to be awarded for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt during the war.</p>
                  <p>SEC. 4.<note place="margin">Intereſt during the War.</note> Theſe debts were contracted either in the then American colonies where the creditor and deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor reſided at the time of contract, or elſewhere in other parts of the Britiſh dominions where the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor reſided. Moſt of the objections againſt the claim of war-intereſt, are alike applicable to both deſcriptions of debt and a few will apply with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter force to the former.</p>
                  <p>Though the 4th article of the treaty of peace, is in its terms reciprocal ſo that it would ſeem that each nation was equally intereſted in having it plain and free from doubt, yet the contrary is well known to be the fact. The creditors almoſt entirely belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to one and the debtors to the other nation. It was then the peculiar intereſt and duty of the credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor nation to expreſs this ſtipulation in ſuch language as to leave no doubt that it embraced not only the principal debt but the intereſt alſo during the war, and if this explanation has not been made it is the worſe for that nation. <hi>Veteribus placet pactionem ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcuram vel ambiguam venditori et qui locavit nocere; in quorum fuit poteſtate legem apertius conſcribere. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt, lib.</hi> 2, <hi>tit.</hi> 14, <hi>de pactis leg.</hi> 39. "It is an ancient rule that an obſcure or ambiguous pact is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued unfavorably to the vender and creditor in whoſe power it was to expreſs the legal meaning more plainly." The ſame thing is laid down by Vat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel as a general maxim in interpreting treaties B. 2. Section 264. "If he who can and ought to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:034906_0028_0FFF93664D7FAC58"/>
himſelf clearly and plainly has not done it,<note place="margin">Intereſt during the War.</note> it is the worſe for him; he cannot be allowed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce ſubſequent reſtriction; which he has not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed," nor (I will add on the ſame principle) can he be allowed to introduce ſubſequent extenſions which he has not expreſſed. The pact made between the two nations exiſts only in the article now under conſideration, and if the expreſſions admit a reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable doubt whether intereſt during the war was comprehended or not, and if it was the duty of the creditor to have been more explicit than he has been, that interpretation is to be received according to theſe rules, which is moſt favorable to the debtor.</p>
                  <p>This argument is enforced by what paſſed between the Commiſſioners of the United States for negotiat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a peace with Great-Britain, and David Hartley, miniſter of his Britannic Majeſty. Before the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitive treaty was ſigned in their letter of the 17th July 1783, they repreſented the ſenſe of Congreſs on war-intereſt, in the following words "Congreſs alſo think it reaſonable that ſuch part of the intereſt which may have accrued on ſuch debts during the war ſhall not be payable, becauſe all intercourſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two countries had, during that period be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come impracticable, as well as improper. It does not appear juſt that individuals in America ſhould pay for delays in payment, which were occaſioned by the civil and military meaſures of Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain."<note n="*" place="bottom">Preſident's Meſſages, page 140.</note> After this if War-intereſt was meant to be claimed on the part of Great-Britain ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eqivocal terms ſhould have been uſed, comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and the not uſing ſuch terms is an acquieſcence
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:034906_0029_0FFF936A98FF98E0"/>
in the opinion entertained by Congreſs,<note place="margin">Intereſt during the War.</note> which had been communicated by the American negotiators of the Treaty.</p>
                  <p>Hence it may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e preſumed that the article was underſtood by Great-Britain, as it was by America, and underſtood not to comprehend war-intereſt.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, it is ſaid by Grotius, that if the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of words be dubious as the ſeller or buyer may be affected, the interpretation ought to be againſt the ſeller, who ought to blame himſelf for not fully explaining himſelf. B. iii. Ch. 20. Sect. 26. So if a doubt ariſes whether the words of a ſtipulation ought to be interpreted favorably to the creditor or to the debtor, the reaſon of this rule ought to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in favor of the debtor, who is generally in the greater want, and therefore is in more need of the benignity of conſtruction.</p>
                  <p n="2">2dly. Suppoſing the words of the article to be am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous, that interpretation is to be preferred that leads to equality, and therefore it has become a well known rule, that the cauſe of him who wiſhes to avoid a loſs, is to be preferred to him who ſeeks an advantage. Vattel, book 2d. ſection 301. To deny intereſt on theſe debts during the war will put the creditor and debtor upon a more equal footing than to exact it, and a loſs will not be incurred by the debtor for the ſake of a gain to the creditor.</p>
                  <p>What is meant by intereſt?</p>
                  <p>If intereſt be defined the hire of money to be paid by another for the uſe of it, this ought not to be paid to the creditor, when the debtor has been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:034906_0030_0FFF936C1CAC1A68"/>
of the means of uſing it with profit by unfore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen events,<note place="margin">Intereſt during the War.</note> to be attributed to the creditor equally, if not more than to himſelf. If the creditor receive intereſt during the war, he loſes nothing, and gains every thing that he would have gained in peace. To him the war is no calamity. On the other hand if the debtor pays intereſt during the war, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made no profit during this period, but in many inſtances having ſuſtained loſſes, he will be charged with an additional loſs.</p>
                  <p>Thus then it is apparent, that if the Britiſh cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors remain without war-intereſt from their Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican debtors, who made no profits during the war, the two parties will be in a more equal ſituation, than if the former ſhould receive that intereſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly. The ſtipulation in the fourth article of the treaty of peace "that creditors on either ſide ſhall meet with no lawful impediment to the recovery of the full value in ſterling money of all bona fide debts" contracted before that time, provides for the principal only, and leaves all claims of intereſt open, to be decided judicially, according to all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of each caſe. There is no country in the world, where the diſtinction between principal and intereſt is better underſtood than in Great-Britain, and there <hi>Debt</hi> in common parlance means principal excluſively of intereſt. Generally in accounts the debt and the intereſt are diſtinctly ſtated.</p>
                  <p>If in the language of ſome political writers inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt is truly defined to be the <hi>hire of money,</hi> it cannot be contended that the hire of the ſum is the ſame thing with the ſum itſelf. This would be to ſay that
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:034906_0031_0FFF936D9EB6F210"/>
a profit produced by a thing, was the thing itſelf.<note place="margin">Intereſt during the War.</note> But the profit of land, or chattels is well known to be a diſtinct and ſeparate thing from the land or chattels. No remark perhaps can more ſtrongly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force this diſtinction between debt and intereſt, than that debts in many inſtances do not carry intereſt. This is too well known to require particular illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If a ſum of money be due, a promiſe to pay the debt is not a promiſe that intereſt on the debt ſhall be paid alſo.</p>
                  <p>According to the Roman lawyers "intereſt is what is given more than the principal, that the creditor may not be a loſer;" Uſura quod accedit ne in dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no verſetur creditor. Grotius B. 2. chap. 12. note to ſec. 21. The learned Puffendorf obſerves that the damages allowed the creditor for what he might have made of his money, are among other reaſons, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded for failure of payment at the time appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which ought to be ſtated according to the loſs ſuſtained, be it what it will; but becauſe it would be difficult to prove and adjuſt it exactly, it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore generally reduced to regular intereſt."</p>
                  <p>"Since therefore 'tis lawful to demand damages for tardy payment, or becauſe we loſe by not having our money paid in at the time appointed, why may we not bargain for ſomething certain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand, upon conſideration that our money is in another man's power, whereas we were not obliged for his benefit to venture the loſs, or to neglect the gain that might be made of it." B. 5. chap. 7. ſec. 9. But on this point let the books of Engliſh juriſpru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence be conſulted, and let that definition of intereſt
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:034906_0032_0FFF9372137F1AA8"/>
be received in preference to any other,<note place="margin">Intereſt during the War.</note> which in a long courſe of judicial deciſions, by learned, wiſe and juſt judges, has been eſtabliſhed in England. To this the claimant will not preſume to object, and the agent for the United States conſcious of the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, intelligence and equity, which the judges of that country have diſplayed, moſt readily conſents. By the Engliſh judges, intereſt is conſidered as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation for the damage ariſing from detaining the debt, and ſo diſtinct is the intereſt conſidered from the debt, that an action of debt does not lie to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the intereſt accrued on the debt. In the caſe of Yeoman vs. Barſtow, juſtice Powel ſaid that "debt ne giſt pour interet," 1 Lutwyche 274. In the caſe of Seaman vs. Dee, after ſeveral arguments lord chief juſtice Hale ſaid "no action of debt lies for the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of money, though he which borrows it, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to pay after the rate of 6 per cent for it, but it is to be recovered by aſſumpſit in damages. So where by deed the party covenants or binds himſelf to pay the principal with intereſt, the intereſt is not to be included with the principal, in an action of debt, but ſhall be turned into damages, which the jury is to meaſure to what the intereſt amounts to." 1 Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triſs 198. This is a judicial reſolution upon the very point, whether intereſt was recoverable as debt, which was brought before the court by demurrer, and therefore is of high authority. If it be an axiom of Engliſh law, as it is believed to be that an <hi>action of debt</hi> lies for recovering every debt, and if ſuch an action does not lie for intereſt, as has been ſhewn, it then follows that in the eye of Engliſh law, inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt is not debt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="19" facs="unknown:034906_0033_0FFF93739525BDF8"/>In the caſe of Holdiph vs. Otway,<note place="margin">Intereſt during the War.</note> it was declared by the c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Saunders 206. In Hobior vs. Ebyzſon upon a writ of error to the king bench, the counſel for the plaintiff ſaid that in an action of debt and judgment by default intereſt was allowable by the court, by way of damages occaſione deten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis debiti, without the trouble of a writ of enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the counſel for the defendant, agreed, That in debt a jury will be directed to give the intereſt in damages, and chief juſtice Parker in giving judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment declared that by the common law in every ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of debt damages are given occaſione detentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis debiti, either by writ of enquiry or by the court. 10th. Mod. 277. Lord Mansfield in the caſe of Zinck vs. Langton, confirmed this doctrine that in an action for debt intereſt is recoverable by the way of damage and ought to be the rule for aſſeſſing the damage. This was a writ of error, and a motion was made under the ſtatute of Henry the 7th. that intereſt on the original judgement ſhould be allowed for da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage ſuſtained by the delay ariſing from the writ of error which was granted by the court, who ſaid that the original action being for a debt, the intereſt ought to be the meaſure of the damage." So in Sweatland vs. Squire, juſtice Powel ſaid that intereſt is recovered by way of damages when damages are recovered occaſione detentionis debiti. 2d. Salkeld 623. In ſhort no rule ſeems better eſtabliſhed in the practice of the courts of England as well as of the ſeveral United States than that in an action of debt,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:034906_0034_0FFF93760648FA70"/>
intereſt is recoverable as compenſation for the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage occaſioned by detaining the debt.<note place="margin">Intereſt during the War.</note> Thus much has been thought neceſſary for ſupporting the poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that "debt" is diſtinguiſhable from intereſt and does not neceſſarily ex vi termini include inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt. If this be admitted, then the 4th article of the treaty of peace being ſilent as to intereſt, may be interpreted not to include it, but to leave all claims of intereſt to be decided according to juſtice, upon a comprehenſive view of all circumſtances attending each caſe.</p>
                  <p>As a general rule it may be admitted that intereſt from the ratification of the definitive treaty of peace ought to be paid to the creditor in ſpecialty caſes, and alſo wherever by the uſage of trade it was in contemplation of both parties that it ſhould be pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Though this ſhould be admitted, yet it is contended that intereſt during the war under the ſingular and unprecedented circumſtances under which the creditor and the debtor were placed by it, ought not in equity to be paid.</p>
                  <p n="1">1ſt. Becauſe it may fairly be inferred that the omiſſion in the treaty to ſtipulate for the payment of war-intereſt, was meant to bury in oblivion that ſpecies of damage ariſing from the detention of debt for which intereſt is the ordinary compenſation. This idea is ſtrongly ſupported by Vattel, who ſays,
<q>As every power at war pretends to have right on its ſide, and this pretenſion is not liable to be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by others, the ſtate of things at the inſtant of the treaty is to be held legitimate, and any change to be made in it requires an expreſs ſpecification
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:034906_0035_0FFF9377A9AB9658"/>
in the treaty,<note place="margin">Intereſt during the War.</note> conſequently all things not mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the treaty, are to remain as they were at the concluſion of it. This is alſo a conſequence of the promiſed amneſty. All the damages cauſed during the war are likewiſe buried in oblivion, and no plea is allowable for thoſe the reſtoration of which is not mentioned in the treaty: they are looked on as if they had never happened.</q>
B. iv, ſec. 21. If then the damage to the creditor by detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his debt during the war, is to be buried in obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion, there remains no ground to claim compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for that damage, or in other words to claim in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. This matter muſt remain incapable of repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration as at the inſtant of the treaty.</p>
                  <p n="2">2dly. In a liberal view of this ſubject it deſerves to be noticed that different opinions have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained in the United States and great Britain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that part of the 7th Article which prohibits the "carrying away negroes or other property of the American in habitants," and it has been executed in the manner moſt favorable to the latter. The Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans inſiſted that this Article was to be interpreted <hi>liberally</hi> in favor of their ancient rights, but the <hi>strict</hi> conſtruction has prevailed. With reſpect to the 4th Article concerning debts, the Americans have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended and do contend, that a ſtrict conſtruction ought to be given to it, excluding intereſt, but on the part of Britain it is urged that a liberal conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould be given, ſo as to include intereſt. Is it reaſonable or equal that where a ſtrict interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one article will be advantageous to Britain, it ſhould be taken, and that where a ſtrict interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:034906_0036_0FFF93792C9CBEF0"/>
of another article will be advantageous to Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,<note place="margin">Intereſt during the War.</note> it ſhould be denied. In a national point of view, may not the loſs of ſlaves by reaſon of the ſtrict conſtruction put on one article, be reaſonably oppoſed to the demand of intereſt during the war, when founded not on a ſtrict but on the moſt liberal interpretation of another article? Is it reaſonable that every article in the treaty ſhall be underſtood moſt unfavorably to the United States? Is it conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with thoſe "principles of liberal equity and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocity" which the preliminary articles declare to be the baſis for ſecuring perpetual peace and harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny?</p>
                  <p n="3">3dly. It cannot be ſaid with reaſon or juſtice, that when by the laws of the nation to whom the credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor was ſubject, it was highly criminal for him to receive payment, the damage to him in not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving payment, ſhould be anſwered by the debt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or. So fully impreſſed with the weight of this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was the Britiſh Secretary of Foreign Affairs, in the year 1786, in a converſation with the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Miniſter, that he agreed with him in the injuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of demanding intereſt during that period. This may be ſeen in an extract of a letter from the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican Miniſter at the Court of Great-Britain to the American Secretary for Foreign Affairs, dated June 16, 1786.</p>
                  <q>Lord Caermarthen told me yeſterday, "That he had letters from Mr. Anſtey, mentioning his civil reception." A long converſation enſued up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſubject of the froſts, debts, &amp;c. little of which being new is worth repeating. The policy

of giving up the intereſt during the war,<note place="margin">Intereſt during the War.</note> and of agreeing to a plan of payment by inſtalments, was again inſiſted on, from various conſiderations, particularly from the evident injuſtice of demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intereſt from that period. It was urged that the claim of intereſt, in moſt caſes, was grounded upon cuſtom and the mutual underſtanding of the parties; but that it never had been the cuſtom, nor had it ever been underſtood or foreſeen that an Act of Parliament ſhould be paſſed, caſting the American debtor out of the protection of the crown, cutting off all correſpondence and render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all intercourſe criminal; for that was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult and the legal conſtruction during the whole war.</q>
                  <p>
                     <q>Here his Lordſhip fully agreed with me, and ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en out-went me, ſaying, that "It was very true, that by conſtruction of the law of this land, it was high treaſon in a creditor in Great-Britain to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a remittance from his debtor in America du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the war." His Lordſhip added ſome ſlight expreſſions concerning the intereſt, and wiſhed that the Courts were opened for recovering the principal: we might leave the intereſt for an after conſideration.</q>

                  <p n="4">4thly. The detention of the debt during the war, was unavoidable by reaſon of the war, not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all commerce was interdicted to the United States by the Britiſh parliament, and all intercourſe and acceſs between the American debtors and Britiſh creditors was unlawful and generally impoſſible in conſequence of the party creditor, but becauſe the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:034906_0038_0FFF9380DAB8AED8"/>
Americans were abſolutely deprived of the means of payment,<note place="margin">Intereſt during the War.</note> by the nature, manner and events of the war. On the ſide of the Americans it was a war for life, liberty and property—it was a war pro aris et focis; their country was invaded almoſt every where, hoſtilities were brought into its boſom, their great towns taken, ſome of their ſmall ones deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the huſbandmen obliged to abandon their homes, the labourers carried away by force, or ſeduced by reward, the plantations and farms not permitted to be cultivated, as in ordinary wars between independent nations they might have been, and all the products of the land were indiſpenſably neceſſary for defence. There was nothing left to an individual for paying intereſt on his debt, and in a conteſt of this kind, if ſucceſsful, few expected to be required at a future day to pay intereſt upon <hi>any debt</hi> due to a Britiſh creditor, for that ſpace of time when all profit from their property was become impoſſible. Waving the enquiry before a tribunal conſtituted as this is, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the juſtice of the war on the one ſide or on the other, it may be aſſerted, that if the two nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons had equal juſtice on its ſide in regard to it, yet under the extraordinary circumſtances attending its proſecution it is not equitable to claim intereſt dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the period of the war upon American debts due to Britiſh ſubjects. The agent for the United States is aware that Great-Britain is to be viewed in the light of a creditor nation in Europe, Aſia and Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, and that it deeply concerns her to extend the claims of intereſt upon debts as far as may be prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable, yet he relies they will be limited by the principles of equity.

If the proprietor at the end of the war is only reinſtated as he ſtood at the beginning of it, which is the correct operation of poſtliminy, intereſt during the war is neceſſarily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.

Yet <hi>thoſe debts</hi> which were due to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſons at the beginning of the war are not to be forgiven, for theſe were not contracted by the right of war, but only forbidden to be demanded in time of war, therefore the impediment being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, that is the war ended, they retain their full force.</q>

                  <p>It is to be obſerved that at the time this author
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:034906_0040_0FFF9384F2DC6E78"/>
wrote,<note place="margin">Intereſt during the War.</note> intereſt was lawful in but few countries, and there not generally but in ſpecial caſes: therefore intereſt on a debt during war could not have been in his contemplation, and the latter ſection is to be confined to the principal only. So underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it the doctrine is not denied. But the former ſection very much favors the idea which has been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore preſſed, that intereſt being the rated damage for detaining the principal, and this detention being the effect of the war, and the treaty not expreſsly mentioning intereſt, it ought to be conſidered as a damage forgiven by the peace.</p>
                  <p>In like manner it is laid down by Vattel
<q>debts contracted with individuals or injuries which they may have received without relating to the war, are likewiſe not aboliſhed by the agreement and amneſty, theſe relating only to their object, that is <hi>the war, its cauſes and effects.</hi>
                     </q>
                     <q>That the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the agreement or amneſty cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to things of no relation to the war, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by the treaty. Thus claims founded on a debt or an injury prior to the war, but which made a part of the reaſons for undertaking it remain en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, and are not aboliſhed by the treaty unleſs it be formally extended to the extinction of every claim whatever. It is the ſame with debts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted during the war but for cauſes of no rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to it or with injuries likewiſe done during the courſe of the war, but foreign to the ſtate of it.</q>
Upon this let it be obſerved that the firſt clauſe relates to the debts due to the nation, and the latter to the debts due to individuals; and it is agreed that
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:034906_0041_0FFF93876D95F3D0"/>
neither ſpecies of debts as diſtinct from intereſt,<note place="margin">Intereſt during the War.</note> are aboliſhed by a treaty of peace without expreſs words to that effect. 2d. It is true that the author lived at a time when intereſt on debts was become more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral than in the time of Grotius, and therefore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he has uſed different expreſſions, which as to individuals are confined to <hi>debts</hi> excluſive of intereſt, or if they extend to intereſt during the war, they are to be underſtood to aboliſh intereſt during this period. According to him claims for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of injuries ariſing from or effected by the war, are aboliſhed; others not relating to the war are not. Tne detention of the debt during the war was an injury or damage to the creditor, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the war, eſpecially under the circumſtances of the American war; therefore a claim for repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for this damage, that is for intereſt during the war is aboliſhed by the treaty of peace.</p>
                  <p>But further to illuſtrate that the circumſtances of the American war ought in the judgment of juſt men to exempt the debtor from paying intereſt during that period, it deſerves to be noticed that in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of both parties when the credit was giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, the expected profits of the farms and plantations in America conſtituted the funds from which the debts were payable, and the intereſt too in thoſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes where by contract or uſage intereſt ought to be paid. It is laid down by Viner in his abridgement of the laws of England
<q>that where by a general and <hi>national</hi> calamity nothing is made out of lands which are aſſigned for the payment of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, it ought not to run on during the time of ſuch calamity.</q>

Surely it is not neceſſary to enlarge on the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitous ſituation of America during the war,<note place="margin">Intereſt during the War.</note> or to attempt to prove a fact ſo notorious, that individuals generally made no profit to themſelves out of their lands. In the language of the American Secretary of State, in his excellent letter of 29th May 1792, to the Britiſh miniſter,
<q>Can a more general nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal calamity be conceived than that univerſal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſtion, which took place in many of thoſe ſtates during the war? Was it ever more exactly the caſe any where that nothing were made out of the lands which were to pay the intereſt? The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce of thoſe lands, for want of the opportunity of exporting it ſafely, was down to almoſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in real money, e. g. tobacco was leſs than a dollar the 100lb. Imported articles of cloathing or comſumption were from four to eight times their uſual price. A buſhel of ſalt was uſually ſold for 100lb. of tobacco. At the ſame time, theſe lands, and other property, in which the money of the Britiſh creditor was veſted, were paying high taxes for their own protection, and the debtor as nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal holder, ſtood ultimate inſurer of their value to the creditor, who was the real proprietor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were bought with his money. And who will eſtimate the value of this inſurance, or ſay what would have been the forfeit in a contrary event of the war? Who will ſay that the riſk of the property was not worth the intereſt of its price.</q>

Such was the practice of the courts in Maſſachuſetts till the year 1787. Such was and has continued to be the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the courts of New-York, New-Jerſey, Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia and South-Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina, and in like manner have juries acted in the caſes that were under the power of their verdicts. A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of opinion on this point in the different ſtates, of the numerous individuals whoſe duty in ſome way or other it has been to decide upon it, ſpeaks loudly in favor of its rectitude; eſpecially when it is remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered that in ſome of the ſtates, the claims of Britiſh debts were ſo inconſiderable, and ſo few as not to have occaſioned public concern, or to have excited any prejudices. This opinion therefore muſt have proceeded from the pureſt principles of equity; and to ſuppoſe the contrary would be to queſtion the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bity of the beſt and moſt intelligent part of the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican ſociety.</p>
                  <p>Conſcious that they were not entitled to intereſt during the war, the Britiſh creditors themſelves, or their agents, when they began the adjuſtment and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of their debts, almoſt univerſally diſclaimed intereſt during this period. When they obtained judgments in the courts, they formally releaſed the
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:034906_0044_0FFF938ED7CFB400"/>
intereſt during the war,<note place="margin">Intereſt during the War.</note> and the like rule they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in all amicable adjuſtments with their debt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors. Preſident's Meſſages, page 133, 134, 12, 6, 143. The Agent for the United States is authoriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to repreſent that this was the prevailing practice in Maryland and Virginia; and to add, that demands for more than a million of dollars have been ſettled and paid in thoſe two ſtates according to this rule, with the conſent of the creditors, and in moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances at their own ſuggeſtion. The idea of claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intereſt during the war, upon this kind of debts, ſcarcely prevailed any where until of very late years, except in the State of Maſſachuſetts, where it began to appear in the year 1788.</p>
                  <p>Whether intereſt during the war, ought in equity to be paid, was a queſtion more likely to be decided rightly immediately upon the return of the peace, when all the circumſtances of the war were in the knowledge of the parties, than at a later period; and the general impreſſion, the general conviction and general practice which was then taken up by the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors, that intereſt during the war ought not to be claimed furniſhes an argument that deſerves much conſideration.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the reaſons that have occured for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the propoſition that the Britiſh creditors are not entitled upon principles of juſtice to intereſt dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the war, on the debts due from the American debtors, which were contracted before the war, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the debts be evidenced by bond, note or account. A bond in common form carries intereſt only by the uſage of the courts and juries in America as well as
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:034906_0045_0FFF93922A773740"/>
in Great Britain, for the legiſlative acts,<note place="margin">Intereſt during the War.</note> of both coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, are alike on this ſubject, and in both they limit the annual intereſt not to exceed a certain ſum and do not enact poſitively that intereſt ſhall be paid in any caſe.</p>
                  <p>If according to the treaty of peace the payment of intereſt during the war is not ſtipulated but left to be decided by principles of equity, and if theſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples dictate that it ought not to be paid, then the claim of intereſt during the war cannot be awarded in any caſe whatever, under the treaty of 1794. The 6th article of this treaty was not deſigned to enlarge the rights of creditors beyond what they were under the treaty of 1783, but to ſatisfy their claims under the 4th article of that treaty, in inſtances where from the operation of legal impediments contrary to good faith loſſes had occurred, and complete juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice was unattainable from the debtors, and the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors had not been in fault.</p>

                  <p>Whatever reſpect might have been ſhewn anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently in the courts of juſtice to the evidence of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants books, when the planters were in greater igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and in greater neceſſity than within the laſt forty years, it ſeems very certain, that this kind of evidence had declined in reputation in the year 1748, when the act preſcribing the method of proving book debts was paſſed, to which the claimants have referred. To encourage the merchants of Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain who traded to America, was the policy declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

But it is not correctly ſtated by the claimants that at the time the revolution was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced, the book of a merchant who or whoſe fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor reſided in Virginia when the goods were ſold and delivered, was <hi>concluſive</hi> evidence of the debt in all caſes, but on the contrary it was only admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable evidence in ſpecial caſes and under ſpecial cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances and relative to goods ſold and delivered within a certain ſhort time previous to the action brought, and was liable to be oppugned by any le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal evidence whatſoever.

Enough it is hoped has already been ſaid upon the interpretation of the treaties to ſhew the untenability of ſuch a doctrine, and with great deference to the board the agent for the United States ſubmits whether what has been ſtated by the claimants relative to the operation of the acts of Virginia above mentioned, on their claims found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on book-debts, be not either erroneous or irrele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</p>

Firſt, by authorizing debtors to Britiſh ſubjects to make payment into the loan office of the ſtate: but it has been ſolemnly determined in the ſupreme court of the United States, that pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments under this act are no legal impediment to the recovery of the full value in ſterling money, of any debts contracted before the war.

It is anſwered that to permit theſe ſuits to continue in court during the war was a favor to which the plaintiffs, who had become enemies, were not on general principles entitled. Theſe ſuits ſhould have been abated in conſequence of the war, but they were not, and on the return of peace they might have been immediately, as they have ſince been proſecuted, and in many inſtances with effect. In the claſſifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which the claimants have made of their various debts, none were in ſuit on the 12th day of April, 1774, as will appear hereafter, upon examining the ſeveral claims which are preſented by them to the board, and therefore, <hi>they</hi> cannot have ſuffered any

In this the claimant is correct, yet if it has been ſatisfactorily ſhewn, and the agent for the United States truſts it has been ſatisfactorily ſhewn that no payment under the act of 1777 is a legal impediment, the revival of it muſt be deemed wholly immaterial.</p>

<q>And whereas the good people of this ſtate will labor under many inconveniencies for want of ſome rule, whereby to ſettle and adjuſt the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of debts and contracts entered into and made between the firſt day of January, one thouſand ſeven hundred and ſeventy-ſeven, and the firſt day of January one thouſand ſeven hundred and eighty-two, unleſs ſome rule ſhall be by law eſtabliſhed for liquidating and adjuſting the ſame, ſo as to do juſtice as well to the debtor as creditor: Be it therefore enacted by the General Aſſembly, that from and after the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of this act, all debts and contracts en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into or made in the current money of this ſtate or of the United States, excepting at all times contracts entered into for gold and ſilver coin, tobacco, or any other ſpecific property, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the period aforeſaid, now remaining due and unfulfilled, or which may become due at any fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture day or days, for the payment of any ſum or ſums of money, ſhall be liquidated, ſettled and adjuſted, agreeable to a ſcale of depreciation here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in after mentioned and contained, that is to lay, by reducing the amount of all ſuch debts and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts to the true value in ſpecie at the days or times the ſame were incurred or entered into:</q>

<pb n="41" facs="unknown:034906_0055_0FFF93A8D3A334D8"/>
preſent claimants,<note place="margin">No legal impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment in Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia ſince the peace.</note> there is not a ſingle bond of this deſcription; for they are dated anterior to the firſt day of January in the year 1777, and the ſpace of depreciation fixed by the act commenced on the firſt day of January 1777, and ended the 1ſt day of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary 1782. Conſequently theſe claimants have no right to complain of the depreciation law, as they have not received a loſs from it in any caſe, in any form whatever. It is reſerved to the United States more fully to diſcuſs this law, when any caſe of loſs under it ſhall be preſented to the board. In the mean time the agent for the United States thinks proper to mention his information, that by judicial deciſions it has been ſettled in Virginia, that if a bond dated at any time between the 1ſt day of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary 1777, and 1ſt day of January 1782, contains in the condition or any part of it any thing to ſhew the debt was originally contracted before the date of the bond, the depreciation law ſhall not be conſtrued to operate on ſuch a caſe; but if the bond has no ſuch intrinſic evidence of the time the debt was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, it is liable to be ſcaled and parole evidence is not admitted to alter the effect and purport of the ſealed inſtrument. Thus then if the creditor omitted to take a bond ſo as to ſhew by ſomething in it, that it was probably to ſecure a debt contracted before the war, it was a wilful omiſſion in him, and if any loſs ariſes from hence, it is a loſs not intended by the treaty of 1794, to be charged on the United States.</p>

Theſe

are the words,<note place="margin">No legal impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment in Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia ſince the peace.</note>
                     <q>Whereas it is ſtipulated by the fourth article of the treaty of peace between the king of Great-Britain and the United States of America in Congreſs aſſembled, that creditors on either ſide ſhall meet with no lawful impediment in the recovery of the full value in ſterling money of all bona fide debts heretofore contracted; Be it therefore enacted by the General Aſſembly, that ſuch of the acts or parts of acts of the legiſlature of this commonwealth, as have prevented or may prevent the recovery of debts due to Britiſh ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, according to the true intent and meaning of the ſaid treaty of peace, ſhall be, and are here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by repealed.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Provided that this act ſhall be ſuſpended until the governor with the advice of council ſhall, by his proclamation, notify to this ſtate that Great-Britain hath delivered up to the United States the poſts therein now occupied by Britiſh troops, which poſts were ſtipulated by treaty, to be given up to Congreſs immediately after the concluſion of peace; and is alſo taking meaſures for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fulfilment of the ſaid treaty, by delivering up the negroes belonging to the citizens of this ſtate taken away contrary to the ſeventh article of the treaty, or by making ſuch compenſation for them as ſhall be ſatisfactory to Congreſs.</q>
It will not be urged that this act repealed any act whatſoever prohibiting the recovery of Britiſh debts, if any le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal prohibition at that time exiſted. But the whole act is to be conſidered as nugatory; the proviſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the act which is correctly ſet forth by the
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:034906_0057_0FFF93AF9A2786B0"/>
claimants ſuſpended the operation of the act com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely,<note place="margin">No legal impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment in Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia ſince the peace.</note> if indeed there had been any ſubject for its operation. In reality there was no ſuch ſubject. There was no act or part of an act in force which prohibited the recovery of Britiſh debts on the 12th of December 1787, and it was paſſed under an erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous opinion that ſome ſuch act or part of an act did then exiſt: an opinion that was generally prevalent as much becauſe the creditors did not venture to bring forward their claims from an idea of a general prejudice againſt them before a court of juſtice, as for any other reaſon which can be aſſigned.</p>
                  <p>It has been alledged as another impediment to the recovery of the full value of the debts in ſterling money, in the ordinary courſe of judicial proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that at the time the debts were ſeverally contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the difference between ſterling money of Great-Britain and currency of Virginia was only 25 per cent, and by the laws paſſed ſince the revolution the difference is now 33⅓ per cent. Since the year 1755 to this day, the law has been reſpecting the ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling money debts, the ſame. It was enacted,
<q>that in any action which hath been or ſhall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced, and is or ſhall be depending for the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of any <hi>ſterling</hi> money in any court of record within this commonwealth, wherein the plaintiff or plaintiffs ſhall recover; ſuch court ſhall have power, and are hereby directed by rule, to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered at the foot of their judgment in ſuch action, to order ſuch judgment to be diſcharged or levied in current money at ſuch rate of exchange <hi>as they ſhall think juſt,</hi> any law, uſage or cuſtom to the

                     </q>
Virginia laws 121,323. Theſe are the very words of the act of aſſembly at this day in force, and conſequently there ſeems no pretence for the complaint which has been made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative to debts contracted in ſterling money. As to debts contracted in Virginia, in current money of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia, there never was a law which fixed the value of current money of Virginia in ſterling money of Great-Britain at any certain rate, nor was a debt in the current money of the ſtate ever expected to be diſcharged in ſterling money: The lex loci was in theory and practice the rule, and when the current money debt was paid in ſpecie at the current value, the debtor was diſcharged in equity as well as law. The value of a Spaniſh milled dollar varied from five ſhillings and ninepence currency to ſix ſhillings cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency, and was eſtimated of the latter value about the time the revolution commenced. Since the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution the value of a dollar is fixed by law to be ſix ſhillings, and other ſilver coins in proportion, and the dollar is the adopted item in account. Was it contemplated by the two nations when they made the treaties, that this was a ſubject on which a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence would ariſe? Rather was not the phraſe
<q>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue in ſterling money</q>
in the treaty of peace intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to preclude paper money in all varieties of form: Ought it not to be reſtrained to paper money, and not extended to ſpecie? eſpecially when the actual rate of ſpecie in the dealings of individuals was the ſame on the 19th April 1775, or 4th July 1776, as at this day in Virginia.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are all the acts which the preſent claimants have ſpecifically alledged to create impediments to
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:034906_0059_0FFF93B3B3C2EE48"/>

<q>An act to repeal ſo much of a former act as ſuſpends the iſſuing of executions upon certain judgment until December 1783.</q>
By the ſecond ſection it is enacted
<q>that no debt or debt or demand whatſoever, originally due to a ſubject of Great-Britain ſhall be recoverable in any court in this Commonwealth, although the ſame may be transferred to a citizen of this ſtate, or to any other perſon capable of maintaining ſuch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, unleſs the aſſignment hath been or may be made for a valuable conſideration, bona ſide paid before the firſt day of May, in the year one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſeven hundred and ſeventy ſeven, the proof of which conſideration and the time thereof, ſhall be on the plaintiff.</q>

The ſtate of war created this diſability in Britiſh ſubjects, who being enemies could not maintain actions in our courts. But ſuits might have been proſecuted, upon debts of this kind aſſigned to citizens. This during the trouble and diſtreſſes of the war would have been oppreſſive and intolerable, and it called for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventive aid of the legiſlature: Therefore this act was made, which may be reaſonably reſtrained to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of Britiſh debts aſſigned to citizens; and if this be the moſt proper conſtruction it follows that no impediment has ariſen to Britiſh creditors from this law.</p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſing it muſt be underſtood more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, yet it will be found not to have been in force longer than July 1784, if ſo long.

                  <p>It cannot be controverted that one ſtatute may be
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:034906_0063_0FFF93BDC19BCDE0"/>
repealed by another,<note place="margin">No legal impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment in Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia ſince the peace.</note> without expreſs words of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, if ſuch be the evident ſenſe of the latter: if for example the former be digeſted and merged in the latter, ſo that both may not conſiſtently be in force at the ſame time. This is conceived to be the caſe with reſpect to the acts of May and October 1782. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the latter contains a ſentence of repeal of every part of the former not compatible with the latter. If then the act of May 1782 be digeſted, amended and merged in the act of October 1782, which was temporary, it may be conſidered as being out of force with the act of October 1782. It is admitted as laid down in Hobart, 215, that an affirmative con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance for a limitted time, of a perpetual ſtatute will not abrogate it, after the expiration of the limit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed time, but this rule does not apply to the preſent caſe, where a perpetual ſtatute was digeſted, merged and re-enacted under additional modifications by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother ſtatute which was limited in its duration. This was the ſenſe of the legiſlature as is undeniably manifeſt by an act paſſed in December 1783, reviv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the two acts of May and October 1782, for the ſhort ſpace of four months from the firſt day of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember 1783, when they had expired, and from thence to the end of the next ſeſſion of aſſembly. This period happened early in July 1784, as can be proved if required. The act of December 1783 is too material not to be quoted, and is in the words following,</p>

                  <p>From this view which has been fairly preſented of the acts of Virginia, there ſeem ſtrong grounds for the opinion, that independent of the operation of the treaty of peace, there was no law in force in that ſtate which prohibited Britiſh ſubjects from recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their juſt debts from the date of the peace, and at all events from the  <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>  of July, 1784, when the aforementioned acts of 1782 expired. Since the peace no act was paſſed by that ſtate prohibiting the recovery of Britiſh debts: If any ſuch be ſuppoſed to exiſt, let it be produced.</p>
                  <p>Secondly. The operation of the treaty of peace upon the acts of Virginia, will now claim ſome atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is contended that the treaty abrogated all the legiſlative acts of Virginia, which were contrary to it if any ſuch were to be found. On the 14th of January, 1784, Congreſs ratified it, and proclaimed it the law of the land, and required it to be executed and obeyed accordingly. In this light it was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally conſidered throughout the United States; and it is not believed that any judicial deciſion was ever made to the contrary by the judges of any court in any ſtate; and if by accident ſuch a deciſion was ever made, it may be pronounced to be erroneous, and it would have been corrected if it had been carried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

                  <p>On the 13th of April 1787, the ſenſe of Congreſs was <hi>unanimouſly</hi> expreſſed in their circular letter to the ſtates that under the 9th article of the confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the ſole and <hi>excluſive</hi> right and power of deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining on war and peace, and entering into treaties, was veſted in them, and that a treaty made and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by them, became immediately obligatory on the whole nation, "<hi>and ſuperadded to the laws of the land without the intervention of the ſtate legiſlatures.</hi>" On the ſame day Congreſs reſolved
<q>that the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the ſeveral ſtates cannot, of right, paſs any act or acts for interpreting, explaining or conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a national treaty, or any part or clauſe of it; nor for reſtraining, limiting or in any manner im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peding, retarding or counteracting the operation and execution of the ſame; for that on being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutionally made, ratified and publiſhed, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come in virtue of the confederation, part of the law of the land, and are not only independent of the will and power of ſuch legiſlatures, but alſo binding and obligatory on them.</q>

Vattel B. 4. Section 25.</p>
                  <p>If the commonwealth of Virginia had not been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federated with the other ſtates, and had alone made a treaty; there is no pretence for doubting whether it would not have been received as part of the law of the land in that ſtate, and conſequently have repealed all laws in that ſtate contrary to it. Shall it have leſs force, when it has been made by that ſtate, united with other ſtates, in conformity to the articles of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federation. Surely not. Congreſs made the treaty for all the ſtates; and none but Congreſs could have made it. If it be a part of the laws of the land, it has repealed all legiſlative acts incompatible with it upon the principle that leges poſteriores priores abrogant. Though in the preſent conſtitution of the United
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:034906_0068_0FFF93CA17B7CED0"/>
States the power of a treaty over the laws of the ſtates,<note place="margin">No legal impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment in Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia ſince the peace.</note> is expreſsly declared to be ſupreme, yet this expreſſion was introduced for the ſake of explicitneſs to prevent all miſapprehenſions on the ſubject. It furniſhes no ſubſtantial argument againſt the power of a treaty over prior ſtate laws under the old con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federation, on which there ſeems to have been a concurrence of ſentiment in every part of the United States. In confirmation of this doctrine, the unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous judgment the circuit court of the United States in the diſtrict of North-Carolina held in June 1796, in the caſe of Hamiltons againſt Eaton, may be cited as of the higheſt authority. Chief juſtice Ellſworth in delivering his ſentiments obſerved with his uſual ſtrength and perſpicuity of expreſſion,
<q>As to the opinion that a treaty does not annul a ſtatute, ſo far as there is an interference, it is unſound. A ſtatute is a declaration of the public will, and of high authority; but it is controulable by the public will ſubſequently declared. Thence the maxim, that where two ſtatutes are oppoſed to each other, the latter abrogates the former. Nor is it material as to the effect of the public will, what organ it is declared by, provided it be an organ conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally authoriſed to make the declaration. A trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty when it is in fact made, is with regard to each nation that is a party to it, a national act, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the national will, as much ſo as a ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute can be. And it does, therefore, of neceſſity, annul any prior ſtatute ſo far as there is an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. The ſuppoſition that the public can have two wills at the ſame time, repugnant to each other, one expreſſed by ſtatute and another by a treaty, is abſurd.</q>

                  <p>Theſe are the reaſons by which the agent for the United States maintains the propoſition, that in Virginia there was no legal impediment to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of Britiſh debts, ſubſequent to the peace of 1783, or at all events, ſubſequent to July 1784. If this ſhall have been ſatisfactorily proved to the board, it will be difficult to produce any caſe grounded on a debt contracted in Virginia, where according to the treaties, the creditors will be entitled to reparation from the treaſury of the United States. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a moſt important point to be determined by the board. It is not denied that the Britiſh creditors generally entertained the opinion that ſuits were not maintainable in the courts of Virginia, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the fact was, that very few ſuits were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced by them 'till the operation of the preſent conſtitution of the United States. This was a wilful omiſſion on their part, and eſpecially on the part of thoſe who were adviſed, by reſpectable counſel, that the courts were open to the recovery of their debts.</p>

In each county are a convenient number of juſtices of the peace; who poſſeſs juriſdiction ſingly to hear and determine all claims for debt under five dollars and award execution againſt the debtors goods and chattels. In each county a court which is a court of record, conſiſting of any four or more of the juſtices, is to be held every month, who have final ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction to hear and determine in a ſummary way on all demands of debts under twenty dollars, and to hear and determine all actions founded on contract, where the ſum in controverſy amounts to twenty dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars or more, and all actions founded on tort, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the principles of common law or chancery, as the caſe may require; and their juriſdiction is final in common law caſes founded on contract where the judgment is for leſs than one hundred dollars, if for more, it may be carried into the Diſtrict court for correction, by writ of error or appeal, upon giving approved ſecurity for ſatisfying the judgment and da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages for the delay, if affirmed, and in Chancery caſes an appeal lies to the high court of Chancery, on giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing approved ſecurity for performing the decree if affirmed. The rules of proceeding are declared by law, ſo that they are not only eaſily underſtood but productive of an uniform practice. Theſe rules are generally derived from the moſt improved practice of the courts of King's Bench, and of Chancery in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, with ſuch alterations and additions as by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience have been found to render them more cheap,

one hundred pounds,<note place="margin">William Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningham and company, liſt A.</note> let it be obſerved that there will be required the ſame proofs and conſequently the ſame trouble to inveſtigate a claim for the ſmaller as for the larger ſum. Did Lord Grenville and Mr. Jay intend this? Did the nations intend it? Or was the treaſury of the United States to be reſorted to for all the little balances due in America to Britiſh ſubjects to ſave them the inconvenience of requeſting payment from the debtors? In all ſuch caſes payment it is preſumable would be made on requeſt where the demand is juſt.</p>
                     <p>As to the other remaining twelve caſes in liſt A. how is the aſſertion proved that they are not recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the courts of Virginia. Each of theſe is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to be good, that is to ſay, due from a ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent perſon. With reſpect to theſe, the attention of the board is requeſted to all thoſe obſervations which have been made in a general point of view, relative to the interpretation of the treaties, relative to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which ought to be proved by the claimants, and relative to the judiciary of Virginia. It may here be added as a general rule, that the creditors ought to go before the ordinary tribunals with their claims, and ought to uſe reaſonable endeavours to obtain payment from the debtors capable of paying, before the United States ſhall be charged. Theſe endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours ſhould be made to appear before the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners, and ought not to be preſumed. Equity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires this not only for the reaſons that have been given, but becauſe in ſuits againſt the debtors, ſome inſtances will probably occur where the debts appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:034906_0076_0FFF93DDCA4B1608"/>
to be due,<note place="margin">William Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningham and company, liſt A.</note> according to the books of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, can and will be proved by the debtors to have been in whole or in part paid. Such inſtances the agent of the United States is authorized to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, have occurred in Virginia. It is alſo thought reaſonable that the creditor ſhould go through the ſame labor and preparation to obtain payment from the debtor, who is not certainly inſolvent, as if no treaty had been made. To eaſe him of this was not the intent of the treaty. Again, ſome claims were barred by the acts of limitation before the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the war, and ſuch cannot be reaſonably brought within the operation of the treaty, or it will have an operation retro-active to the firſt ſettlements in America. As to intereſt on theſe caſes, where the creditors and debtors reſided in Virginia at the time the debts were contracted, in retail dealing, it may well be doubted whether intereſt is juſtly recoverable. For goods ſold, it was not uſual in Virginia to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low intereſt in judicial deciſions before the war, and therefore they were ſold at a higher price. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitance of price compenſated for the denial of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. At common law, book debts do not of courſe carry intereſt, and if it be payable at all, it muſt be in conſequence of cuſtom or of ſome ſpecial agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or,
<q>in caſes of long delay under vexatious and oppreſſive circumſtances,</q>
of which a jury in their diſcretion may judge. Theſe are the words of Lord Mansfield in the caſe of Eddowes vs. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris's executors. Douglaſs 361. Admitting this rule to be proper as here laid down, and that the uſage in Virginia was to diſallow intereſt on book-debts, and that no ſpecial agreement exiſted in any
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:034906_0077_0FFF93E1287E8038"/>
of theſe caſes in liſt A. it follows that unleſs there has been long delay under vexatious and oppreſſive cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,<note place="margin">William Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningham and company, liſt A.</note> there is not ground to demand intereſt on theſe accounts. As to long delay, the creditor, for aught appears, has not even aſked payment; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly he has not ſued, but has neglected from the time of the peace, or at any rate from July 1784, to ſue as it has been ſhewn he might have done. As to vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atious and oppreſſive circumſtances, they, it is hoped, will not be the ſubject of diſcuſſion, becauſe ſuch a diſcuſſion will draw forth an enquiry into the conduct of the two nations relative to the non-execution of the treaty of peace, which has been wiſely conſigned to oblivion by the treaty of 1794; and therefore it would very improperly be ſtirred, even if any ſuch cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances exiſted before the national arbitrators: But if it is, the agent for the United States reſerves to himſelf the privilege of a copious and thorough diſquiſition. With reſpect to intereſt during the war, on debts of this kind, an additional argument to what has been urged on this head, ought not to be omitted. The creditors and their factors left Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia and carried away their books and vouchers, and were inacceſſable to the debtors 'till the return of peace. The place of payment was in Virginia, and the debtors were not bound to pay while there was no perſon there to receive payment; and this alone ought to diſcharge the claim of intereſt during the war, in caſes of this kind. So it has been judicially determined in the court of appeals of Virginia, in the caſe of M'Call, vs. Turner. No. 1. A manuſcript re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of which caſe, taken by one of the able and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious counſel of that court, is annexed for the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction

of the commiſſioners.<note place="margin">William Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningham and company, liſt A.</note> If it be alledged that this abſence was occaſioned by the law of Virginia, and therefore the creditor ought not to ſuffer by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this conduct; It is anſwered that on the firſt day of January, 1776, the Parliament of Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain had prohibited all intercourſe between the two countries, and it was not 'till the third day of Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary 1777, after allowing all perſons to chooſe their ſides in the war, that any perſons were ordered out of the Commonwealth. Before this time, many had voluntarily gone, and only ſuch of thoſe who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained were ordered away, who had given proofs of their diſaffection to the cauſe of America. It was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their own act, their preference to the cauſe of Great Britain that occaſioned their diſmiſſion. Under ſuch circumſtances it was moderation, laudable mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, on the part of Virginia, to permit or direct them to be abſent. They who were friendly to the American ſide, and preferred to ſtay, were permitted to do ſo: Therefore, every individual may be ſaid to have been left freely to follow his own choice. A copy of the proclamation on this ſubject is alſo here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to annexed. No. 2.</p>
                     <p>Some general obſervations relative to thoſe caſes of book-debts which are not ſanctioned by judicial determinations, if any ſuch can be cognizable by the commiſſioners, will conclude what was intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be ſaid relative to liſt A. It is deemed reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that the books containing the original entries ſhould be exhibited to an authorized agent for the United States, with leave to take copies of any

ſuch inſtance.<note place="margin">William Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningham and company, liſt B.</note> Thomas Gordon the agent for the claimants, has ſubjoined a remark which applies to each liſt, that each is characterized agreeable to a liſt in 1775. A doubt ariſes on the meaning of this phraſe. If underſtood to mean among other things the ſolvency or inſolvency of the debtors in 1775 it is hoped that thoſe that are ſtated then to have been doubtful ſhall be excluded, unleſs ſolvency ſhall be actually and ſatisfactorily proven ſubſequent to the peace, as well as all the other requiſites that have formerly in the general argument been urged to be indiſpenſable to entitle a claim to redreſs under the treaty of 1794. Thoſe which are then repreſented to be good, it is inſiſted ought to be proved to have continued good on the third day of September 1783 when the treaty of peace was concluded. And on this occaſion it is repeated that wherever the inſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency happened before the date of the treaty of peace, no circumſtances can bring any loſs ariſing from thence within the meaning of the 6th article of the treaty of 1794. It would be tedious to reiterate the arguments which already have been adduced and which are almoſt all applicable to the debts deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in this liſt; and becauſe they are not again diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly preſſed they are not to be ſuppoſed in any manner waived. One obſervation relative to intereſt during the war muſt however be here mentioned. By the municipal law of Virginia of an ancient ſtanding, it is enacted
<q>That in all actions which ſhall be brought upon any bond or bonds for the payment of money wherein the plaintiff ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, judgment ſhall be entered for the penalty of ſuch bond to be diſcharged by payment of the
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:034906_0081_0FFF93EA1C1AB3C0"/>
                           <hi>principle and intereſt due thereon</hi> and the coſts of ſuit.</q>
Virginia laws page 181.<note place="margin">William Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningham and company, liſt B.</note> By the terms of this act as adjudged and practiced in Virginia, it is the duty of the jury to aſcertain <hi>the intereſt due on a bond,</hi> who are to conſider all circumſtances that in equity ought to cauſe any abatement or deduction. A contrary opinion was however once expreſſed in the caſe of Jones' executors vs. Hylton by the chief juſtice of the United States on the meaning of this act, who thought where the debt was evidenced by a bond, that the jury had no power over the intereſt but it accrued of courſe. This opinion, though proceeding from a moſt reſpected judge, was never approved by the bar or bench of the ſtate of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia, and a different interpretation has prevailed there. This matter is explained in order that the opinion of the chief juſtice may not improperly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence the queſtion, whether in equity intereſt dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the war is payable. It was not on principles of equity but on the ſtatute of Virginia ſtrictly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that the opinion was expreſſed which with great deference to the able and learned Judge, has been generally deemed erroneous. The caſe of M' Call vs. Turner is in point and expreſſes the unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous judgment of the court of appeals in that ſtate.</p>

                     <p>Reſpecting both it is contended that the Claimants ſhould ſet forth, and prove too, all the facts and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances belonging to each debtor which are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial for doing juſtice in the particular caſe between the Claimant and the United States.

                     <p>As to the 1ſt Claſs, though the debtor is deceaſed and his property has been divided, it does not follow that the United States are to be awarded to pay the debt. By the laws of Virginia the perſonal proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the deceaſed is liable in the hands of his repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives to pay all his debts, and the lands and real property of the deceaſed are liable in the hands of his heirs or deviſees to pay his ſpecialty or judgment debts: Therefore, though divided, the eſtate may and ought to be purſued by the Creditor.

Nor,<note place="margin">William Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningham and company, liſt D.</note> though the eſtate has been ſquandered either by the deceaſed in his life time or by his repreſentative, does it follow that the United States are to be awarded to pay the debt. If the Creditor has neglected for a long time to proſecute the debtor or his repreſentative, when he might have proſecuted them, and in this interval the eſtate has been waſted, the loſs ought to remain with the Creditor for his wilful laches.</p>
                     <p>Reſpecting the 2d claſs. It has been denied that any legal impediment to the recovery of the Britiſh debts exiſted in Virginia ſince the peace. The trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of peace repealed all acts anterior to it, which created any ſuch impediments, and no laws of that kind were paſſed poſterior to it, unleſs the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the acts of May and October 1782, 'till July 1784, be ſaid to be one.</p>
                     <p>This point the agent for the United States hopes, with confidence, has been fully and ſatisfactorily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the board, and to his former arguments he prays leave to refer. Then the ſhort ſpace of a few months, viz.—From the third of September 1783 to the ſixth of July 1784 was the utmoſt ſpace that any impediment exiſted in Virginia, and during this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod very few debtors, if any, removed out of that ſtate into parts unknown. The damage ariſing from this ſource if any, muſt conſequently be very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, and it is therefore reaſonable that every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual caſe of this kind ſhould be explained and made out by ſufficient proofs.

The latter ſhall be left in the point of view in which it has been placed. Relative to the former, in addition to the arguments already uſed upon this head, let it be remembered that the trial of the cauſes in the courts of juſtice, was <hi>in the ſame form and under the ſame laws</hi> which were in force before the war. The contracts were made ſubject to the diſcretion of juries and courts, as to the allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance or diſallowance of intereſt in all caſes in Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, however evidenced, whether by bond, bill, note or book account. No new law was introduced on this ſubject, and therefore this conduct of juries or courts cannot be truly repreſented as a legal impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the contemplation of the treaty of 1783. The legal impediments meant to be removed by it were ſuch as had originated ſubſequent ta the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement

This is all that juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice could or can require. Can it be right to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrue the treaty as repealing any laws that were in force at the time the debts were contracted? Or can it be underſtood to require the inſtitution of new laws or a new mode for deciding upon and recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing debts contracted before the war? If, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the deduction of intereſt has been regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly and juſtly made by the competent tribunal according to ancient laws, no ground is perceived for makings this the baſis any claim againſt the United States. The deduction of intereſt ſo made if to be called a loſs is manifeſtly a loſs occaſioned not by any legal impediments created ſince the 4th July 1776, but occaſioned by other cauſes that would equally have operated to produce it, if there had been no legal impediments ſince the peace in Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia. If this be admitted to be correct it follows that it is expreſsly excluded from the proviſion of the 6th article of the treaty of 1794, and that no award can be made againſt the United States for compenſation of intereſt that is deducted by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent tribunal in the ordinary courſe of proceeding, according to ancient uſage and laws. The claim therefore grounded on the caſes in liſt E ought to be diſallowed on this principle, if no other objection had been brought againſt them.</p>

                     <head>M'CALL vs. TURNER.</head>
                     <p>THIS was an appeal from a judgment of the diſtrict court of King and Queen, upon the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing caſe. On the 18th day of January 1774. Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben Wright, Reuben Turner, Benjamin C. Spiller and William Aylett, entered into a bond of the uſual form, to Robert M'Kendliſh, in the penalty of fifty five pounds with condition to be void on payment of twenty ſeven pounds ten ſhillings on or before the firſt day of October thence next following,
<q>with intereſt from the date;</q>
which bond M'Kindliſh aſſigned to the plaintiff by an indorſement in theſe words, "Pay the within to Archibald M'Call" and ſigned his name to the ſaid indorſement. In July 1793, M'Call brought ſuit upon this bond in the diſtrict court of King and Queen, againſt Reuben Wright, Reuben Turner and Benjamin C. Spiller, the ſurviving oblig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rs; for William Aylett was then dead. The writ was executed by the ſheriff of King William, on Reuben Turner only, and Spiller and Wright were returned "no inhabitants." The plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff filed a declaration on the above bond in the common form of declarations upon aſſigned bonds; after which follows an entry in theſe words,
<q>Abated as to the defendants Reuben Wright and Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min C. Spiller, by the return, and a conditional order againſt the defendant Reuben Turner and James Turner bail for appearance.</q>
The condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional order was confirmed at the next rules; and at
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:034906_0090_0FFF94002914DC68"/>
the ſucceeding court Reuben Turner gave ſpecial bail, pleaded payment, and the plaintiff took iſſue. In April 1795, the cauſe ſtood for trial; and the jury being charged upon the iſſue, the plaintiff filed a bill of exceptions to the courts opinion, which ſtated that
<q>the defendant by his counſel moved the court to be permitted to give in evidence to the jury that the plaintiff was abſent in foreign ports beyond ſeas, and not within the ſtate of Virginia for the ſpace of eight years, to wit, from the 19th day of April 1775, to the 19th day of April 1783, and that during that period, he had not any known agent or attorney within the commonwealth, who would receive payment of the debt and give a legal diſcharge for the ſame, on which the ſuit is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with a view of extinguiſhing the intereſt dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that period, to which the counſel for the plaintiff objected, but the court permitted the defendant to offer ſuch evidence if he ſhould think fit ſo to do. And the defendant being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to give evidence to the jury, to the purpoſe aforeſaid, it was proved that the plaintiff was out of Virginia in ports beyond ſea, from ſome time in the year 1775, to ſome time in the year 1783, which was permitted to go to the jury.</q>
The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff, that the defendant had not paid the debt in the declaration mentioned, but that the ſame ought however to be diſcharged by the payment of twenty ſeven pounds ten ſhillings with intereſt thereon from the date of the bond until the 19th day of April 1775, and from the 19th day of April 1783, until paid, and aſſigned damages to a penny; and the court gave judgment for the plaintiff,
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:034906_0091_0FFF94029B8F8AC0"/>
for the penalty of the bond to be diſcharged accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the terms of the verdict with coſts of ſuit From which judgment the plaintiff appealed to this court.</p>
                     <p>WARDEN for the appellant. It is unneceſſary to ſay much upon this ſubject; for the record ſhews mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt error in the opinion of the court in permitting improper evidence to be given to the jury. The plea was payment, and nothing but what went to prove that ſhould have been received; for nothing elſe was within the iſſue. The notice was not that the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant would prove a payment, but that the plaintiff was abſent during a certain period; within which it does not appear that there was no agent here to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the money, had ſuch a fact ever been material which it was not. All that the jury upon this iſſue could do, was to find whether the defendant had paid the debt or not; and in ſuch a caſe if travelling out of the iſſue they of their own accord ſhould diminiſh the debt, it would be the duty of the court to grant a new trial. The law is that judgment ſhall be entered for the penalty, to be diſcharged by the payment of the principal debt with intereſt and coſts; and ſo it is conſtantly done in caſes of judgments by default; which proves the law to be as I have ſtated it. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the bill of exceptions does not ſtate that this was all the evidence, yet it is fair to infer that there was no other, as none appears; and therefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that the evidence offered by the defendant was inadmiſſible: and conſequently that the judgment is erroneous and ought to be reverſed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="vi" facs="unknown:034906_0092_0FFF94051E5555C8"/>WICKHAM for the appellee. This was a ſuit upon a joint bond, which could neither be ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> or proſecuted ſeverally. The plaintiff therefore ſhould have purſued all the obligors, and ſhould not have abated the ſuit as to the non-reſident defendants; for he thereby diſcontinued as to him who was arreſted. It may be ſaid that this ſhould have been pleaded in abatement; but that was not neceſſary, as it appears upon the record: and Turner could not have pleaded it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the declaration was joint. The act of Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly had provided the means of bringing all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties before the court, and therefore it ought to have been done. At leaſt the plaintiff ſhould have follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up his proceſs.</p>
                     <p>Then as to the point concerning the evidence:— My own impreſſion from the act of Aſſembly origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally was, that the jury were merely to find if any and what payments had been made, and that the court was to aſcertain the reſt; but on my firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the bar, I found the practice ſettled the other way, and that the jury were to find the ſum by which the penalty was to be diſcharged: which I preſume was done upon a proper conſideration of the law. I had occaſion once to ſubmit this queſtion to the federal court, and contended that the jury ſhould find the payments ſpecially; but the court enquired into the practice of Mr. Brown the clerk of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral court, and being informed that the practice was to find generally they ſubmitted the cauſe to the jury. Therefore I conclude that the practice is ſettled, that the jury may enquire into the amount; and of courſe muſt be regulated by evidence and the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:034906_0093_0FFF9408838E0CA8"/>
Perhaps the circumſtances do not all appear in this caſe; but if under any circumſtances there might be a deduction of intereſt, the court will ſuppoſe thoſe circumſtances were proved upon the trial, as every thing tranſacted in a court of juſtice is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to be rightly done until the contrary is ſhewn. The queſtion therefore is, whether under any cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances a deduction of intereſt can be made by the jury?</p>
                     <p>The act of Aſſembly does not ſtate from what pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod intereſt ſhall commence; and I ſuppoſe the act was founded on the practice of the court of chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery of relieving againſt the penalty on payment of principal, intereſt and coſts. Now in a court of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity circumſtances would clearly be taken into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, and a deduction made or not according as they ſhould appear. In the preſent caſe all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances do not appear, but there are ſeveral men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned which afford an equity. The plaintiff was abſent during all the interval mentioned in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, and had no known agent to whom payment could be made, which of itſelf affords a ſtrong rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon for ſuſpending the intereſt; but if during that period he went into the hoſtile country and became an alien enemy, ſo that the defendant was prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited from having any intercourſe with or paying him the money, in that caſe the deduction would be more reaſonable ſtill. For it would be againſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience that the creditor ſhould demand intereſt when his own abſence was the cauſe why the debt was not paid. I dont ſay this was the caſe, or what kind of proof was actually made, but as nothing contrary to
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:034906_0094_0FFF940A0783EB70"/>
what I ſtated appears, the court will intend that thoſe circumſtances or ſome ſuch were proved; for the reaſon before given, that whatever is tranſacted in a court of juſtice is preſumed to be rightly done until the contrary is ſhewn.</p>
                     <p>WARDEN. As to the queſtion concerning the abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there is no difficulty in it. The ſheriff is bound to return the truth of the caſe, for otherwiſe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs might be infinite. In the county courts it has been conſtantly done both before and ſince the revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. When this ſuit was commenced the diſtrict courts did not poſſeſs the right of iſſuing meſne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs out of the limits of the diſtrict. There is a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt difference in this reſpect between the act of 1788, under which this ſuit was brought, and the act of 1792, ſpoken of by Mr. Wickham. The le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature by allowing copies of bonds to be uſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the originals in ſuits brought in other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricts plainly intended to provide againſt the defect of limited juriſdiction. The plaintiff proceeding un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the act of 1788, was obliged to ſubmit to the abatement; for he could not follow up the proceſs as to the non-reſident defendants.</p>
                     <p>Then as to the point of evidence;—Any thing elſe might as well have been proved on the plea of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as the abſence of the party. If the defendant had pleaded the fact ſpecially it would have been demurrable to; which proves that ſuch evidence before the jury cannot be admitted: for whatever goes to the deſtruction of the plaintiff's right may be pleaded. Even a tender in this caſe would not have
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:034906_0095_0FFF940B89BD1678"/>
availed; becauſe the day of payment had arrived, before the plaintiffs departure from the ſtate. A caſe in the federal court was mentioned which I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect; but I remember that, in the caſe of Jones's executors vs. Hylton, chief juſtice J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y was of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that the jury could not deduct impreſs; for he ſaid it was the act of the court to aſcertain the amount ſtill due after the payments were deducted, which was all that the jury could enquire into. It has been ſaid by ſome that no particular intereſt was fixed by law; becauſe the act of aſſembly does not ſay that any intereſt ſhould be received in ſo many words, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t only that not more than five per cent ſhall be taken. Though the law has ſaid that the obligee ſhall not take more than five per cent, it certainly implies that he may take that; and the uniform practice of the country has been to give judgment for it, which proves the univerſal opinion of the law. By the treaty of peace we agreed to the payment; and there is no exception in it of courſe where the party was abſent. It is therefore a reflection on the ſtate, and renders us rediculous in the eyes of foreigners, that our juries have ſo long perſiſted in refuſing to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the ſtipulation and to find the full amount due to thoſe creditors.</p>
                     <p>The judges now delivered their opinions ſeparately to the following effect.</p>
                     <p>Fleming judge. There were two points made in this cauſe; one by the appellants counſel on the propriety of admitting the evidence in order to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh the intereſt during the abſence of the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:034906_0096_0FFF9434D3D78B48"/>
from this country: and the other by the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants counſel on the ground that the plaintiff by fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to continue the proceſs againſt the non-reſident defendants had diſcontinued his ſuit altogether.</p>
                     <p>On the firſt queſtion it was ſaid by the counſel for the appellants that ſuch evidence could not be given upon the trial of an iſſue on the plea of payment; and that poſition is correct if the caſe be conſidered upon the doctrines of the common law only. But the act of aſſembly has altered the common law; and by allowing the penalty "to be diſcharged by payment of the principal and the intereſt due there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on," with the coſts of ſuit, has neceſſarily turned the quantum into a queſtion to be determined by circumſtances: and I think it was the province of the jury to decide that queſtion. The plaintiff by abſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf from the country put it out of the power of the debtor to make payment; and therefore it is unreaſonable that he ſhould demand intereſt during that period. This was a circumſtance proper to be left to the jury, upon a plea of this kind in an action of debt upon a bond. It is like collateral evidence to mitigate damages in actions of aſſault and battery.</p>
                     <p>As to the other point, the act of aſſembly does not give ſuch extenſive juriſdiction as the counſil for the appellees contended for; and the clauſe relative to the copy of the bond proves it. Which would have been unneceſſary if the court had poſſeſſed general juriſdiction ſo as to force the appearance of non-reſident defendants from other diſtricts. However according to any conſtruction, I think it ought
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:034906_0097_0FFF5FABEFAFEA90"/>
to have been pleaded; and therefore I am of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that the judgment of the court was right upon both points, and ought to be affirmed.</p>
                     <p>Carrington judge. Every queſtion in this caſe might have been ſaved except that upon the bill of excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. If Mr. Wickhams argument was correct a judgment might never be obtained, where there are ſeveral defendants; becauſe it would ſeldom happen that they all could be found in one diſtrict: and the act of aſſembly does not admit of the enlarged ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction which he contends it does. For although the words of the proviſo page 83, are calculated to give that impreſſion at the firſt view, yet a cloſer at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention will lead to another conſtruction; becauſe the next member of the ſentence which allows a copy to be given in evidence would according to the other interpretation have been wholly unneceſſary. But let the expoſition be what it may, the matter ſhould have been pleaded in abatement; without which if it even be admitted that the argument of the appellees counſel is correct, no advantage can be taken of it. Upon that ground therefore I think there is no error.</p>
                     <p>The whole queſtion then reſts upon the other point; and I am of opinion that the jury had the right of deciding what was the amount of the intereſt due· The act of aſſembly ſeems to me eſſentially to inveſt them with this power; for the expreſs language is that the penalty ſhall be diſcharged
<q>by payment of the principal and the intereſt due thereon,</q>
with the coſts of ſuit. Who then are to ſay what intereſt
<pb n="xii" facs="unknown:034906_0098_0FFF5FB798C4F528"/>
is due thereon? The jury ſurely; who muſt decide upon the circumſtances of the caſe, and ſay when it ſhall commence, how long it ſhould continue, and when it ſhould be ſuſpended or extinguiſhed. On all general iſſues (and this is one) the whole circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the caſe ſhould be ſubmitted to the jury, who are to decide accordingly.</p>
                     <p>As to the juſtice of the caſe I do not think its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Britiſh debt or not makes any difference. The ſame rule would apply in a caſe between two citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens. Now ſuppoſe a caſe between two citizens, in which one is creditor and the other debtor; and that the creditor removes himſelf into parts of the world unknown to his debtor: who thereby cannot come at him in order to make payment, would it be juſt in ſuch a caſe that full intereſt ſhould be given; and ought not the jury to enquire into the circumſtances and reduce the intereſt accordingly?—Again ſuppoſe there be a bargain and ſale of property, and that the ſeller keeps the property a long time; would it be right that he ſhould recover intereſt upon the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe money during the time of his unjuſt detention of the property?—Surely not; no jury would do otherwiſe than deduct it: and I think the act of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly would warrant them in doing ſo. In this caſe the plaintiff abſented himſelf, and went into a country with which we had no intercourſe, and did not return until ſome time in the year 1783; ſo that his debtor could not make payment to him or by remittance. If under theſe circumſtances he were to have full intereſt he would be better off than our own citizens who ſtayed at home and braved the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
<pb n="xiii" facs="unknown:034906_0099_0FFF940EF319F090"/>
of the war. Upon the whole, the trial appears to have been fair; the plaintiff had notice of the evidence: the verdict I think was juſt, and did not in my opinion endanger the honor of the country. I am therefore for affirming the judgment.</p>
                     <p>Pendleton Preſident. It was objected by the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel for the appellee that the plaintiff had ſuffered the ſuit to be abated as to the non-reſident parties, whom it was ſaid he ought to have purſued by continuing the proceſs; and that having ſailed to do ſo he had diſcontinued his ſuit. I thought at firſt, from a ſlight reading of the act of aſſembly, that a teſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>m capias might in the caſe of a joint bond be iſſued into any county; but on a more attentive peruſal of the law I find I was miſtaken, and that the firſt part of the proviſo is corrected by the latter, which allows the party to make uſe of a copy, in thoſe caſes where all the defendants are not arreſted in the ſame diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trict. The proviſo though was for the benefit of the plaintiff who might waive it if he would. It was ſaid by the counſel for the appellee that the defendant could not have pleaded it in abatement, becauſe the declaration was joint; but the fact appeared upon the record, and therefore might have been inſiſted on by way of plea if the objection had been main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable. The defendant however might upon his part alſo waive the objection if he would; and by going on to trial without taking any notice of it, he certainly has done ſo.</p>
                     <p>Then as to the queſtion with regard to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
<pb n="xiv" facs="unknown:034906_0100_0FFF941253D312C0"/>
of the evidence. The juſtice of the defence was impeached; and it was aſked whether it was right that a Britiſh ſubject ſhould loſe intereſt on his debt during the continuance of the war between that country and this? The affirmative it was ſaid would be diſhonorable to the ſtate; and that it was diſgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the people of this country that the juries had perſiſted ſo long in deducting intereſt during that period. I am ſenſible that politics ought not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into judicial determinations, for which reaſon I have uſually avoided them; and I truſt I am an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial judge upon the preſent occaſion, unleſs it ſhall be ſuppoſed that I am under any national preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices, of which however I am not conſcious. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe impreſſions I will endeavor to redeem my country from the grievous imputation which has been laid upon it; and I cannot ſay that I think the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict wrong upon the juſtice of the caſe. I am an enemy to war and all its conſequences; but if we compare the conduct of the two nations the compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſon is evidently in favor of America. Our ſequeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration laws ſecured the proceeds of the property in the public treaſury, and waited for the conduct of the mother country; but did Great Britain meet us on the ſame liberal ground? I wiſh the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances forgotten; and it is with an ill grace that thoſe perſons ſhould recall the painful remembrance of them, which were ſo many deflections from the modern rules of warfare; and did not in my opinion, entitle the creditors even to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal debts themſelves, had they not been ſtipulated for by the treaty of peace. With which however,
<pb n="xv" facs="unknown:034906_0101_0FFF9414C3B55740"/>
I dont find fault; for although it was unjuſt and inconvenient in one reſpect, yet as the other parts were eſteemed beneficial it was right to accept it, for the ſake of the general advantages it contained: and having been entered into it ſhould be performed, provided Great Britain had fulfilled her part of it. But this however is now out of the queſtion; it is ſettled that the debts are to be paid: and the only point which remains to be conſidered, is, whether the creditors are entitled to intereſt during the war? We were attacked by a great and powerful nation, who entering our country with force, obliged us to call forth every reſource, and to exert every means of defence; ſo that the debtor, inſtead of providing for the payment of his debt, was conſtantly engaged in the protection of his family: and might there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore well be excuſed for not paying his debt during a period in which he was prevented from attending to his private affairs, by the calamities of a war which his creditor was aſſiſting to excite. According to the modern practice of nations, all that the credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors could have expected, was to be put in the ſame ſituatiom with reſpect to the recovery of their debts, as our own citizens were; but the latter beſides the depredations of war, ſuſtained immenſe loſſes from various cauſes which that had introduced, and are daily ſubject to the loſs not only of intereſt but of principal too, and no good reaſon could be aſſigned why the other ſide ſhould have been put upon a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter footing. If a citizen creditor had removed himſelf to other parts of the world in the ſame manner, and left his debtor to fight the battles of his
<pb n="xvi" facs="unknown:034906_0102_0FFF94164780B338"/>
country, it would have been a ſufficient cauſe for taking off the intereſt during that period; and the reaſon certainly holds with as much force when ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to thoſe who were on the ſide of the people with whom we were contending. This is my opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, and whether it be right or wrong muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to a more unerring tribunal hereafter!</p>
                     <p>Then as to the mode of proceeding; the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, whether evidence of theſe facts could be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the jury on the plea of payment? The ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that it could not be done at common law is true; becauſe the whole penalty was forfeited if only a ſhilling was due: and therefore it was to no purpoſe to offer evidence to diminiſh the debt; for that did not excuſe the penalty. This drove the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant into equity to ſuch a diſcharge by payment of the principal, intereſt and coſts; where relief upon thoſe terms was conſtantly obtained. But this was found to be troubleſome and expenſive; and therefore the legiſlature interfered and paſſed the act of aſſembly for that purpoſe: which not only allows payments, but diſcounts too, to be given in evidence at the trial. Now, if inſtead of paying intereſt on the debt, proof can be given to the jury diſcloſing a reaſon why intereſt ſhould not be paid, why ſhould it not be received and the court allow the jury to conſider of it? I can diſcern no good objection to it; nor do I think that any can be offered. I obſerved that the act of aſſembly was founded on the practice of the court of chancery; and in a court of equity evidence of the circumſtances would certainly be
<pb n="xvii" facs="unknown:034906_0103_0FFF9418CCCF82B0"/>
received, and a deduction of intereſt made or not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to them. The trial here was fair; even no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the evidence was given, though that perhaps was not neceſſary, and therefore I ſee no reaſon to diſturb the verdict. The opinion of the chief juſtice of the United States in a caſe before the federal court was cited; in which he is ſtated to have deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered to the jury a charge differing from the opinion I have juſt expreſſed; but I cannot concur with him. He is reported to have ſaid, that intereſt was queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of law; which I do not agree to: for no law has ſaid in expreſs terms when intereſt ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence." The jury in the caſe before the federal court deducted the intereſt; and to them I think it emphatically belonged to decide whether it ſhould be paid or not. I concur therefore, with the other judges who have delivered their opinions, that the judgment in this caſe ought to be affirmed upon both the points which have been made in the cauſe.</p>

                  </div>
                  <div type="proceedings">
                     <p>FOR the ſake of order and method the Claimants will purſue a different courſe of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument in their Reply, from that adopted in the Anſwer to their claim—For if the doctrine, (to them ſo ſtrange) "<hi>that no legal impediments to the recovery of their debts exiſted in Virginia ſince the peace</hi>" be really well founded, every other diſcuſſion will be vain and uſeleſs.</p>
                     <p>This claim <hi>was</hi> intended "<hi>to ſubmit to the deciſion of the Board moſt of the principles relative to the debts within the State of Virginia,</hi> of which payment may be claimed, under the treaty of 1794, from the treaſury of the United States." In order to bring theſe forward with as much expedition, and at as ſmall expence and trouble as poſſible, the claimants at large, were adviſed by their General Agent to ſelect that liſt of balances which contained the feweſt names, and to claſs the ſeveral debtors agreeably to a form preſcribed.—It was not thought abſolutely neceſſary, that the liſt ſo ſelected ſhould contain at leaſt one caſe under every different head of impediment, eſpecially as a claim on account of a treaſury payment had been filed, and in part argued before the Board— The liſt ſelected, does embrace nearly every other caſe upon which a queſtion of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance can ariſe. It was therefore expected, and if the claimants are correct in their recollection, it was agreed, that every point ſhould be argued, in order, that after the long delay which had unfortunately tho' unavoidably taken place, as many principles as poſſible, ſhould be ſettled by a decree in a ſingle claim, which would enable other claimants ſo to prepare their different memorials, that all their tenable demands might be arranged under their proper heads, and the claſs or claſſes which might be determined untenable, abandoned or omitted.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="5" facs="unknown:034906_0110_0FFF9428F26C2460"/>The form in which the Anſwer in this caſe appears, and the direction that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication have equal publicity, muſt be the apology for a repetition in many inſtances of, inſtead of a reference to, the arguments in other caſes—the Anſwer does not appear to demand very much new matter in the Reply.</p>
                     <p>The claimants would not have thought it altogether juſtifiable, for them, in reaſoning upon the plain words of a written inſtrument, to draw inferences from the correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence or converſation of miniſters, in order to extend or narrow down the evident and natural meaning of thoſe words,—a mode of argument however which has been adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in one caſe on one ſide, may be purſued in other caſes on the other ſide—and as the example has been given, it will be followed.—Mr. Jefferſon's letter to Mr. Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond has alſo been cited with much approbation, in the Anſwer on behalf of the United States to this claim; in that letter the opinions of members of the two Britiſh Houſes of Parliament are quoted, to ſhew the idea that nation entertained of the effect of <hi>recommendations of Congreſs.</hi>—In this Reply the opinions of the moſt conſpicuous mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of ſeveral deliberative bodies in the United States will be reſorted to, to ſhow the ideas Americans entertained of <hi>impediments</hi>—Deciſions in Engliſh courts have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied upon in the Anſwer—Deciſions in American courts will be brought forward in the Reply.</p>
                     <p>It is aſſerted, "<hi>that no legal impediments to the recovery of Britiſh debts, contracted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, exiſted after, the peace, in the State of Virginia</hi>; and, if ſome laws of that State bore the complexion of impediments, they were <hi>ipſo facto</hi> repealed by the treaty.</p>
                     <p>In order to form a true judgment upon theſe poſitions, it is neceſſary to examine into the powers of Congreſs previous to the articles of confederation; the authorities veſted in them by that inſtrument, and whether they ever poſſeſſed the means of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing obedience to reſolutions, decrees, ordinances or compacts, paſſed or entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by them, within the undoubted limits of that authority!</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>The powers of Congreſs were revolutionary in their nature, ariſing out of events, adequate to every national emergency, and co-extenſive with the object to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. Congreſs was the general, ſupreme, and controuling council of the nation, the centre of union, the centre of force, and the ſun of the political ſyſtem. To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine what their powers were, we muſt enquire what powers they exerciſed. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs raiſed armies, fitted out a navy, and preſcribed rules for their government: Congreſs conducted all military operations both by land and ſea: Congreſs emitted bills of credit, received, and ſent Ambaſſadors, and made treaties: Congreſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned privateers to cruiſe againſt the enemy, directed what veſſels ſhould be lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to capture, and preſcribed rules for the diſtribution of prizes. Thoſe <hi>high acts of ſovereignty were ſubmitted to, acquieſced in, and approved of, by the people of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica.</hi> In Congreſs were veſted, <hi>becauſe by Congreſs were exerciſed with the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the people,</hi> the rights and powers of war and peace. In every government, whether it conſiſt of many ſtates, or of few, or whether it be of a federal or conſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated nature, there muſt be a ſupreme power or will; the rights of war and peace are component parts of this ſupremacy, and incidental thereto is the queſtion of prize. —The queſtion of prize grows out of the nature of the thing. If it be aſked, in whom, during our revolution war, was lodged, and by whom was exerciſed this ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme authority? No one will heſitate for an anſwer. It was lodged in and exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Congreſs; it was there or no where; the States individually did not, and with ſafety could not, exerciſe it. Diſaſtrous would have been the iſſue of the conteſt, if the ſtates, ſeperately, had exerciſed the powers of war. For in ſuch caſe, there would have been as many ſupreme wills as there were States, and as many wars as there were wills. Happily, however, for America, this was not the caſe; there was but one war, and one ſovereign will to conduct it. <hi>The danger being imminent and common, it became neceſſary for the people or colonies to coaleſce and act in concert, in order to divert or break the violence of the gathering ſtorm; they accordingly grew into union, and
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:034906_0111_0FFF942CA6A8AEC8"/>
founded one great political body, of which Congreſs was the directing principle and ſoul.</hi> As to war and peace, and their neceſſary incidents, Congreſs, by the unanimous voice of the people, exerciſed excluſive juriſdiction, and ſtood, like Jove, amidſt the Deities of old, paramount, and ſupreme. The truth is, that the States individually were not known nor recognized as ſovereign by foreign nations, nor are they now? the States collectively, under Congreſs as the connecting point, or head, were acknowledged by foreign powers as ſovereign, particularly in that acceptation of the term, which is applicable to all great national concerns, and in the exerciſe of which, other ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns would be more immediately intereſted; ſuch, for inſtance, as the rights of war and peace, of making treaties, and ſending and receiving Ambaſſadors. Beſides, every perſon muſt be amenable to the authority, under which he acts. If he accept from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs a commiſſion to cruiſe againſt the enemy, he muſt be reſponſible to them for his conduct. If under colour of ſuch commiſſion, he had violated the law of nations. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs would have been called upon to make atonement and redreſs. The perſons who exerciſe the right or authority of commiſſioning privateers, muſt, of courſe, have the right or authority of examining into the conduct of the officer acting under ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and of confirming or annulling his tranſactions and deeds.</q>
(<hi>Judge Patterſon in the caſe Penhallow and others againſt Doane's Admrs. Sup. Court. U. S. Feb.</hi> 1795.)</p>
                     <p>The following brief ſtate of the caſe in which the above opinion was delivered, is abridged from the Judge's ſtatement:</p>
                     <p>On the 25th Nov. 1775, Congreſs (1 journ. 259) paſſed a ſeries of reſolutions reſpecting captures, and recommended it to the different colonies, to erect courts for the trial of ſuch as ſhould be made, reſerving in all caſes an appeal to Congreſs, or ſuch perſons as they ſhould appoint for the trial of appeals.</p>
                     <p>On the 23d of March, 1776, they reſolved, that the inhabitants of the Colonies be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to fit out armed veſſels to cruiſe on the enemies of the United Colonies, and a few days after, they agreed upon the form of a commiſſion to the commanders of private ſhips of war, which was to run in the name of the Delegates of the United Colonies, and be ſigned by the Preſident of Congreſs.</p>
                     <p>On the 3d July, 1776, New-Hampſhire paſſed an act for the trial of captures, and allowed in certain caſes an appeal to Congreſs, and in others to the Superior Court of the State.</p>
                     <p>On the 30th of Jan. 1777, Congreſs appointed a ſtanding Committee of Appeals.</p>
                     <p>In October, 1777, the brigantine Suſanna was captured by an armed veſſel belonging to Penhallow and others, citizens of New-Hampſhire—ſhe was libelled in the Maritime Court of New-Hampſhire, and a claim filed on behalf of Doane and others, citizens of Maſſachuſetts—On the 16th of December, 1777, ſhe was condemned—An appeal to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs was in due time demanded and refuſed, <hi>becauſe contrary to a law of the State</hi>—An appeal was then pray'd by the claimants to the Superior Court of New-Hampſhire and allowed—and in September, 1778, a judgment of condemnation was alſo rendered in that court—The claimants in due time demanded an appeal to Congreſs, tender'd ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity to proſecute the appeal to effect, and the ſame was lodged in Congreſs within the proper time after the definitive ſentence was pronounced.</p>
                     <p>On the 9th of October, 1778, a petition from Eliſha Doane was read in Congreſs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with the proceedings in New-Hampſhire, and praying an appeal—this was referred to the Committee of Appeals (4 journal, 586.)</p>
                     <p>On the 26th of June, 1779, the Commiſſioners of Appeal gave their opinion that they had juriſdiction of the cauſe.</p>

                     <p>In the month of September, 1783, the Court of Appeals, before whom the parties ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared by their advocates, did after a full hearing and ſolemn argument finally adjudge and decree, that the ſentences of the inferior and ſuperior courts of New-Hampſhire ſhould be reverſed, and the property reſtored.</p>
                     <p>Here the cauſe reſted till the adoption of the exiſting Conſtitution of the United States, except an ineffectual ſtruggle before Congreſs on the part of New-Hampſhire, and an unavailing experiment at common law, to obtain redreſs on the part of the appellants.</p>
                     <p>From the foregoing ſtatement, William Cunningham &amp; Co. think, that they are not going too far in ſaying, that there the cauſe would have reſted forever, had it not been for the preſent judiciary ſyſtem of the United States.—Fortunately however, that ſyſtem was eſtabliſhed, the time arrived when theory could be reduced to practice, when imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility was ſucceeded by energy, when impartial juſtice could not only pronounce her deciſion, but enforce its execution, and in the year 1795, the repreſentative of Doane heard a decree in his favour from the higheſt tribunal in America, prefaced with this honeſt and correct ſentiment—
<q>Judges may die, and Courts be at an end; but Juſtice ſtill lives, and though ſhe may ſleep for a while, will eventually awake, and muſt be ſatisfied.</q>

                     <p>In the caſe of the ſloop Active, in the Admiralty of Pennſylvania, the jury found a verdict which was confirmed by the Judge, and ſentence paſſed thereon—An appeal was lodged and referred by Congreſs to the Committee of Appeals—the Committee reverſed the ſentence, making a new decree, and ordering proceſs out of the Court of Admiralty of Pennſylvania, to carry this their decree into execution.</p>
                     <p>The Judge of the Court of Admiralty refuſed to carry into execution the decree of the Committee on Appeals, and aſſigned as the reaſon of his refuſal, that an <hi>act of the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the State</hi> has declared, that the finding of a jury ſhall eſtabliſh the facts in all trials in the Court of Admiralty without re-examination or appeal, and that an appeal is permitted only from the decree of the Judge.</p>
                     <p>This buſineſs was agitated in Congreſs, and it was "Reſolved, That Congreſs, or ſuch perſons as they appoint, to bear and determine appeals from the Courts of Admiralty, <hi>have neceſſarily the power</hi> to examine, as well into deciſions on facts, as deciſions on the law, and to decree finally thereon, and that no finding of a jury in any Court of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty, or Court for determining the legality of captures on the high ſeas, can or ought to deſtroy the rights of appeal, and the re-examination of the facts reſerved to Congreſs:</p>

                     <p>That a controul by appeal is neceſſary, in order to compel a juſt and uniform exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the law of nations:</p>

                     <p>That this power of controuling by appeal the ſeveral admiralty juriſdictions of the States, has hitherto been exerciſed by Congreſs, by the medium of a Committee of their own Members.</p>

                     <p>The powers above claimed by Congreſs, were moſt abſolutely and eſſentially neceſſary to be veſted ſomewhere in confederated Republics, as well as in ſingle States and Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies. The ſupreme power of the confederation was the only place in which they could be lodged. The ſafety of all the States as well as of each individual State, irreſiſtibly required it; and the deductions drawn by Congreſs from the neceſſary and acknowledged poſſeſſion of the power, flow too palpably to admit of contradiction. All this the Judge of the Admiralty of Pennſylvania knew, as well as Congreſs. But there was a colliſio legum. Congreſs the ſupreme power of the whole had reſerved the right of deciding on appeals in all caſes of capture: The law of Pennſylvania had declared the finding of a jury to be final. That law was not inconſiſtent with the Conſtitution of the State. The Judge of the State court was bound by his oath, to decide according to the law of the State: He was not to declare a new law; he was not to determine whether the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial appeal was politic or impolitic: He could only ſay, this act is my authority; my oath and conſcience are my monitors: And this Congreſs knew as well as the Judge. What then did Congreſs do? Had they the means of enforcing the decree of their committee? Could they compel the inferior to bend to the ſuperior court? They did all in their power.—</p>

                     <p>"That the General Aſſembly of the State of Pennſylvania be requeſted to appoint a committee to confer with a committee of Congreſs, on the ſubject of the proceedings relative to the ſloop Active, and the objections made to the execution of the decree of the Committee on Appeals, to the end that proper meaſures may be adopted for removing the ſaid obſtacles: And that a committee of three be appointed to hold the ſaid confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with the committee of the General Aſſembly of Pennſylvania, (5 journals, 86 to 90.)</p>

That "the power of eſtabliſhing courts for receiving and determining finally appeals in all caſes of captures". is reſerved in Congreſs by the articles of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federation: And as the State of Pennſylvania has acceded to thoſe articles, this houſe eſteem it their duty to adopt ſuch regulations, conſiſtent with the principles of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federation, as Congreſs may judge neceſſary for the due exerciſe of the ſaid power.</p>
                     <p n="2">2dly. That by an act of this Commonwealth for eſtabliſhing a Court of Admiralty, it is declared and enacted, that the finding of the jury ſhall eſtabliſh the facts without re-examination or appeal; and that the ſaid act is not repugnant to, but conſiſtent with the reſolutions of Congreſs of 25th Nov. 1775.</p>
                     <p n="3">3dly. That the proceedings in the caſe of the ſloop Active were founded on the aforeſaid act of Aſſembly, which, together with the ſaid reſolve, form the true ground whereupon the deciſion of the conteſted points ſhould be made, without involving a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the neceſſity or propriety of future alterations or amendments.</p>
                     <p>It need only be added, that the Legiſlature the next year amended their Admiralty law, directed that caſes of capture ſhould be decided agreeably to the law of nations and acts of Congreſs; that the proceedings ſhould be according to the courſe of the civil law, and an appeal in all caſes given to Congreſs.</p>
                     <p>From the foregoing caſes it is evident, that whenever any difference aroſe between the Superior Court of Congreſs and the Inferior Court of the State, the advantage was on the ſide of the State Court; that when in the lower court, a State law came in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the act, ordinance, or reſolve of Congreſs, the latter was obliged to yield to the former: In fine, that although Congreſs appeared to poſſeſs extenſive powers, they could carry nothing into effect, when oppoſed by the laws and courts of individual States; in theory they had every thing, in practice nothing.</p>
                     <p>Were the real powers of Congreſs increaſed by the adoption of the articles of Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration?—It is contended their power in making treaties was diminiſhed. Congreſs had declared the States independent;—the States individually formed Conſtitutions for themſelves;—the Conſtituted Authority in each State ſent their Delegates to Congreſs, to conſult and act for the general good;—thus ſent with undefined powers, the only na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural concluſion was, that their authority muſt be commenſurate to the object of their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment:—"He who wills the end, wills alſo the means by which that end ſhould be accompliſhed." Under the impreſſion of having the fulleſt powers for that purpoſe, Congreſs entered into and ratified treaties with France;—but this power, is (by the ſtrongeſt implication) conſidered in a leſs extenſive point of view in the articles of Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. There each State reſerves its own ſovereignty, and every power not expreſsly delegated to Congreſs; and ſo far were the States from allowing that Treaties were the Law of the Land, that a clauſe was inſerted, that
<q>No State ſhould lay impoſts or duties to interfere with any ſtipulations in Treaties, entered into by the United States, in Congreſs aſſembled, with any King, Prince, or State, in purſuance of any Treaties already propoſed by Congreſs to the Courts of France and Spain:</q>
And in the 9th article, in which the power of <hi>entering into</hi> Treaties is delegated, the power of eſtabliſhing rules for deciding in caſes of capture is given, but with this remarkable difference, that all the important rights of foreigners, however ſecured by Treaty, all the numerous queſtions on the law of nations ariſing out of Treaties, are left to be decided as many different ways as there may be courts; and in many inſtances the national faith, character, honor and peace, committed to the general verdicts of uninformed juries, while a diſpute about a cock-boat could be carried to a Court of Appeals appointed by Congreſs.</p>

to have any force at all, muſt be conſidered as part of the law of the land. Their true import, as far as reſpects individuals, muſt, like all other laws, be aſcertained by judicial determinations. To produce uniformity in theſe determinations, they ought to be ſubmitted in the laſt reſort, to one SUPREME TRIBUNAL: And this tribunal ought to be inſtituted under the ſame authority which forms the treaties themſelves. Theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients are both indiſpenſible. If there is in each ſtate a court of final juriſdiction, there may be as many different final determinations on the ſame point, as there are courts. There are endleſs diverſities in the opinions of men. We often ſee not only differing courts, but the judges of the ſame court differing from each other. To avoid the confuſion which would unavoidably reſult from the contradictory deciſions of a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of independent judicatories, all nations have found it neceſſary to eſtabliſh one court paramount to the reſt, poſſeſſing a general ſuperintendence, and authoriſed to ſettle and declare in the laſt reſort, an uniform rule of civil juſtice.</p>
                     <p>"This is the more neceſſary where the frame of the government is ſo compounded, that the laws of the whole are in danger of being contravened by the laws of the parts. In this caſe, if the particular tribunals are inveſted with a right of ultimate juriſdiction, beſides the contradictions to be expected from difference or opinion, there will be much to fear from the bias of local views and prejudices, and from the interference of local regulations. As often as ſuch an interference was to happen, there would be reaſon to apprehend, that the proviſions of the particular laws might be prefered to thoſe of the general laws; from the deference with which men in office naturally look up to that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to which they owe their official exiſtence. The treaties of the United States, under the preſent conſtitution, are liable to the infractions of thirteen different legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and as many different courts of final juriſdiction, acting under the authority of thoſe legiſlatures. The faith, the reputation, the peace of the whole Union, are thus continually at the mercy of the prejudices, the paſſions, and the intereſts of every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of which it is compoſed.

                     <p>"The judicial power extends to all caſes ariſing under treaties made, or which ſhall be made, by the United States. I ſhall not repeat, at this time, what has been ſaid with regard to the power of the States to make Treaties; it can not be controverted, that when made, they ought to be obſerved. But it is highly proper that this regulation ſhould be made; for the truth is, and I am ſorry to ſay it, that in order to prevent the payment of Britiſh debts, and from other cauſes, our treaties have been violated, and violated too by the expreſs laws of ſeveral States in the Union. Pennſylvania, to her honor be it ſpoken, has hitherto done no act of this kind; but it is acknowledged, on all ſides, that many States in the Union have infringed the treaty; and it is well known, that when the Miniſter of the United States made a demand of Lord Carmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, of a ſurrender of the Weſtern Poſts, he told the Miniſter, with truth and juſtice, <q>The treaty, under which you claim thoſe poſſeſſions, has not been performed on your part: Until that is done, thoſe poſſeſſions will not be delivered up.</q> This clauſe, Sir, will ſhew the world, that we make the faith of treaties a conſtitutional part of the character of the United States; that we ſecure its performance no longer nominally, for the Judges of the United States will be enabled to carry them into effect, let the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlatures of the different States do what they may."</p>
                     <p>And in another page (131.)</p>
                     <p>"I ſtated on a former occaſion one important advantage; by adopting this ſyſtem, we become a nation; at preſent we are not one. Can we perform a ſingle national act? Can we do any thing to procure us dignity, or to preſerve peace and tranquillity? Can we relieve the diſtreſs of our citizens? Can we provide for their welfare or happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? The powers of our government are mere ſound. If we offer to treat with a nation, we receive this humiliating anſwer, "You cannot, in propriety of language, make a treaty—becauſe you have no power to execute it."</p>
                     <p>And Chief Juſtice M'Kean gives this as one of his leading reaſons for adopting the Conſtitution, which he declares to be one of the beſt Syſtems the world has yet ſeen:</p>

                        </gap> the meeting of the federal convention, ſays the honorable gentleman, we reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in peace; a miracle it was, that we were ſo: Miraculous muſt it appear to thoſe who conſider the diſtreſſes of the war, and the no leſs afflicting calamities, which we ſuffered in the ſucceeding peace;—be ſo good as to recollect how we fared under the confederati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I am ready to pour forth ſentiments of the fulleſt gratitude to thoſe gentlemen who framed that ſyſtem. I believe they had the moſt enlightened heads in this weſtern hemiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere:—Notwithſtanding their intelligence, and earneſt ſolicitude, for the good of their country, this ſyſtem has proved totally inadequate to the purpoſe, for which it was devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: But, Sir, this was no diſgrace to them; the ſubject of confederations was then new, and the neceſſity of ſpeedily forming ſome government for the States, to defend them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the preſſing dangers, prevented, perhaps, thoſe able Stateſmen from making that ſyſtem as perfect as more leiſure and deliberation might have enabled them to do: I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not otherwiſe conceive how they could have formed a ſyſtem, that provided no means of enforcing the powers which were nominally given it. Was it not a political farce, to pretend to veſt powers, without accompanying them with the means of putting them in execution? This want of energy was not a greater ſoleciſm than the blending together, and veſting in one body, all the branches of Government. The utter inefficacy of this ſyſtem was diſcovered the moment the danger was over, by the introduction of peace: The accumulated public misfortunes that reſulted from its inefficacy, rendered an altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion neceſſary; this neceſſity was obvious to all America: Attempts have according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been made for this purpoſe. I have been a witneſs to this buſineſs from its earlieſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning. I was honoured with a ſeat in the ſmall Convention held at Annapolis.

                        </gap> to extend the improvement to the whole ſyſtem. The members of the general Convention were particularly deputed to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liorate the confederation. On a thorough contemplation of the ſubject, they found it impoſſible to amend that ſyſtem: What was to be done? The dangers of America, which will be ſhewn at another time by a particular enumeration, ſuggeſted the expedient of forming a new plan: The confederation has done a great deal for us, we all allow, but it was the danger of a powerful enemy, and the ſpirit of America, Sir, and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny energy in that ſyſtem that carried us through that perilous war: For what were its beſt arms? The greateſt exertions were made, when the danger was moſt imminent. This ſyſtem was not ſigned till March 1781, Maryland having not acceded to it before: yet the military atchievements and other exertions of America, previous to that period, were as brilliant, effectual, and ſucceſsful, as they could have been under the moſt energie Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. This clearly ſhews, that our perilous ſituation was the cement of our Union —How different the ſcene when this peril vaniſhed, and peace was reſtored! The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Congreſs were treated with neglect. One State complained that another had not paid its quotas as well as itſelf. Public credit gone—for I believe were it not for the private credit of individuals we ſhould have been ruined long before that time. Commerce languiſhing—produce falling in value, and juſtice trampled under foot. We became con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible in the eyes of foreign nations; they diſcarded us as little wanton bees who had played for liberty, but who had not ſufficient ſolidity or wiſdom to ſecure it on a perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:034906_0119_0FFF943FA01D5810"/>
baſis, and were therefore unworthy of their regard. It was found that Congreſs could not <hi>even enforce the obſervance of treaties.</hi>"</p>
                     <p>The ſame Gentleman, who muſt be ſuppoſed acquainted with the laws of Virginia and the practice of its courts, and who cannot be ſuſpected of a public ſlander upon his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive State, ſays, "The cry of peace is falſe. It is but a ſudden calm; the tempeſt growls over you—look round—whereſoever you look you ſee danger. When there are ſo many witneſſes in many parts of America, that Juſtice is ſuffocated, ſhall peace and happineſs ſtill be ſaid to reign? Candour, Sir, requires an undiſguiſed repreſentation of our ſituation. Candour demands a faithful expoſition of facts. Many <hi>citizens</hi> have found Juſtice ſtrangled and trampled under foot, through the courſe of juriſprudence in this country. Are thoſe who have debts due to them, ſatisfied with your government? Are not creditors wearied with the procraſtination of your legal proceſs? A proceſs ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured by legiſlative miſts."</p>
                     <p>If the above remarks are founded, (and the Claimants do not obſerve that they were contradicted,) if even citizens were thus impeded in the recovery of their juſt debts, what muſt have been the ſituation of Britiſh creditors?</p>
                     <p>Again, the ſame ſpeaker ſays, (1 vol. deb. 84) "The debts due to the Britiſh are alſo very conſiderable. Theſe have been withheld contrary to treaty." And in reply to Mr. Henry, who had anſwered him, he ſays, (p. 190) "The honorable gentleman has paſt by my obſervations with reſpect to Britiſh debts. He has thought proper to be ſilent on the ſubject. My obſervations muſt, therefore, have full force." The Claimants do not conceive that any member could contradict the aſſertion. The inſtrument then under conſideration was dated Sept. 17, 1787. The act of Virginia of Dec. 12, 1787, and its ſuſpending clauſe, was only ſix months old, and muſt have been too freſh in the memory of every one preſent, to admit of a contradiction.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Pendleton, the preſident of the Convention, ſays, "It was the ſpirit of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, and not the Confederation, that carried us thro' the war. Thus I prove it; the moment of peace ſhewed the imbecility of the Federal Government. Congreſs were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered to make war and peace. A peace they made, giving us the great object, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence, and yielding us a territory that exceeded my moſt ſanguine expectations. Unfortunately, a ſingle <hi>diſagreeable clauſe,</hi> not the object of the war, has retarded the performance of the treaty on our part. <hi>Congreſs could only recommend its performance, not enforce it.</hi>"</p>
                     <p>Mr. Nicholas, in urging the neceſſity of adopting the Conſtitution, ſays, (Deb. vol. 2, p. 43) "There is another point wherein this government will ſet them right; I mean the Weſtern Poſts. They have been withheld from us ſince the peace by the Britiſh. The violation of the treaty on our part, authoriſes this detention in ſome degree. The anſwer of the Britiſh Miniſter to our demand of ſurrendering the Poſts, was, that as ſoon as America ſhould ſhew a diſpoſition to comply with the treaty on her part, that Great Britain ſhould do the ſame. By this Conſtitution, treaties will be the ſupreme law of the land."</p>
                     <p>If other proof was wanting, in addition to theſe ſtrong and uncontradicted acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Congreſs have repeatedly declared their ſentiments on the ſubject. It was in vain they aſſerted, that "a treaty made and publiſhed by them became obligatory on the whole nation." The aſſertion was a dead letter. They had no power to inflict penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties on infractions; no courts to carry their decrees into execution: It was in vain they recommended repeals of exiſting laws infringing the treaty; the days of common danger were over; the taliſman that had once enſured reſpect to their ordinances, had loſt its virtue, and their recommendations ſounded as feebly in the ſouth, as the voice of Juſtice in the ears of a diſhoneſt and protected debtor.</p>

                        <pb n="15" facs="unknown:034906_0120_0FFF9443002790E8"/>The reaſoning of the Author of the Federaliſt is ſo concluſive that the Claimants muſt beg leave to adopt it as their own.</p>
                     <p>"The caſe of Virginia is ſtill ſtronger than that of South Carolina. There is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence which cannot be diſputed, that her courts, in defiance of the treaty, have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly remained ſhut to the recovery of Britiſh debts, in virtue of laws paſſed during the War.</p>
                     <p>"An act of her general aſſembly of the 22d. June, 1784, after ſuggeſting as breaches of the treaty by Great-Britain the carrying off of the Negroes, and the detention of the poſts, after inſtructing her delegates in Congreſs to requeſt a remonſtrance to the Britiſh court, complaining of thoſe infractions, and deſiring reparation, and after declaring that the national honour and intereſt of the citizens of that Commonwealth, obliged the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly to withhold their co-operation in the compleat fulfilment of the ſaid treaty, until the ſucceſs of the aforementioned remonſtrance is known, or Congreſs ſhall ſignify their ſentiments touching the premiſes, concludes with the following reſolution:</p>
                     <p>"That ſo ſoon as reparation is made for the foregoing infraction, or congreſs ſhall judge it indiſputably neceſſary, ſuch acts and parts of acts paſſed during the late war, as inhibit the recovery of Britiſh debts, ought to be repealed, and payment thereof made in ſuch time and manner, as ſhall conſiſt with the exhauſted ſituation of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
                     <p>"The plain language of this reſolution is, that there were acts paſſed during the war, which then actually inhibited the recovery of Britiſh debts, and that for the removal of this inhibition, a repealing act by the authority of Virginia was neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>"However unfounded this poſition might have been in theory, here is concluſive evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that the fact in Virginia was conformable to it; that her courts had been, ever ſince the peace, then were, and until a repealing law was paſſed, were likely to continue to be ſhut againſt the recovery of Britiſh debts.—When teſtimony of this kind was urged by the Britiſh Miniſter, was it poſſible for our Envoy to make any ſolid reply; Who could be ſuppoſed to know better than the legiſlature of Virginia, the real ſtate of the fact? When that legiſlature declared it to be as has been ſtated, who, or what could contradict it? With what truth has it been aſſerted, that "it was at all times perfectly underſtood" that treaties controuled the laws of the States?</p>
                     <p>"Additional proof of the contrary is found in the ſubſequent conduct of Virginia. On the 12th of December, 1787, the State paſſed an act, repealing all ſuch acts or parts of acts of the State, as had prevented, or might prevent the recovery of debts due to Britiſh ſubjects, according to the true intent of the treaty; but with this proviſo, that there ſhould be a ſuſpenſion of the repeal, 'till the Governor, by advice of council, had, by proclamation, notified that Great-Britain had delivered up the poſts, and was taking meaſures for the further fulfilment of the treaty by delivering up the negroes, or by making compenſation for them. This denotes clearly, that in the opinion of the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature of Virginia, there were acts of that State which had prevented, and might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, the recovery of debts according to the treaty.</p>
                     <p>"It is obſervable too, that the reſolutions of June, 1784, do not even give the expectation of a complete repeal of the impeding laws, in the event of reparation of the breaches of treaty by Great-Britain. They only promiſe ſuch a modification of them as would permit the payment in ſuch time and manner as ſhould conſiſt with the exhauſted ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the Commonwealth; that is, not according to the true intent of the treaty, but according to the opinion of the legiſlature of Virginia of the abilities of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.</p>

                        <pb n="16" facs="unknown:034906_0121_0FFF944484189580"/>"The complaints of a power, whoſe treaty with us was, in fact, violated by the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of a State law, could never be ſatisfactorily anſwered by referring to a theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retic abſtract, or diſputed propoſition. Such a power might reply with irreſiſtible force: "It is not for us to concern ourſelves about the ſtructure and meaning of your political conſtitutions, or the force of legal maxims deducible from the forms and diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions of power which you have adopted for your government.

This is the firſt inſtance in which the Claimants have ever heard the ignorance of a legiſlature uſed as an argument to do away an unequivocal declaration in a ſtatute. If, indeed, the laws regulating elections in Virginia, contained a prohibition ſimilar to that in the writs for the Coventry Parliament, then the name of <hi>Parliamentum indoctum,</hi> and the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sir Edward Coke, "that they never made a good law," might be applied to the Virginia Aſſembly of 1787. If any member of that houſe ſubſcribes to the aſſertion in the Anſwer, the Claimants will refer him to the only reported caſe they know, in which, and the terms on which, ignorance of the law was admitted as an excuſe.</p>
                     <p>"In the year 1598, Sir E. Coke, then Attorney-General, married the Lady Hatton, without banns or licence, and in a private houſe, ſeveral great men were preſent, as Lord Burleigh, &amp;c.—they all ſubmitted to the cenſure of the Arch-Biſhop, who granted them abſolution from the excommunication they had incurred. The act of abſolution ſets forth, that it was granted by reaſon of their penitence, and the fact ſeeming to have been done <hi>through ignorance of the law.</hi> N. B. Lord Chancellor Egerton ſubmitted to the cenſure of the Arch-Biſhop on the ſame account." (Hardw. 58.)</p>
                     <p>The Claimants in this caſe ſincerely repent, that they were as ignorant of the laws of Virginia as the law-makers themſelves are ſtated to be, in the anſwer to their claim; and they truſt their ignorance will be their excuſe.</p>
                     <p>But even ſuppoſing there were legal impediments in Virginia, and that the legiſlature of that State were not in an error when they paſſed the act of 1787, "it is contended that the treaty of peace abrogated all the legiſlative acts of Virginia, which were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it: In this light it was generally conſidered throughout the United States; and it is not believed, that any judicial deciſion was ever made to the contrary, by the Judges of any court, in any State: And if, <hi>by accident,</hi> ſuch a deciſion was ever made, it may be pronounced to be erroneous, and would have been corrected, if it had been carried before a higher tribunal."

A repetition of a few obſervations upon that deciſion, may be proper here. The effect of a payment of a debt due to a Britiſh ſubject into the treaſury of Maryland, was the ſame, as a ſimilar payment in Virginia. By the laws of each State it operated as a diſcharge of the debt. It is fair to reaſon from what did paſs in Maryland, whoſe courts were open immediately after the peace, to what would have paſſed in Virginia, had ſhe barely repealed all laws prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Britiſh ſubjects from proſecuting ſuits for the recovery of their debts, without going further and <hi>declaring the Treaty of peace the ſupreme law of the land.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the caſe of Ruſſell's Admr. <hi>v</hi> Harwood,</p>
                     <p>The original Writ iſſued 19th. June 1786—Several pleas were put in, but all of them were afterwards relinquiſh'd, except that of payment unto the treaſury agreeably to the act of Aſſembly, and judgment was rendered in favour of the Plaintiff by the Judges of the General Court, deducting war intereſt, on the 12th of October 1790. A writ of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror was ſued out the 21ſt. December 1790, and the judgment of the General Court was reverſed in the high court of errors and appeals, June the 9th. 1795.</p>
                     <p>The Claimants do not pretend, nor have they, or any other Claimants before the Board, ever pretended, that the decree of the court of appeals <hi>in this Caſe</hi> can be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported on legal principles—The judgment of the general court was rendered after the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had been declared the law of the land, by the Legiſlature of Maryland, and after it had been <hi>ſolemnly eſtabliſhed as the ſupreme law of the land,</hi> by the adoption of the preſent conſtitution of the United States—It however eſtabliſhes undeniably theſe points—That the act authoriſing payments into the treaſury of debts due to Britiſh ſubjects, and pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments made in conformity to the directions of that act, were in the opinion of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt court of Maryland, a bar to the recovery of the debt, and notwithſtanding the fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Conſtitution, would ſtill be a bar, if an appeal had not been authoriſed in the "act to eſtabliſh the judicial courts of the United States."</p>
                     <p>There exiſts alſo an impediment which that act itſelf cannot remove, and which would entitle the Adminiſtrator of Ruſſel to claim compenſation of the United States, if Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood had became inſolvent even ſubſequent to the 9th. of June, 1795. The bail in er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, was bail for the abſolute payment of the debt, if the court of appeals of Maryland affirmed the judgment. By the reverſal of the judgment of the General Court that bail was diſcharged. Another conſequence is undeniable. If this ſuit had been brought earli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and if the final judgment of the court of appeals in Maryland had been rendered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the 24th. of September, 1789, the date of the "act to eſtabliſh the judicial courts of the United States," the Creditor would have been without remedy, except under the 6th Article of the Treaty of Amity,—And if all the Creditors in Virginia had commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced their ſuits immediately after the peace, and every one had been diſmiſſed, on the ground that they were for Britiſh debts, no courts erected ſubſequent to thoſe judgments, and under a conſtitution adopted ſubſequent to them, could poſſibly re-examine and reverſe them.</p>
                     <p>But it is ſaid that the deciſion of the circuit Court of the United States in June, 1796, fully eſtabliſhes the doctrine, that a treaty controuls all State laws oppoſed to it. Could a ſimilar deciſion of the Judges of the Supreme court of Virginia ſince the peace and before the adoption of the federal Conſtitution, be produced, it might be of conſequence, but it lies not with the United States to ſay, "It is true that in 1783, we ſtipulated, that no legal impediments ſhould exiſt to the recovery of debts, the courts in the different States ought to have decided that that ſtipulation repealed the laws which the Judges of thoſe courts were ſworn to ſupport; We recommended it to them ſo to do; Their obſtinacy would not, or their conſciences could not, bend to our recommendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. It is true, that many loſſes have been ſuſtained in conſequence thereof: It is true
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:034906_0124_0FFF944A577C1D90"/>
that in 1794, we promiſed compenſation for thoſe loſſes; but we are releaſed from both ſtipulations, becauſe, in 1796, the Judges of our Circuit Court have decided that judgments of State Courts, (not in our power to reverſe,) were rendered on erroneous principles."</p>
                     <p>But the caſe cited (Hamilton <hi>v</hi> Eaton) does not go the full length contended for in the Anſwer. The principle there laid down is correct where there is one ſovereign will; but it has been ſhewn, that it is at beſt extremely doubtful where there is <hi>imperium in imperio</hi>; nor was it neceſſary to decide the point, for the Chief Juſtice goes on and ſays, "If, however, a ſubſequent ſanction of this State was at all neceſſary to make the treaty law here, it has been had and repeated. By a ſtatute paſſed in 1787, the treaty was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be law in this State, &amp;c. And in 1789, was adopted here, the Conſtitution of the United States, which declared, that all treaties made, or to be made, under the authority of the United States, ſhould be the ſupreme law of the land, and that the Judges in every State ſhould be bound thereby; any thing in the Conſtitution or laws of the State to the contrary notwithſtanding. Surely then, <hi>the treaty is now law in this State.</hi>" He concludes with ſaying, "What is moſt material to be here noted is, that the right or obſtacle in queſtion, whatever it may amount to, has been created <hi>by law, and not by the creditors:</hi> It comes within the deſcription of <hi>lawful impediments,</hi> all of which, in this caſe, the treaty, as I apprehend, <hi>removes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here the Claimants leave the general points on legal impediments, with this remark, that if the power of the State legiſlature of North Carolina<note n="*" place="bottom">A ſhort ſtatement of facts attending the above caſe may be neceſſary. Archibald Hamilton, and Co. had mercantile houſes in Glaſgow; they had large ſtores in North Carolina and in Virginia; the American concerns of the houſe for ſeveral years previous to the Revolution, had been under the direction of John Hamilton, Eſquire. In April 1777, the legiſlature of North Carolina enacted, that all perſons who had traded directly to Great Britain or Ireland, within ten years laſt paſt, ſhould take an oath of alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance or depart the State; they were authoriſed to ſell their eſtates, to export the amount in produce, and to appoint attornies to ſell and diſpoſe of their eſtates for their uſe. Debts were not mentioned, nor were they required to collect them before their departure. That was impracticable, as no courts exiſted. Under the above act the plaintiffs left North Carolina. In November, 1777, another act paſſed, confiſcating all their eſtates, real and perſonal; and Commiſſioners were directed to be appointed to collect all their debts for the uſe of the State, and give diſcharges, which ſhould forever indemnify the debtor. Under this act very large ſums were paid, among others the debt of the defendant. After the peace, Col. Hamilton return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to North Carolina to endeavour to collect his debts, but a poſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>tive law of the State prohibited him from inſtituting any ſuit. Several ſuits were commenced againſt him for ſums owing to citizens of Virginia and North Carolina, and judgments ſpeedily obtained for principal and intereſt. In this ſituation he petitioned the legiſlature to repeal the confiſcation law, and grant an order on the treaſury for the monies paid in by his debtors; this was rejected. He petitioned a ſecond time, ſtating the ſuits brought againſt him, and praying the equal benefit of the laws to recover the debts due to him, and requeſting an order for only ſo much of the money paid into the treaſury by his debtors, as would enable him to diſcharge the debts due by the firm before the war to citizens of America. This, alſo, was rejected; and as the federal judiciary was now eſtabliſhed, in which ſuits for 500 dollars and upwards could be commenced, and ſome were, they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Attorney and Solicitor General to defend them.</note>, had not been controuled by the Conſtitution of the United States; or if the 14th amendment to that Conſtitution agreed to by the Virginia Convention,<note n="†" place="bottom">By an amendment propoſed by the Virginia Convention, the judicial power of the United States was not to extend to any caſe, where the cauſe of action originated before the ratification of the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, except diſputes between States about their territory, diſputes between perſons claiming lands under grants of different States and ſuits for debts due to the United States.</note> had been adopted, it is probable the caſes of Hamilton <hi>v</hi> Eaton, or Jones <hi>v</hi> Hylton, would have never been decided.</p>

                        <head>The Claimants are to prove their Caſe.</head>
                        <p>THIS is admitted, but it is contended that in this caſe, as well as in ſuits at law, a title prima facia good, is ſufficient until the defendant ſhews, either that the plaintiff has been diveſted of that title, or that the defendant, or ſome perſon elſe, has a better; or, if it is a demand for money, that the demand has been legally ſatisfied. But there are caſes even at law where the fulleſt proof cannot be expected; and here a legal maxim applies: "No man is permitted to take advantage of a defect of evidence, when that defect is occaſioned by his own act."</p>
                        <p>A maxim is cited in the Anſwer, (p. 5) <hi>Melior eſt conditio defendentis</hi>—This requires an obſervation. "<hi>Potior eſt conditio poſſidentis,</hi>" is a correct maxim. In an ejectment the plaintiff muſt produce a clear title, otherwiſe the mere poſſeſſion of the defendant is ſufficient. The maxim cited in the anſwer ſhould be, "<hi>In pari delictu melior eſt conditio defendentis.</hi>" This is founded on a principle of general policy, which a defendant has advantage of, contrary to real juſtice, as between him and the plaintiff; the principle is, "<hi>ex dolo malo non oritur actio.</hi>" If the cauſe of action appears to ariſe <hi>ex turpi c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In reply to this maxim, a claimant can only aſk, in the "plaintive motto of a Courtnay, <hi>Ubi lapſus? quid feci.</hi>"</p>
                        <p>It is agreed, that the ſtipulation in the Sixth article of the treaty of Amity is ſo "<hi>brief and intelligible, that it is difficult by any phraſeology to make it either more conciſe or plain.</hi>" (Anſw. pa. 7.) But the Claimants do not entirely acceed to the ſpecial deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Anſwer. (pa. 8.) within which it is ſaid, a "remediable claim muſt be brought;" nor to all the caſes (pa. 10.11.) ſaid to be "<hi>not relievable under the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>" They fully agree with the Anſwer in this, "<hi>that the</hi> 6<hi>th. article of the treaty of amity grew out of the</hi> 4<hi>th. article of the treaty of peace</hi>" but while they acknowledge the fundamental principle laid down, (pa. 12.)
<q>that no loſs or damage is reparable under the treaty of <hi>1794,</hi> that is not grounded on a debt comprehended in the <hi>4</hi>th article of the treaty of <hi>1783,</hi> and has not proceeded from the violation or non-execution thereof,</q>
to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect as far as it goes, they reſpectfully contend, that the fundamental rule ſhould be in the affirmative, and not the negative; it ſhould be—<hi>Every loſs or damage is reparable under the treaty of</hi> 1794, <hi>that is grounded on a Debt comprehended in the</hi> 4<hi>th article of the treaty of peace, and has proceeded from a violation or non-execution thereof.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This leads to a ſhort diſcuſſion as to the true meaning of both articles. The Claimants will ſtate the conſtruction which to them appears to ariſe from the Words—The Board will decide between the anſwer and reply.</p>
                        <p>"<hi>It is agreed, that Creditors on either ſide, ſhall meet with no lawful impediment to the recovery of the full value, in ſterling Money, of all bona fide debts heretofore contracted.</hi>"</p>
                        <p>The words <hi>Creditors on either ſide,</hi> are to be taken in their moſt extenſive ſignification. All Britiſh ſubjects having demands on one ſide, whether reſident in Great Britain, Ireland, the Indies, or the Continent; and all American citizens on the other. All
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:034906_0126_0FFF9451D84A1420"/>
diſtinctions of Britiſh ſubjects taken from their reſidence, are blended in the deſignation <hi>Creditors on the ſide of His Britannic Majeſty.</hi> Not a word is ſaid of <hi>Debtors</hi>; therefore, the firſt deſcription in the Anſwer (pa. 8) is not quite accurate; for, if a Britiſh ſubject indebted to a Britiſh ſubject before the peace, had abſconded with his property, after the peace, and becoming either a citizen or inhabitant of any State, had there been protected by a State law from the purſuit of his creditor, it is not unfair to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it a remediable claim. That, however, is not the caſe of the Claimants, nor is it known or believed that any ſuch caſe exiſts.</p>
                        <p>Further. "<hi>Creditors of all bona fide debts theretofore contracted,</hi>" whether entitled to receive the debts, as creditors by original contract or aſſignment before the peace: Whether the debts had been confiſcated, ſequeſtered, paid into the Treaſury, or tendered in worthleſs paper, or in any thing leſs than ſterling value: Whether the obligations or evidences of the debts had been ſeized, deſtroyed and cancelled, as in ſeveral caſes they were, under a State law; or fraudulently or forcibly, or by operation of law, obtained by the debtor—Still they are creditors, and are to meet no lawful impediment to the <hi>recovery</hi> of the full value in ſterling money <hi>of all ſuch debts.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A law that is univerſally beneficial cannot contain exceptions, for ſuch would make it only beneficial in caſes not excepted. The word <hi>all,</hi> without any exception annexed to it, is a term of univerſality, and cannot be reſtrained, there being no ambiguity in the expreſſion, and as to the words <hi>lawful impediments to the recovery,</hi> they have nothing to operate upon, eſpecially as connected with the words <hi>full value in ſterling money,</hi> except confiſcations, ſequeſtrations, depreciated paper, depreciation laws, ſcaleing debts, and laws at that time in force prohibiting ſuits; all of which required legiſlative interference to remove; in every other caſe, by the mere return of peace, without any expreſs ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, the war ſuſpended remedy revived. The article therefore clearly means, that thoſe laws, and all proceedings under them, ſhould be <hi>no impediment to a full recovery.</hi> A rule of conſtruction of ſtatutes, already mentioned, is "to give its force to every word, where it can be done." And Vattel ſays, "<hi>where an act is conceived in clear and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe terms, when the ſenſe is manifeſt and leads to nothing abſurd, there can be no reaſon to refuſe the ſenſe which it naturally preſents,—to go elſewhere in ſearch of conjectures to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh or reſtrain it, is to endeavour to elude it.</hi>"</p>
                        <p>In the treaties made between France, Spain, and Holland, with Great Britain, about the ſame time, there is no ſuch proviſion; becauſe there exiſted no ſuch acts in thoſe governments, which rendered neceſſary a ſtipulation that their effects ſhould be of no validity.</p>
                        <p>Juſtice, and reciprocal remedies to the ſubjects and citizens of the two countries, call for this conſtruction. The intimate connection which had ſubſiſted between Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and the Colonies, previous to their ſeparation, ſtrongly require it, in order to make the article completely mutual. No laws were made in England confiſcating debts, or making depreciated paper a tender; and if a creditor was beyond ſeas, no act of limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation barred him. If, therefore, leſs than <hi>all</hi> impediments to the recovery of <hi>all</hi> debts were intended to be removed, where is the line to be drawn?—An half, a fiftieth, or a thouſandth part? Or, is a conſtruction to be put, ſimilar to that ſtated and ſeverely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probated by Puffendorf, on the treaty between Fabius Labeo and Antiochus. in which the Romans ſtipulated to reſtore one half the ſhips taken from Antiochus. They ſawed them all in half, and rendered the whole uſeleſs.</p>
                        <p>The ſixth article of the treaty of amity which aroſe out of the foregoing article of the treaty of peace, in conſequence of alledged infractions, evidently contains, and muſt be divided into two parts. Great Britain complained, "that debts to a conſiderable amount, which were bona fide contracted before the peace, ſtill remain owing to her ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, by citizens or inhabitants of the United States; that by the operation of various
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:034906_0127_0FFF94536C287568"/>

                        <p>Within this part of the ſection, and this only, the Claimants muſt prove their caſe. They come fairly before the Board on the following terms:</p>
                        <p>They muſt be Britiſh ſubjects.</p>
                        <p>Their Debtors muſt have been citizens or inhabitants of the United States.</p>
                        <p>Their debts muſt have been bona fide contracted before the peace; they are to be proved in that manner which was admiſſible and ſufficient, at the time they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, if that is now poſſible; but, if from the unavoidable accidents that muſt have happened in a long lapſe of time, that is now impracticable, the next beſt teſtimony in their power is to be received and conſidered. Their debts muſt ſtill remain owing to them; legal impediments muſt have ſo operated, that <hi>a full recovery has been delayed,</hi> or the value and ſecurity impaired and leſſened, ſo that by the <hi>ordinary courſe of judicial proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> (that is, the courts which had original juriſdiction, according to the amount in the State where the debt was contracted,—for the proſecution of a five pound appeal, ſeven hundred miles off, was never contemplated) they cannot NOW <hi>actually have and receive full and adequate compenſation</hi> for the loſſes and damages thereby ſuſtained. No further or other points are to be proved, and if they cannot <hi>now</hi> actually have and receive from their Debtor, they are not to wait the event of hopeleſs ſuits or general verdicts, years after the commiſſion ſhall have been expended; becauſe, the United States <hi>have agreed,</hi> that in all ſuch caſes where full compenſation cannot, <hi>for whatever reaſon,</hi> be actually ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, they will make it.</p>
                        <p>While the Claimants ſtate the above to be all that can be required of them, and inſiſt that it is ſufficient to entitle them to a decree, (they executing proper aſſigmnents and releaſes) for all loſſes and damages thus proved to be ſuſtained, if nothing elſe appears; They admit, that there is a defendant ſide to the caſe, becauſe, when the United States ſtipulated to make compenſation as above, they required, and it was agreed, and "diſtinctly underſtood, that the ſtipulation was not to extend to loſſes occaſioned <hi>by ſuch inſolvency of the debtors, as would equally have operated to produce ſuch loſs if the ſaid impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments had not exiſted,</hi> nor to ſuch loſſes or damages as have been occaſioned by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt delay, negligence, or wilful omiſſion of the Claimant."</p>
                        <p>This part of the article belongs to the United States, and when the inſolvency of the debtor at and ever ſince the peace is affirmed, the burthen of the proof lies on the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty affirming.

while debtors are tranſacting buſineſs publicly, buying, ſelling, and trading, they are at that time good and ſolvent debtors; and the State of Virginia by protecting their debtors from a ſuit, was like the holder of a bill of exchange giving credit at his own riſk to an acceptor.</p>

So where the payee of a bill neglects to give due notice of the non-acceptance, he will loſe his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy againſt the drawer, on the principle, that if due notice had been given, the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>might have ſecured himſelf</hi>; this defence however of the drawer will not avail him, if it is ſufficiently proved that he had no funds in the hands of the drawee. It muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be evident, that if, in the caſe of an aſſignment as above ſtated, the United States could not recover of the Claimants, without proof of inſolvency at the peace, (which is equivalent to proof of no funds in the hands of a drawee) ſo neither can they reſiſt their promiſe to make full compenſation, without that proof.</p>
                        <p>But the reverſe of the allegation is true. The creditors were driven out of the State by law. The courts were occluded in 1774. At the return of peace, ſuits were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited. If therefore, there is a defect of proof on this point, it ariſes from the act of the State, and not to be taken advantage of. Where preſent inſolvency, or removal from the State during the exiſtence of legal impediments, are the grounds on which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation is claimed, they will be proved.</p>
                        <p>It is laid down as a <hi>general rule,</hi> "that the creditor ought to apply to the Courts of Juſtice againſt the debtor, before he applies to the Commiſſioner's againſt the United States." (Anſw. pa. 10.)</p>
                        <p>In many inſtances the debtors have ſold off their property during the period of exiſting impediments, and removed to places beyond the reach or knowledge of the claimants; it cannot be expected that records of ſuits ſhall be produced in ſuch caſes. To ſue perſons notoriouſly inſolvent, only to produce a return of "no goods," is to ſuppoſe the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners can receive no teſtimony of facts, but what ariſes from record.—If one ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn was had, it might be alledged, that the claimants had only tried one county;—that the debtor might have goods in another of the eighty-two counties, he muſt be purſued in each; if the returns are uniform, it may be urged that he has lands; the claimants muſt try their elegits, and at laſt after twenty years delay, and expence equal to fifty times the debt, they will be able to eſtabliſh by records what the board can eaſily decide upon teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony leſs expenſive, more eaſily obtained, and equally ſatisfactory.—To bring ſuits in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes where there is no other teſtimony except the books, or even where there is other proof, if length of time is a bar, would only be adding the coſts of ten thouſand fruitleſs ſuits to the loſs and damage already ſuſtained.</p>
                        <p>The firſt caſe ſtated (Anſw. pa. 10, 11) as not relievable, is admitted; ſo is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, on proof by the United States of the debtors inſolvency at the peace, and at all times ſince: The third and fourth are conteſted, for reaſons already given; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe moſt of the debts are below the juriſdiction of the Circuit Court of the United States. It would take years to carry thoſe which are above the final juriſdiction of the inferior court, up to the "higheſt court of law or equity of the State in which a deciſion can be had;" in order to bring them within the appellate juriſdiction of the Supreme Court of the United States; and becauſe the word <hi>now,</hi> in the ſixth article, does not mean ten years after the Board ſhall have broken up.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="24" facs="unknown:034906_0129_0FFF9458E4E7FB98"/>The fifth and ſixth are a little at variance—the former inſiſts upon the neceſſity of a tedious and expenſive ſuit for partial relief, before application for the balance ſhall be made to the Board; and the latter inſiſts, that no compenſation ſhall be made where a creditor has accepted, without ſuit, as much as he could poſſibly recover at law; that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning is not ſound—"<hi>Intereſt reipublicae ut finis ſit litium.</hi>" The ſixth caſe however, contains ſomething to be admitted, and ſomething that will be ſtrenuouſly denied. Where the debt has been <hi>ſatisfactorily ſettled before</hi> the peace, there was no debt <hi>at the peace</hi>; where ever it has been <hi>ſo ſettled</hi> ſince the peace, there is no debt now owing; where it was voluntarily compromiſed by a new contract before the peace, and the performance of that contract has been prevented by legal impediments ſince, that is ſtrictly within the treaty; where it has been <hi>voluntarily</hi> compromiſed by a new contract ſince the peace, the original demand is extinguiſhed, and it is not within the treaty. In making theſe admiſſions, the Claimants underſtand the words voluntarily and ſatisfactorily in their plain ſenſe—the will muſt have been unfettered by the certainty that <hi>compromiſe</hi> was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, becauſe payment could not be enforced; and the ſettlement muſt have been ſuch, as would have been ſatisfactory, if acceſs to the courts had not been denied, and the courſe of juſtice had been unimpeded. A caſe may ariſe, where a debtor in affluent circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, or the heirs of ſuch debtor, paid the debt into the treaſury of Virginia, and took a receipt, which by law was declared an effectual diſcharge from the debt: The eſtate of the deceaſed has paſſed unincumbered into the hands of bona fide purchaſers: The heirs, in the enjoyment of the perſonal and the purchaſe money of the real eſtate are, on the return of peace, applied to by the creditor: Their anſwer is rigorous, but mixt with honeſty, and a regard for character: Your debt (ſay they) has been paid according to a law in force: By law we are diſcharged—by law you cannot recover: It is true, that the money paid into the treaſury was worth nothing—it is true, you have received no ſatisfaction, and in conſcience and juſtice you are entitled to it; make us certain deductions, give us certain terms of inſtalment, accept our ſeparate engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments according to the proportions of eſtate which have reſpectively deſcended to us, and we will give them; but you muſt take this or nothing. In ſuch a caſe, the credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor complying was doing the beſt in his power for himſelf, and of courſe the beſt in his power for the United States. But can this be called a <hi>voluntary compromiſe,</hi> a <hi>ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory ſettlement?</hi> And if one of thoſe heirs became inſolvent before payment could be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced, can negligence or omiſſion be imputed to the creditor, or will it be fair in the United States to ſay, "<hi>We did ſtipulate that no impediments ſhould exiſt, but we are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged from that agreement, becauſe the creditor has been compelled to ſubmit to impediments which actually did exiſt.</hi>"</p>
                        <p>The ſeventh excepted caſe is admitted, provided the indulgence was granted ſince the eſtabliſhment of the federal court, and the ſum was within its juriſdiction; but it is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped that no endeavours of a claimant to perſuade a debtor to do juſtice, no kind expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations in letters ſoliciting payment, or even part payments, at a time when no payment which could not be enforced by law, will be conſtrued into ſuch indulgence, and in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances where the Attorney for the creditor was a relation of the debtor, it might have been hoped, that thoſe expoſtulations would have had more weight then when pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from a ſtranger.</p>
                        <p>The eighth excepted caſe in the Anſwer, is by no means agreed to. Judgments of competent courts before the war, are undoubtedly a bar to any claim, on account of a debt then determined not to be juſt; but if non-ſuits have been ordered, ſuits diſmiſſed, or judgments rendered for defendants during the commotions at <hi>the commencement of the war,</hi> and in the abſence of the plaintiff, it will require more conſideration before claims on that account are abandoned. The different Claimants have been adviſed by their General Agent not to bring forward any very ſtale claims; but it is by no means ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, that a debt, which had been five years due, at the time of the occluſion of the courts in Virginia, was not a <hi>bona fide debt</hi> within the meaning of the treaty.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="25" facs="unknown:034906_0130_0FFF945B5686B170"/>The Claimants acknowledge, if the courts in Virginia had been open to them at the ratification of the treaty of peace, and all the time between their occluſion and that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification had been declared out of the act of limitations, in that caſe they would have had no right to complain. If length of time had then been pleaded, they might have repelled the plea by proof of ſubſequent acknowledgments and promiſes, <hi>which is not now within their power.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Here ſome obſervations on the book debt law, the act of limitations, the deciſions of courts, and the practice of the bar in Virginia under thoſe acts, may be properly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced. Deciſions nearly coeval with the date of a ſtatute, and particularly where an uniform practice conformably to ſuch deciſions has taken place for a length of years, are of ſuch high authority as not to be ſhaken; "<hi>Contemporanea expoſitio eſt fortiſſima in lege,</hi>" they reſtrain, they enlarge the conſtruction, and ſometimes ſettle a conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion contrary to the letter.</p>
                        <p>Before the enacting of the act of 1748, the ſtore books of the merchant had always been admitted as evidence of the debt, and an act (5 Geo. IId. now out of print) of the ſame title as the act of 1748, was in force; and it is believed no complaints ever were heard either againſt the practice or the law. But as the ſtate of ſociety advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, debtors ſometimes diſputed the accounts, which threatened deſtruction to that mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual confidence which had hitherto ſubſiſted between the merchant and the planter, and which was eſſential to the convenience of the inhabitants. However, the exigencies of the people, who were moneyleſs a great part of the year abſolutely requiring it, (for otherwiſe, they could not without the moſt intolerable inconvenience to themſelves have procured the comforts and neceſſaries which their families daily ſtood in need of,) the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature, <hi>at once to comply with the public convenience, and to ſecure the merchant,</hi> paſſed the "<hi>act preſcribing the method for proving book debts.</hi>"</p>
                        <p>After the paſſing of this law, (which the claimants never underſtood to have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as a <hi>grievance to the planters)</hi> the courſe of trade was continued upon the ancient footing, and the planters perſiſted to take up goods, as they had occaſion for them for the uſe of their families, and to pay for them out of the enſuing crop. It frequently hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened though, that they over went the growing crop and anticipated the ſubſequent one: In which caſes, if the exceſs was not great in proportion to the uſual extent of their crops, it was cuſtomary once a year to call over the accounts in preſence of the debtor, to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him with a copy if deſired; and to transfer the balance to another ledger, without demanding a ſpecialty, which would have been conſidered as a mark of diſtruſt, and therefore would have been highly offenſive, inſomuch that it was never done, except in caſes ſuppoſed to be perilous, in order to give dignity to the debt. Nor is there any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance recollected where ſuch transfer of the balance has ever been made, until the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count was approved of by the debtor. The courts fell in with this diſpoſition of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and took the law by equity; which they extended beyond the ſtrictneſs of the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to caſes which hardly ſeemed to be within the proviſions of it.</p>
                        <p>Thus, although the firſt and ſecond ſections relate to accounts for ſtore dealings and tranſactions altogether, yet accounts between planters, or for mechanic work, or upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other account whatſoever, were proved in the ſame way, and judgment given on them.</p>
                        <p>So, although the law ſpeaks of two and three years, yet the County Courts univerſally diſpenſed with the limitations, and allowed the evidence at any diſtance of time. Hence it came to paſs, that nothing ever prevented a recovery of an open account thus authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticated, but the general act of limitations paſſed in the year 1705; which, at that time, was thought ſo diſgraceful, that lawyers never inſiſted on it without directions, and no perſon of reputation would require it to be pleaded; and whoever did was held in ſuch diſhonour that very few inſtances of it ever occurred; and even in thoſe, juries found for the defendant with ſuch reluctance, that any thing was admitted in avoidence of the
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:034906_0131_0FFF945DE26CA710"/>
plea. In the General Court too, which at that time was the higheſt Court of Judicature in the State ſuch evidence was admitted, where not pointedly objected to; and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection either from the integrity of the bar, or the diſcountenance ſhewn by the Court, was ſeldom made, inſomuch that it is believed, that but few caſes happened where the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff failed to recover merely upon the ground of that objection. Nay, ſuch was the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement given by the Courts to this ſpecies of evidence, that in caſes where the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffs ſummoned his clerks or others to prove the account, payment for the witneſſes atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance was diſallowed by the Court, as the plaintiff might have proved it by his own oath and therefore ſhould not have ſummoned the witneſs and unneceſſarily have encreaſed the coſts of the ſuit againſt the defendant.</p>
                        <p>This conduct generated a mutual confidence between the merchants and their cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, which induced candour in the planter, and a ſtrict attention on the part of the merchant to the fairneſs of his accounts; inſomuch that he would have yielded any debt which was pointedly objected to by the cuſtomer, ſooner than have the reputation of his books impeached. And to ſuch length was this carried, that a wilful falſe entry in his books would have been as highly condemned, not only by cuſtomers, but by mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, as if he had committed forgery; becauſe ſuch practices would, in the long run, have weakened the teſtimony, which, while it remained unimpaired, was held as ſacred as a bond. Hence, in the public eſtimation, few evidences were more reſpected than a merchant's books, and none, where it was more eſſentially the intereſt of the party that they ſhould be pure and unexceptionable.</p>
                        <p>Under this act, therefore, prior to the revolution, the merchants and traders of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations reſted perfectly ſecure, and ſeldom thought of procuring any other teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, except where the claim had grown to any conſiderable amount, or all dealings and tranſactions were broken off betwixt the parties, when bonds were ſometimes taken to give dignity to the debt. The planter confided in the books, and the merchant relied on them as the only evidence of his claim, which he truſted would be always ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſupport it; and aſſured of this, from the whole experience of his buſineſs, he gave himſelf no concern about any other. Which ſecurity was not indiſcreet, but was founded on the practice and deciſions of the country.</p>
                        <p>From this temper and diſpoſition of the parties, and the ſecurity which the law and practice of the country afforded the creditor, ſuits were ſeldom brought, unleſs the delay of payment was unconſcionable, or the debtor was declining in his circumſtances: In which caſes they were brought, not to authentica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>e the debt, for that was conſidered as eſtabliſhed without, but merely to enforce payment of the money.</p>
                        <p>The revolution then, and its conſequent regulations, came upon them by ſurpriſe. It was an event which no human wiſdom could have foreſeen, and therefore could not be provided againſt. But even had it been foreſeen, and had the creditors reſolved to guard againſt it, they muſt have relied upon the generoſity and integrity of the debtors, as it was not in their power to compel them, from the twelfth day of April, 1774, to this very time. For the coſts of ſuit in Virginia were aſcertained by a temporary law called the F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

Hence, in a variety of inſtances, the creditor <hi>could not have brought his ſuit, had he deemed it neceſſary to do ſo, within the limitations preſcribed by the act of Aſſembly</hi>; which being an impediment ariſing from a defect of juſtice in the country, the delay of ſuit ought not to be imputed to the creditor, even had it been foreſeen that ſuch a ſtep was important. But when it is conſidered, that no ſagacity could have penetrated into the events which afterwards took place, every ſhadow of careleſſneſs and indiſcretion imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately diſappears.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="27" facs="unknown:034906_0132_0FFF945FEFA10228"/>In this ſituation were things then at the commencement of the revolution, which brought on an occluſion of the courts of juſtice, paper money, and a thouſand other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, until finally a law was paſſed which obliged the creditors, their factors and agents, to depart the country. So that it became impoſſible, by this additional act of government, even had they divined the neceſſity of it, to obtain further proofs of their debts, which they could not ſue for and reduce into poſſeſſion—1ſt. Becauſe there was an occluſion of the courts of juſtice—2d. Becauſe there was an expreſs inhibition to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in ſuits brought by Britiſh ſubjects—3d. Becauſe the creditor could only have recovered paper money, which would have been of no ſervice to him out of America; and here he was not allowed to uſe or employ it.</p>
                        <p>Hence if no alteration had been made in the law, it would not have been a chimerical inference in the creditors, that they would on the return of peace, have been allowed to prove their debts according to the exiſting modes at the time they were contracted. But flattering as this proſpect was, it was afterwards blaſted for ever; for, in the year 1779, the book-debt law was repealed; and although the repealing act has an excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with regard to goods ſold before, yet the Courts immediately began to depart from the liberality of the former practice, and held the plaintiff to the ſtrict letter of the book-debt law, in all caſes previous to the operation of the repealing ſtatute, and called on him for common law proof in all caſes ſubſequent to that ſtatute. So that it is now univerſally holden in all caſes before the State courts, that neither citizen or foreigner can eſtabliſh his claim by his own oath; and at a late court of the United States for the middle circuit and diſtrict of Virginia, it was expreſsly decided, that the plaintiff could not recover in a ſuit brought by him upon an open account which was only proved by his own oath, but that the delivery of the articles to the debtor muſt be proved by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſted teſtimony. Added to this, in the State court on whom alone the deciſion of all cauſes under five hundred dollars is devolved, and of theſe particularly the county courts, who have concurrent juriſdiction in all common plea caſes whatſoever, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive juriſdiction in all caſes under one hundred dollars, the difficulty would be greater ſtill: For even <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                           </gap> caſes ſupported by other evidence, the plaintiffs, ſometimes from the obſtinacy of the juries, and at other times from the reluctance of the courts, have been continually delayed, or their claims have been decided againſt them without regard to the merits of the caſe, merely on the ground of their being Britiſh debts.</p>
                        <p>Hence it has become morally certain, that no recovery can be had of the debtor for theſe claims, becauſe the law having been held to be out of force which allowed the plaintiffs to prove them by their own oaths, and the factors, agents, and ſtore-keepers who might in ſome inſtances have been able to have proved them having been driven out of the State; and being now dead, or diſperſed into different quarters of the world unknown, in much the greater part of the caſes, to the creditors, it is impoſſible to prove them according to the common law rules in a court of juſtice.</p>
                        <p>The claimants reſpectfully contend, that a change of the rules of evidence after the debts were contracted, ought not to affect the creditor, who only provided himſelf with ſuch evidence as the then exiſting laws and uſages required, and as it was not neceſſary for them to have witneſſes at that time it ought not now to be required; otherwiſe the treaty will have done nothing for them, ſince although the right to recover is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, yet the means are taken away by requiring teſtimony not foreſeen, and impoſſible to be procured.</p>
                        <p>The ninth caſe ſtated in the Anſwer (pa. 12.) as not relievable under the treaty, would not have been much conteſted if it had reſted at the firſt period; but the inſtance given in the latter part is ſo contradictory to what the claimants conceive to be an undeniable maxim, to wit "neither of the contracting powers has a right to interpret the treaty at his pleaſure," and would go to the entire cutting up of ſo large a portion of the claims which were intended to be compenſated, that the admiſſion would be making the greater

part of the treaty a dead letter. It is alſo inconſiſtent with another part of the Anſwer it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. In one caſe it is inſiſted, that the creditors muſt reſort in all caſes to the tribunals of the country, where they can only obtain a partial relief, before they can come before the Board for that part which cannot be recovered; and here it is inſiſted, that when they have reſorted to that tribunal, and obtained a verdict for that part of their demand which a jury may pleaſe to allow, they are to be concluded by the verdict, as to the amount, and can never be permitted to ſhew, that injuſtice has been done to them. In other words it is ſaying, that the courts and juries in Virginia, and in caſes of general verdicts <hi>juries alone,</hi> the friends and neighbours of the debtor, with every prejudice, if not reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt the creditor, are to be the excluſive judges on the conſtruction of the treaty of peace, that their ideas of equity and juſtice is to be binding on the conſciences of the Commiſſioners, and that if Judges, <hi>on a plea of payment to a bond,</hi> will admit evidence of the abſence of the creditor, though forced from the country by law, <hi>as a ſet-off,</hi> that the Britiſh ſubject muſt in all caſes ſubmit to it; this (to uſe the expreſſions of Congreſs already quoted, ſee pa. 8. <hi>anti.</hi>) "is a conſtruction which involves many inconveniences and abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, deſtroys an eſſential part of the power of war and peace entruſted to Congreſs, <hi>and would diſable the Congreſs of the United States, from giving ſatisfaction to foreign nations complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a violation of neutralities, of treaties, or other breaches of the law of nations, and would enable a jury in any one State,</hi> to involve the United States in hoſtilities; a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, which for theſe and many other reaſons, is inadmiſſible."</p>
                        <p>An inſtance in which the verdicts of juries has been peculiarly injurious to Britiſh creditors, ariſes from an act ſettling a ſcale of depreciation. It is true, that the ſche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules of debts due at the Brunſwick ſtore, contain no demand on this account; but the Claimants ſtated in their memorial, that they had ſeveral ſtores, and it was agreed that as many heads of real complaints as poſſible ſhould be brought forward for diſcuſſion in one claim. Under this agreement, and referring to it, the Agent of the United States omitted anſwering ſeveral points in the caſe of <hi>Oſwald Denniſtown, &amp; Co.</hi> to ſave repetition before the Board.</p>
                        <p>The whole of the debts due to the Claimants were contracted at a time of unſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting confidence; when debtor and creditor were ſubjects of the ſame Sovereign, and bound by the ſame laws, under the faith of which the credit was given. No depreci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of money was then known. In the year 1777, perſons of their deſcription were ordered, by proclamation, to quit Virginia in forty days. To collect their debts in that ſhort ſpace was impoſſible—they did what they could. From as many of their debtors as they met, who were willing to give, they obtained bonds for the balances due to them. In 1781, a law is paſſed, by which the ſums are directed to be reduced to two thirds of the debt bona fide contracted, and war intereſt deducted from that two thirds: Is this <hi>equity and juſtice? Is this full compenſation?</hi> Courts and juries may think ſo, or be bound to decide ſo in the United States, but debts due to Britiſh ſubjects are not to be legiſlated away, by acts to which they were no party. (Du Coſta <hi>v</hi> Cole, Skinner, 272) And as ſuch judgments are no compliance with the 4th article of the treaty of peace, the loſs ſuſtained by means of them are to be redreſſed under the 6th article of the treaty of amity.</p>
                        <p>But it is alledged (Anſw. pa. 41.) "that by judicial deciſions it has been ſettled in Virginia, that if a bond dated at any time between the 1ſt day of January 1777, and 1ſt day of January 1782, contains in the condition, or any part of it, any thing to ſhew the debt was originally contracted before the date of the bond, the depreciation law ſhall not be conſtrued to operate on ſuch a caſe; but if the bond has no ſuch intrinſic evidence of the time the debt was contracted, it is is liable to be ſcaled, and parole evidence is not admitted to alter the effect and purport of the ſealed inſtrument. <hi>Thus then, if the creditor omitted to take a bond ſo as to ſhew by ſomething in it, that it was probably to ſecure a debt contracted before the war, it was a wilful omiſſion in him,</hi> and if any loſs ariſes from hence, it is a loſs not intended by the treaty of 1794, to be charged on the United States."</p>

                        <p>Intereſt is recoverable upon contracts wherein intereſt is ſtipulated to be paid; upon merchandize according to the uſage of particular branches of trade, or of a ſpecial agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; upon goods ſold and delivered at a limited credit, after the expiration of the time of credit; upon money payable at a particular day, after that day is paſſed; upon money payable on demand, after demand proved; upon accounts after final ſettlement, and even upon accounts where no time of credit was ſpecified, if the delay has been long, and under vexatious and oppreſſive circumſtances.</p>
                        <p>This queſtion of intereſt will be examined upon general principle, becauſe, the occlu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of courts prevented a legal demand at one period, the baniſhment of the creditors or their factors rendered final ſettlements in moſt caſes impoſſible, the impediments ſince the peace have been vexatious, the deciſions reducing their bonds bearing intereſt, have been oppreſſive, the loſs upon their accounts for which bonds were not obtained, has been nearly total, and the expence of agents and factors for fourteen years paſt in endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to collect their debts, has been more than equal to all recovered.</p>
                        <p>The Claimants do not think it neceſſary to go back to the black letter deciſions in the reigns of the Stuarts, to diſcover whether <hi>intereſt</hi> was recoverable as debt or da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages; or to find out how judgments were entered, or what pleadings were faulty, a century ago. All the caſes, therefore, cited in the Anſwer from the 13th to the 20th page, will, (except one) be left as they are. The caſe in a Ventris, 198, is ſaid in the Anſwer to be "a judicial reſolution upon the very point, whether intereſt is reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable as debt," and as it was decided upon demurrer, it "<hi>therefore is of high autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi>" The caſe is ſhortly this. A teſtator borrowed a ſum of money, for which he gave his obligation to repay the ſame ſum with intereſt; a judgment was obtained on this obligation againſt the executor. Another ſuit, by another creditor, was afterwards brought againſt the executor, to which he pleaded that judgment, in which, the debt and intereſt at the time of the action brought, amounted to ſuch a ſum, &amp;c. ultra quae he had not to ſatisfy: Demurrer and judgment for the plaintiff. Lord Hale does make uſe of the expreſſions quoted in the Anſwer, (pa. 18) but as the real reaſon for the judgment is omitted in the Anſwer, it ſhall be inſerted in the Reply.

                        <p>From the ſeveral caſes cited in the Anſwer, the following concluſion is drawn: "If it be an axiom of the Engliſh law, as it is believed to be, that an <hi>action of debt</hi> lies for recovering every debt; and if ſuch an action of debt does not lie for intereſt, as has been ſhewn, then it follows, that in the eye of Engliſh law, intereſt is not debt."</p>
                        <p>In the eye of the Engliſh law, <hi>intereſt is debt</hi>; it is demandable as ſoon as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes <hi>due</hi> and <hi>payable; it is recoverable</hi> in an <hi>action of debt</hi> brought for <hi>intereſt alone,</hi> notwithſtanding the caſe in Ventris: For inſtance, if a ſum of money was lent for a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of years with intereſt, payable half yearly, the intereſt could not be recovered by aſſumpſit in damages for not paying the principal, becauſe the principal might not be due. And Lord Kenyon ſays, (5 term. R. 556) "<hi>The caſe cited from Ventris ought not to be treated ſlightly, or overturned without great conſideration, becauſe it has the ſanction of Lord Hale's name. But as at preſent adviſed, I confeſs it appears to me, that the reaſons given in ſupport of that judgment, are ſtrong to ſhow, that the deciſion ſhould have been the other way</hi>; for if it were rightly decided in that caſe, that an action of debt will not lie for intereſt, great injuſtice would be done in a variety of inſtances that might be put.

                        <p>Lord Hale in the caſe of Ventris, admits, that intereſt may be recovered in aſſumpſit, and it is a rule, that wherever <hi>indebit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Nor is the <hi>maxim</hi> laid down in the Anſwer, (pa. 19, 20) "that in an action of debt intereſt is recoverable for the damage occaſioned by detaining the debt," more cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect than the <hi>axiom.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In truth, intereſt is recoverable both in Great-Britain and the United States in one or the other of all the following forms.</p>
                        <p>In actions of debt on bonds with penalty, judgment is rendered for the penalty as the debt, to be releaſed on payment of the principal and intereſt due, and if there is a delay of payment beyond the time of judgment, the principal and intereſt form a new debt upon which intereſt is calculated.</p>
                        <p>In actions of debt without penalty, intereſt is given for detention, and judgment is rendered, (to preſerve old forms,) for ſo much debt and ſo much damages.</p>
                        <p>In actions on the caſe, both principal and intereſt are called damages, and judgment rendered for one ſum including both; and</p>
                        <p>Intereſt is recoverable in an action of debt, by itſelf, and in an action of aſſumpſit by itſelf, where the principle is not due.</p>
                        <p>But it is totally immaterial to the Claimants, in what form of action, or by what name intereſt is recoverable, or how judgment rolls are made up in different actions; to them it is ſufficient, that intereſt is <hi>money,</hi> and that it is <hi>due.</hi> Inſtead therefore of hunting through obſolete caſes for what was the ſtrict meaning of a word, not to be found in the 4th. article of the treaty, to wit, "<hi>intereſt,</hi>" the Claimants beg leave to examine into the meaning of a very important word in that article, <hi>debts.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In common parlance <hi>all debts</hi> muſt, and do mean, every ſum of money a man owes, whether principal or intereſt, whether by ſealed ſpecialty, bill, note, book-debt, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe expreſs or implied; whether recoverable by action of debt, covenant, aſſumpit, or even caſe for a quantum meruit; or againſt a common carrier for the value of goods loſt. If a note bearing intereſt is barred by an act of limitation, a promiſe to pay the debt will revive the remedy as to principal and intereſt. So, directions in a will to pay all the teſtator's juſt debts, has been held to revive the remedy for both principal and intereſt of debts which had been barred by length of time. It is in this common acceptation that the word was uſed in the treaty. In many inſtances, however, of this particular claim, if the ſtrict legal meaning of the word <hi>debt</hi> is adhered to, then the award, even deducting intereſt during the war, will far exceed the preſent demand. On failure of payment agreeably to the condition, the penalty became the debt in every caſe of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialties with penalty;—The penalty was the debt at the treaty of peace—The penalty is the ſum for which an action muſt be brought, and for which the Court are obliged to
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:034906_0136_0FFF946A734DF8E0"/>
render judgement; and (bound down to certain forms of proceeding) nominal damages muſt be given on that penalty, and if from length of time, the principal and intereſt exceed the penalty, the overplus intereſt is recoverable beyond the penalty. Formerly, Courts of Equity only could relieve againſt the penalty; modern ſtatutes have authorized Common Law Courts to relieve; but how? They render judgement for the penalty— to be releaſed on payment of <hi>principal and intereſt.</hi> Courts rendering judgements on other grounds are aſſuming Chancery powers not delegated to them.</p>
                        <p>It is to be wiſhed, that an accurate report of the caſe of Jones <hi>v</hi> Hylton, had been printed, as well as M'Call <hi>v</hi> Turner. In that cauſe Chief Juſtice Jay preſided, and delivered in the moſt expreſs and pointed terms, the opinion of the Court, that full in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt ſhould be recovered. The jury were ſent out more than once, but perſiſted in the deduction. In the caſe of Hamilton <hi>v</hi> Eaton, the jury of enquiry found a ſpecial ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, by which the queſtion of war intereſt was left to the Court, and decided in favour of the plaintiff.</p>
                        <p>One circumſtance here requires remark. Whenever a Claimant grounds his Claim upon an impediment, created by the judgement of the higheſt State Court, the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of an appeal to the dernier reſort is inſiſted upon. Here, however, the caſe of M'Call <hi>v</hi> Turner is relied upon, in oppoſition to the decided opinion of the Judges who compoſe that Superior Court. It belongs not excluſively to the Courts of either Country to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret treaties. If they differ, no inference but what ariſes from the force, the reaſon of their arguments, can be drawn. Where the ſupreme judicial authority of both agree in opinion, that opinion is of the greateſt weight.</p>
                        <p>It has been endeavoured in the Anſwer, (pa. 14.) to draw an inference from an extract of a letter from the American Commiſſioners to Mr. Hartly, dated Paſſy, July 17th. 1783, in ſupport of the poſition, that war intereſt ſhould not be allowed. The Claimant makes no exception to it, but he believes, that if the preſent was a diſcuſſion before the higheſt Court of Law of Equity, either in Great Britain or the United States, the Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges would not liſten to ſuch an argument. The anſwer would be—
<q>We are bound by our oaths to judge upon the words of the inſtrument, as it is before us—Our conſciences are not to be guided by the correſpondence of the Miniſters on either ſide—If the Commiſſioners on both ſides were preſent we could not examine them—Who ever heard of legiſlators be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing call'd upon to explain the meaning they affix'd to words? <hi>'Tis theirs to legiſlate, to us belongs the interpretation of their acts.</hi>
                           </q>
As the letter or extract is before the Board it will be obſerved upon, and one undeniable poſition being ceded, it is thought a concluſion, diametrically oppoſite to that of the Attorney General, will be fairly drawn.</p>
                        <p>The proviſional articles which were to form the baſis of the definitive treaty of peace were ſigned the 30th of November, 1782. They laid the foundation of peace and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation—They were to be inſerted in and conſtitute the treaty of peace. Whatever therefore was meant by the 4th proviſional article, muſt be the meaning of the 4th arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the definitive treaty. This is the poſition not to be denied. Theſe articles were ſent over to Congreſs: They knew the meaning of the word <hi>debt,</hi> and that it included intereſt and principal: Satisfactory as the articles muſt have been, ſtill Congreſs wiſhed for ſomething more. From the circumſtances of the country at the cloſe of the war, they thought it reaſonable that time ſhould be given for payment, and a deduction of intereſt agreed to, and inſtructed their Miniſters accordingly.</p>
                        <p>For what purpoſe then was the letter of July 17th, 1783, written? To obtain an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of the article. In what points? In order that inſtalments might be ſettled, and a deduction of intereſt agreed to. Was this amendment obtained? No. What is the conſequence? That inſtalment laws and deductions of intereſt were a violation of the treaty. To recur to the argument on this point.—"After this, if war intereſt was meant to be claimed on the part of Great Britain, ſome unequivocal terms ſhould have been
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:034906_0137_0FFF946C612D0AC0"/>
uſed, comprehending it; and the not uſing ſuch terms, is an acquieſcence in the opinion entertained by Congreſs, which had been communicated by the American negociators of the treaty." Let this inference be contraſted by maxims, and it will at once fall to the ground. If he who can, and ought "to have explained himſelf clearly and plainly, has not done it, it is the worſe for him; he can not be allowed to introduce ſubſequent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions, which he has not expreſſed." To this authority from Vattel, the Claimants will add a maxim from a writer equally reſpectable: "All contracts are to be taken according to the intent of the parties, expreſſed by their own words, and if there be any doubt in the ſenſe of the words, ſuch interpretation muſt be made, as is moſt ſtrong againſt the grantor or obligor, that he may not by obſcure wording of the contract, find means to evade or elude it."</p>
                        <p>The Claimants believe the 4th article was, as its terms expreſs it to be "<hi>reciprocal.</hi>" If the contrary is the caſe, as contended for, the United States are the grantors, the obligors, and for the moſt valuable of all conſiderations: Their country was diſcovered by Britons, peopled by Britons, and during its infancy and weakneſs, had been guarded and protected by the blood and treaſure of Britain. It is true, that as the Colonies matured in ſtrength and vigour, they were in a fair way of repaying, by an almoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive commerce, even if they had not actually repaid, the debt of protection. But if at the cloſe of a civil war, they demanded and obtained the acknowledgment of their Independence, and the ceſſion of an immenſe territory unoccupied by citizens of the United States, granted by the Aborigines to the Crown, and in an extenſive line join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing other poſſeſſions of that Crown; and in lieu of this acknowledgment and ceſſion, they covenanted, that all debts contracted in a time of mutual confidence, ſhould be paid, the United States are grantors and obligors for a valuable conſideration, and can not by any ſubſequent reſtriction of the meaning of any word in their contract, leſſen the force of their obligation.</p>
                        <p>There are ſtronger objections to any argument being drawn againſt the Claimants from Lord Carmarthen's converſation, than from the Commiſſioners correſpondence. Courts of law will not admit parole teſtimony to contradict a deed; and ſurely converſation is not to contradict a treaty. But what is the purport of it? Two years after the negocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the treaty had fruitleſsly endeavoured to have the fourth article amended, ſo as to admit of inſtalments and a deduction of intereſt, the ſame ſubject is broached, but the expreſſions are widely different, and in both caſes correct.</p>
                        <p>While the negociation was yet open, and there was a poſſibility of an alteration being made, the language is, "Congreſs think it reaſonable that the <hi>intereſt which may have accrued during the war, ſhall not be payable.</hi> In June, 1786, Mr. Jay urges the policy of <hi>giving up the intereſt during the war,</hi> thereby plainly allowing the right to demand it, although the United States may have thought it impolitic and ſevere to exert that right. Mr. Jay's deciſions as Chief Juſtice of the United States, corroborate this conſtruction. Lord Carmarthen's ideas of treaſon, do not appear extremely correct; and the Clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mants, yielding in loyalty to none of their fellow-ſubjects, would have thought it no crime to have received their debts during the war; but his Lordſhip's ſlight expreſſions concerning the intereſt, and his wiſhes that the courts were open for recovering the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal, were a very mild reproof upon the inſtalment and other laws infringing the treaty. As to intereſt being left to after conſideration, that has been the caſe. Inſtalment laws, deductions of intereſt, treaſury payments, and a variety of other impediments, have been the ſubject of after negociation and treaty.</p>
                        <p>The firſt clauſe only of the ſixth article of that treaty, which ſpeaks of <hi>bona fide debts</hi> contracted before the peace, and loſſes and damages occaſioned by impediments and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvencies, has been inſerted in the Anſwer to the claim of Cunningham and Company. If the article had reſted at the end of the firſt clauſe, it might with as much reaſon be urged, that no intereſt at all ſhould be allowed—that when the whole debt was loſt by
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:034906_0138_0FFF946F1B246128"/>
inſolvency, the original ſum due, ſhould be the full compenſation; and where a partial inſolvency happened, the only damage or loſs was to be the difference of the ſum reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered and the original debt. <hi>Debts bona fide contracted</hi> before the peace, and <hi>bona fide debts contracted</hi> before the peace, mean one and the ſame thing—both include intereſt, or neither does.</p>
                        <p>The general tenor of the intereſt argument ſufficiently accounts for the omiſſion of, and total ſilence upon, a latter clauſe of the 6th article of the treaty of amity, in the Anſwer to Cunningham's claim: As it contradicts nothing, but ſupports every thing ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in this Reply, the ſame reaſon for ſilence does not apply. It will be obſerved upon.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The conſtruction on the 7th article of the treaty of peace formerly contended for, has been abandoned, and the true conſtruction of the 4th article, has been ſolemnly ſettled by negociation. All queſtions on the former being now at reſt for ever, it will here be only remarked, that however proper the ſubject was for diſcuſſion between Mr. Jefferſon and Mr. Hammond in 1792, there was no neceſſity for any alluſion to it, either in the deciſion of M'Call <hi>v</hi> Turner, or in the Anſwer to the memorial of the Claimants. Not the moſt diſtant imputation is meant to be made upon the integrity and virtue of the Judges who decided that caſe; but the legality and propriety of the deciſion may be canvaſſed and denied without a ſhadow of diſreſpect to them. The great Lord Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicke, after full argument, and long conſideration, decided an important cauſe; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hearing was afterwards had, and having taken a twelvemonth's time to conſider, he reverſed his own decree, concluding with this obſervation: "<hi>Theſe are the reaſons which induced me to alter my opinion, and I am not aſhamed of doing it; for I always thought it a much greater reproach to a Judge to continue in his error than retract it.</hi>" Many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks might be made upon the deciſion in M'Call <hi>v</hi> Turner, but they will (except one) be avoided. Preſident Pendleton, after declaring, that intereſt during the war ought to be deducted, ſays, "<hi>The opinion of the Chief Juſtice of the United States in a caſe (Jones</hi> v <hi>Hylton) before the Federal Court, was cited, in which he is ſtated to have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the jury a charge differing from the opinion I have juſt expreſſed, but I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur with him.</hi>" In the Anſwer (pa. 38) the caſe of Jones <hi>v</hi> Hylton is mentioned, and this remark is made: "<hi>To this judgment all the Inferior Courts are bound in duty to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, and it is believed actually do conform.</hi>" Juries are ſworn to give verdicts according to their evidence; the opinion of the Court is their evidence what the law of the land is; —<hi>They diſregard it.</hi> Inferior Courts are bound in duty to conform to the judgment of Superior Courts, <hi>but they cannot concur.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The obſervations in the Anſwer, (pa. 25 &amp; ſeq.) do not require reply. <hi>Damages done in war,</hi> and <hi>intereſt occurred during a war,</hi> are too widely different to be compared to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, or to have inferences drawn from the law of nations reſpecting one, applied to the other; in the authorities cited, they are oppoſed to each other. On a peace, da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages done in war, whether to public or private property, are to be buried in oblivion, theſe being <hi>the effects of war</hi>; but debts retain their full force.</p>
                        <p>Here the Claimants reſt the queſtion of intereſt during the war, with only one remark, That however diſpoſed they might themſelves have been to indulgence and ſome allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, if they could have obtained payment of their debts at the peace, it is not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to expect them now—nor are they to be bound by what others have done, "<hi>Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libet poteſt renunciari jure pro ſe introducto.</hi>"</p>

                        <p n="2">2. That the treaty of peace did not, of itſelf, by its own mere power, repeal thoſe impediments; and that the Legiſlature of Virginia, who alone had the power, refuſed to repeal them.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That even if the plauſible theory of the repealing power of the treaty was as cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and ſound, as it is unſound, or at moſt, doubtful; yet, as the general opinion of the Legiſlature and people of Virginia, and the practice of the Courts was the other way, no fault is imputable to the Claimants.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. That there are impediments yet exiſting, which even the Federal Courts cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move, as they are obliged to determine according to the laws of the State: Theſe ariſe from the lapſe of time, which is againſt the Claimants, altho' the Courts were ſhut to them, ſo that in every inſtance, where their books are all their evidence, judgment muſt be given againſt them; in caſes where other evidence can be produced, the act of limitations is a bar, altho' it would not have been a bar, could the Claimants have ſued at the peace; and in all caſes, where bonds were taken in 1777, for debts due years before, they are reduced by a ſcale, which the Claimants could not foreſee, and which was paſſed ſeveral years after taking the bonds. That as full compenſation can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in the ordinary courſe of judicial proceedings be actually had for ſuch loſſes, the United States have agreed to make it. That the General Government is alone anſwerable for any violation of treaties; and that if the State Governments ſuffered legal impediments to remain, and in conſequence, the claims of creditors have been delay'd, and the common law evidence to ſupport ſuch claims loſt by the delay, or ſtatutes of limitation had run againſt them, the General Government cannot avail itſelf of theſe circumſtances; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this would be firſt to violate a compact by delaying a claim till the evidence of it was loſt, and then to avail themſelves of that act which they had created.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. That proof of the actual inſolvency of debtors at the peace, would, in almoſt every inſtance, be impoſſible, and that it is not required of the Claimants.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. That where inſolvency, omiſſion, or any other cauſe, is alledged to have equally operated to produce the loſs, that is the defence of the United States and muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by proof.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. That the claimants are entitled to full intereſt on their demands, and that they are not to wait the event of ſuits until years after the Commiſſion ſhall be broken up.</p>
                        <p>It remains now to be ſhewn, how each particular claſs of demands annexed to the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial in this particular claim, comes within the true intent, ſpirit and meaning of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of amity, and on what grounds the Claimants demand payment of the ſeveral ſums ſet forth in the ſeveral liſts. In the Anſwer on behalf of the United States, (pa. 60.) a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark is made upon the liſt of debts, which might have been ſpared; The Claimants are not hurt by it; Conſcious of their own integrity, they do not believe any imputation was intended to be caſt upon them; indeed the whole tenor of the Anſwer forbids them to entertain an idea of the kind.
<q>It is ſaid while ſuch demands furniſh a proof <hi>of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme

care</hi> with which the Claimants <hi>have been gleaning their books and papers,</hi> they are liable to this objection, that the two nations never contemplated ſuch to be ſubjects to the awards of the Commiſſioners</q>
The Claimants have been gleaning no books and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers—It was the conſtant practice with the reſident factors of the mercantile houſes in Scotland who had retail ſtores in Virginia, to make out once in every year and tranſmit to their employers, correct liſts of all outſtanding debts, divided into three claſſes, bad, doubtful, and good—The factors knew every individual in the neighbourhood of the ſtores, and the ſtatements thus made could be relied upon. If they could ever have been diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to diſhoneſty, they would have added to the <hi>bad</hi> from the doubtful, and to the doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful from the good, becauſe they had allowances for bad and doubtful debts, bringing forward this liſt therefore, omitting only thoſe which were bad in 1775, and thoſe who have paid ſince the peace, is acting in the faireſt and moſt candid manner. The liſts alſo furniſh full proof of the induſtry of the factor in collecting, and the punctuality of the neighbourhood in paying before the war—No old longſtanding debts appear—none barred by the act of limitations; none which could not be proved agreeably to the book debt law—But it is ſaid the demands are too ſmall to be ſubject to the award of the Board —
<q>that the maxim <hi>de minimis non curat lex,</hi> and the honor and dignity of the nations dictate their excluſion.</q>
—If this is ſo, the Claimants muſt be the ſufferers; for they cannot fabricate books for large debts, when only ſmall ones are due.—But the anſwer it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf affords the Claimants the beſt Reply, "The principles of equity are the ſame whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the debt be one ſhilling or one hundred pounds"—And although, if burthenſome and expenſive proof of every ſmall claim could be required of the Claimants, they might think it beneath the dignity of a great nation to inſiſt upon the production of that proof, and if inſiſted upon, might in many inſtances abandon, rather than purſue the demand, they alſo think, that the burthen of the proof is on the other ſide, and that it is more conſiſtent with the dignity of a nation to pay than contend for trifles.—As there is no power in the Board to liſten and agree to compromiſes, the Claimants muſt contend for principles.</p>

Their accounts were kept in pounds, ſhillings, and pence, and at preſent, a leſs number of dollars make one hundred pounds than at the time the debts were contracted; this is an impediment to a recovery of the full value, and creates a loſs and damage in the debtor. The firſt queſtion of intereſt has been fully argued. All arguments that could apply to loſſes occaſioned by the depreciation law, will apply to difference of cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency.

                  <p>THE agent for the United States regrets that he finds himſelf under the neceſſity of again troubling the board upon the ſubject of the claim of Daniel Dulany. The reply contains ſome poſitions and obſervations not before urged, which are of real importance and ought not to go unanſwered. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains others, which, whether true or not in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, need not and therefore will not be contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.</p>
                  <p>The material facts in this caſe, according to the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legations of the claimant, to be found in his original claim and ſubſequent reply, may be ſtated as follows:</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="4" facs="unknown:034906_0144_0FFF94802122D960"/>Ann Taſker, ſome years before the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the revolution war, departed this life, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of a very conſiderable eſtate, of which a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal part, to the value of £42,000 ſterling was in cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dits, evidenced by bonds and otherwiſe. By her will ſhe deviſed various pecuniary legacies of the value of £28,000 ſterling, appointed Daniel Dulany the elder, ſole executor, and his ſon Daniel Dulany the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, reſiduary legatee. The debts were all contracted and payable in the then colony, now ſtate of Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, where Ann Taſker, as well as the debtors and executor, reſided. The executor undertook the truſt, and died in opulent circumſtances in the year 1796. The reſiduary legatee was and always has been a real Britiſh ſubject, and the debtors to Ann Taſker, as well as her executor, became citizens of the ſtate of Maryland when the ſeparation of the two countries took effect. During the war the debtors fully paid to the executor, their debts in the lawful money of the ſtate, which was depreciated at the time of payment, in ſo much, that upon the ſum of £12,559 1 8 ſterling, which was thus received, the loſs was £10,344 8 7 ſterling, the real value of the money being £3655 11 5, according to the ſcale of depreciation afterwards eſtabliſhed by law in that ſtate. For this difference £10,344 8 7 ſterling, the reſiduary legatee now applies for payment from the United States, alledging it ought to be awarded to him under the treaty of 1794, in as much as no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery can be had of it, either from the executor, or from the original debtors, who have received acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances in full from the executor. An act of the ſtate of Maryland was in full force at the time of payment,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:034906_0145_0FFF9481A4C6DB20"/>
making the money a legal tender. The neceſſary proofs for eſtabliſhing this ſtatement to the ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the board, the agent for the United States in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts ſhould be produced by the claimant. If theſe proofs ſhall be produced he then contends the caſe is not relievable under the treaty of 1794.</p>
                  <p>In the anſwer to the claim of William Cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham and Company, the agent for the United States diſcuſſed a variety of propoſitions, ſome of which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the preſent claim; ſuch as that the juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the arbitrators was limited, and that the claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant is bound to prove every matter eſſential to his caſe to bring it within the relief of the treaty. He alſo endeavoured to lay down the true interpretation of the 4th article of the treaty of peace, and the 6th ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the treaty of amity, to explain their connection with each other, and to prove that the latter was confined to compenſation in ſuch caſes only where loſſes had happened by reaſon of the operation of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal impediments contrary to the former. Upon theſe ſeveral heads as well as relative to intereſt during the war, he begs leave to refer the board to the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments which have been there uſed. The caſe which has been ſtated preſents for conſideration theſe poſitions;</p>
                  <p n="1">1ſt. That the claimant was always, and is now a real Britiſh ſubject.</p>
                  <p n="2">2dly. That he was the reſiduary legatee of Ann Taſker, and for the actual reſiduum, which exiſted in out-ſtanding debts was a creditor until the debts were paid.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="6" facs="unknown:034906_0146_0FFF948328D02E60"/>3dly. That the reſiduum was £14,000 ſterling.</p>
                  <p n="4">4th. That the debts were contracted in Maryland, where, when a colony, a legiſlative power over its internal affairs was exerciſed, and where the laws regulated the mode of fulfilling and diſcharging con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts there made as in an independent ſtate.</p>
                  <p n="5">5th. That Ann Taſker, the creditor, as well as her executor, and all the debtors were inhabitants of Maryland when the debts were contracted, and ſo continued always.</p>
                  <p n="6">6th. That the debts were fully paid by the debtors to the authorized agent of the creditor, who accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the money in payment, gave acquitances, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered up the bonds.</p>
                  <p n="7">7th. That the acceptance of the money might have been refuſed, and if it had been the legal effect of the refuſal would have been a legal queſtion.</p>
                  <p n="8">8th. That the executor, unleſs he committed a breach of truſt in receiving the payment, cannot be charged with the loſs by depreciation, nor the debt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors who have fully and legally diſcharged their debts, ſo that this loſs muſt remain with the claimant unleſs the United States under the treaties of peace and of amity ſhall be made reſponſible.</p>
                  <p n="9">9th. That the difference between the ſterling value of the money in which the debt was contracted, and the ſterling value of the money in which it was paid, forms the ſum which is claimed from the United States.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="unknown:034906_0147_0FFF94859DC4FCA8"/>The agent for the United States contends that ſuch a claim cannot be maintained before the board, who have no authority to award payment by the United States in a caſe ſo circumſtanced, and therefore any ſuch award will be void. The principle on which the defence of the United States reſts, againſt a claim of this deſcription is,
<q>that whenever a debt is completely ſatisfied according to the laws of the country where the debt was contracted, and to be paid, by the payment of the debtor to the creditor, or his authorized agent which has been accepted, it is a final diſcharge.</q>
This, as a general principle, cannot be denied. In the caſe reported by Brown 376, it is expreſsly affirmed by the Lord Chancellor that <hi>if a tranſaction is legally ſatisfied in the country where it aroſe</hi> nothing is left for equity to do. This adjudication related to a contract made before the war in South Carolina, evidenced by bond, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſatisfied there by a payment in paper money at the legal nominal value in that ſtate during the war. Whether the creditor was or was not a real Britiſh ſubject does not appear, and though he were, the principal of lexloci, as to contracts, has the ſame operation. If a Britiſh ſubject will go into Ruſſia, and there make a contract with a Ruſſian, and the contract is ſatisfied according to the laws of Ruſſia, the ſatisfaction is final and concluſive according to the juriſprudence of England. Before the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if any Engliſhman or Scotſman ſhould have gone from London or Edinburg into the colony of Maryland, and there given a credit, or contracted a debt, a ſatisfaction there according to the local laws of the colony, would have been deemed a compleat
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:034906_0148_0FFF9489E863EF70"/>
ſatisfaction in every court at Weſtminſter. Under the colonial ſyſtem as well as ſince the independence of Maryland, the legiſlature could make a paper mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney current and a tender in payment, of debts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted within its limits. In many colonies before the war, ſuch as Pennſylvania, Virginia, New Jerſey, Maſſachuſetts, &amp;c. &amp;c. there was a paper currency. The 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th particulars above reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, deſerve to be well conſidered, as they contain the grounds of the defence in this caſe; and the 1ſt, 2nd, 3rd and 9th are ſubmitted, with ſuch proofs as may be offered concerning them.</p>
                  <p>The 4th article of the treaty of peace is the baſis of the 6th article of the treaty of Amity. The form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er never meant to annul or ſet aſide, in whole or in part, any compleat payments which had legally been made to, and excepted by the creditor.</p>
                  <p>A manifeſt difference exiſts between payments to a ſtate and payments to a creditor. If the former <hi>aſſumed</hi> authority to receive payment it alſo abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted what was ſo done by the proviſion in the treaty. In all adjudications reſpecting confiſcations or pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments into the ſtate treaſuries, it was taken as a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, that the creditor had never accepted the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and was not bound by it. But if a creditor is not bound by his own act in accepting payment ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the laws of the place, where the contract was made, and where it was to be fulfilled, what is there can bind him? It was by the acts of debtor and creditor that the debt was originally contracted, and it has ſince been paid by the one and accepted by the other; the contracts are equally valid, that which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:034906_0149_0FFF948C57B390E0"/>
the debt and that which diſcharged it. It is not therefore to be ſuppoſed that the 4th article of the treaty of 1783 was intended to ſet aſide pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments accepted by the creditors themſelves, under an idea that ſuch payments were legal impediments. The impediment ariſing from the receipt of the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor is an impediment of fact, an impediment which could not have been without his concurrence. Can it be reaſonably ſuppoſed that this article was intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to open and unſettle the numberleſs liquidations and payments to which the parties, debtor and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor had agreed? By the 6th article of the treaty of 1794 the United States can be liable in no caſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, unleſs the loſs has ariſen from ſome legal im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments which have prevented a due recovery of the debts in purſuance of the treaty of peace, and loſſes of this ſpecial deſcription only are referred to arbitration. This is fully illuſtrated in the caſe of Cunningham and Company, to which the agent of the United States prays leave to refer.</p>
                  <p>If this view of the two treaties be correct, and if payment to, and acceptance by a creditor according to law, be not a legal impediment intended to be remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the 4th article of the treaty of peace, it follows that in caſes where payments in paper money have been accepted by creditors, the loſſes, if any, are not reparable under either treaty, but muſt lie as they have fallen.</p>
                  <p>According to this doctrine, if in the preſent caſe, the bonds had been aſſigned to the claimant by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutor, and if the claimant had accepted payment in
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:034906_0150_0FFF948EDF34DC70"/>
paper money he would not be relievable under the treaty of 1794.</p>
                  <p>There is no difference between the acceptance of the creditor himſelf and the acceptance of an autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized agent. The executor received full authority by the will of the teſtatrix, who died before the war, to receive payment of theſe debts, and he alone was legally authorized to receive payment.—When re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, the executor held the money paid to him in the character of truſtee for the legatees. If in the hands of the truſtee, the money depreciated without his fault, the loſs will fall on the ceſtuique truſt for which he has no remedy, and which properly may be termed a misfortune.</p>
                  <p>But if the executor has committed a breach of truſt either in accepting payment as the claimant, in his reply, ſeems to intimate, by declaring him
<q>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceps criminis,</q>
or by any other act, then the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutor was reſponſible for it, and his repreſentatives may now be made to repair the wrong in the ordinary courſe of judicial proceedings in Maryland, for let it be recollected that the claimant repreſents him as having died fully ſufficient and ſolvent to make good the loſs here claimed from the United States.</p>
                  <p>There is a manifeſt and eſſential difference between the confiſcation of a debt belonging to an enemy by a ſovereign, and the payment of a debt by a debtor to an enemy creditor, which he accepts. The hazard that is run of loſing the debt entirely, by the laws of war, as it may be taken away during the war by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcation, and may not be reſtored by the terms of
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:034906_0151_0FFF94915ADF97C8"/>
the peace, may induce the creditor to accept ſpecific commodities at an over-rated value, or a depreciated paper currency in payment. If under ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, the creditor or his agent accepts in full pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a thing not one half the value of the debt, it is his own contract that ought to bind him in reaſon, and therefore in equity alſo.</p>
                  <p>Confiſcation is a lawful appropriation to public uſe of the property of an individual who offends the ſtate, or who is an open enemy. This property may be reſtored by the ſovereign without interfering with the rights of a third perſon. In the caſe of debtor and creditor where payment has been accepted, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration cannot be made without infringing directly or indirectly private rights. Though then it be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted that the 4th article of the treaty of peace ſets aſide the confiſcation of debts, it does not alſo follow that it ſets aſide payments accepted by the creditor or his authorized agent, in a depreciated current money.</p>
                  <p>The ſtate of Maryland confiſcated no part of the debts due to the teſtatrix, Ann Taſker, but in the confiſcation laws, the debts were expreſsly excepted. This exception proves the ſenſe of Maryland, that a debt paid in depreciated money, was not conſidered as a confiſcation. The claimant ſeems to contend that there is no difference between payment in depreciated paper and a confiſcation; that the former is a confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in another form. The difference, it is hoped, has been ſhewn; the former cannot take place with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the participation of the creditor or his agent; the latter is effected independently of ſuch participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In the former caſe, when the money is receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:034906_0152_0FFF9494B146DA58"/>
according to law, the debtor is diſcharged, and it does not concern him whether a profit or a loſs is made out of it by the creditor. The debt is paid according to the laws of the country, where, by the original contract, it ought to have been paid; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative to payments ſo made, the laws bind an alien as firmly as a citizen. In whatever light, therefore, the claimant may be conſidered, whether as an alien or as a citizen of Maryland (and in one or other of theſe lights he muſt be conſidered after the 4th day of July, 1776) the tender law made in 1777 by Maryland, muſt operate on the debts <hi>contracted and payable there.</hi> It is hoped it will not ſeriouſly be diſputed that Maryland was an independent ſtate in the year 1777, for even the Lord Chancellor and the maſter of the Rolls of England have openly affirmed it. Wright and Nutt Henry Blackſtone's reports 154. This was a caſe between a Britiſh ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and a citizen of South Carolina. The ſame opinion is declared by Lord Loughborough, in the caſe of Folliott and Ogden. Henry Blackſtone's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports 135.
<q>A civil war breaks the bonds of ſociety and government, or at leaſt ſuſpends their force and effects. It produces in the nation two independent parties, conſidering each other as enemies, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging no common judge; therefore, of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, theſe two parties muſt be conſidered at leaſt for a time, as forming two ſeparate bodies, two diſtinct people.</q>

                  <p>
                     <q>But when a nation becomes divided into two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, abſolutely independent, and no longer acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging a common ſuperior, the ſtate is diſſolved, and
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:034906_0153_0FFF949727026F58"/>
the war betwixt the two parties, in every reſpect, is the ſame with that of a public war between two different nations.</q>
Vattel B. 3. Sect. 295.</p>
                  <p>It has been ſaid by the claimant, that upon the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance of an empire into two parts, if one ſubject adhere to one part, and another to the other, neither part can annul the contract between the two indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals. It is however aſſerted, that each part having become a ſovereign independent ſtate, has compleat power, if a war ſubſiſts, to appropriate the contract to its ſelf, by the rights of war, and to make laws that reach all contracts made and to be fulfilled within its limits, as well thoſe between its own ſubjects as aliens.</p>
                  <p>The claimant need not have taken any trouble to aſſert that
<q>if one empire is ſubdivided and forms two, the debts contracted, prior to that event, ſtill are to be ſatisfied.</q>
This is fully anſwered by the fact of the caſe, for the debts have been ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied according to the laws of the country where they were to be paid, and this ſatisfaction is valid every where. Nor though it be admitted that ſuch debts could not be confiſcated or extinguiſhed by a legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive act of the ſtate, does it follow that payments made and accepted in the money of the country, declared a legal tender, ſhall not avail as compleat ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>It is aſſerted by the claimant,
<q>that the ſtate of Maryland was bound in good faith, ſo to modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy its laws, as to enable him to recover the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence here claimed, and as that has not been done, and perhaps cannot conſtitutionally be done, that he is now entitled to compenſation under the 6th
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:034906_0154_0FFF9498C8E85988"/>
article of the treaty of amity.</q>
To this it is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered that no ſuch modification was neceſſary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the treaty of peace not only repealed all legal impediments which had been created to the recovery of the full value in ſterling money, of debts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore contracted, but was always conſidered in that ſtate as the ſupreme law of the land, which no act of the ſtate, either before or ſince the peace, could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travene or invalidate. Therefore, this cannot be a ſufficient ground for demanding compenſation from the United States under the treaty of amity. If how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, a payment accepted by the creditor, be a legal impediment within this treaty, which is not admitted, but denied on the part of the United States; and if it has been annulled, recourſe ſhould be had to the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal debtors, who are ſtill ſolvent for the difference in value between the money due and the money paid.</p>
                  <p>The agent for the United States acknowledges that he expreſſed himſelf inaccurately when he ſaid that the treaty of 1794 contemplated no remedy, except what was given by the treaty of 1785; <hi>he meant to have ſaid that the treaty of</hi> 1794 <hi>contemplated no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy except for a loſs that had been occaſioned to the creditor in conſequence of the operation of ſome legal impediment, contravening the treaty of</hi> 1783, <hi>and without any fault or laches on his part.</hi> Admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that the treaty of peace ſhall be conſtrued to annul the confiſcations of debts as being a kind of legal impediment meant to be removed; if there is a real difference between debts confiſcated and debts paid to the creditors or their agents, duly authorized,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:034906_0155_0FFF949D279FC898"/>
which it is hoped has been ſatisfactorily ſhewn, any argument concerning the former is to be conſidered as irrelative to the latter.</p>
                  <p>It is alſo aſſerted by the claimant, that however the ſtate might paſs laws to bind its own citizens, it could not paſs laws to bind a ſubject of Great Britain. To theſe an anſwer has been given, and here it is repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that a ſtate, by the laws of nations as recognized by the Engliſh law, has a right to paſs laws that ſhall <hi>govern all contracts made and to be fulfilled within its territory;</hi> and ſuch laws bind all perſons, as well the ſubjects or citizens as foreigners or aliens. A law of this kind is compulſory on all, and foreigners have no right to expect a different law concerning their contracts made and to be fulfilled in the ſtate, than the ſubjects enjoy in the like caſes.</p>
                  <p>Againſt this propoſition, nothing urged by the claimant will be found to militate. But it will be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious that it has been avoided, and that the arguments as well as the authorities, on which the claimant has relied, are beſide, and do not meet the principle on which the defence of the United States has been placed.</p>
                  <p>The claimants ſeem to rely on a deciſion in the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit court of the United States, which he has cited as applicable in his favour. The contract was made in the ſtate of Pennſylvania, for a ſum of money to be paid in France, where the parties intended payment to be made in ſpecie and not in paper medium called aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignats. It was decided that the creditor was not bound to <hi>accept</hi> the paper. This deciſion is legal and
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:034906_0156_0FFF949F979D49C0"/>
juſt, but in two points the facts of this caſe differ from the caſe of the claimant. 1ſt. The contract was made in one ſtate, to be performed in another. 2d. The aſſignats were not accepted in pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Suppoſe the aſſignats had been accepted in payment by the holders of the bill in France, let it be aſked whether the drawer would not have been forever, and every where diſcharged. Undoubtedly he would.</p>
                  <p>The like doctrine is eſtabliſhed in the other caſe cited by the claimant, Da Coſta, vs. Cole Skinner 272, which is conſequently entitled to the like anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer. There too, payment was not actually accepted in the leſſened money of Portugal, but payment was refuſed becauſe the parties did not contemplate any change in the value of the money, and the drawer and payee were both Britiſh ſubjects.</p>
                  <p>The queſtion in this caſe was not on the validity of a payment accepted in leſſened money, but how the payments ought to have been made.</p>
                  <p>The claimant has alſo quoted the ſentiments of Judge Sitgreaves, in the caſe of Hamilton, vs. Eaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, in the circuit court of North Carolina, which need not be queſtioned on the preſent occaſion, and perhaps on no other. They ſeemed not to furniſh any oppoſition to the preſent defence.</p>
                  <p>It is thus the agent of the United States has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to anſwer thoſe obſervations of the claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant which have appeared to him moſt material, and
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:034906_0157_0FFF94A11A664148"/>
to ſupport the propoſition that a loſs ariſing from the payment, by a citizen, of a debt due to a Britiſh ſubject, before the war, in a depreciated currency, the lawful money of the ſtate where the debt had been contracted, and was payable when a colony, which payment the creditor or his agent, has accepted, is not a loſs that can be awarded to be paid by the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited States, under the treaty of 1794, and with great deference his arguments are ſubmitted to the conſideration of the commiſſioners.</p>

                  <head>In the Caſe of Daniel Dulany.</head>
                  <p>FOR the purpoſe of having a ſubject of ſo much importance, as the <hi>general</hi> queſtion which occurs in this caſe, maturely conſidered, on full diſcuſſion and argument,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ordered,</hi> that the agent for the United States have leave, within eight days, to lay before the Board ſuch further argument as he may think pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, for obviating the points ſuggeſted in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing queſtions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1ſt. It has been ſtated on the part of the United States,<note place="margin">See Anſwer, &amp;c. in Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury's caſe.</note> that the effect of the "<hi>conceſſion</hi>" made by the treaty on their part was "<hi>to revive</hi>" debts which were held to be ſatisfied; and in the caſe of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments into the treaſury, before the peace, it never has been diſputed that the creditor is entitled to a remedy under the treaty, although it was adjudged in the laſt reſort, and held to be a law, that by ſuch payments into the treaſury, purſuant to an act of the ſtate declaring the debt to be thereby extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, it was accordingly ſo extinguiſhed and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied at law. Is it not, therefore, clearly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by both parties, as a principle, that a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge or extinction of the debt at law before the
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:034906_0159_0FFF94A6283D7F98"/>
treaty, is not <hi>of itſelf</hi> a bar to the remedy thereby provided; but that it muſt alſo appear to have been ſuch an extinction and diſcharge as proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the <hi>free</hi> concurrence and <hi>voluntary act</hi> of the creditor, and not from the effect and operation of law; ſuch operation of law, in bar of all legal remedy, being on the contrary relied on as the main foundation of a right to claim under the treaty?</p>
                  <p n="2">2dly. By the "Tender law" of Maryland, paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in April, 1777, it is enacted that the paper mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in queſtion
<q>
                        <hi>ſhall</hi> paſs current and <hi>be received</hi> in payment and <hi>diſcharge</hi> of all manner of debts.</q>
Do the United States contend that any individual living within the ſtate of Maryland, whether Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh ſubject or American citizen, was at liberty to diſrega<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> this law, and ought not to have obeyed it? If not, is the loſs ariſing from his obedience aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable <hi>under the treaties,</hi> to his own <hi>free</hi> concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and <hi>voluntary</hi> act, or ſolely to the act of the law itſelf? Having it in view that the queſtion here raiſed, refers, not to an <hi>implied</hi> concurrence, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily connected with all obedience, by fiction or maxim of law, but to that true meaning, purpoſe, and underſtanding of the party, acting upon choice and fair alternative, which arbitrators in equity are bound to require.</p>
                  <p n="3">3dly. But ſuppoſing it to be argued on the part of a public government that an individual was at at liberty, and ought to have diſobeyed a preciſe
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:034906_0160_0FFF94A89776CA48"/>
and poſitive law of the ſtate in which he lived, would he as a creditor, or the perſon for whoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit he acted, have been in a better ſituation in conſequence of his diſobedience? In obeying the law, he received ſomething; by refuſing to obey it, he would have forfeited all—for it is alſo there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by enacted, that if the creditor refuſe to receive the paper money tendered, as a ſatisfaction, the <hi>whole</hi> debt or demand
<q>
                        <hi>ſhall be forever extinguiſhed,</hi> and if any ſuit ſhall be commenced for the recovery of ſuch debt or demand, after tender and refuſal as aforeſaid, the defendant may plead payment, and give this act and the ſpecial matter in evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</q>
—And further it is thereby provided that it ſhall, in that caſe, be lawful for the debtor to demand the bond or contract; or a diſcharge of the debt and if the creditor ſhall refuſe to deliver up the ſame or give ſuch diſcharge, it ſhall be lawful for ſuch debtor to ſue him for damages, to the extent of the debt, with coſts of ſuit.—How it is to be maintained that a debt was <hi>voluntarily given up</hi> when it could not be ſaved? Or that a claim under the treaty is to be leſs admiſſible or juſt for compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation on account of his having been deprived by the above law of only <hi>part</hi> of his debt, than it would have been, if, in conſequence of his diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, he had been thereby deprived of the whole? Was the extinction leſs compleat, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy more attainable, under the law, in the latter caſe than in the former?</p>
                  <p n="4">4thly. To place the ſame ſubject in another point
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:034906_0161_0FFF94ABEDF6D0B0"/>
of view—It has been argued in this caſe, on the part of the United States, that
<q>by the 4th article of the treaty of peace it was not intended to <hi>ſet aſide payments accepted by the creditors themſelves</hi> under the idea that <hi>ſuch payments</hi> are lawful im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment.</q>
—But ought it not rather to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and diſcuſſed how far the effect given by law to thoſe payments, being full value of the debt in <hi>paper</hi> money, though but a ſmall part of the <hi>full value in ſterling money,</hi> as a compleat ſatisfaction for the debt, and a lawful bar or impediment to all fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther recovery, ſhall be available not to the debtor (who is here out of the queſtion) but to the nation who made the law, and who, in oppoſition (as it is argued) to their own ſtipulatton that
<q>creditors ſhould meet with no lawful impediments to the recovery of <hi>full</hi> value in ſterling money of all bona fide debts theretofore contracted,</q>
without any diſtinction or reſerve whatever, ſuffered that law to remain in exiſtence and force as a perpetual bar or lawful impediment to the recovery of what was <hi>"still owing" under the treaty,</hi> of the "<hi>full value in sterling money</hi>" ſo ſecured?</p>
                  <p n="7">7thly. May it not be urged, not as a neceſſary argument, but as <hi>confirming</hi> an interpretation fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to the claim of a Britiſh creditor, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived paper money in obedience to the law, that ſuch interpretation is manifeſtly conſonant with juſtice to both parties—to the Britiſh creditor, in as much as it ſaves him from the loſs of the greater part of a juſt debt in conſequence of his

                  <p>THE agent for the United States, reſpectfully offers the following obſervations, upon the ſeveral points ſuggeſted by the commiſſioner, in their order of the 7th inſtant.</p>
                  <div type="part">
                     <head>UPON THE FIRST POINT.</head>
                     <p>When the agent for the United States, in the courſe of his argument in Hanbury's caſe, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the effect of the treaty on debts that might have been deemed to have been paid before the peace, he had in view thoſe debts only which had been paid into a ſtate treaſury. The Board will be pleaſed to recollect that in Hanbury's caſe the debtor had made payment into the treaſury of Maryland, purſuant to a law of that ſtate, and that it was only with reſpect to the operation of the treaty on treaſury payments that the agent had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to make any obſervations; and he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore truſts they will be applied to treaſury pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments only as they were intended. With reſpect to payments accepted by the creditors, whether in paper money, in lands, in houſes, in public ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or in any other commodity, the validity of either of theſe, to which both parties, the creditor and debtor had agreed was not imagined to be queſtionable.</p>
                     <p>After the ſupreme court of the United States
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:034906_0164_0FFF94B543F76568"/>
had decided in the caſe of Hylton, that the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the debt into the treaſury of Virginia, in purſuance to the laws of that ſtate, was not a bar to the action of the plaintiff, becauſe the fourth ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the treaty of peace had annulled ſuch a pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and had placed the creditor and debtor in the ſame ſituation, as if it never had been made; the agent for the United States would not preſume to controvert the operation of the treaty on ſuch payments, though he well knows that many learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and able juriſts avow their diſſent from that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion. This has however eſtabliſhed, that a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury payment is by the operation of the treaty of peace to be conſidered as no payment, to which adjudication not only the courts, but the ſtates of America have conformed.</p>
                     <p>In Virginia an act was lately paſſed, authoriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her treaſurer to re-pay to the debtor the value in ſpecie, of the paper money he had paid into the treaſury, and the ſame has accordingly been repaid when demanded, ſo that treaſury payments are null and void to every intent and purpoſe. They form no impediment either in law or equity, to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of any debt, bona fide, contracted before the late war, and due from a citizen of the United States to a Britiſh ſubject. The debtor is liable in like manner, as if he had made no ſuch payment, and from him the creditor is bound to uſe all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable means to obtain payment, before he can have under any circumſtances whatever any juſt ground to apply to the United States. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:034906_0165_0FFF94B7AF683B00"/>
given by the ſupreme court to the fourth article of the treaty of peace, was ſuppoſed moſt liberal, and to extend it further ſeems inadmiſſable. If the treaty of peace had not been conſtrued to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>null the treaſury payments, the creditors would have loſt thoſe ſums by the laws of war, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcation; but the American courts have been ſo liberal as to interpret the treaty to reſtore debts paid into the public treaſury. The principle upon which this interpretation reſts has been fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained in the former argument in this caſe, where it has been contended that there is an eſſential dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between a payment into a ſtate treaſury, and the acceptance of payment by the creditor in any commodity, whether paper money, lands, or public ſecurities.</p>
                     <p>Upon this occaſion the agent for the United States ought not to omit to obſerve, that the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury payments having been made without the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity or conſent of the creditors, might have been conſidered by them only as extinguiſhing the legal remedy for a time, which was reſtored by the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in which caſes the treaty might be conſtrued to remove any impediments of that deſcription with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out interfering improperly with private tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or without occaſioning general inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. But the agent for the United States does not admit, that it was ever underſtood by him, or by the United States, as a general
<q>principle, that the diſcharge or extinction of the debt at law
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:034906_0166_0FFF94BA2A91C038"/>
before the peace was a legal impediment, which the treaty of peace removed,</q>
and conſequently that every adjuſtment, and payment between the debtor and creditor, before that period, was liable to be re-examined and unſettled. On the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the agent denies ſuch a principle, and contends that the Board has no power to make examination into any matter that has been ſettled by the debtor and creditor, according to the laws of the land. The juriſdiction of the commiſſioners is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be confined to claims againſt the United States, in caſes where the debtor and creditor have not ſo ſettled, and which are attended with all the other circumſtances requiſite to bring thoſe caſes within the treaty of 1794. Upon this ſubject, and the true interpretation of the treaties he prays leave to refer to the argument in the caſe of Cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham and Company.</p>

                     <p>As a general rule, it is lawful for a creditor to refuſe money tendered to him, in payment of a debt, and the conſequence of ſuch refuſal is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge from intereſt and coſts from the time of the tender, 3d Blac. Com. 303. Ld. Raym. 254. The United States therefore do contend, that according to common law, it was in the power of any indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual creditor, if he pleaſed, and that it is at this day, in his power to refuſe a tender, whether made in paper or ſpecie, the lawful current money of the country; and at common law ſuch refuſal is not a public offence. So too, when a ſtatute declares a
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:034906_0167_0FFF94BBBB96BED8"/>
thing to be money, and ſhall paſs, and be received as ſuch, if a creditoe refuſes to take it under par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular circumſtances, he is not chargeable as an offender, with diſobeying the law, for if this diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience was a public offence if would be puniſhable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as ſuch. To refuſe paper declared money by ſtatute is no more a public offence than to refuſe metal declared money by ſtatute. If therefore a creditor accepts a tender, which he might refuſe, and a loſs accrues in conſequence thereof, it is to be imputed to his own act, and not ſolely to the ſtatute which made the money a tender, and it is contended, neither treaty had in view any loſſes which aroſe in whole or in part from the conduct of the creditor.</p>
                     <p>Though it be admitted that it was deſirable on the part of the United States, that the paper cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency ſhould have paſſed freely as ſpecie from hand to hand, yet many perſons, from diſaffection to the American cauſe, created difficulties, made objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and thereby occaſioned a depreciation. Theſe cauſes of depreciation, or any other, did not proceed from the will of the conſtituted au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities.</p>
                     <p>May it be permitted here to aſk, whether on the part of his Britannic Majeſty, or of his ſubjects it is contended, that a Britiſh ſubject ought to have receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or was obliged by duty to receive in payment, during the late war, the paper currency emitted by any of the United States? Rather was it not an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, for which by the laws of Great Britain, he
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:034906_0168_0FFF94BF1B79BCB8"/>
was puniſhable, as all intercourſe was prohibited by his King? And ſhall he now claim a merit for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving paper money which the laws of his country try required him to refuſe?</p>
                     <p>As to the power of arbitrators in equity, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be better decided than by the maxims of equity which are eſtabliſhed in the high courts of equity in Great Britain and America.</p>

                  <div type="part">
                     <head>ON THE THIRD POINT.</head>
                     <p>Suppoſing a Britiſh ſubject had refuſed a tender in paper currency, which he might have done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out committing a public offence, it is contended that he would have been in a better ſituation with reſpect to his right to recover his debt under the laws of the land and the treaty of peace, than he is after accepting it. 1ſt. Let it be obſerved that there is ſcarcely an inſtance between citizen and citizen, where the validity of a tender in paper mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney has been litigated that it has been maintained. There has been ſome defect, either in the quality of the bills or in the time, or in the place, or in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or in ſome other material thing, or as the tender might relate to the contract, for which the tender has been adjudged inſufficient. The doctrine of tenders was little underſtood here, 'till after the peace, when a number of law-ſuits brought the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject before the American courts. Hence it may be inferred, that on legal grounds, the tender would have been unavailing, 2dly. The effect of a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and refuſal is always a matter of legal conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:034906_0169_0FFF94C18C535988"/>
It is not a payment of the debt at common law under any circumſtances. It is not a payment of the debt even under the ſtatute of Maryland, which has been quoted; but the utmoſt operation of that ſtatute would have been to extinguiſh the remedy of the creditor, but not his right, or even ſuppoſing the right to be extinguiſhed 'till the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of peace was made, this treaty would have ſet aſide the effect of the tender and refuſal, would have revived the right of the creditor upon the like principles, that debts paid into the treaſury may be recovered from the debtors by the credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, which having been the ſolemn judgment of the court of the United States, is the law of the land.</p>
                     <p>Thus then it is not admitted that the creditor might not have ſaved his debt, ſo as to recover the full value thereof in ſterling money from his debtor. On the contrary it is contended, that by refuſing the tender, this would have been in his power under the laws of the country and the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of peace. If by the act of the creditor, the debtor has been diſcharged, the United States are not, according to any ſtipulations with Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to be held liable. If the creditor had refuſed the tender, he might have recovered the whole from the debtor, the principal as well as the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, to which juſtice would have entitled him. The inadmiſſibility then of this claim againſt the United States, reſts not on the idea that the credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor could have had a better title to recover from
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:034906_0170_0FFF94C403EA5D78"/>
the United States the whole, if he had refuſed the tender, than a part ſince he accepted the tender, but it reſts on the principle that the creditor has done an act which has forever diſcharged the debt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, which act might not have been done, and if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, the debtor would have been reſponſible for the debt.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="part">
                     <head>UPON THE FOURTH POINT.</head>
                     <p>It has been inſiſted by the agent for the United States, that by the fourth article of the treaty of peace, it was not intended to ſet aſide payments ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by the creditors themſelves, under the idea that ſuch payments are lawful impediments. To prove the truth of this proportion nothing new will be attempted here, but the agent prays leave to refer to his former arguments in this caſe. If true, there ſeems no room for controverſy, for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the treaty of peace did contemplate payments accepted by the creditors, as legal impediments, which it intended to annul; there is no contraven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the treaty in maintaining their validity; conſequently from this cauſe, no complaint can exiſt againſt the United States, for which they are to make compenſation.</p>
                     <p>But to conſider this point in the view preſented by the board, it may be contended that the debtor is not diſcharged, merely by the effect given by ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute to payments, where the creditor has accepted in full ſatisfaction, a commodity of leſs than the full value, but the diſcharge ariſes from the acts of the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:034906_0171_0FFF94C59CCC5850"/>
creditor, who has accepted ſatisfaction, and given an acquittance. If a creditor received public ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of the United States, or land, or any ſpecific commodity, in ſatisfaction of his debt, and gave an acquittance in full, the debtor is diſcharged, though there is no ſtatute giving ſuch an effect to a tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that kind. Here it may be remarked, that Britiſh creditors have received in ſatisfaction of their debts, many things which have ſuddenly apprecia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in their hands: are theſe willing to unſettle their liquidations, and to reſtore to the debtors the immenſe gains which have accrued from this ſource? Would it be reaſonble to demand it? Or ought ſuch gains to be paid to the United States?</p>
                     <p>With this view of the ſubject then, it is urged, that the United States do not act in oppoſition to the treaty of peace, when they maintain the effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of payments in paper money, accepted by the creditors; nor are they chargeable with a breach of that treaty by ſuffering ſuch payments to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main a perpetual bar to any demands of Britiſh creditors in full ſatisfaction of which they have been accepted.</p>

                  <div type="part">
                     <head>UPON THE FIFTH POINT.</head>
                     <p>There doubtleſs, are caſes in which the creditors who accepted depreciated paper money in payment, may have ſuſtained loſſes, but theſe loſſes ariſing wholly or in part from their own act, are not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to retribution from any quarter; if from any it ſhould be from the debtors. A claim of this kind
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:034906_0172_0FFF94C8F9AD1B30"/>
only concerns the debtor and creditor; a nation not being anſwerable for the loſſes which accrue to individuals from their dealings with one another, either by the principles of reaſon and juſtice, or by the uſage of nations. Therefore, any argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing from the juſtice of making a nation reſponſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for any loſſes of this kind, it is hoped will not weigh with the Board.</p>
                     <p>The agent for the United States has endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to confine his obſervations ſtrictly to the matters ſuggeſted in the order of the Board, and he truſts that they will obviate and remove all doubts that a claim for compenſation from the United States, on account of payments accepted by Britiſh credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors in depreciated money, is not by the treaty of amity, ſubmitted to the juriſdiction of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners.</p>
