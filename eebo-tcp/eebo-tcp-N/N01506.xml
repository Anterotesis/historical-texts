            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>e, in the Redemption of Sinners thro' Jeſus Chriſt. This Subject, juſtly calls for our highest Meditation &amp; Admiration: we ſhould ſo contemplate on it, as heartily to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with it's Invitations in the Goſpel. To move &amp; quicken Sinners here-unto, is what's mainly aim'd at in the following Sermons. I hope every one who ſeriouſly Reads them, will (by Gods bleſſing) be clearly convinc'd, that Chriſt is fully able and willing to <hi>Save all Sorts of Sinners,</hi> that will Submit to Him on Goſpel Termes. It's the Wiſdom and Intereſt of all ſo to Submit, and Inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable folly and wickedneſs in any to refuſe. I have Indeavour'd to anſwer ſeveral Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, which Sinners are apt to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:001789_0003_0FB82B4BDDE7CAD0"/>
coming to Chriſt: they'll ſurely be Self-condemn'd if they refuſe Him. And how ſhall any eſcape if they neglect ſo great Salvation! Here are offers of Salvation to <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Women,</hi> to thoſe of <hi>Various Nations,</hi> to <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>Young, High</hi> and <hi>Low, Rich</hi> and <hi>Poor, Bond</hi> and <hi>Free.</hi> I have here treated on ſundry Subjects, I hope none Unprofitable to a diligent Reader. The Preaching of theſe Sermons, I hope was not fruitleſs; a number of the Hearers Spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily deſired the Printing of them, and readily Subſcrib'd to the doing it: I wiſh their Souls may be abundantly Profitted, by what they deſir'd ſhould be thus made Publick, the ſame I wiſh to the Souls of all that Heard them or may Read them. 'Tis my earneſt deſire, that my Poor Indeavours may be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental to promote the Glory of Chriſt, and the goods of Souls; that theſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and whatever elſe I have Printed, may be ſo, is what I Pray to God for, and hope I ſhall do ſo as long as I Live.</p>

               <p>THESE Words here ſpoken by our Bleſſed Redeemer, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, are the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of a <hi>Parable.</hi> For we have much the ſame Diſcourſe as to the <hi>Scope</hi> and <hi>Subſtance</hi> of it (tho' differing in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry

Particulars) <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.2. <hi>v. &amp;c.</hi> and there 'tis call'd a <hi>Parable. v.</hi> 1. Jeſus anſwered and ſpake unto them again by <hi>Parables.</hi> The <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> which our Text is the beginning of, is of a Great <hi>Man</hi> (there call'd <hi>Lord, v.</hi> 21, 22. and <hi>King,</hi> Mat. 22.2.) making a great <hi>Supper,</hi> a great <hi>Feast,</hi> and by his Servants Inviting <hi>many Guests;</hi> the firſt that were Invited made <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes</hi> and would not come, <hi>v.</hi> 18. — 20. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, that Lord, whoſe kindneſs was thus deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed, was <hi>Angry,</hi> and reſolv'd that the deſpiſers of his offered kindneſs, ſhould not taſte of his Supper; and ſo order'd his Servants to go into the <hi>Streets</hi> and <hi>Lanes,</hi> and to Invite others to the Feaſt, even the <hi>Poor, Maimed, Halt</hi> and <hi>Blind,</hi> and thoſe alſo who were in the <hi>High wayes and Hedges,</hi> yea to <hi>Compell</hi> them to come in, that his Houſe might be filled. It's very probably thought, that in this Parable one thing mainly intended by our Saviour was, to ſet forth the <hi>Rejection of the Jews</hi> for their <hi>refuſing of Goſpel Offers &amp; Invitations,</hi> and the <hi>Calling in of the Gentiles.</hi> However, by a Man (a <hi>Lord,</hi> or <hi>King</hi>) here making a Feaſt and bidding many to it, we may underſtand <hi>God and Christ ſending forth Ministers to Invite Sinners to believe in Chriſt,</hi> to accept the Benefits Offer'd in the Goſpel; many refuſe theſe Offers, they wont accept the Goſpel-Bleſſings they're Invited to, ſuch ſhall not taſte of the Feaſt, they ſhall periſh for ever. But tho' ſome thus refuſe Goſpel-Offers, God will make them to others, and would have his <hi>Servants,</hi> Miniſters <hi>Compell</hi> them to come in, that is, be <hi>very urgent</hi> with them to accept the Benefits Offer'd in the Goſpel. It
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:001789_0006_0FB82B533697F7A8"/>
ſeems our Saviour when He ſpake this Parable about a <hi>Feaſt,</hi> was then Himſelf <hi>at a Feaſt, v.</hi> 1. <hi>He went into the Houſe of one of the chief Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees to eat Bread on the Sabbath-Day.</hi> It's likely this was ſomething more than an ordinary Meal, even a <hi>conſiderable Feast</hi> or Entertainment, where <hi>many Gueſts</hi> were, becauſe 'tis ſaid, <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>He marked how they choſe out the chief Rooms;</hi> and thence caution'd them that when they were bidden to a Wedding, not proudly to ſeek for chief Places. When our Lord was thus <hi>at a Feaſt,</hi> He took occaſion to <hi>Spiritualize</hi> the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Affair, to ſet forth Spiritual things under the <hi>Notion or Similitude of a Feaſt.</hi> So when He had Miraculouſly Fed many with a <hi>few Loaves,</hi> He took occaſion to ſpeak of the <hi>Meat that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures to Everlaſting Life,</hi> Joh. 6.27. When He ask'd the <hi>Woman of Samaria</hi> for ſome <hi>Water</hi> to drink, He took occaſion to ſpeak about <hi>Living-Water — ſpringing up unto Everlaſting Life,</hi> Joh. 4.10, 14. From our Saviour's Practice herein, we ſhould be quicken'd to <hi>Spiritualize</hi> the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that occur, the Affairs before us; thence taking occaſion to ſpeak thoſe things which may be of <hi>Spiritual uſe and advantage.</hi> Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence gives us many fair Handles (or Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities) for this, if we had but Wiſdom and Grace to Improve them. If we were prudent and careful in this matter, we might frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and eaſily do much Good, without any more Coſt or Labour than that of a few Words. Our Text, with the remaining part of the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſeem to be <hi>Introduc'd</hi> by way of <hi>Reply,</hi> to what was ſaid by one at Meat with our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. Our Lord advis'd the Man who gave Him
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:001789_0007_0FB82B5592656578"/>
an Invitation to Eat, when he made an Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, to Invite the <hi>Poor</hi> and Indigent who were not likely to Invite him again, nor make him any requital; if with a right Spirit he did thus, he ſhould be <hi>Recompens'd at the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Juſt, v.</hi> 12. — 14. Hereupon, one that ſat at Meat and heard theſe things, ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed is he that ſhall eat Bread in the Kingdom of God.</hi> To this ſaying, our Text is ſubjoined and annexed, <hi>Then ſaid he unto him,</hi> that is, then ſpake Chriſt to him that had uttered thoſe words (tho' in the hearing alſo of the reſt) <hi>A certain Man made a great Supper, and bade many,</hi> &amp;c. This Great <hi>Man Inviting many to a great Supper</hi> (or ſumptuous Feaſt) may ſignifie (as was hinted before) <hi>God's Inviting Sinners</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Spiritual, Saving Benefits Offered to them in the Goſpel. From the Words therefore we may obſerve this,</p>

                  <p>Here I ſhall indeavour to ſet forth ſome Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel, or ſhew in ſome General Heads; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God's Offering Spiritual Saving Benefits to Sinners in the Goſpel, may be compar'd to a great Man's Inviting many to a Sumptuous Feaſt.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Various Sorts of Perſons, are commonly Invited to a Great and Sumptuous Feast.</hi> To ſuch a Feaſt,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001789_0008_0FB82B58F217E9E0"/>
it's common to Invite Perſons of each Sex, <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Women:</hi> Perſons of different Age, ſome <hi>Younger</hi> ſome <hi>Older</hi> ones: Perſons of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Rank or Quality, ſome of an <hi>Higher</hi> and ſome of a <hi>Lower</hi> Station. So where the Goſpel is Preached, God Offers Spiritual Saving Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits to various Sorts of Perſons, even to all Sorts be they who they will that ſit under ſuch Preaching: none are exempted or excluded. Col. 3.11. <hi>There is neither Greek nor Jew, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barian, Scythian, Bond or Free, but Christ is all and in all.</hi> Gal. 3.28. <hi>Three is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither Bond nor Free, there is neither Male nor Female: for ye are all one in Christ Jeſus.</hi> All theſe <hi>various Sorts of Perſons</hi> are equally welcome to Chriſt, ſhall be equally Benefitted by Him as to all Saving Bleſſings; if they'l heartily accept of Him as Offered in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. I may therefore ſay, that Spiritual Saving Benefits are Offered to <hi>all Sorts of Perſons,</hi> where the Goſpel is plainly and Faithfully Preached. And to mention ſome particular Heads, I may ſay, ſuch Benefits are offered,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Both to Men and Women.</hi> There's no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between <hi>Male and Female,</hi> as to this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: both, as proceeding from Fallen Apoſtate <hi>Adam,</hi> are <hi>ſhapen in Iniquity and conceiv'd in Sin; a Seed of Evil doers, Children of Wrath by Nature.</hi> They're by Nature equally Sinful and Guilty, Heirs of Wrath, Obnoxious to Hell and Damnation. They <hi>equally need</hi> Chriſt, that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Saviour of Sinners; and he Dy'd to Save thoſe of each Sex. Act. 5.14. <hi>And of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers were the more added to the Lord, Multitudes both of Men and Women.</hi> Both <hi>Men and Women

If an <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> and <hi>one of another Nation,</hi> heartily receive Chriſt; they ſhall be equally welcome to Him and Benefitted by Him. In this caſe, there's no difference between Jew and Gentile; for <hi>all have Sinned and come ſhort of the Glory of God — It is one God which ſhall Juſtifie the Circumſicion by Faith, and the Uncircumſion thro' Faith,</hi> Rom. 3.22, 23, 30. Tho' while our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour dwelt in Fleſh here on Earth, He <hi>Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> the Commiſſion of His <hi>Apoſtles</hi> as to their <hi>Preaching,</hi> Mat. 10.5, 6. <hi>Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any City of the Samaritanes enter ye not; but go rather to the loſt Sheep of the houſe of Iſrael;</hi> Yet after His Reſurrection from the Dead, He Inlarg'd their Commiſſion ſaying, Mat. 28.19. <hi>Go teach</hi> (or <hi>Diſciple,</hi> as the word ſignifies) <hi>all Nations Baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> &amp;c.

If then there be any <hi>Old Unconverted Sinners</hi> in this Congregation, that have ſpent all their paſt time in Neglect and Contempt of God; if there be any ſuch here, hearken to what I ſay, <hi>Full, Compleat Salvation thro' Jeſus Christ is now once more Freely Offered to you.</hi> If you <hi>Old Sinners,</hi> Great Tranſgreſſors, who have ſo long Deſpis'd the Riches of God's Goodneſs, Forbearance, and Long-Suffering; will now once at laſt Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely Turn from your Sins to God in Chriſt Jeſus, you ſhall then be Welcome to Chriſt, and be Saved by Him for ever. Oh, Admire at this Amazing Grace and Patience of God! Accept the Invitation, Defer no longer. Your Time on Earth can't be long, your Days muſt needs be near their End; you'll have but very few if any more Offers of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, your Old Age will ſoon be ended.

Thus ſubmit to the Lord Jeſus, and then you ſhall thrive and proſper after the beſt manner that can be.

upon a Sick Bed. But tis unſpeakable Folly &amp; Wickedneſs, thus to defer preſent Duty. When Perſons are Sick, they've commonly enough to do to grapple with their Illneſs and Pain; how do they turn, heave and throw to get a little reſt and eaſe, and yet can't get it? They are ſcarce capable, of any ſerious deliberate Thoughts or Conſideration. Yea they're often <hi>out of their Senſes</hi> (as we call it) depriv'd of the uſe of Reaſon. It's unutterable Madneſs and Wickedneſs, to defer the concerns of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity till ſuch a Diſtreſſed, Diſtracted Condition as <hi>Sickneſs</hi> often occaſions. But beſides all this, you know not that ever you ſhall be <hi>Sick;</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Young</hi> Ones as well as others are taken out of the World, by ſome ſudden Fall, Blow or ſome ſurprizing unthought of Accident or other, and you don't know but you may thus die, and be removed from Time into Eternity in a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Till you have accompliſhed ſuch and ſuch world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Affairs which you have in view.</hi> Some are apt to think, <hi>Young</hi> Ones eſpecially, that when they come to be <hi>Setled in the World,</hi> when they're got through ſuch or ſuch a difficult matter that is before them, when they are come into ſome good Way or Method of Buſineſs; then they ſhall have more time and leiſure to mind their Souls, and then they'l mind them in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt: but dont be ſo Fooliſh, Mad and Wicked as to defer on any ſuch accounts as theſe.</p>
                  <p>For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Your Souls<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are of more Worth and Value,

than any other things you can be concern'd about.</hi> Things of greateſt Weight and Worth, ſhould be <hi>Firſtly</hi> and <hi>Chiefly</hi> minded, Mat. 6.33.

If we ſuppoſe a Man to <hi>gain this whole World,</hi> and to <hi>loſe his Soul</hi> while he's Buſied in doing it: he would indeed be a moſt Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Loſer.

Surely then, you ſhould mind your Souls <hi>Firſtly, Chriſtly;</hi> and other Things afterwards, or only in Subordination to God's Glory and your Spiritual Welfare. If by ſome grievous Fall, you ſhould <hi>tear your Cloaths</hi> to Pieces, and Grievouſly <hi>tear your Fleſh</hi> alſo, and <hi>break your Bones;</hi> doubtleſs in ſuch a Caſe you would be more concern'd to <hi>Heal your Wounds</hi> than to <hi>Mend your Cloaths.</hi> Why?

So your <hi>Souls</hi> being of <hi>Greateſt Worth,</hi> you ſhould be more concern'd for their Welfare, than for any or all Outward Affairs whatſoever: All other Things are but empty Bubbles and Trifles compar'd with your Souls.

Difficulties, got into ſome Good Way or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Buſineſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But Alas, you dont know that you ſhall ever obtain what you thus propoſe to your ſelves.

You dont know but it may be thus with you, &amp; then what becomes of your Precious Immortal Souls, whoſe Welfare you purpoſely Deferred till after ſuch Settlement as you never obtain? I believe there are vaſt Multitudes now in Hell, who once as really Thought and Deſigned as you do, to mind their Souls after ſuch and ſuch <hi>Worldly Matters</hi> were Accompliſhed; but Death Snatched them away before ever they had that Time and Leiſure they promiſed to themſelves.

Men are Diſtinguiſhed into <hi>High</hi> and <hi>Low,</hi> Pſal. 62.9. <hi>Surely Men of low Degree are Vanity, and Men of high Degree a Lie.</hi> Well, both <hi>High</hi> and <hi>Low</hi> are Invited to accept of Saving Benefits in the Goſpel. Pſal. 49.1, — 3. <hi>Hear this all ye People, give ear, all ye Inhabitants of the World: both Low and High, Rich and Poor together; my Month ſhall ſpeak of Wiſdom.</hi> The Counſels of Wiſdom are given to <hi>High</hi> and <hi>Low:</hi> They are Invited to Walk in Wiſdoms Ways. Thoſe loaded with Honours among Men, have but a Flaſhy, Empty Enjoyment of it; yet ſuch Honours (and love to them) keeps ſome from accepting Goſpel Offers. <hi>They love the Praiſe of Men more than the Praiſe of God,</hi> Joh. 12.43. <hi>How can ye Believe, who receive Honour one from another, and ſeek not that Honour which cometh from God only?</hi> Joh. 5.44. But Miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble will be the Caſe of thoſe, who for the ſake of Worldly Honours Reject Goſpel Invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

Thus, ſome who are eſteemed <hi>Honourable among Men,</hi> do more abundantly Honour themſelves in accepting the Offers of the Goſpel. Where-ever the Goſpel comes, the Saving Benefits of it are Offered to the <hi>High,</hi> to thoſe <hi>moſt Eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> in the World; and they are alſo Offered to the <hi>Low,</hi> to thoſe never ſo <hi>meanly Eſteemed</hi> or <hi>greatly Deſpiſed.</hi> Not only thoſe in the <hi>Streets and Lanes of the City,</hi> but alſo thoſe <hi>mean</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who had their abode in <hi>High Ways</hi> and <hi>Hedges</hi> (no Houſe to dwell in) were Invited to the Feaſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.21, 23. Thoſe who are moſt Overlooked, Deſpiſed, Contemned among Men, (I ſay, thoſe as well as any others where the Goſpel comes) are Invited to accept of Spiritual Saving Benefits thro' Jeſus Chriſt. If any of you are meanly eſteem'd or greatly deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis'd by Men, yet God wont over-look or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject you on that account. If Men count you the baſeſt abjects, the filth and off-ſcouring of all things; yet God offers great honours, dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, benefits to you: He bids you believe in Chriſt, and if you heartily do ſo, then he'll pardon your Sins, make you his Adopted Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, this is a great honour. If you'll receive Chriſt on Goſpel-termes, then you ſhall be his <hi>Brethren.</hi> Heb. 2.11. <hi>He is not aſhamed to call them Brethren.</hi> You ſhall be the <hi>Temples of the Holy Spirit.</hi> The holy Angels, thoſe bright Courtiers of the heavenly World who wait a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round

GOD Himſelf will honour you, love you, number you among his Special Friends and Favourites, count you as his Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, tender you as the Apple of his Eye; he'll make you his Heirs. Rom. 8.17. <hi>Heirs of God, and joynt Heirs with Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> He will here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after beſtow on you, not ſmall honours but great ones, even a Kingdom, a Crown of Glory that never fades away: a far more exceeding and an Eternal Weight of Glory: an Inheritance Incorruptible, Undefiled, that fadeth not away, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the Heavens for you. Thus (and much above what can be particularly expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed) ſhall all thoſe be honoured, that heartily Imbrace Chriſt Jeſus on Goſpel termes. The moſt precious Goſpel offers, are made both to <hi>High and Low.</hi>

               <p n="5">5. <hi>Both to the Rich and to the Poor.</hi> Men are often diſtinguiſh'd from one another, by their different condition as to Out-ward Poſſeſſions.

According to Perſons different circumſtances on theſe accounts, they're often differently eſteem'd and treated among Men. Prov. 14.20. <hi>The Poor is hated even of his own Neighbour, but the
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:001789_0026_0FB82B7A59ACB548"/>
Rich hath many friends.</hi> But theſe different cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of <hi>Wealth</hi> and <hi>Poverty,</hi> dont exclude any from the Offers and Invitations of the Goſpel. As for thoſe <hi>Rich</hi> in the World, they need a Chriſt as much as any: their Riches can't Save their Souls, can't Profit them in the Day of Wrath: they can't be Redeem'd with Corruptible things, ſuch as Silver and Gold. (Nothing but the Precious Blood of Chriſt can Redeem them) they'll be Miſerably of it for Ever, Damn'd Eternally in the Unquenchible Flames of Hell, notwithſtanding all their Riches, if they Die deſtitute of true Faith in Chriſt Jeſus. But the true Riches are Offered even to ſuch, even Durable Riches &amp; Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The Great GOD, commands all the Great and Rich under the Goſpel, to Believe in Chriſt, and if they do ſo He'll cauſe them to Inherit Subſtance: they ſhall be Rich in Faith and Heirs of the Kingdom. You that are Proſper'd by Providence, and are Poſſeſs'd of Outward Plenty; Oh dont think that you have enough, that you have a Satisfying Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in theſe things, dont truſt in them nor be proud of them.

Your Riches are uncertain, you muſt part with them at Death if not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and when GOD takes away your Souls, than whoſe ſhall thoſe things be which you have Provided.

Notwithſtanding all your Outward Poverty, God Offers you that which is better than all the Wealth of the World. He bids you heartily to believe in Chriſt, to receive Him as Prince and Saviour; if you do it, your Faith will Inrich you, and make you Heirs of the Kingdom of Glory. Such <hi>Faith is more precious than Gold that periſheth, tho' it be tried in the Fire,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.7. You that are <hi>Poor</hi> in this World, hearken to theſe Offers of God. You have not wherewith to Buy and Sell, to Trade and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in Worldly Goods as others can; but if tis not your own Fault, you may grow Rich in Heavenly Treaſures, God freely Offers them to you: Oh accept them on His Terms.

of Years, or Bought Servants, <hi>Indians</hi> or <hi>Negro's</hi> to Serve during Life; God calls upon you all to Submit Heartily unto Jeſus Chriſt, and tells you if you do, you ſhall be Sav'd for ever. God Offers you what is better than the greateſt Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from Humane Servitude, Imbrace Chriſt as Prince and Saviour, and you ſhall be Fre'd from the Guilt of Sin, the Curſe of the Law, the Tyranny of Satan, the Wrath of God, and Sin ſhall not have Dominion over you; but you ſhall Reign with Chriſt for ever and ever. Oh you <hi>Servants of Men,</hi> accept theſe Gracious Offers of the Great GOD. If you Heartily Submit to Chriſt, He'll now accept you, and hereafter graciouſly Reward you. Poſſibly when you ſerve your Maſters after the beſt manner that you can, they'l ſometimes be diſpleas'd with you (Maſters as well as others, have their failings) but the Great GOD will be <hi>pleas'd</hi> with you, if you Sincerely <hi>Fear Him and hope in His Mercy,</hi> Pſal. 147.11. See to it therefore, that you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Sincere Servants of Jeſus Chriſt, Truſt in Him and Obey Him. And if you will put your Necks under Chriſt's Yoke, and Indeed take Him for your Lord and Maſter; then remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber this is one thing He requires of you, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that you ſhould be <hi>True, Faithful, Honest to your Masters according to the Fleſh,</hi> Your becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt's Servants, Intitles you to as great Spiritual Privileges and Bleſſings as your Maſters can be intitled to; yet it does not at all free you from being Servants to your Maſters. No, Chriſt requires thoſe of <hi>His Subjects</hi> who are <hi>Servants to Men,</hi> to <hi>count their own Maſters worthy of all Honour, that the Name of God and His Doctrine
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:001789_0033_0FB82B873AE0C100"/>
be not Blaſphemed.</hi> 1 Tim. 6.1. That <hi>they be obedient to their own Masters, not anſwering again</hi> (not ſawcily contradicting) <hi>not purloining</hi> (not Pilfering, Stealing from them, or hurting their Intereſt) <hi>but ſhewing all good Fidelity, that they may adorn the Doctrine of God our Saviour in all things,</hi> Tit. 2.9, 10. You that are <hi>Servants,</hi> ſhould be <hi>Subject to your own Maſters, not only to the good and gentle, but alſo to the froward,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.18. You ſhould not be <hi>Eye-Servants,</hi> but ſhould be Obedient and Faithful in doing Service, when your Maſters are <hi>Abſent,</hi> as well as when they are <hi>Preſent</hi> and looking on you. And if you are thus True and Faithful to your Maſters, out of Hearty Conſcientious Obedience to Chriſt your Great Lord and Maſter, then He'll reward you hereafter in Heaven for it. Tis ſaid to <hi>Servants,</hi> with reference to their obeying of their Maſters, Col. 3.23, 34. <hi>Whatſoever ye do, do it heartily as to the Lord and not to Men; knowing that of the Lord ye ſhall receive the reward of the Inheritance, for ye ſerve the Lord Chriſt.</hi> So Eph. 6.8. <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever good thing any Man doth, the ſame ſhall he receive of the Lord whether he be Bond or Free.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. <hi>At a great Feaſt, there's commonly Variety of Entertainment; Things for Neceſſity and for Innocent Delight and Pleaſure.</hi> So there's <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety</hi> of Bleſſings, Offered in the Goſpel unto Sinners.

               <p n="1">1. <hi>That Sovereign Almighty Grace has enabled them to Accept this Invitation.</hi> He that truly Receives Chriſt on Goſpel Terms, has the Waſhing of Regeneration, and the Renewing of the Holy Ghoſt: The Image of God in Righteouſneſs and True Holineſs is Created in Him. He's turn'd from Darkneſs to Light, from the Power of Satan unto God.

               <p n="2">2. <hi>That their Sins are Pardoned.</hi> They who Receive Chriſt on Goſpel Terms, are Pardoned thro' His Blood. Acts 10.43. <hi>Whoſoever Believeth on him ſhall receive Remiſſion of Sins,</hi> Eph. 1.7. <hi>In whom we have Redemption thro' his Blood, the Forgiveneſs of Sins, according to the Riches of his Grace.</hi> This Remiſſion of Sins is a great Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, Incomparably Greater than all Outward Proſperity whatſoever. The Wrath of a King, is reckoned Terrible. Prov. 19.12. —<hi>The Kings Wrath is as the Roaring of a Lyon.</hi> What then is the Wrath of the LORD GOD Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty?

It muſt needs then be a very great Benefit, to be deliver'd from the Vindictive Anger, the Terrible In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable Wrath and Curſe of this Almighty Jehovah.

great Benefit. From this Benefit, a Perſon is Denominated <hi>Bleſſed</hi> or <hi>Happy. Bleſſed is he whoſe Tranſgreſſion is forgiven,</hi> Pſal. 32.1.

This makes them go mourning &amp; bowed down, ſometimes doubting that they have no Grace in them, that they never yet took one right ſtep in the way to Heaven; ſometimes fearing, that there is no hope for them, that their day of Grace is end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or that their Spiritual Enemies will finally be too ſtrong for them. No Tongue can tell, the Perplexities of Soul the Saints often meet with from Indwelling Sin. Well, but when
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:001789_0053_0FB82BB1446336F8"/>
Death comes, they'll be eternally fre'd from theſe the greateſt Perplexities of their whole Lives. As when they die, their Souls go to be <hi>Preſent with the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.8. So, they ſhall then be, the <hi>Spirits of Juſt Men made Perfect,</hi> Heb. 12.23. They ſhall be perfectly fre'd from all the remains of Sin, from the very life and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it; and being perfectly holy ſhall Serve God with the greateſt joy and gladneſs. And as at Death the Saints ſhall be perfectly freed from all <hi>Outward Troubles,</hi> from <hi>Satan's Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> from all <hi>their Own Corruptions;</hi> ſo,</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>They ſhall Poſſeſs that Joy, bleſſedneſs and glory which is at preſent Inconceivably great.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſtate of their Souls after Death, is ſaid to be their <hi>Gain,</hi> and to be <hi>better</hi> than what it was here on Earth: <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.21, 23. They are ſaid to be <hi>Comforted,</hi> Luke 16.25. The whole of their Condition is ſet forth by that word, <hi>Comfort,</hi> and ſo may Intimate that they ſhall have <hi>Good, Joy, Comfort</hi> and nothing elſe. They ſhall be <hi>Preſent</hi> with the Lord, and in His Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence there is <hi>fullneſs of joy and pleaſures for ever more,</hi> Pſal. 16.11. And, as great will be the bleſſedneſs of the Saints at their Death; ſo,</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Greater will be their bleſſedneſs at and for ever after the Reſurrection.</hi> All the Dead ſhall live again. There ſhall be a <hi>Reſurrection of the Dead, both of the Just and the Unjuſt,</hi> Acts 24.15. When this time comes, the happineſs of the Saints ſhall be greatly Increaſed. Tho' their Souls in their Separate State were free from all Sin, Sorrow, Trouble, and entertain'd with
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:001789_0054_0FB82BB3EA010D40"/>
Inexpreſſible Joys, yet it will be an Increaſe of their bleſſedneſs, when their whole Man Body and Soul ſhall be United in a moſt bliſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful State.

No Deed of <hi>Charity,</hi> tho' ſo ſmall as the giving a <hi>Cup of Cold Water,</hi> ſhall then miſs of being Rewarded, Mat. 10.42. Their <hi>Faith</hi> which is now <hi>more precious than tried Gold,</hi> ſhall then be found to <hi>Praiſe, Honour and Glory,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.6, 7. Yea, <hi>Whatſoever good thing they ever did, the ſame ſhall they then receive of the Lord,</hi> Eph. 6.8. This their Future Glory and Felicity, is ſet forth by things commonly much eſteem'd by Men in this World; 'tis call'd a <hi>Crown, Kingdom, Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance,</hi>
                  <pb n="52" facs="unknown:001789_0055_0FB82BB5AB99E550"/>
&amp;c. But indeed their Future Glory and Happineſs, will be far greater than we can at preſent conceive of. The Apoſtle plainly ſays of it, 1 Joh. 3.2. <hi>It doth not yet appear what we ſhall be.</hi> The meaning is, Future Bleſſedneſs exceeds all preſent Conceptions and Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions. And this Future Inconcievable Bleſſedneſs of the Saints, will be <hi>Eternal</hi> too; 'twill never have an end nor ceaſe to be, 'tis therefore ſet forth by ſuch Epithets as <hi>Eternal,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.17. <hi>Everlaſting,</hi> Joh. 3.16. <hi>Unfading,</hi> or that <hi>never fades away,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.4. All this Inconceivable good and glory at &amp; after Death, is reſerv'd for the Saints, and aſſured to them by the Unchangible Promiſes of the Lord Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty. And it muſt needs be matter of great comfort and joy to the Saints, even at preſent, to think of &amp; meditate on theſe things. They ſhould <hi>Rejoyce in the hope of the Glory of God,</hi> Rom. 5.2. No <hi>Feaſt</hi> on Earth is ſo delightful to an hungry Perſon, as the belief and hope of future glory often is to the Saints. They <hi>Rejoyce with joy unſpeakable and full of Glory,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.8. The bleſſings belonging to thoſe that accept of Goſpel Invitations, contain mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of greater joy, than any Feaſt on Earth can yield to the <hi>Gueſts</hi> that partake of it. Yea I might further add, the more careful the Saints are to Live according to Goſpel Invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Precepts, ſo much the clearer view they're likely to have, of their <hi>firm Title</hi> to fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Matchleſs Glory: 1 Joh. 2.3. <hi>Herely do we know that we know him, if we keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.</hi> The more they have of preſent Holineſs, ſo much the more ordinarily of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent

Joy, 2 Cor. 1.12. <hi>This is our rejoycing, even the teſtimony of our Conſcience, that in Simplicity and Godly Sincerity; not with Fleſhly Wiſdom but by the Grace of God, we have had our Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the World.</hi> The more they find of the <hi>Fruits of the Spirit in them,</hi> (Gal. 5.22.) So much the more likely to <hi>know in themſelves, that they have in Heaven a better and an enduring ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> Heb. 10.34. Indeed the ways of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom are ways of Pleaſantneſs, and all her Paths are Peace. From what has been ſaid under this Second General Head of Compariſon, we may Infer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Saints ſhould be thankful, for the great Bleſſings Divine Grace has provided for them, and intitled them unto.</hi> It well becomes them to ſay, as, Pſal. 103.1, 2. <hi>Bleſs the Lord, Oh my Soul, and all that is within me Bleſs His Holy Name.

               <p>WE may now proceed to <hi>another</hi> General Head of Compariſon, God's Offering Spiritual Saving Benefits to Sinners in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, may be compar'd to a Great Man's Inviting many to a Sumptuous Feaſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>Becauſe in a Great and Sumptuous Feast, there's commonly Plenty, a Sufficiency for all that come.</hi> In

ſuch a Feaſt there's commonly Store and Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, enough for all that come: enough and to ſpare; ſo that it may be ſaid as, Cant. 5.1— <hi>Eat, O Friends, Drink, yea Drink abundantly, O Beloved.</hi> So there's Saving Mercy enough in the Goſpel, for all that will come and accept it as Offered to them. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt with His Saving Benefits, is the Subject Matter of the Goſpel Feaſt to which Sinners are Invited. <hi>There is Salvation in none other, neither is there any other Name given under Heaven among Men whereby we can be Saved,</hi> Act. 4.12. And as Chriſt is the <hi>only</hi> Saviour of Sinners, ſo He is an <hi>All-Sufficient</hi> Saviour of them. <hi>He's able to Save to the uttermoſt them that come unto God by Him,</hi> Heb. 7.25. None that came to Chriſt Hungring and Thirſting after Righteouſneſs, were ever ſent Empty away. There's a Fulneſs, a Sufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Merit, Vertue, Power, Willingneſs in Jeſus Chriſt, to Save all that come to Him and accept of Him on Goſpel Terms. Here I might ſay—</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>There's enough in Chriſt to Save thoſe of all the VARIOUS AGES of the World, that Believe in Him and Accept of Him as Reveal'd and Offer'd to them.</hi> Soon after our Firſt Parents had Sinned, God made a Promiſe, Gen. 3.15. That the <hi>Seed of the Woman ſhould break the Serpent's head.</hi> This was a Promiſe of Chriſt the Saviour of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, He is the <hi>Promiſed Seed of the Woman,</hi> Gal. 4.4. All that were Pardoned and Sav'd under the Old Teſtament Diſpenſation, were Sav'd by the Fulneſs and Sufficiency of Chriſt who then <hi>was to come;</hi> for there is Salvation in none other.
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:001789_0059_0FB82BBC66D27DE8"/>
All the Explatory Sacrifices appointed by God before Chriſt's coming, were but Types, Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, Repreſentations of Chriſt, who is (there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore call'd) <hi>The Lamb Slain from the Foundation of the World,</hi> Rev. 13.8. <hi>The Lamb of God who takes away the Sin of the World,</hi> Joh. 1.29. <hi>For it is not poſſible that the Blood of Bulls and Goats ſhould take away Sin,</hi> Heb. 10.4. Tho' the Blood of Beaſts Slain in Sacrifice could not take away Sin, yet the <hi>Blood of Jeſus cleanſeth from all Sin,</hi> 1 Joh 1.7. Therefore all that Pardoning Saving <hi>Mercy</hi> which Old Teſtament Believers obtain'd, was in and thro' Chriſt who was then to come. All the <hi>Prophets of the Old Teſtament</hi> (as well as the Apoſtles of the New) bare Witneſs of Chriſt, <hi>that thro' His Name, whoſoever believeth in Him ſhall receive Remiſſion of Sins,</hi> Act. 10.43. This was the Unanimous <hi>concurrent</hi> Teſtimony of all the Old Teſtament-Prophets. There is <hi>Redemption tho' Jeſus Chriſt, whom God hath ſet forth for a Propitiation thro' Faith in His Blood, to declare His Righteouſneſs for the Remiſſion of Sins that are paſt, thro' the forbearance of God,</hi> Rom. 3.24, 25. Chriſt <hi>by one Offering, hath perfected forever them that are Sanctified,</hi> Heb. 10.14. All the Sins of Old Teſtament Believers were forgiven, for the ſake of that One Offering which according to God's Promiſe, Chriſt was <hi>afterwards</hi> to Offer.

For He has ſaid, Joh. 6.37. <hi>Him that cometh unto me, I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> Having ſaid ſo much before, I ſhall not Inlarge under this Head.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>There's enough in Chriſt to Save the Greateſt, Worſt, Vileſt Sinners if they'll come to Him by Faith.</hi> Some can pay ſmall Debts, that cannot pay great Ones.

Chriſt came to ſave even <hi>Chief Sinners,</hi> this God aſſures us of; 'tis a True and <hi>Faithful Saying, worthy of all Acceptation,</hi> worthy to be Believed, Credited, Relied on <hi>by all</hi> that hear it. <hi>Whoſoever</hi> (though the Greateſt Vileſt Sinner in the World) <hi>Believeth in him, ſhall not Periſh, but have Everlasting Life,</hi> Joh. 3.16.

Iſai. 55 7. <hi>Let the Wicked forſake his Way, and the Unrighteous Man his Thoughts; and turn to the Lord, and he will have Mercy upon him, and to our God for he will abundantly Pardon.</hi> If Men have been <hi>Abundantly Wicked,</hi> Unrighteous, have <hi>Abounded Greatly</hi> in Sin; yet there is <hi>Abundance of Pardoning Mercy</hi> for them, if <hi>they will Turn from their Wickedneſs,</hi> Pſal. 51.1. —<hi>According to the Multitude of thy tender Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, blot out my Tranſgreſſions.</hi> There are <hi>Mercies,</hi> yea a <hi>Multitude</hi> of Mercies of <hi>Tender.</hi> Mercies with God; to Pardon all the Iniquities of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent returning Sinners. Oh Sinners, ſeriouſly conſider theſe true ſayings of God; heartily and ſpeedily ſubmit your ſelves to Chriſt, there's enough in Him to Save you all if you'll hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily believe in Him. I might here ſay:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>There's vertue enough in Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>blood to Pardon all your Sins.</hi> For, as was ſaid but now, <hi>His blood cleanſeth from all ſin,</hi> 1 Joh. 1.7.</p>

               <p n="3">3. <hi>There's willingneſs enough in Chriſt to Save you, if you come.</hi> He has given his Infallible Divine Word for it ſaying: Joh. 6.37. <hi>Him that cometh unto me, I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> Matt. 11.28. <hi>Come unto me, all ye that Labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you Reſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There's enough in Chriſt to Save you from all following aſſaults of your Spiritual Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, if you heartily give up your ſelves to Him. Chriſt is ſtronger than Satan that ſtrong man armed, and is able to defend and protect from Satan's deſtructive Rage, all that truſt in him. He has ſaid: Joh. 10.27, 28. <hi>My ſheep hear my voice, and I know them; and they follow me. And I give unto them eternal Life, and they ſhall never periſh, neither ſhall any man pluck them out of my hand.</hi> And as <hi>no Man,</hi> ſo neither ſhall <hi>Devils</hi> be able to pluck Chriſt's Sheep out of his hand. For Chriſt has <hi>Suffered death, to deſtroy him that had the power of death, that is the Devil,</hi> Heb. 2.14. Thus we ſee, there's every way enough in Chriſt, to Save all that come to Him and truſt in Him as offered in the Goſpel. As there's commonly <hi>Plenty</hi> at a great Feaſt, enough for all that come; ſo there's <hi>Saving Mercy in Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>enough</hi> of it for all that ſincerely come unto him.

and bringing into Captivity every thought to the Obedince of Chriſt.</hi> Thoſe that are Converted, they have the <hi>waſhing of Regeneration, and the Renewing of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Tit. 3.5.

               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>What Perſons are Invited to at a Feaſt, is at free cost as to them.</hi> Tho' its commonly mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of coſt and charge to him that makes the Entertainment, yet it coſts nothing to the Gueſts themſelves; its kindneſs freely granted

to them. Its given them, given freely, what they're Invited to eat and drink coſts them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, they pay nothing for it. The Inviter has a Mind to ſhow his Love, Kindneſs, Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in freely communicating his good things to thoſe whom he Invites. So the ſaving bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits offer'd to Sinners in the Goſpel, are offer'd <hi>freely.</hi> Whatever coſt or charge there may have been, on the part of God or Chriſt, to provide or procure theſe ſaving benefits; yet there's no coſt or charge on the part of Sinners that are Invited to receive them. Sinners <hi>as ſuch</hi> are worthy of Death, Children of Wrath, deſerve Hell and everlaſting Vengeance: this is all they're worthy of at God's hand. They are utterly and altogether unworthy of all that ſaving Mercy, that's offer'd to them in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. Therefore tho' they're bid to <hi>buy tryed gold, and white raiment,</hi> Rev. 3.18. Yet they're bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den <hi>to buy without money and without price,</hi> Iſai. 55.1. That is, they're Invited to accept Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Saving bleſſings, <hi>moſt freely offer'd</hi> to them. Tho' they have no price, no money to lay down; that is, no Merits, Worthineſs, Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of their own, nothing of their own to recommend them to Divine favour, yet they're Invited to accept full compleat Salvation <hi>freely</hi> offered to them. The <hi>gift of God</hi> is eternal Life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. Tis your Father's <hi>good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to give you the Kingdom,</hi> Luk. 12.32. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever obtains Salvation, Eternal Life, will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it by way of <hi>free gift as from God,</hi> from Chriſt; and what can be <hi>freer than a gift?</hi> Nothing can be <hi>more freely offered,</hi> than Salvation is to Sinners in the Goſpel. Here we may conſider:</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="71" facs="unknown:001789_0074_0FB82BD8C19CDF50"/>1. <hi>GOD needs not the Salvation of Sinners.</hi> Men will ſometimes Ingage in great, coſtly, difficult affairs; when they think their own real welfare calls for it: very often <hi>neceſſity</hi> will make them venture <hi>hard.</hi> But God had no neceſſity at all, to <hi>concern</hi> Himſelf about the Salvation of Sinners. God's Compleat Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Bleſſedneſs, is Unchangible. With Him there <hi>is no variableneſs nor ſhadow of turning,</hi> Jam. 1.17. God's happineſs can't be diminiſh'd by Mens Wickedneſs or Miſery, nor be increas'd by their Holineſs or Felicity. Job 35.6, 7. <hi>If thou ſinneſt, what doeſt thou againſt Him? Or if thy Tranſgreſſions be multiplied, what doeſt thou unto Him? If thou be righteous, what giveſt thou Him? Or what receiveth He of thine hand?</hi> If all Men had periſhed Eternally for their Wickedneſs, as all the fallen Angels ſhall; God's Eſſential Compleat Bleſſedneſs would not have been at all impaired thereby.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>From all Eternity, God of His own heart con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd the Scheme and Method of Sinners Salvation.</hi> Tis His <hi>Eternal Purpoſe,</hi> Eph. 3.11. Men could not be <hi>first movers</hi> in this Scheme, twas laid long before they had any being. The Motion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was intirely, wholly, only from God, of His own heart, of His own meer good Will and Pleaſure.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Twas of meer Love, that God gave Chriſt to Save Sinners.</hi> Joh. 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the World, as to give His only Begotten Son, that whoſoever Believeth in Him, ſhould not periſh but have Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Life.</hi> Twas meer Love, Grace, Bounty, Good Will in the Heart of God towards Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners (and not any need of them, or foreſeen
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:001789_0075_0FB82BD9B747AC20"/>
worthineſs in them) that put Him on ſending His Son on this Errand.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Twas of meer Love, that Chriſt Died for Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi> In themſelves conſider'd they were Rebels, Traytors, Enemies, Children of the Devil, Heirs of Hell; yet from a free Love to, and Deſire of, their Salvation, Chriſt Dyed for them. <hi>He loved us, and gave himſelf for us an Offering and a Sacrifice to God,</hi> Eph. 5.2. Rev. 1.5. So that this great Salvation Offer'd in the Goſpel, is the moſt Gratuitous and Free that can be, with reſpect to thoſe to whom tis Offer'd.

<pb n="95" facs="unknown:001789_0098_0FB829327257D528"/>
More particularly, this backwardneſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſs in Men, to accept of Goſpel Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, does proceed:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>From their Blindneſs and Ignorance.</hi> All the faculties of the Rational Soul, are wonderfully deprav'd &amp; vitiated by Sin. The Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is wonderfully weaken'd, darkned, blinded. The Holy Ghoſt in deſcribing the depravation of fallen Men, ſays, Rom. 3.11, 17. <hi>There is none that Underſtandeth, there is none that Seeketh after God — the way of Peace have they not known.</hi> And ſo Unregenerate men are ſaid to be <hi>in darkneſs;</hi> and Converſion is call'd an <hi>Opening of their Eyes, a turning them from darkneſs to light: a calling them out of darkneſs into marvellous light,</hi> Act. 26.18. 1 Pet. 2.9. Unregenerate Perſons are ſo in the dark, that they have not a right view and underſtanding of things: they have not a right view and ſenſe of the curſed nature and tendency of Sin, of their own Slavery to it, and liableneſs to miſery for it. They dont rightly ſee and conſider their own danger and hazard, the Suitableneſs and All-ſufficiency of Chriſt to Save them, their abſolute need of an Intereſt in Him by heart-purifying Faith. If they had a right underſtanding of theſe things, they would not be ſo eaſy, quiet, joyful in their Sinful Periſhing Condition, as they often are. If they had a right, clear, realizing view of the endleſs Torments of Hell which wait for the Impenitent, and of the endleſs Matchleſs Glories which ſhall be the Portion of Sincere Saints; then they would not be ſo eaſy and quiet while liable to the former and uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted in the latter, as they often are. Tis ſaid,
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:001789_0099_0FB82933E80B4820"/>
Pſal. 9.10. <hi>They that know thy Name will put their truſt in thee, for thou Lord haſt not forſaken them that ſeek thee.</hi> Therefore tis very much from an <hi>Ignorance</hi> of God and Chriſt, and the abſolute need of an Intereſt in his favour, that Sinners are ſo backward and unwilling to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of Goſpel Offers and Invitations.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>From the Hardneſs of their Hearts.</hi> They not only have a great Ignorance of God, and of the things of God, of the duties they owe to him, and the need they have of his favour; but there's alſo in them a baſe, vile contrariety of heart to that which they do know of God. Their hearts are ſo hard, ſo ſtrongly ſet againſt Gods Authority, ſo bent to wickedneſs; that they often neglect to do what they know is Duty, and commit what they know is Sin. And ſo they are ſaid to <hi>Love darkneſs rather than light — to hate the light,</hi> Joh. 3.19, 20. They <hi>hold the Truth in Unrighteouſneſs — when they knew God, they glorified him not as God</hi> — Tho' they know that ſuch and ſuch things <hi>are worthy of Death, yet they not only do them, but take pleaſure in thoſe that do them,</hi> Rom. 1.18, 21, 32. <hi>They ſay unto God, depart from us; for we deſire not the knowledge of thy ways,</hi> Job 21.14. Tis <hi>after their hardneſs and impenitent heart, that they trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure up to themſelves wrath againſt the day of wrath, and the revelation of Gods righteous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> Rom. 2.5. This backwardneſs to accept of Goſpel Invitations, is often furthered:</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>By their accuſtoming themſelves to Sin.</hi> The root, habit, principle of Sin in the Soul, which
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:001789_0100_0FB8293526D8DAD0"/>
is commonly call'd <hi>Original Sin:</hi> is often ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then'd, increas'd, confirm'd and eſtabliſh'd (as it were) by a continued cuſtomarineſs in Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. The longer men live in Sin, the more they uſe and accuſtom themſelves to it: ſo much the more they commonly love it: ſo much the more unwilling they uſually are to leave and forſake it. He that has been long us'd to Drunkenneſs, is not eaſily brought to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake it. He that has been long us'd to filthy Unclean Practices, is not eaſily brought to be chaſt and pure. So thoſe habituated to Lying, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tealing, Cheating, Defrauding, Blaſpheming, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are not eaſily brought to forſake ſuch Helliſh Practices. Jer. 13.23. <hi>Can the Ethiopian change his ſkin, or the Leopard his ſpots? then may ye alſo do good, that are accuſtomed to do evil.</hi> So that in general, Mens backwardneſs and unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to accept of Goſpel Offers and Invitations. proceeds from the depravation and corruption of their Nature by the Fall, by <hi>Adam's</hi> Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie from God. It's a great evil, to refuſe Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Offers; but the depravation of Man's Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is the cauſe of all Moral evils, both of Omiſſion and Commiſſion. Indeed tis great part of the work of Goſpel Grace, to cure this depravation in the Soul; but this Malady na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally reſiſts the remedy, till conquer'd, and ſubdu'd by Sovereign Almighty Grace. And again, this backwardneſs &amp; unwillingneſs:</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Is often much furthered by Satan.</hi> All the fallen, <hi>Apoſtate Angels</hi> are often comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in this Collective Name, <hi>Satan,</hi> or <hi>the Devil.</hi> The Devil was the firſt Sinner. By his Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:001789_0101_0FB82938DD3F3690"/>
he drew Mankind into <hi>Sin</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves <hi>Death;</hi> and ſo he's juſtly call'd <hi>a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer from the beginning,</hi> Joh. 8.44. And as at firſt, Satan thus drew Mankind into Sin and Miſery; ſo he does all he can to obſtruct their Recovery and Salvation. He's an Enemy of all Righteouſneſs, ſtrives to pervert the right ways of the Lord. He does all he can to blind and darken the Minds of Men, to fill them with Errors, and with Prejudices againſt the Truths and Ways of God which lead to Salvation: 2 Cor. 4.3, 4. <hi>But if our Goſpel be hid, tis hid to thoſe that are loſt; in whom the god of this World</hi> (that is, the Devil) <hi>hath blinded the Minds of thoſe that believe not, leſt the light of the glorious Goſpel of Christ, who is the Image of God, ſhould ſhine into them.</hi> When the Seed of the Goſpel is Sown, — when the holy Saving Truths of God are Preached; Satan catches them away as much as poſſibly he can: he does his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to hinder the good efficacy of them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.12. He is <hi>the</hi> Tempter, <hi>the</hi> Enemy, <hi>the</hi> Wicked one, the <hi>Abaddon</hi> and <hi>Apollyon</hi> (that is, Deſtroyer) emphatically ſo; who uſeth all his Subtlety, Power and Unwearied Malice, to hinder Perſons from underſtanding the one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way of Salvation, and from walking in it.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>We ought to conſider and deeply bewail the Depravation and Corruption of our Nature.</hi> As we come from fallen <hi>Adam,</hi> we're wofully depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

We're Naturally prone to hate God, whom we ſhould love above all things; and to chuſe and love the ways of Sin, which we ſhould hate above all things. Indeed we're Naturally in a very depraved, woful, degenerate Condition. And tho' God of His Infinite Grace, has given His Son to ſave Sinners, and Invites us to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept this Salvation; yet ſuch it our Ignorance and Wickedneſs Naturally, that we are prone to neglect and reject this great Salvation. We are prone to reject this only and All-ſufficient Remedy which is Offer'd us. We are Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally Dead in Treſpaſſes and in Sins. Surely we have abundant cauſe, to bewail and lament our wretched depraved ſtate by the Fall. If Men loſe their Credit, their Eſtate, their Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs; if they loſe their Health and Strength, eſpecially if they loſe the uſe of their Limbs, their Sight, their Hearing, they're apt greatly to bewail theſe Loſſes. But the loſs of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God in our Souls, and to have our Souls ſo darkened and corrupted by Sin as they are, is a much greater loſs and much more to be lamented and bewailed.</p>

Tho' God ſometimes ſuffers the Wicked to flouriſh a while in great Proſperity; yet on the other hand, He often witneſſeth againſt their Sins, by pouring down His Wrath, even heavy Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for them. Nay further ſtill, thoſe who irreligiouſly neglect God, often take thoſe <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> which <hi>naturally</hi> tend to bring Outward Troubles and Miſchiefs on them. Thus when they give themſelves up to <hi>Idleneſs, Gaming, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance, Uncleanneſs,</hi> &amp;c. Such a courſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly tends to <hi>Impoveriſh</hi> them; beſides the <hi>diſgrace</hi> and <hi>ſting of Conſcience</hi> which they have into the Bargain. <hi>The Glutton and the Drunkard ſhall come to Poverty, and Drowſineſs ſhall cloth a Man with rags,</hi> Prov. 23.21. Yea many <hi>Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> of the Wicked, tends not only to bring <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty</hi> and <hi>Diſgrace</hi> among Men, but alſo <hi>Bodily Pains, Sickneſſes,</hi> and <hi>Immature Death.</hi> Prov. 5.11. <hi>And thou mourn at the laſt, when thy Fleſh and thy Body are conſumed.</hi> So that ſuch Sinners, are often <hi>Martyrs</hi> (as it were) for the Devil and for their own Luſts; their ſerving of Sin and Satan, does as it were in a <hi>natural way</hi> bring theſe Evils on them. Are they afraid, leſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors ſhould ſpoil them of their Goods and impoveriſh them for their Piety? Why their ſinful <hi>Practices</hi> bring them to the <hi>ſame want and Poverty.</hi> Their <hi>Idling, Gaming, Drinking</hi> to exceſs and other vile <hi>Practices,</hi> waſt and conſume their Eſtates that they are not worth a <hi>Groat.</hi> Are they afraid, that if they ſhould be ſeriouſly
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:001789_0121_0FB8296010FC30B8"/>
and practically Godly, they ſhould be <hi>meanly eſteemed,</hi> nay revil'd for being ſo? Why their <hi>vile Practices</hi> render them mean and contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in the eſteem of all who have any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Honeſty or Sobriety. Are they afraid leſt they ſhould ſuffer Bodily Puniſhments, Pains, Confinements for Religion ſake? Why their vicious <hi>Practices</hi> often bring thoſe <hi>Bodily Pains,</hi> thoſe <hi>Confinements</hi> by <hi>Sickneſs</hi> which are very heavy and grievous. Nay, for their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious wicked <hi>Practices</hi> they're often juſtly <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon'd, Fin'd, Whip'd</hi> and otherwiſe corporally Puniſh'd, yea ſometimes put to Death. Thus many ſuffer <hi>Martyrdom</hi> (as it were) for their Luſts: their Indeavours to gratifie their Luſts, bring theſe Miſeries on them. For the ſake of gratifying their Luſts, they rob and ſpoil them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of their <hi>Health, Eaſe, Credit, Liberty, Eſtate,</hi> yea and often of their <hi>Lives</hi> too. Perſons often procure to themſelves by their wickedneſs, as grievous Sufferings (in themſelves conſider'd) as the Godly almoſt ever meet with from cruel Perſecutors. And as the Wicked are thus lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to (and do often meet with) great <hi>Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Troubles;</hi> ſo they're liable to and often meet with,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Great Inward Troubles.</hi> Indeed ſome Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners by long Practiſing of Wickedneſs, have in a Sort benum'd and ſtupifi'd their Conſciences. Their <hi>Conſciences are ſeared as with an hot Iron,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.2. Being <hi>paſt feeling, they give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves over to laſciviouſneſs, to work all unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with greedineſs,</hi> Eph. 4.19. But Sinners dont preſently arrive at ſuch a degree of Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity, and Inſenſibility of Conſcience as this
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:001789_0122_0FB829664A5D36A8"/>
is: they often meet with many a rub and ſting of Conſcience, as they go on in their evil courſes. The very <hi>Heathen</hi> ſometimes had their Thoughts <hi>accuſing of them,</hi> Rom. 2.15. Nor is it eaſy to expreſs the great <hi>Terrors</hi> of Soul, the amazing diſquietments and horrors of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, which the wicked often meet with for their Sins. Iſai. 57.20. <hi>The wicked are like the troubled Sea when it cannot reſt, whoſe waters cast up mire &amp; dirt.</hi> Indeed the wicked often have a Sort of <hi>War between their own Luſts;</hi> tho' they have <hi>not grace &amp; corruption</hi> oppoſing one another, (as the Saints have) yet their Luſts do ſometimes ſo ſtruggle with one another, as to occaſion great diſquietment to them. Griping <hi>Covetouſneſs,</hi> pleads for <hi>Holding faſt</hi> what they already have of the World; and <hi>love</hi> to <hi>vain Company,</hi> humane <hi>Applauſe, Uncleanneſs, Intemperance</hi> and other vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Practices, pleads hard for <hi>diſburſing</hi> what they have, for it's gratification. So that there's often a diſquieting tumultuous War, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their own Luſts. Again, they're often <hi>Diſcontent,</hi> Murmuring, Repining, Fretting at the diſpenſations of Divine Providence; <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ng</hi> the Proſperity of others: now theſe things fill them with uneaſineſs and diſquietment. And the reflections of Conſcience they often have, the Self-condemnings for their ill-Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: theſe are unutterably perplexing to them. They're often ſo diſreſted by their accuſing Conſciences, that they're afraid of themſelves (as it were) afraid to be alone, afraid to give way to any ſerious thinking. Nay they often get into vain Company, take to exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Drinking, and to other ill Practices; on
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:001789_0123_0FB829678C861DA0"/>
purpoſe to ſtiffle the noiſe, ſtill the din, and dull the anguiſh and pain of their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences. And yet all the Methods they uſe, ſometimes can't give them any reſt within; their amazing <hi>horrors</hi> are unutterable, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times wickedly put them upon laying violent hands on themſelves, as did the Curſed Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor <hi>Judas.</hi> Now theſe things which I have mention'd plainly ſhow, that if any think to eſcape Difficulties and Troubles by neglecting to be ſeriouſly Religious, they greatly deceive themſelves: for thoſe who irreligiouſly neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect God, are liable to and often meet with great Troubles Outward and Inward, even in this preſent World, beſides what they juſtly may look for in the next. Wherefore another Anſwer to the <hi>Objection,</hi> about the <hi>Difficulties</hi> and <hi>Sufferings of a Religious Life</hi> may be,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>We are not ſure, that we ſhall meet with great Outward Sufferings for the ſake of Religion.</hi> Tho' if we are Seriouſly and Practically Godly, we may expect <hi>Scoffs</hi> and <hi>Jears</hi> (at leaſt) from ſome of the Ungodly and Prophane; yet we dont know that ever we ſhall be Perſecuted in our <hi>Liberties, Perſons or Eſtates.</hi> God can grant to His Churches, ſuch <hi>Rest</hi> as ſhall be for their <hi>Edifying and Multiplying,</hi> Act. 9.31. God can reſtrain the <hi>Wrath</hi> of Men, and often does ſo. If a Perſon becomes Practically Godly, and leads a long Life of true Piety, yet poſſibly God may preſerve him from bitter and heavy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions all his days. Or poſſibly Death may ſometimes remove the indangered Saint, and ſo take him away from the evil to come: Death
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:001789_0124_0FB829692DEC5CE8"/>
puts the Godly beyond the reach of all Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors. So that although we ſhould Love Chriſt above all Outward Injoyments, and ſhould be willing and ready to part with all of them rather than diſpleaſe Him; yet we dont certainly know that God will ever call us to ſuch a Trial. The Holy Ghoſt does not teſtify to all the Saints, as it did to <hi>Paul;</hi> that <hi>Bonds and Afflictions abide them in every City,</hi> Act. 20.23.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>If we ſhould ſuffer never ſo much for Religion ſake, yet thoſe Sufferings will be but very ſhort.</hi> In general, our whole Life on Earth is but very ſhort, tis a Span, an Hand's Breadth, our days paſs away like a ſwift Ship, like a Tale that's told, like a <hi>vapour that appears for a little while and then vaniſheth away,</hi> Jam. 4.14. If our whole Life ſhould be fill'd with grievous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions for Chriſt's ſake, yet they would be but <hi>very</hi> ſhort. They are called the Sufferings of <hi>this preſent time,</hi> (Rom. 8.18.) and ſaid to be but <hi>for a Moment,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.17. What if our Houſes, Lands, Eſtates ſhould be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by Perſecutors? Why if they were not thus taken away, yet Death would ſoon ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate us from them. If our <hi>Lives</hi> ſhould never be in Danger by <hi>Perſecutors;</hi> yet Death would ſoon end them. We muſt ſoon part with all our <hi>Outward</hi> Injoyments, and Life it ſelf too, whether Perſecutors ever moleſt us or not; ſo that if Perſecutors ſhould take theſe away, we're only depriv'd of them but a <hi>little ſooner</hi> than otherwiſe it might have been. However, all Perſecutions for Chriſt's ſake, will be but
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:001789_0125_0FB8296A693B6798"/>
very ſhort; therefore we ſhould by no means be frighten'd from Duty thereby.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>When the Saints meet with great Sufferings for Religion, they commonly have great Inward Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations at the ſame time.</hi> The Soul is the chief part of Man. It's very certain, that Inward Diſtreſſes are more Grievous than Outward ones: and ſo, Inward Reſt, Eaſe, Quiet in the Mind is far preferable to any Outward Proſperity what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. Now when the Saints meet with Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Sufferings for Religion's ſake; they often have great Inward Eaſe, Quiet, Holy Joy and Satisfaction. The Apoſtles <hi>Rejoyced,</hi> that they were counted <hi>Worthy</hi> to Suffer Shame for the Name of Chriſt. <hi>Act.</hi> 5.41. <hi>As the Sufferings of Chriſt abound in us, ſo our Conſolation alſo abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.5. We Read of <hi>Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Saints,</hi> who <hi>took Joyfully the ſpoiling of their Goods, knowing in themſelves that they had in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a better and an enduring Subſtance,</hi> Heb. 10.34. Though <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> were (for the ſake of Religion) <hi>in Priſon, with their Feet faſtened in the Stocks;</hi> yet ſuch <hi>Inward Joy</hi> they had, that even <hi>at Midnight</hi> they could <hi>Sing Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> to God, as well as <hi>Pray</hi> unto Him, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.24, 25. Perſecuted Saints, have <hi>Gloried in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation,</hi> Rejoyced in their <hi>Grievous Sufferings.</hi> All the Scoffs, Jeers, Reproaches, Loſſes of Eſtate, Impriſonments, Baniſhments, Bodily Pains and Puniſhments they can poſſibly meet with for <hi>Piety</hi>'s ſake, are not ſo <hi>Grievous</hi> and <hi>Afflictive</hi> to them, as 'tis <hi>Pleaſant</hi> and <hi>Joyful</hi> to their Souls, to have their Conſciences Teſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they have had their Converſation in the

World in <hi>Simplicity and Godly Sincerity;</hi> and <hi>their knowing in themſelves, that they have in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a better and an Enduring Subſtance.</hi> Hence they <hi>Chuſe</hi> the Ways of <hi>Piety,</hi> with all the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings that can poſſibly attend them; rather than all the <hi>Profits</hi> and <hi>Pleaſures</hi> of an <hi>Irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Life.</hi> This was <hi>Moſes</hi>'s <hi>Choice,</hi> Heb. 11.25, 26. <hi>Chuſing rather to ſuffer Affliction with the People of God, than to enjoy the Pleaſures of Sin for a ſeaſon: eſteeming the Reproach of Christ greater Riches than the Treaſures of Aegypt; for he had reſpect to the Recompence of Reward.</hi> This was the <hi>Choice</hi> that <hi>Moſes</hi> made; he <hi>Prefer'd</hi> a Life of <hi>True Piety</hi> with all the <hi>Sufferings</hi> that could attend it, to a Life of <hi>Wickedneſs</hi> attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the <hi>Pleaſures of Sin,</hi> the <hi>Honours of a Court,</hi> and the <hi>vaſt Treaſures of Aegypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>It is Abſolutely Neceſſary to be Seriouſly and Practically Religious, in order to eſcape Future End<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Miſeries, and to obtain Future Endleſs Glories.</hi> There can be no reaſonable Doubt or Diſpute, about what's here Aſſerted.

If they ſuffer with Chriſt, they ſhall reign with Him, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.12. Now all the <hi>Perſecutions</hi> any can poſſibly ſuſtain in this World are Small, Light, Trivial, compared to the <hi>Happineſs</hi> they ſhall have hereafter. Rom. 8.18. <hi>For I reckon that the Sufferings of this preſent time, are not worthy to be compared with the Glory which ſhall be revealed in us.</hi> So 2.

Yet in Reply to the preſent Objection, we may here Diſtinctly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That Chriſt Died on Purpoſe to ſave Sinners.</hi> The only Begotten Eternal Son of God, took our Nature into Perſonal Union which Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and in our Nature Died on the Croſs a Sacrifice to God's Juſtice, on purpoſe to ſave Sinners. <hi>He gave himſelf a Ranſom for all,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.6. <hi>He once ſuffered, the Juſt for the Unjuſt that he might bring us to God,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.18. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, 1 Tim. 1.15. <hi>This is a faithful ſaying and worthy of all acceptation, that Chriſt came to ſave Sinners, of whom I am chief.</hi> Tis a moſt true and faithful ſaying (as well as moſt weighty) worthy to be Credited, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd, Rely'd on by all that ever hear it, that Chriſt came to ſave Sinners, even chief Sinners. Chriſt came into the World and Died, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to ſave poor, vile, abominable Sinners, ſuch as deſerv'd no favour, ſuch as deſerv'd
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:001789_0137_0FB82983E8090600"/>
nothing but terrible deſtructive Wrath and Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance from God. Do you Doubt whether Chriſt will ſave vile Sinners? Why He Died on purpoſe to ſave ſuch.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>God ſent His Son Chriſt Jeſus into the World on this very Errand, even to ſave Sinners.</hi> Joh. 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the World, as to give His only Begotten Son; that whoſoever believeth in Him, ſhould not periſh, but ſhould have Everlaſting Life.</hi> God was juſtly Offended with Sinners, yet of His own Heart He had pity on them, a love for their Welfare: therefore that He might without any reflection on His Juſtice and Holineſs make them happy, He ſent His own Eternal Son on purpoſe to purchaſe Salvation for them. <hi>As to Sinners,</hi> this was God's End and Deſign, the thing He aim'd at, even their Salvation; tho' <hi>as to Himſelf,</hi> the Supream End He aim'd at was, the Glory of His own Sovereign Grace. Eph. 1.6. <hi>To the praiſe of the glory of His Grace.</hi> Now ſince twas God's declared End, Aim, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in ſending His Son into the World; Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that all who Believe in Him ſhould be Saved, why ſhould any Doubt of His Willingneſs to ſave ſuch? Even Men, dont care to be put by what they ſtudiouſly aim at and deſign; and ſurely God does not.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>The Scripture plainly declares Christ's Ability and Willingneſs, to ſave all thoſe that trust in Him.</hi> Heb. 7.25. <hi>He is Able to ſave them to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, that come unto God by Him.</hi> Chriſt is an <hi>Able</hi> Saviour, a <hi>Mighty</hi> Saviour, an <hi>Almighty</hi> Saviour.

Him, that's too difficult for Him. There's Vertue enough in His Blood, to cleanſe from the moſt heinous Tranſgreſſions that are truly Repented of, even from <hi>Scarlet Crimſon-coloured Sins,</hi> Iſai. 1.18. His <hi>Blood cleanſeth from all Sin,</hi> 1 Joh. 1.7. And He is as <hi>Willing</hi> as He is <hi>Able,</hi> to ſave all that truſt in Him. He has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſaid, Joh. 6.37. <hi>Him that cometh unto me, I will in no wiſe cast out.</hi> Him that <hi>comes,</hi> be he who or what he will, if the greateſt Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal in the World; if he <hi>comes</hi> to Chriſt by <hi>true Faith,</hi> ſhall by no means be rejected, but ſhall moſt certainly be Saved. Why then ſhould <hi>any</hi> Doubt in this Caſe?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Great Sinners are ſtrongly Invited to Chriſt, and Mercy promis'd to them if they'll come.</hi> Iſai. 55.1. <hi>Ho, every one that thirſteth, come ye to the Waters, and he that hath no Money; come ye, buy and eat; yea, come buy Wine and Milk without Money and without Price.</hi> This is an Invitation to Sinners, to come to Chriſt and accept Salvation freely Offer'd to them; tho' they have <hi>no Money</hi> (nor Money's worth) <hi>no Price</hi> to lay down for the Bleſſings Offer'd. Our Lord Redeemer ſaid, Joh. 7.37. <hi>If any Man thirſt</hi> (any Man, any Sinner whatſoever, tho' never ſo Vile and Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal; if he thirſt, thirſteth after Salvation in the Goſpel way) <hi>let him come unto me and drink.</hi> So, Mat. 11.28. <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt.</hi> All whoſe Sins are grievous and burthenſom to them, are Invited to come unto Chriſt by Faith; and He promiſeth them <hi>reſt</hi> if they'l come.

Why then ſhould any Deſpair? If the worſt of Sinners will heartily come to Chriſt, they ſhall certainly be Saved. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 55.7. <hi>Let the wicked forſake his way and the unrighteous Man his thoughts; and let him turn to the Lord, and He will have Mercy upon him, and to our God for He will abundantly pardon.</hi> The <hi>Wicked,</hi> the <hi>Unrighteous,</hi> (without any Limitation, and therefore) tho' never ſo groſly and ſcandalouſly <hi>Wicked</hi> and <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous,</hi> are call'd upon to <hi>turn</hi> to God. And here's <hi>God's Word</hi> for it, that He will <hi>abundantly pardon</hi> ſuch if they do turn. And the God who ſays theſe things, is a God of Unchangible Truth, <hi>He cannot Lye,</hi> Tit. 1.2.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Very great Sinners have found Mercy and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with God, upon their turning to Him.

was Intreated of him,</hi> 2 Chron. 33.12, 13. <hi>Paul</hi> was a very great Sinner, a Blaſphemer, a fierce and bloody Perſecutor; yet upon his Penitently truſting in Chriſt, he obtained Mercy. He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires the <hi>Saving Mercy</hi> of Chriſt to <hi>himſelf a chief ſinner,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.15. Great Sinners a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Idolaters, Adulterers, Thieves, Drunkards,</hi> &amp;c. obtain'd Pardoning Sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mercy with God thro' Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9. — 11.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>None were ever known to be Rejected, that came to Chriſt for pardoning Mercy.</hi> The Lord has ſaid, He would caſt out none that come, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.37. And twas never known that He acted contrary to this. There was never known ſo much as any one Perſon, in any Place, or Nation, or Age of the World, that ever came to Chriſt; that came Repenting of Sin and Truſting in Him, and was yet Rejected and ſent away Unpardoned. There cannot be given ſo much as any one Inſtance, of any Perſon thus Rejected, among all the Millions of Perſons that have been from the beginning of the World to this very day.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>God is greatly pleaſed with thoſe that Truſt in Him, and pleaſed in ſhowing Favour to them.</hi> God is ſo far from Rejecting any, that Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently Truſt in His Mercy through Chriſt; that indeed He is Pleas'd which them, and takes Pleaſure in doing them Good. <hi>He takes pleaſure in them that Hope in his Mercy,</hi> Pſal. 147.11.

<pb n="138" facs="unknown:001789_0141_0FB8298EA2A20B08"/>
is moſt Pleas'd with thoſe who moſt Humbly and Firmly Hope in His Mercy in Chriſt. <hi>Abraham</hi>'s <hi>ſtrong Faith Glorifyed God,</hi> Rom. 4.20.

When <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> Pray'd to God ſaying, <hi>I beſeech thee ſhew me thy Glory;</hi> God ſaid, I will make all <hi>My Goodneſs</hi> paſs before thee, and will Proclaim the Name of the Lord before thee; and will <hi>be Gracious to whom I will be Gracious: and will ſhew Mercy on whom I will ſhew Mercy,</hi> Exod. 33.18, 19. <hi>Moſes</hi> deſired to ſee God's <hi>Glory,</hi> and God tells Him He will make all His <hi>Goodneſs</hi> paſs before Him, and will be <hi>Gracious,</hi> &amp;c.

Therefore when God Proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed His Name to <hi>Moſes,</hi> 'twas this, Exod. 34.6, 7. <hi>The Lord, the Lord God merciful and gracious, longſuffering, and abundant in goodneſs and truth, keeping Mercy for Thouſands, forgiving Iniquity, Tranſgreſſion and Sin.</hi> This is God's <hi>Name,</hi> Men are commonly known by their Names; God would be always known by this Name of His, even by <hi>His readineſs to forgive Iniquity Tranſgreſſion and Sin,</hi> to all Penitent Believing Sinners.

Oh how Vile is this! No, God won't Deny His Name, Break His Word or Oath, but will ſurely Pardon all True Penitents. He takes <hi>Pleaſure</hi> in doing it. Micah. 7.18. <hi>Who is a God like unto thee, that Pardoneth Iniquity, and paſſeth by the Tranſgreſſion of the Remnant of his Heritage; he retaineth not his Anger for ever, becauſe he delighteth in Mercy.</hi> Zeph. 3.17. <hi>The Lord thy God in the midst of thee is Mighty: He will ſave, he will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Men can't poſſibly Pleaſe and Glorifie God in any thing, like Penitently Hoping in His Mercy through Chriſt for Salvation: When they do thus, they Approve, Acknowledge and Glorifie His Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Holineſs, Grace, Faithfulneſs, even all His Attributes Shining in the Great Affair of Redemption; God takes Abundant Pleaſure in Extending His Saving Mercy to ſuch.</p>

Why they muſt have gone without Corn, and ſtarv'd and periſh'd, for none but <hi>Joſeph</hi> could ſupply them. <hi>Gen.</hi> 41.53 — 57.

Miniſters</hi> who ſeem to be Principally Intended by the <hi>Servant</hi> here ſpoken of. We may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore under this Doctrine take notice:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That Servants ought to Obey their Maſters.</hi> All Perſons are not on a Level; order muſt be upheld in the World. The Superiors in a Family, ſhould be Obeyed by their Inferiors: Parents, and Maſters, by their Children and Servants. The <hi>Centurion</hi> witneſs'd for the <hi>ready</hi> Obedience of his Servants: Mat. 8.9. <hi>I ſay — to my Servant, do this, and he doth it.</hi> And truly ſuch ready Obedience of Servants to their Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, is no more than what Gods word plainly requires. Col. 3.22. <hi>Servants, Obey in all things your Maſters according to the fleſh.</hi> Tit. 2.9. <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort Servants to be Obedient to their own Masters, and to pleaſe them well in all things.</hi> Thus, God the Maker and Maſter of all Men, requires Servants to Obey all the Commands of their Maſters; that is all lawful Commands. For if Maſters or any Superiors among Men, ſhould command their Servants or Inferiors to <hi>Lie, Steal</hi> or commit any wickedneſs; ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands ought not to be obeyed. It's a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rule for ever, concerning all Perſons in the World, that they <hi>ought to obey God rather than men,</hi> Act. 5.29. But on the other hand, the lawful commands of Maſters ought to be Obey'd by their Servants; and of thoſe Servants who Obey them not, we may ſay as in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſe: 1 Theſ. 4.8. <hi>He that deſpiſeth, deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſeth not Man but God.</hi> Thoſe Servants who are Proud, Stubborn, diſobedient to the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful commands of their Maſters; they deſpiſe
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:001789_0150_0FB829A4457A2538"/>
God, trample on His Authority, trample on that order that He has ſet up among Men: they deſerve not only the diſpleaſure of their Maſters, but alſo the wrath of the Lord God Almighty.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Goſpel-Miniſters ſhould faithfully convey the Meſſage, and do the buſineſs that God Orders them.</hi> Thoſe employ'd by God, to declare his Mind and Will to the Children of Men; are eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Intended by <hi>Servants</hi> in this Parable. God requires Miniſters to Invite Sinners to the Goſpel-Feaſt, to Invite them to Chriſt, and Exhort them to live as becomes ſuch. Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſhould faithfully Obey God, in delivering his Important Meſſages unto Men; they ſhould deliver his whole Counſel to them, with-hold nothing from them that might be profitable to them, teſtifying both Repentance towards God and Faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. They ſhould teach them <hi>to deny Ungodlineſs and World ly Lusts, and to live Soberly, Righteouſly, Godly in this preſent evil World,</hi> Tit. 2.12. They ſhould plainly tell Men from Gods word, That <hi>it ſhall go well with the Righteous, they ſhall eat the fruit of their doings; but wo ſhall be to the wicked, for the reward of their hands ſhall be given them.</hi> Iſai. 3.10, 11. Indeed they ſhould plainly tell Men of their Sin and danger, of their Duty and Incouragements to it: they ſhould faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully declare Gods Mind and Meſſage to them, whether they will hear or whether they will forbear, (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 2.7.) And 'tis at their Peril if they neglect thus to warn them.</p>

The Servant in our Text did ſo, <hi>v.</hi> 21. <hi>He ſhewed his Lord theſe things.</hi> So, Miniſters of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel are accountable to God for the whole of their management. Indeed God is the Maker, Lawgiver and Judge of all Men, and therefore <hi>every one of us must give an account of himſelf to God,</hi> Rom. 14.12. <hi>We muſt all appear before the Judgment Seat of God, that every one may receive the things done in the Body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.10. Every humane Perſon is thus accountable to God, for the whole of his Behaviour. So <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> as well as others are accountable to God for the whole of their Behaviour; yea for the whole of their management in their Office-work. They are <hi>Stewards of the Myſteries of God, and it is required of Stewards that a Man be found faithful,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.1, 2. And they muſt alſo <hi>give an account of their Stewardſhip;</hi> muſt be tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their Great Lord and Maſter whether they have been Faithful or not, and muſt be dealt with accordingly. If they have been Faithful in their Office-work, they have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered their own Souls, and ſhall receive a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Reward. If they are Faithful, <hi>they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God a ſweet ſavour of Chriſt, in them that are Saved and in them that Periſh,</hi> 2 Cor. 2.15. But if any Souls Periſh for want of Faithful warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Blood of thoſe Souls will be required at the hands of their Watchmen, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.8.</p>

Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour was <hi>grieved for the hardneſs of Mens hearts,</hi> Mark 3.5.

Some were bettered by his Preaching, and ſome not. And doubtleſs tis thus, with moſt if not all the Faithful Miniſters of Chriſt; ſome ſubmit to the Divine Meſſage they deliver, and ſome ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit not.

                     <q>Lord, I Invited theſe Perſons to come to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Feaſt (as thou didſt Order me) I urg'd them from thy Word to come to Chriſt, told them that <hi>all things were ready</hi> on His part; but yet they would not come: they made <hi>Excuſes,</hi> they made light of the Invitation, and went away one to his Farm &amp; another to his Merchandiſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I did all I could to ſave their Souls, but they were ſo taken up with the Profits, Pleaſures, Honours of a ſinful World, that they would not comply with thy Meſſage which I Faithfully deliver'd to them: as to any good done to theſe Sinners, I have laboured for nought and ſpent my ſtrength in vain.</q>

                  <p>Oh how terrible will it be to Sinners, to have Faithful Miniſters thus teſtifying againſt them to the Great God! The Apoſtle ſays, Heb. 13.17. <hi>Obey them that have the rule over you, and ſubmit your ſelves, for they watch for your Souls as they that must give an account; that they may do it with joy and not with grief, for that will be unprofitable for you.</hi> It's matter of Joy to Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miniſters, when their Indeavours are bleſs'd for ſaving good to Souls. 1 Theſ. 2.19, 20. <hi>For what is our Hope, or Joy, or Crown of Rejoycing?

                  <p>When the Servant in our Text told his Lord, that thoſe Bidden to the Feaſt Refuſed to come; his Lord then ſends him to Invite others, even the <hi>Poor, Maimed, Halt</hi> and <hi>Blind.</hi> God's Grace is Free, He may Offer it to whom He will: He may do what He will with His own. God may <hi>take away</hi> His <hi>Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard</hi> from thoſe who won't <hi>yield Him the Fruit of it,</hi> and <hi>may let it out to others.</hi> If the <hi>Jews</hi> Refuſe Chriſt (He came to His own and His

own Received Him not, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.11.) God may Offer Him to the <hi>Gentiles. Through their Fall Salvation is come unto the Gentiles — The Fall of them is the Riches of the World — The caſting away of them, is the reconciling of the World,</hi> Rom. 11.11, 12, 15. <hi>Is he the God of the Jews only; is he not of the Gentiles alſo; yea of the Gentiles alſo,</hi> Rom. 3.29. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> ſaid to the Contradicting Blaſpheming <hi>Jews, It was neceſſary that the Word of God ſhould firſt have been ſpoken unto you; but ſeeing ye put it from you, and judge your ſelves unworthy of Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Life, lo we turn to the Gentiles,</hi> Act. 13.46. One Nation's Refuſing the Goſpel, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hinder God from ſending it to another: One Town or Family Refuſing of it, cannot hinder it's being ſent to another. If Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion through Chriſt be Refuſed by <hi>Parents</hi> or <hi>Maſters,</hi> this cannot exclude Children or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants from the Offer of it: If Children or Servants Refuſe it, this cannot hinder the Offer being made to their Parents or Maſters. If Salvation be Refuſed by Sober, Civiliz'd Perſons, this cannot hinder the Offer from being made to <hi>Publicans</hi> and <hi>Harlots,</hi> to the moſt Groſs, Scandalous Tranſgreſſors: If it be Refuſed by one Neighbour, this cannot hinder the Offer of it to another.</p>
                  <p>And therefore,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Let none think that God would be really Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd or Indebted to them, if they ſhould Heartily Acce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

own, but what He had a previous Unaliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Right to. It's of His Pleaſure, that all Things are and were Created, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.11. It's of His Free, Sovereign, Overflowing Goodneſs that He has Made Men, that He Preſerves them, beſtows many Outward Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits on them; and that He Offers to ſome of them Free Salvation thro' Chriſt. Let none think therefore, that God can be <hi>Really</hi> or <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly</hi> Beholden or Indebted to them, for any Submiſſion or Obedience they can poſſibly Yield to Him. Indeed He is Pleaſed with thoſe who Heartily Submit to Chriſt: <hi>Takes pleaſure in them that hope in his Mercy,</hi> Pſal. 147.11. But it is of His Infinite Sovereign Grace that He does ſo, not that He is <hi>Really</hi> or <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly</hi> Benefitted by their Hoping aright in His <hi>Mercy.</hi> O Sinner, if thou doſt <hi>Heartily Receive Chriſt as Offered in the Goſpel,</hi> thou art properly the <hi>Gainer</hi> (really Bettered and Benefitted) and not God; thou art <hi>Inconceivably</hi> Indebt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Him, He not at all to thee. And don't think on the other Hand, that God would be <hi>Really</hi> and <hi>Properly</hi> a <hi>Loſer</hi> by thee, if thou ſhouldſt Refuſe Chriſt. For if thou ſhouldſt be thus Wicked, though God would be Diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured and Provoked thereby, yet He would <hi>Eternally Glorifie</hi> His Juſtice in thine Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable <hi>Miſery.</hi> And as for His Sovereign Grace in Chriſt, if that be not Glorifi'd in thy Salvation, becauſe thou doſt Wickedly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe it; yet God can and will Glorifie it in the Salvation of others. Thy Refuſing His Offered Grace and Salvation, cannot hinder Him from Glorifying His Grace in the
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:001789_0158_0FB829B49EFDD298"/>
Salvation of many others. If thou wilt not come to Chriſt when Invited, don't think that God muſt therefore loſe the <hi>Glory of His Grace.</hi> No, No, He can Offer it to others, to the <hi>Poor, Halt, Blind</hi> (and cauſe them to Accept it too if He will) He won't be <hi>Real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> and <hi>Properly</hi> a <hi>Loſer,</hi> a <hi>Sufferer</hi> by thee, if thou ſhouldſt Refuſe His <hi>Gracious Offers.</hi> If thou ſhouldſt be thus Fooliſh and Wicked, He'll Damn thee for it; but He'll find other Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects on which to <hi>Glorifie</hi> His Sovereign Grace.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Let not any Neglect coming to Christ meerly becauſe others Refuſe Him.</hi> In this Parable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining our Text, when ſome Refuſed the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation given them to the Feaſt, the Servant was bidden to Invite others. Oh Sinner, are there ſuch and ſuch of thy Neighbours who Refuſe Chriſt, do they refuſe the Calls of God, the Gracious Invitations of the Goſpel; go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on ſtill in their Wickedneſs, Prophaneneſs, Drunkenneſs, Uncleanneſs, Diſhoneſty, or any <hi>Unholy Practice?</hi> Do they thus Refuſe Chriſt? yet let not this hinder thee from coming. If they <hi>Finally Refuſe</hi> Chriſt, they ſhall not Taſt of God's Supper, of the Feaſt of Salvation they are Invited to, but ſhall Periſh for ever; howbeit, God calls on thee to come. Their Refuſal cannot Excuſe thee, if thou ſhouldſt Neglect coming Their ill Example, cannot Excuſe thee if thou doſt Imitate it. Exod. 23.2. <hi>Thou ſhalt not follow a Multitude to do Evil.</hi> If great Multitudes ſhould Neglect Chriſt, yet do not thou follow them, do not thou
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:001789_0159_0FB82B0FE68B6E80"/>
Act like them. Have no Fellowſhip with the <hi>Unfruitful Works of Darkneſs.</hi> If none in the ſame <hi>Seat</hi> or <hi>Pew</hi> with thee ſhould Submit to Chriſt, yet God bids thee Submit to Him. If thoſe of the ſame <hi>Neighbourhood</hi> with thee, of the ſame Family with thee; yea if the <hi>Wife</hi> of thy Boſom ſhould Refuſe to Accept of Chriſt; yet God bids thee Accept of Him, and their Refuſal cannot poſſibly Excuſe thee if thou Neglect Him. If none in an whole Town or Congregation ſhould Heartily Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of Chriſt, but only one Perſon; then that one would be in the right tho' alone, and all the reſt tho' never ſo numerous, in the wrong. Therefore, Oh Sinner whoever thou art, Man or Woman, Young or Old, Rich or Poor; the Great GOD Calls, Commands, Requires thee, even thee in particular <hi>heartily</hi> to ſubmit to Chriſt as Prince and Saviour. And whether all or any about thee, do ſubmit to this Call or not, yet tis thine indiſpenſable Duty to Obey it. If they ſhould all Refuſe, yet this cannot Excuſe thee if thou ſhouldſt Refuſe: if they ſhould all Periſh for their Unbelief, yet if thou doſt <hi>hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily</hi> ſubmit to Chriſt, thou ſhalt ſurely be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py for ever. <hi>Whoſoever believeth in Him, ſhall not Periſh but ſhall have Everlaſting Life,</hi> Joh. 3.16.</p>

                     <hi>DOCTRINE III.</hi> God is very ready and earnect to offer unto Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners Salvation thro' Chriſt.</head>
                  <p>When the Maſter of the Houſe (in our Text) was Inform'd, that ſome Refus'd the
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:001789_0160_0FB82B131AC45F08"/>
Invitation to his Feaſt; he bade his Servant to go <hi>Quickly,</hi> and bring in others, call others to the Feaſt. Though he was Angry with thoſe who refus'd his Offer'd kindneſs, yet he ſeems reſolved to communicate his Bounty: he had made great and coſtly Proviſion, was unwilling it ſhould be loſt, and ſeems <hi>uneaſy</hi> and <hi>in haſt</hi> as it were, till he could find thoſe who would accept his Offer'd Bounty. Indeed (as we ſhew'd but now) God needs not any of His Creatures, cannot be <hi>properly</hi> Indebted to thoſe who accept Goſpel Offers, nor <hi>really</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly</hi> a Loſer by thoſe that refuſe them. And further, we ſhould not entertain unbecoming Conceptions of God, not think Him ſubject to any Uneaſy, Reſtleſs, Troubleſom Paſſions or Affections as Men are. His Eſſential Glory and Felicity is always the ſame. It can't be Interrupted, Diminiſhed, or Increaſed. <hi>He is the Lord and changeth not — There's no variable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs nor ſhadow of turning with him,</hi> Mal. 3.6. Jam. 1.17. Yet many things are ſpoken of and by God, after the manner of Men; the better to help our Conceptions of Him. So when the Maſter of the Houſe (mention'd in our Text) ſays, <hi>go Quickly</hi> and call others to the Feaſt, it ſeems to Intimate,</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>As tho' Gods Heart were full of Love and Grace, as tho' He were Earneſtly ſet and bent to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate of His Salvation to poor Sinners; as tho' He could ſcarce find Eaſe or Reſt in Himſelf, till he could find ſome vent for His overflowing good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Bounty, and find ſome who would open the Doors of their hearts, to let Chriſt and Salvation

into them. <hi>Go Quickly,</hi> as if He ſhould ſay, Tho' ſome Refuſe my Goſpel Grace, yet it ſhall not be in vain, I wont have it loſt, it ſhall take Effect ſomewhere, go Speedily and make the Offers of it: I'm even in Travail and Pain, as it were, till I am extending and diffuſing of my Goſpel Grace to ſome or other.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And indeed this is but agreable to other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Expreſſions, which tell us, <hi>God delights in Mercy,</hi> Mic. 7.18. He's greatly delighted and rejoyced, in the Communications of His Mercy. 2 Pet. 3.9. <hi>The Lord is not ſlack concerning His Promiſe, as ſome Men count ſlackneſs, but is long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering to usward, not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to Repentance.</hi> Iſai. 30.18. <hi>And therefore will the Lord wait that He may be Gracious unto you, and therefore will He be exalted that He may have Mercy upon you; for the Lord is a God of Judgment, bleſſed are all they that wait for Him.</hi> The Lord <hi>waits that He may be gracious,</hi> watches and longs as it were, for an Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to extend of His Saving Grace to Poor Sinners. And therefore thoſe who <hi>Refuſe</hi> it, are repreſented as <hi>grieving</hi> and <hi>troubling</hi> of Him. He's <hi>griev'd</hi> for the hardneſs of their Hearts, (Mark 3.5.) <hi>vex'd</hi> when they <hi>rebel,</hi> Iſai. 63.10. He is <hi>preſſed under them</hi> (by reaſon of their Sins and Rebellions) <hi>as a Cart is preſſed that is full of Sheaves,</hi> Amos 2.13. Oh the amazing Love, Grace and Patience of God!

them to come in. Miniſters ſhould <hi>compel</hi> Sinners to come to Chriſt, that is, be very Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous, Preſſing, Urgent with them to come. It does not mean, that they ſhould uſe any Outward means of Force, Violence or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion. Chriſt came to <hi>ſave men from their ſins — to bleſs them in turning them from their iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> Mat. 1.21. Act. 3.26. No Outward Force or Violence can do any thing in this Work. If by Outward Penalties, Fines, or any External Violence, Perſons ſhould be frighted and forced to Read God's Word, hear it Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to attend Prayer, or any other Religious Exerciſes; yet all this Outward Force could not of it ſelf effect any real change in their Souls, any Repentance of Sin, Faith in Chriſt or Union to Him. Neither are Miniſters Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized by Chriſt, to uſe any Outward For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible means at all in this matter. The Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Method they are to take, is to Preach the Goſpel, <hi>Preach the Word,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.2. They are to tell Sinners plainly from God's Word, that if they <hi>Believe and are Baptized they ſhall be Saved, if they Believe not they ſhall be Damned.</hi> So their Commiſſion runs, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. When Chriſt ſent forth His Miniſters to Preach, and any refus'd to receive them or their Doctrine, even in that caſe they were not to uſe Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Violence, but to leave them, <hi>Shaking off the Duſt of their Feet as a Witneſs againſt them,</hi> Mat. 10.14, 15. This Method <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas</hi> took, when the Jews outragiouſly oppos'd them, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.51. They us'd no Outward Violence, the Apoſtle therefore declares, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. The Weapons of our Warfare <hi>are not

Carnal,</hi> but Mighty thro' God to the pulling down of ſtrong holds, &amp;c. They <hi>us'd no Carnal Weapons,</hi> or Outward Violence to ſpread the Goſpel and win Souls to Chriſt; but only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd the Revelations of God's Will, Urging Men to comply therewith, which Spiritual Means God bleſs'd (when He ſaw meet) to pull down the ſtrong holds of Sin &amp; Satan in the Souls of Men, and ſo to the Converting of Sinners to Chriſt. So that <hi>no Outward Force or Violence</hi> can be meant, by the <hi>Compulſion</hi> here ſpoken of. The Word here rendred <hi>Compel,</hi> comes from a Word that ſignifies <hi>neceſſity:</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters ſhould <hi>neceſſitate</hi> Sinners to come to Chriſt; that is, they ſhould indeavour to ſhow them the <hi>abſolute neceſſity of it,</hi> and ſo be Urgent and Sollicitous in Reaſoning with them, in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting and Perſwading of them to come to Chriſt for Life. We have already mention'd ſeveral Reaſons, why Miniſters ſhould be <hi>ſpeedy</hi> in Exhorting Sinners Heartily to give up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Chriſt; the ſame Reaſons ſhould quicken to be very <hi>Earneſt, Preſſing, Urgent</hi> in the Work. Therefore</p>

fully to convince them, that they are ſinful by Nature and Practice, and ſo do moſt juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Eternal Plagues and Puniſhments from God. That God, the one Lawgiver who alone can Save or Deſtroy, has given His Son Chriſt Jeſus, to ſave Sinners; and has plainly ſtated the termes, declaring that Perſons muſt Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily Repent of their Sins, Believe in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, truſt in His Righteouſneſs alone for Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, give up themſelves to be conſtantly and heartily Obedient to Him, as ever they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to eſcape Hell and enter into Heaven.

Born of the Spirit, to become New Creatures, and to commence and maintain a conſtant Mortal <hi>War</hi> againſt all their Luſts and Corruptions; and to become <hi>Sincerely, Diligently, Conſtantly</hi> Holy in Heart and Life, ſhowing them the abſolute neceſſity of theſe things, they ſhould <hi>Exhort, Urge, Perſwade, Intreat</hi> them to be reconciled to God, to flee from the Wrath to come and lay hold on Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life. To this end, they ſhould ſet forth the Fulneſs of Chriſt, the All-ſufficiency of His Meritorious Righteouſneſs to ſave all that Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently truſt in Him, the Freeneſs and Readineſs of Divine Grace to receive all ſuch. They ſhould <hi>Urgently</hi> Exhort and Direct them, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend all <hi>proper</hi> means for their Spiritual Good, to avoid as carefully what tends to <hi>Blind Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> and <hi>Destroy</hi> them; and to Pray moſt <hi>Earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> and <hi>Conſtantly</hi> to God, for the efficacious ſaving Influences of His Good Spirit.</p>

                     <hi>Fullneſs</hi> and <hi>Sufficiency</hi> in Himſelf. Our Lord once ſaid, Luk. 8.46. <hi>I perceive that Vertue is gone out of me.</hi> Though He perceived, that Vertue <hi>went out</hi> to <hi>Heal</hi> that Woman that touch'd Him; yet He did not perceive that there was any thing leſs of <hi>Vertue</hi> remaining in Him. 'Tis ſaid, Luk. 6.19. <hi>The whole Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude ſought to touch him: for there went Vertue out of him and he Healed them all.</hi> He had <hi>Vertue</hi> enough to Heal <hi>All</hi> that touch'd Him, yet this <hi>Vertue</hi> was nothing Diminiſh'd by it's Healing of Multitudes. Chriſt is <hi>full of Grace and Truth,</hi> Joh. 1.14. Many Things that are <hi>Full</hi> are capable of being <hi>Emptied;</hi> but Chriſt cannot be at all Emptied of <hi>Grace and Truth.</hi> Col. 1.19. <hi>It hath pleaſed the Father, that all Fullneſs ſhould dwell in him.</hi> It <hi>Dwells,</hi> Abides, Continues in Chriſt; ſo that tho' He ſaves <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> yet there is ſtill as great a Fullneſs to ſave <hi>more,</hi> as ever there was to ſave <hi>any. Joſeph</hi> in <hi>Aegypt</hi> had vaſt Stores and Treaſures of <hi>Corn,</hi> yet they were bounded limited Treaſures, though they laſted <hi>long</hi> and fed <hi>many,</hi> yet they could not laſt <hi>always</hi> nor feed <hi>all:</hi> The more was taken out of thoſe Stores, ſo much the leſs remained in them. Tis not ſo with Chriſt, who has <hi>Stores</hi> of Food for the Souls of Men. There are <hi>Unſearchible Riches in Chrict,</hi> Eph. 3.8. There's no ſearching out the Compleat Height and Depth, Length and Breadth of the Fullneſs and Sufficiency of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>All Old-Teſtament Saints, all New-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Saints hitherto have been Waſhed, Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, Sanctifyed <hi>in the Name of the Lord Jeſus and by the Spirit of our God;</hi> and yet Chriſt is

ſtill as full and Able for ſuch Work <hi>as ever</hi> He was. His Blood is as full of Saving <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, Worth</hi> and <hi>Efficacy Now,</hi> as on the Day it was <hi>Poured forth on the Croſs;</hi> or as it was when <hi>Three Thouſand</hi> were <hi>Converted</hi> in one Day, Act. 2.41. <hi>The Blood of Jeſus Cleanſeth from all Sin,</hi> 1 Joh 1.7. This was a <hi>Truth</hi> in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles Days, and tis as much a <hi>Truth</hi> now <hi>as ever</hi> it was: The <hi>Vertue</hi> of that moſt Precious Blood is nothing Diminiſhed. Chriſt is able to ſave <hi>to the Uttermoſt,</hi> thoſe that come to God by Him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. It may ſignify, not only His <hi>Ability</hi> to ſave a Sinner <hi>Perfectly,</hi> to <hi>Begin</hi> His Salvation and <hi>Carry it on</hi> till it's <hi>Compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Finiſhed;</hi> but alſo the <hi>Continuance</hi> of His <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> to ſave. He is fully able <hi>Evermore,</hi> or <hi>as long as the World ſtands,</hi> Compleatly to ſave all that come to God <hi>by Him,</hi> be they who they will, or never ſo many. His <hi>Blood</hi> is the <hi>Blood of God,</hi> it <hi>Purchaſed the Church,</hi> Act. 20.28. Not only a few <hi>Particular Sinners,</hi> but the <hi>Whole Church,</hi> the whole Number of all that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have Believed or ever ſhall Believe in Him. If all Perſons now in the World, would <hi>Heartily Repent of Sin</hi> and <hi>Believe in Chriſt,</hi> all their Sins ſhould be fully Waſh'd away in His Blood. Joh. 3.16. <hi>Whoſoever Believeth in him, ſhall not Periſh but have Everlaſting Life.</hi> As there is Vertue enough in Chriſt's Blood, to Waſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Sins of all <hi>True Believers;</hi> ſo Chriſt has <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and Knowledge enough, to Lead and Guide all His Sheep through all the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Difficulties of this World, till he brings them to Glory. <hi>In him are hid all the Treaſures of Wiſdom and Knowledge,</hi> Col. 2.3.
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:001789_0182_0FB829BFA82BF750"/>
He alſo has <hi>Power and Might</hi> Sufficient, to Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh all His and His Peoples Enemies. He has Deſtroyed him that had the Power of Death, that is the Devil, — and Triumph'd over Him (<hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.15.) He is ſtronger than the ſtrong Man Armed. The Gates of Hell ſhall never prevail againſt His Church: None ſhall ever pluck His Sheep out of His Hand. He can make the Weakeſt of His Saints, to be more than <hi>Conquerors.</hi> He can out of the Unſearchible Stores of Grace in Himſelf, give forth unwearied Recruits and Supplies to all His Saints, to all the Branches that are in Him. <hi>Paul</hi> could do all Things <hi>through Christ that strengthen'd him,</hi> Phil. 4.13. So the ſame Lord Jeſus can ſtrengthen all His Saints to Duty. They that <hi>wait on the Lord ſhall renew their ſtrength, they ſhall run and not be weary, walk and not faint,</hi> Iſa. 40.31. Their Redeemer can ſtrengthen them with ſtrength in their Souls; if they are ready to fall he can uphold them. <hi>He giveth Power to the Faint, and to them that have no Might he increaſeth ſtrength,</hi> Iſa. 40.29. He has all Power in Heaven and Earth committed to Him, and therefore can Guide His Saints by Counſel till he brings them to Glory. Yea, He has a fulneſs of <hi>Love, Grace, Good Will</hi> thus to do for all that come to Him. He <hi>Loved</hi> them and Waſhed them from their Sins in His own Blood, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.5. This moſt <hi>Free Love</hi> of His to them is <hi>Unchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible.</hi> Having loved His own, he loved them <hi>to the End,</hi> Joh. 13.1.

Earth; after Death he had no more any Good Things, he was utterly Deſtitute of every Good Thing whatſoever, could not obtain ſo much as <hi>one Drop of Water</hi> to cool his Inflamed, Tormented Tongue. He had no Comfort, but was filled with Torment.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>The Damned will have the worſt Companions that can be in their Miſery.</hi> The Damned will be ill Companions to one another, and Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs (one way or other) help to promote each others Miſery. The Wicked often love one another's Company in this World, but Doubtleſs they will rather dread it in Hell, but cannot avoid it. Will they not Dread to hear the Doleful Groans, Piercing Cries and Screetches of Damned, Tormented Wretches; and to hear the Curſes and Upbraidings of their former Wicked Companions? But Damned Men muſt not only Company with one another which Doubtleſs will increaſe their Miſery; but muſt alſo be Plagued and Tormented with Devils forever. The Devils are Apoſtate Spirits, Apoſtate Angels, Impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Enemies to God and Men; they are full of Murder, Malice, Spite and moſt Curſed Rage; theſe Tygers, theſe Roaring Lions of Hell; Damned Men muſt be with for ever and ever. The <hi>Sentence</hi> to be Pronounc'd againſt them is that, Mat. 25.41. <hi>Depart from me ye Curſed, into Everlaſting Fire prepared for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and his Angels.</hi> When the Angels Sinned, God was ſo Provoked with them that He ſpared them not; He preſently put them into Chains of Darkneſs reſerving them
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:001789_0190_0FB82AA62146D068"/>
to the Judgment of the Great Day. And theſe Curſed Rebels, from the very firſt of their Apoſtacy till the <hi>Great Day of Judgment</hi> comes; are with all their <hi>Might, Power, Policy</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the Honour and Glory of God as far as poſſibly they can: And has not (think you) the Infinitely <hi>Holy</hi> and <hi>Powerful</hi> GOD, prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Terrible <hi>Torments</hi> for ſuch Early, Obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate long Continued Rebels as they are? Yes moſt certainly. Well, with theſe Damned Devils, Damned Men muſt have their part for ever. How far theſe Tormented Devils will be <hi>Inſtrumental</hi> in Tormenting of Damned Men, no Tongue of Man can Declare. Doubtleſs theſe Devils full of all Spite Malice and Rage, will <hi>Inconceivably Vex, Plague</hi> and <hi>Torment</hi> them. When Satan was permitted, how <hi>Grievouſly</hi> did he Torment the <hi>Body</hi> of Holy <hi>Job</hi> for a while? When he was permitted to to <hi>take Poſſeſſion</hi> of ſome Perſons, he made them Wander about <hi>Night and Day, in Mountains and Tombs, crying and cutting themſelves with Stones,</hi> Mark. 5.5. He <hi>often threw them into the Fire, and often into the Water,</hi> Mat. 17.15. And if his Limited, Chained Rage wrought ſuch Terrible Effects as theſe; what will he do to the Damned in Hell, when all Reſtraints are taken from his Malice, and Damned Men intirely given up to ſuffer Vengeance? Doubtleſs, when God gives up the Wicked to the full Blow of His Holy Wrath and Vengeance, He'll ſuffer exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated Devils, to be Inſtrumental of Inconcei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable <hi>Perplexity</hi> and <hi>Vexation</hi> to them. And as for thoſe who Pariſh from under the Goſpel, how Terribly may the Devil Twit them, Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid

them, and Triumph over them? May they not ſay to them?</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>By our own Folly we have brought our ſelves into this Miſery, but you are greater Fools than we. When are Sinned, no Remedy was propoſed to us, no Salvation was ever Offered us; but you had Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion through Chriſt Offered to you, and you would not Accept it. God waited to be Gracious to you, He uſed long Patience; He often call'd on you by you Parents, Maſters, Neighbours, Miniſters, by the checks and awakenings of your own Conſciences, by the Motions and Strivings of His Spirit; but you refuſed all theſe. Salvation ſtood long (as it were) Knocking at your Door for Entrance, yet you would not Open and let it in, yet you Refuſed. We Devils never ſhow'd ſuch Folly as this, we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Refuſed Salvation for it was never Offered to us. Oh you Fools, you that miſs'd of Salvation, of a Glorious Crown and Kingdom for the ſake of empty Trifies; now reap the fruit of your own Folly, the fruit of your own doings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>If the Devils ſhould thus upbraid Damned Men, and their awakened Conſciences bear the ſame teſtimony, and as a never dying Worm graw upon them, filling them with ſuch Self-condemning Reflections; how unutterably Tormenting muſt this needs be?</p>

on the Veſſels of Wrath. That time therefore is called with reſpect to the Wicked, <hi>The day of Wrath, and the Revelation of the Righteous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God,</hi> Rom. 2.5.

                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Their Puniſhment will be Eternal.</hi> In this World, it's often a relief to thoſe in great Pain or Trouble, to <hi>hope</hi> that it wont laſt long: if it were not for hope the heart would break. Well, but the Torments of the Damned, will never have any end at all: they'l have no Intermiſſion, Mitigation, nor Ceſſation for ever. Their Miſery is call'd, <hi>Everlaſting Puniſhment,</hi> Mat. 25.46. <hi>Everlaſting Destruction,</hi> 2 Theſ. 1.9.

                  <p>Thus I have indeavoured in ſome Meaſure to ſhow, that the Future Miſery of the Damned will be exceeding great; but how Great, how Terrible, no Tongue of Man can tell. The Scripture ſets it forth by thoſe things, which are moſt Terrible to the preſent apprehenſion of our Senſes; but twill be never fully under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood till fully endured. The Scripture ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſets forth the Future Glory of the Saints, by thoſe things which are commonly moſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lu'd and eſteem'd by Men in this World, as by a <hi>Crown,</hi> a <hi>Kingdom,</hi> an <hi>Inheritance,</hi> &amp;c. and yet it ſays, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.2. <hi>It doth not yet appear what we ſhall be.</hi> Notwithſtanding all that's ſaid about the Future Glory of the Saints; yet it does not fully appear at preſent, how Great
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:001789_0195_0FB82AB164A2BD08"/>
and Eminent it will be. Eye has not ſeen, nor Ear heard, nor has it entred into the Heart of Man fully to conceive at preſent; the good things God has prepar'd for them that love Him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. So, notwithſtanding all that's ſaid about the Future Miſery of the Damned; yet it does not fully appear at preſent, how Great and Terrible it will be. Eye has not ſeen, nor Ear heard, nor can the Heart of Man at preſent fully conceive, what Rivers, what Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting Floods of Divine Vengeance will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be poured out on the Ungodly. Yet all this Inconceivable Miſery, will moſt certainly be the Portion of all that refuſe Chriſt, &amp; neglect the Great Salvation Offer'd to them. Surely then we ſhould bethink our ſelves, we ſhould flee from this Terrible Wrath which is to come. If we ſhould Periſh from under the Goſpel, our Condition will be more terrible than theirs of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah.</hi> If we ſhould Periſh, how terrible will it be, to conſider of and reflect on our own Folly and Wickedneſs. To conſider how long we liv'd under the Goſpel, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Precious Offers of Salvation we had, how frequently and fervently we were urg'd to mind the welfare of our Souls, and yet that we Fooliſhly and Wickedly neglected the things of our Peace in the time of them; Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, no Heart can conceive the Anguiſh, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, Horror that will be produc'd by ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections. To think, if we had heartily Obey'd the Goſpel as many others did, we ſhould now have been in Glory as well as they, with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Iſaac, Jacob, the Holy Prophets</hi> and all Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Believers; but Fools, Wretches, Self-Deſtroyers,
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:001789_0196_0FB82AB5E1F7B978"/>
Self-Murderers that we were, we gave way to the Temptations of Satan, the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of our own Hearts; were more fond of Shadows, Trifles, Momentany Vanities, than of Eternal Bleſſedneſs; by this our Folly and Wickedneſs, we have loſt Inconceiveable Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Glories, and brought on our ſelves theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable Plagues that can never be got rid of; I ſay, ſuch Reflections as theſe will be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceiveably Tormenting. Let all of us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be in good Earneſt about our Souls, ſearch and try our ways and turn to the Lord. Let us with utmoſt Speed, Sincerity and Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, Repent of all our Sins, Submit to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt on Goſpel Terms, Imploying all that we are and have for Him: if we thus do, it ſhall be well with us for ever. If we thus do, then, <hi>When Chriſt who is our Life ſhall appear, we alſo ſhall appear with Him in Glory,</hi> Col. 3.4. But if we neglect Chriſt, our Doom is that, Pſal. 9.17. <hi>The Wicked ſhall be turned into Hell, with all the Nations that forget God.</hi>
