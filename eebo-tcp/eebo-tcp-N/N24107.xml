            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN INAUGURAL DISSERTATION.</head>
            <p>IN Auguſt, 1796, the town of Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton was viſited with a contagious diſeaſe of unuſual malignancy, the circumſtances and marks of which were ſuch as threatened great ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity; and the alarm ſpread, and became almoſt univerſal. This ſtill increaſed, on obſerving that in many of its ſymptoms it bore great reſemblance to the fever which had ſo recently raged at Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia and New-York.</p>
            <p>IN the preceding fall and winter, inflammatory diſeaſes were frequent in Boſton, and in many of the towns in the country, particularly the ſcarlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, ſcarlatina, anginoſa, and meaſles. And in the months of June, July and Auguſt, or immediately previous to the diſeaſe we have mentioned, a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of dyſentery was frequent; and now and then
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:031881_0003_0FEF09305EFF1AB8"/>
caſes of cholera morbus occurred. Theſe were in ſome places unuſually mortal, and prevailed more or leſs in different parts of Boſton till the time of the bilious fever; after which they were known no more.</p>
            <p>BEFORE entering more particularly on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the <hi>fever,</hi> I ſhall introduce ſome obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the effects of <hi>poiſons,</hi> and their laws of operation on the human ſyſtem.</p>
            <div type="observations">
               <head>OF POISONS.</head>
               <p>THESE are ſubſtances which either inſtantly deſtroy the life of a part or parts of the ſyſtem, or change the natural functions into morbid actions; and thereby, ſuddenly or by degrees, affect the whole conſtitution.</p>
               <p>THEY are either <hi>mineral, vegetable,</hi> or <hi>animal.</hi>—The damps or mephitic vapours often met with in mines and deep wells, are <hi>mineral poiſons.</hi> Of <hi>vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table poiſons</hi> we have a remarkable inſtance in the Bohan Upas, which grows on the iſland of Java, belonging to the Dutch. It is ſo deſtructively poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous, we are told, as that the ſoil for ſeveral miles in circumference is whitened with the bones of birds and animals, that have been arreſted while attempting to paſs through the atmoſphere of this ſhrub of death. <hi>Animal poiſons</hi> are of two kinds;
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:031881_0004_0FEF09334229ECB0"/>
original, as that ſecreted by the viper; and ſuch as are generated by diſeaſe. The latter are, by Mr. Hunter, and afterwards by others, denominated <hi>morbid poiſons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>POISONS are communicated either in a gaſſous or vaporous ſtate; or by contact, in the form of pus, or ulcerous matter. Fevers are an example of the former, the venerea of the latter.</p>
               <p>THE conſtitution is never affected, or never takes on the morbid action of the poiſon, except it be in a ſtate of <hi>prediſpoſition.</hi> Thus, at the time of any raging epidemic, the <hi>miaſma</hi> or putrid effluvia is generally diſperſed, and different ages, ſexes and conſtitutions are alike expoſed; yet comparatively but few will be infected, while the others eſcape. How the ſame conſtitution ſhould poſſeſs different ſuſceptibilities to diſeaſe, is beſt underſtood from Dr. Brown and Dr. Darwin.</p>
               <p>ANIMAL exiſtence, according to Dr. Brown, is endowed with a quality which he names <hi>excitability,</hi> and Dr. Darwin <hi>the ſpirit of animation,</hi> or <hi>ſenſorial power,</hi> on which the phenomena of life depend. Every thing which ſupports life, exerts itſelf on this principle; and <hi>vice verſa.</hi> It is capable of different degrees of accumulation and exhauſtion: it is accumulated by the abſtraction of ſtimuli, and is exhauſted by exceſſive ſtimuli, or the long appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of others acting more moderately. A due proportion between the exciting powers, ſuch as
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:031881_0005_0FEF0934F1EAD2E8"/>
heat, food, air, mental exertion, &amp;c. and the excita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility or ſenſorial power, conſtitutes health; and every variation from either is diſeaſe.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>"There is, they ſay, and I believe there is,</l>
                  <l>A ſpark within us of th' immortal fire,</l>
                  <l>That animates and moulds the groſſer frame,</l>
                  <l>And when the body ſinks, eſcapes to heaven,</l>
                  <l>Its native ſeat.</l>
                  <l>Meanwhile this heav'nly particle pervades</l>
                  <l>The mortal elements,—</l>
                  <l>And in its ſecret conclave, as it feels</l>
                  <l>The body's woes and joys, this ruling pow'r</l>
                  <l>Wields at its will the dull material world,</l>
                  <l>And is the body's health or malady."</l>
               </lg>
               <p>WITH many diſeaſes of the variolous kind, there is a certain period between the time the infection is received, and the appearance of the diſeaſe; and in this interval ſcarce any alteration in the actions of life can be perceived. Thus, in the caſual ſmall pox, we find a ſpace of about twelve days between the reception of the poiſonous effluvia and the firſt ſymptoms of the diſeaſe. Travellers fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently leave the country where they received the miaſma of ague, long before any ſymptoms of it appear; yet the diſpoſition having been formed, and the poiſon received, the diſeaſe after a certain period makes its appearance.</p>
               <p>IT ſometimes happens, that after the diſpoſition is given and the poiſon received into the ſyſtem, the period of eruption, or the time when the diſeaſe
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:031881_0006_0FEF093B73FD47C8"/>
uſually appears, is protracted beyond the uſual time, in conſequence of the action of other diſeaſes, as the meaſles, ſcrophula, &amp;c. This is confirmed by various hiſtories of the ſmall pox.</p>
               <p>FURTHER—We have great reaſon to believe, that not only the morbid action or ſymptoms of a diſeaſe may be ſuſpended, but alſo that the <hi>ſuſcepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> may be entirely prevented after the poiſon is applied. There is a ſtriking proof of this afforded us in the effect of the Harmattan wind, as recorded in the Philoſophical Tranſactions of London.—Seventy negroes were inoculated for the <hi>ſmall pox</hi> three days after the Harmattan ſet in: none of them had the ſymptoms of the diſeaſe. In a few weeks afterwards, fifty of the ſame were inoculated, and had the diſeaſe; the reſt had taken it in the natural way. Here, though the infectious matter was applied to ſeventy, all of them (as appeared af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards) conſtitutionally ſuſceptible of the diſeaſe, yet even the local diſpoſition was ſuperceded, and of courſe the conſtitution was not infected.<note n="*" place="bottom">Adams on the phagedena, &amp;c.</note>
               </p>
               <p>THE immediately preceding propoſitions are in proof of a medical axiom eſtabliſhed by Dr. Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <abbr>viz.</abbr> That the conſtitution never ſupports the operation of two diſtinct diſeaſes at the ſame time.</p>
               <p>IT is a law with moſt of thoſe poiſons which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce their effects by a <hi>critical fever,</hi> that a conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which has once gone through the action ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by them, is no longer ſuſceptible of it. This
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:031881_0007_0FEF093EAD400BA0"/>
is accounted for upon the principle, that the poiſon is ſo powerful and active as to deſtroy the ſenſibility or life of the part; or that the conſtitution becomes habituated to the particular ſtimuli of the poiſon, and therefore upon a ſecond application to the part or parts of the ſyſtem, they are undiſturbed by or are inſenſible to it. This will account for the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and ſeemingly miraculous diſappearance of epidemics, as was the caſe at Philadelphia and New-York; for all thoſe who had a ſuſceptibility to the diſeaſe have taken it and are not liable to be again affected by it, and thoſe who have not this ſuſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibility cannot receive it; of courſe, the prevalence of the diſeaſe muſt ſuddenly ceaſe.</p>
               <p>POISONS, miaſma or morbific effluvia are of too ſubtle a nature for chemical analyſis; their conſtit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent materials, and the prevailing or diſtinguiſhing principle of each, whether an acid or an alkali, ſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton or nitrous acid gas, or any other gas, is totally unknown.</p>
               <p>VENEREAL and phagedenic poiſons, though in the form of fluid diſcharge and ſubject to obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and even to be experimented upon; yet it is equally unknown what material quality conſtitutes their nature, and renders them capable of their ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cific effects. Do not moſt poiſons contain a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of life, which occaſions their activity, and by means of which their deleterious effects are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, when taken into the human ſyſtem?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="unknown:031881_0008_0FEF09405C77BC28"/>
Dr. Hunter has long ſince diſcovered and dem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onſtrated that the digeſtive organs have no power over ſubſtances which have within them the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of life. There are many circumſtances which render probable this opinion reſpecting poiſons, contagious ones in particular. In the <hi>itch,</hi> animal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culae are probably the cauſe of this affection. And why may not the <hi>ſyphilis</hi> be produced in a ſimilar manner, <abbr>viz.</abbr> by an accumulated and mixed quantity of ſeminal animalculae lodged in thoſe reſervoirs and receſſes peculiar to the parts concerned? Lodged in this abundance, they may by their own activity inſinuate into the ſyſtem, and form nidi; or they may become putrid, and thus produce the ſpecific venom of the ſyphilitic diſeaſe. Thus alſo with other animalculae, introduced by reſpiration or cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular abſorption.</p>
               <p>IN the tropical regions, where death has almoſt an undiſputed reign, the atmoſphere is generally loaded with myriads of animalculae; ſo much ſo, at certain times in the rainy ſeaſons, as nearly to ſuffocate the inhabitants. It is then that diſeaſes moſtly prevail. Life is always found where there is a congeniality of matter for its reception; and every object in nature, animate and inanimate, healthy or diſeaſed, has its particular ſphere of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halation. This exhalation <hi>always</hi> partakes of the nature and life of its ſubject.</p>
               <p>HOWEVER homogenous poiſons are while they form the atmoſphere of the ſubject from whence
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:031881_0009_0FEF09420201C370"/>
they were exhaled; yet being in contact with other ſpheres of exhalation, they are blended with other ſubſtances which form the common atmoſphere; and at length are ſo equilibriated, by entering into new forms and ſtates, as to loſe their activity and power to injure.</p>
               <p>IT is a univerſal truth, equally applicable to poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as to other things, that the more ſimple and homogenous a ſubſtance is, the more powerful and active; and <hi>vice verſa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE atmoſphere in which we live is made up of exhalations from every individual ſubſtance in all the three kingdoms of nature—the animal, vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and mineral: theſe ſubſtances form a perpet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual intermediation of <hi>leſs</hi> and <hi>more ſubtle,</hi> until they reach the ſun himſelf, the great ſenſorium of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial nature, which by them is nouriſhed and fed, in return for the activity which it imparts. Our atmoſphere, in all its extent, becomes blended alſo with the atmoſpheres of other planets, and they, in union, form one common atmoſphere of the whole ſyſtem. This idea might be extended ſo far as to form one general atmoſphere for the univerſe; but this would be filling up Newton's VACUUM, which might expoſe us to the imputation of philoſophical ſcepticiſm.</p>

to periodic returns and regular intervals, <abbr>viz.</abbr> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termittent fevers, the various ſpecies of maenorrhagia, epiſtaxis, and haemorrhois. A late writer has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that the paroxyſms of fevers ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a greater degree of violence about the full and change of the moon, that is to ſay, about three days and an half before and after, including at each period a ſpace of about ſeven days, than during the interval between theſe periods. Alſo—That the paroxyſms of fevers occurring during the periods deſcribed, are conſtantly more violent about mid-day and midnight, than during the intervals between theſe ſpaces.—That ſome remarkable abatement in the violence of the paroxyſm never fails to take place, upon the expiration of the full and change of the moon.—That the paroxyſms of fevers, whilſt they abate in violence upon the expiration of the full and change, ſhift alſo their attack to a later hour.—That epilepſy, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanity, paralytic affections, aſthmas, phthiſical coughs, with a variety of other complaints, often aſſumed an intermittent form, and returned regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly with the full and change of the moon, and diſappeared or diminiſhed during the intervals.</p>
               <p>THIS ſol-lunar influence has been noticed by the ingenious author of Zoonomia; and perhaps better accounted for than by any predeceſſor.</p>
               <p>MOST of the above obſervations are capable of ſatisfactory proof, and have long been acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the beſt medical writers; ſo that they may be
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:031881_0011_0FEF094BEA739590"/>
conſidered as ſo many medical axioms. They may be of uſe in conſidering our ſubject—on which I now enter.</p>
               <p>I HAVE obſerved, that the fever, when it made its firſt appearance, ſhewed ſtrong marks of malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy. The patient, after ſome hours of unuſual dullneſs or dead heavy ſenſation in the head, and great reluctance for any voluntary motion, felt great commotion and uneaſineſs at the ſtomach, which conſtantly increaſed till vomiting commenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. At each of the ſeveral vomitings, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſevere wretchings, much bilious matter was thrown up; and there was found, in many inſtances, a porraceous ſubſtance, reſembling the ſettlings of coffee. The ſtomach ſhewed unuſual ſymptoms of irritability, it being almoſt impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to keep down for a moment the mildeſt medicine that could be adminiſtered. In the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals of vomiting, particularly, a conſtant and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exhauſting pain was felt; moſt exquiſite at the ſmall of the back, and extending along the ſpine and its connexions quite up to the occiput. Pain of head continuing, eſpecially over the eyes and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the temporal bones, ſometimes with a ſenſation as if ſome inſtrument had paſſed the head. Reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration extremely difficult, often with a feel of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focation. Heat very great, eſpecially in the thorax and region of the <hi>liver.</hi> Pulſe morbidly rapid. Pores cloſed. Skin ſmooth, and apparently diſtend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:031881_0012_0FEF094D7904A248"/>
with the expanded fluids and heat within; hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a tinge, ſomewhat reſembling that of chlorotic patients. The cornea albuginea moſt reſembling, in colour, that of duſky glaſs when held up to the light. The eyes, however, expreſſed much concern, and often moved with a furious rapidity in the early ſtage of the diſeaſe. Theſe all increaſed, if poſſible, in violence till death put an end to the patient's ſufferings; or gradually ſubſided, when the fever vaniſhed, and health was reſtored.</p>
               <p>THOUGH theſe were the characteriſtic ſymptoms of the diſeaſe, yet they were generally variant in their commencement, progreſs and termination, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the difference of temperament; and alſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the difference in the prediſpoſing cauſes.</p>
               <p>SLIGHT ſymptoms, ſcarcely noticed by the patient or his friends, were ſometimes the harbingers of this fever: Alſo, languor, yawning, dejection of ſpirits, ſleep diſturbed and not refreſhing, appetite impaired, diſagreeable taſte and ſmell, and uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſibility to cold, were ſometimes among the early ſymptoms of the diſeaſe. In others the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms were more rapid and intenſe; perſons ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times being rouſed from ſleep by a moſt torturous ſenſation in the ſtomach, near its connexion with the duodenum, reſembling liquid fire ſpreading over this viſcus and extending, in the direction of the arteries, quite through both upper and lower extremities.</p>

SOME were affected with alternations of heat and cold; with others, the heat was continual. The appearance of the tongue was various; ſometimes it was moiſt, as in catarrhal defluxion; at other times was parched and dry. The breath, however, was invariably diſagreeable, and ſometimes ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive as to be almoſt intolerable to the patient himſelf. Pulſe often various in the ſame perſons; ſometimes having the regularity and force of ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocha; at other times weak, fluttering, indiſtinct and vibratory; manifeſting very great debility. Coſtiveneſs prevailed with the moſt, eſpecially in the firſt ſtages of the fever; and all the ſecretions and excretions partook of the great diſorder of the ſyſtem. None were in a healthy ſtate; all either in a high degree of exceſs, or greatly dimin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed.</p>
               <p>OTHER ſymptoms, more particular, might be enumerated; but they would neither direct to a rational <hi>indication,</hi> nor aſſiſt to form a probable</p>

               <p>THE ſymptoms which might be conſidered as the heralds of approaching death, were excruciating pain in the loins, through the ſpine, and in all the larger or principal muſcles. Exceſſive irritability of the ſtomach, ſo much ſo as to refuſe all acceſs to medicine. Great pain over the eyes and in the eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balls; this pain increaſing to delirium or madneſs.

               <head>PROXIMATE OR EXCITING CAUSE.</head>
               <p>THIS, in my opinion, is morbid effluvia, firſt lodged in the ſaliva; thence conveyed and lodged in the ſtomach and inteſtines; here either pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or totally deſtroying the digeſtive powers of theſe viſcera: thereby a putrid and highly corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive maſs is generated, inſtead of a mild and bland ſubſtance to give nouriſhment to animal life. The ſurrounding blood veſſels feel the change and are affected. The myſenteric veins, eſpecially, from contiguity, become loaded with a putrid maſs of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digeſted ſubſtances, which are conveyed through the venae portarum into the liver. This important viſcus becomes diſordered; the bile is thrown into the inteſtines and up into the ſtomach in unuſual quantities and in an acrid ſtate. This ſtill increaſes the difficulty; the ſtomach and bowels are heated and inflamed, and puking enſues. The venae haepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticae empty a heterogeneous maſs of black damaged fluid into the right ventricle, which is immediately
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:031881_0015_0FEF095896ED4EF8"/>
thrown into the lungs. The lungs, in turn, are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by the diſorder; the patulous mouths of the abſorbing veſſels are cloſed by preſſure on the ſubſtance of the lungs from the fluid within. The blood no longer receives its congenial nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but is conveyed by the veins of the lungs into the left ventricle of the heart; and, if this Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha and Omega of animal life has not loſt its power, is thence diſtributed in a highly putrid ſtate into the ſeveral parts of the body. The whole vaſcular ſyſtem is thrown into irritation and commotion by unuſual ſtimuli; the maſs of blood is deſtroyed, and the patient dies: Or, the powers of life, collected as in a focus, act with accumulated force, ſubdue the offending cauſes, ſeparate and diſcharge the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities by the ſeveral emunctories, and the patient recovers.</p>
               <p>THAT the miaſma is firſt lodged in the ſaliva, and thence carried into the ſtomach and bowels is probable from this circumſtance; we often hear perſons complain, after being over an infected ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, that they not only <hi>ſmelt</hi> the putrid exhalations, but <hi>taſted</hi> them for a long time afterwards; and that nothing would remove the diſagreeable taſte. Probably, however, a part of the contagion finds a direct way into the maſs of blood through the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorbents of the lungs.</p>
               <p>THAT the morbid miaſma, when thrown into the body, in the manner we have mentioned, are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the effects we have aſcribed to them, is not
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:031881_0016_0FEF095A208AA870"/>
difficult to conceive, eſpecially if they contain a principle of ſpecific life. Life acting againſt life, is like the meeting of two oppoſite powers in nature, in which caſe the one will deſtroy the other; and where life is deſtroyed putrefaction will take place, whence a contagion may ariſe too great for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining power of life to reject or remove, which of courſe will in its turn be either impaired or deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Beſides, we know that perſons are often thrown into the moſt diſtreſſing diſorders by worms and animalculae lodged in the ſtomach and bowels in an oviform ſtate, in conſequence of eating raw fruit and other uncooked ſubſtances. Theſe alſo may and often do concur to make human contagion more fatal.</p>
               <p>THAT the ſtomach and bowels are the <hi>firſt</hi> affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is evident from the ſevere pain that is early felt in the loins, and from the early tendency to puking.</p>
               <p>THAT the liver is affected is evident from the large diſcharges of bilious matter by the ſtomach and ſtool; and that the lungs are, is plain from the difficult reſpiration, which was always an attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant ſymptom of the diſeaſe. In all the ſubjects dead of the yellow fever, that have been diſſected, the liver and the lungs had almoſt univerſally a morbid appearance. The lungs were inflamed, and the liver either greatly ſwollen or very much ſhrunk.</p>
               <p>THAT the heart is greatly affected, is plainly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ifeſt from the rapidity of the pulſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="unknown:031881_0017_0FEF095D0D1A4B38"/>
THAT the life of the blood is either greatly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired or totally deſtroyed, is manifeſt from the pains in the muſcles and in the head; from delirium and coma; from vibices, petechiae and yellowneſs of the ſkin, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>DR. Anthony Fothergill, however, ſays, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to Drs. Harvey, Willis, Hunter, and others, that "the blood is not alive, but is a mere paſſive inorganic maſs." Thus he proves it: "Life, he ſays, is allowed on all hands to be the attribute of an organized body alone, and if blood be an organ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ized body, then it is an animal; and if ſo, here is a living animal deſtined to circulate within the veſſels of another living animal!" This is an attempt by a few words to diſſipate a numerous train of facts and arguments, and to render illegitimate an opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion which I <hi>did</hi> think was the reſult of cloſe obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and ſkilful experiment.</p>
               <p>IF, however, life <hi>is</hi> the attribute of an organized body <hi>alone;</hi> yet this organized body is compoſed of parts, of which the blood is one; and therefore has its ſhare of life. But,</p>
               <p>FURTHER on, Dr. Fothergill, in his ingenious treatiſe, (for ſuch we eſteem it in general) denies his major propoſition. He ſays, "The nervous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, ſenſibility, or as Dr. Darwin elegantly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes it, <hi>the ſpirit of animation,</hi> cannot be a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creted fluid, ſince the brain is no longer allowed by anatomiſts to be a ſecretory organ. Neither
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:031881_0018_0FEF0963610AB5B0"/>
can its origin be proved to be coeval with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed rudiments of the embryo<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>DR. Darwin is fully of the opinion that the rudiments or living ens of the future embryo is derived wholly from the male parent; that this ens or rudiment conſiſts of a living filament or ſtamen, and that this fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, of whatever form it may be, is endued with the <hi>capability</hi> of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing excited into action by certain kinds of ſtimulus. Rouſed into ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity by the ſtimulus of the nutritive and congenial fluid in which it is received from the male parent, it receives new adaptations or accre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſubſtances, and thus becomes organized. With every new change of organic form or addition of organic parts, a new kind of irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability or of ſenſibility [which is only a more general ſenſation] is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced; theſe varieties of irritability or of ſenſibility exiſt in our adult ſtate in the glands; [perhaps in all the parts of diſtinct functions] every one of which is furniſhed with an irritability, or a taſte, or appetency, and a conſequent mode of action peculiar to itſelf. Theſe changes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, and additions of parts with their peculiar irritabilities or appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences and conſequent modes of action, continue in progreſſive order till the embryo is complete in form. The parts moſt eſſential to life are firſt produced. Thus, the brain to diſpenſe the powers of life, next the heart, then the lungs, and from theſe all the parts of the ſyſtem, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the importance of their functions in the animal economy. Sec. 39, Vol. I.</p>
                     <p>THUS then it ſeems to be the opinion of Dr. Darwin that the <hi>eſſe</hi> or eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the embryo is from the male parent, and that the <hi>exiſteré,</hi> or exiſtence, is from the female parent; of this there is no want of proof convincing. This <hi>eſſe,</hi> or as Dr. Darwin names it, <hi>living ens,</hi> always poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes the <hi>conatus</hi> or <hi>endeavour</hi> to aſſume a form ſimilar to the male parent or progenitor, which it always will do when lodged in the proper matrix or mould, and ſupplied with the congenial nouriſhment; this, with ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, is always from the female. Perhaps, Dr. Darwin means the ſame thing by <hi>"the capability of being excited into action by certain ſtimuli."</hi> This conatus or endeavour of the <hi>ſeminal germ</hi> to produce or aſſume the form of its progenitor exiſts not only with every order, genera, ſpecies and creature of the animal kingdom, but alſo with every order, genera, ſpecies and thing of the vegetable kingdom. Thus every creature and thing is preſerved in its order and diſtinction. This preſervation by generation and prolification, production and reproduction, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent increaſe and multiplication, ſuggeſts and impreſſes moſt ſtrongly the idea of <hi>infinity</hi> and <hi>eternity,</hi> and clearly evinces the wiſdom and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the "CAUSE OF ALL CAUSES!

Here the Doctor takes the life from the organized body, of which he before aſſerted it is the attribute alone, and transfers it to <hi>vital air</hi> or ſpirit of the atmoſphere, which is not proved to be more an organized body than the blood.<note n="*" place="bottom">IT is not to be denied that the paſſages in the ſacred writings refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to by Dr. Fothergill may indeed admit of the conſtruction he puts upon them, it being cuſtomary in thoſe writings to aſſume the cauſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental for the cauſe principal; and the air is the medium by which reſpiration exiſts, and the active life of the body. But then this cannot be all that is ſignified by thoſe words, as is evident from the text being in the plural number, and hence they have been more properly conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered by divines, as having relation to the life of the ſoul, from which the life of the body is derived, and which conſiſts in the perception of what is good and what is true, or the will of good, and the perception of truth; thus, a <hi>ſoul of lives.</hi> The expreſſion of this <hi>ſoul of lives</hi> being breathed into Adam by the Almighty, ſeems alſo fully to denote, that man is only an organ of life, and not life itſelf; for life and light are not creatable, but man was created a form receptive of life, as the eye is a form receptive of light.</note>

               <p>WE might here interrogate the Doctor how it is that the foetus moves itſelf and makes various exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in utero, if it is without the ſpirit of animation before the firſt effort of reſpiration?</p>
               <p>SOME medical gentlemen object to our method of accounting for the introduction of contagious
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:031881_0020_0FEF09686EB5E6A8"/>
miaſma into the ſyſtem, and ſay that it is more probably applied immediately to the <hi>powers of life</hi> or <hi>nervous influence.</hi> What is the nervous influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? whence is it derived? and through what medium do we reach it? Theſe are queſtions I never have yet ſeen ſatisfactorily anſwered by any medical writer that has made the attempt.</p>
               <p>WE have ſeen, above, the reaſoning of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious and learned phyſician on this ſubject. He aſſerts that the <hi>nervous influence</hi> exiſts before any <hi>veſtige</hi> of <hi>brain</hi> or <hi>nerves</hi> can be traced, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore concludes that it muſt be derived from oxygen, or ſpirit of the atmoſphere!</p>
               <p>DR. Cullen ſays, "the nervous power ſeems dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from every thing elſe in our body, and ſeems not peculiar to it, but a general principle in nature particularly <hi>modified</hi> in our ſyſtem." What pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces this particular modification? the nervous power? for he acknowledges none higher; if ſo, nervous power modifies nervous power!</p>
               <p>HE again ſays—"The vital power is intimately connected with the <hi>ſenſorium commune,</hi> and this with the ſoul, which certainly is of uſe in the medical ſyſtem, though by no means a rational conductor." Here I cannot comprehend the Doctor's meaning; but I ſuſpect his thoughts at this time were electrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and if by his <hi>ſoul,</hi> I agree that it is not always a <hi>rational</hi> conductor.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="unknown:031881_0021_0FEF096B83DB4E00"/>
DR. Cullen thinks alſo, that "the ſoul influences the body not as a <hi>prime mover,</hi> but as a modifier of external ſenſes." What higher power than the modifier of external ſenſes, which all exiſt from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior life? But again—</p>
               <p>THE Doctor is of opinion that "all our functions are governed by certain laws, that we may obſerve and diſtinctly mark, ſo as to know their conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences; ſo that the <hi>conſideration</hi> of the ſoul, in a medical view, is of no weight." And why not? By what power are thoſe <hi>laws eſtabliſhed,</hi> which govern all our functions?</p>
               <p>ONCE more—<hi>"Medicamentum non agit in cada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,"</hi> ſays the Doctor; which is, in Engliſh phraſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ology, Medicine operates only on life; and yet he agrees with Dr. Boerhaave, that "when a problem is traced up to the connexion between ſoul and body, there we ought to ſtop, and conſider it as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved." Some of the above problems cannot be either ſolved or reſolved, even by this connexion. But I think this is the very point from which we ought to ſet out, if we ever expect rightly to inveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigate the phenomena of life.</p>
               <p>WHAT is the ſoul but life? and again, what is life? <hi>"Cogito ergo ſum,"</hi> ſaid Des Cartes—We can only know it by its operations, <hi>principally</hi> within ourſelves. It is the ſoul or life which ſees, feels, hears, taſtes, is ſenſible of pleaſure or pain, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines our limbs to motion, &amp;c. wills, thinks and
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:031881_0022_0FEF096D155EC3A0"/>
knows. If it be aſked how and whence it is deriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the body? I can at preſent only reply by pointing to ſome of its more interior effects. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, then, the dominion and influence the mind has over all the moſt important functions, which ſupport the economy of life. It actuates the body in all its parts at pleaſure. The mind directs the ear to hear, diſpoſes the eyes to ſee, moves the tongue and lips to ſpeak, and the hands to do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it pleaſes. Thus the body is nothing but obedience to the mind; but can it be thus unleſs there were a moſt intimate connexion between the mind and the body? not ſuch a connexion as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween what is above and what is below, as oil on water, but ſuch a connexion as exiſts between cauſe and effect, the one produced from the other. Ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery one, the leaſt ſkilled in anatomy, muſt have learnt how entirely every part and function of the human ſyſtem is actuated and lives by the cardiac and pulmonic motions. But theſe two motions are entirely ſubject to the two conſtituent principles or powers of the mind, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the will and the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. The will is immediately operative in all the ſeries of catenated motions denominated invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>untary; but the heart exhibits moſt diſtinctly the will's influence in the ſyſtem. Its motions are ſlow or rapid, calm or tumultuous, according to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious affections of the will; of this we have ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble proof by means of the pulſe.</p>
               <p>EVERY one who has ſeen the force of <hi>love,</hi> (which reſides wholly in the will, and, as a general principle
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:031881_0023_0FEF0971C240D3F8"/>
comprehending every kind of affection, is in fact its life) knows how it actuates the body by its pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over the heart's motions; producing, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe, delirium, phrenzy, apoplexy, and ſometimes death. When the love glows, the body is warm, the variations of the heat of the body always tally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the variations of love or affection, whatever be its object, from the <hi>freezing point,</hi> or the extinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of love, to any indefinite degree of intenſeneſs.</p>
               <p>THE underſtanding or thinking principle of the mind influences mainly the pulmonic motions. Thus, if we think tacitly, we breathe tacitly; if we think deeply, we breathe deeply; we draw in and relax, compreſs and elevate our lungs either ſlowly, eagerly, mildly or attentively, in perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the different ſtates of the thoughts. Now it is a maxim of true philoſophy, that what is ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior in power is prior in exiſtence, and that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolling force does not originate from the thing controlled: This is alſo agreeable to every rule of juſt concluſion. Where the reſidence of the mind is fixed, we have no other way of inveſtigating, but to trace the nerves to where they begin and end; for all our ſenſation is tranſmitted by means of thoſe nerves called ſenſory nerves, to the inward ſenſori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, and ſo to the underſtanding. Thus the ſenſations go by the optic nerves from the eyes; and from the noſtrils by the olfactory nerves, or proceſſus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millaris; from the ears by the auditory nerves, and ſo on. Therefore, that the beginning and ending may be ſound, we muſt examine all the brain, and
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:031881_0024_0FEF0975285CEE78"/>
not deſiſt till we find the ends and beginnings of the nerves. Having, therefore, diſſected the brain, we meet with little ſpheres, round, or fully wrapped inward and outward, commonly called the cortical glands, where the nerves begin and end, and where the mind in its principles reſides, and acts from the beginnings of all the nerves; for to theſe ſpheres, as to their ultimate ends, all the nerves are center<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Thence the mind deduces and collects all the modes of appearance and operation tranſmitted by the ſenſes, and thence diſtributes them round to the interior perception and underſtanding. All the nerves, whatever be their office, are formed and produced from theſe glands; wherefore this is our common ſenſorium: from hence alſo proceeds our intimate ſenſe, or underſtanding, which perceives by its ſenſes, thinks on what it perceives; and judging on what it thinks, chooſes what is judged beſt; from what it chooſes, deſires; and laſtly, from the will of its deſire, acts. That the mind or ſpirit thus reſides in its principles in the brain, and in its prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipiates in the body, is manifeſt from experience; for the glands being affected, the whole appendix of the brain and body languiſh in proportion, the power of imagination is ſtupefied; the cogitations languiſh; the memory fails; the determinations of the will heſitate; the deſires fail, and the ſenſes are dulled. But notwithſtanding this defect in the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erations of the mind in conſequence of defect in the organization of the brain, it is not to be thence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred that the mind itſelf is nothing more than ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:031881_0025_0FEF0978C4C26DF8"/>
organization, however highly ſublimated; for we hold the ſoul or mind, though giving life to the body, to be perfectly diſtinct from it in degree, bearing the ſame relation to it as what is prior to what is poſterior, or, as cauſe and effect; ſo that one is in the other not in continuous but in diſcrete order. Hence it follows, that though the latter can have no exiſtence without the former, yet the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer can exiſt without the latter, as is the caſe when the body is entirely rejected at death. But till then the mind is ſo far dependent on the body, that it cannot manifeſt its operation in outward nature, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs by rightly diſpoſed organs; and if there be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments in the corporeal organs, the perfection of the mind will alſo be impeded during its connexion with them, through a want of afflux and re-agency; for it is a received law, that influx is proportioned to afflux, agency to re-agency, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>THE powers of life then which manifeſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the body, we have juſt reaſon to conclude are derived wholly from the mind, and flow ſolely from a ſpiritual origin, the mind itſelf or ſoul being probably an organized form, but ſpiritual, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly diſtinct from the natural, though in it in ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery part throughout, and communicating life there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; which life the ſoul itſelf receives by continual influx from Deity, "in whom we live and move and have our being." Thus much on the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, What is life, and whence derived?<note n="*" place="bottom">If the above obſervation be true, how evidently does the fallacy of that reaſoning appear, which, not diſtinguiſhing the diſcrete degrees of the operation of life, but ſtopping at proximate cauſes from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of analyſis only, makes no diſtinction betwixt the life of a man and that of a brute. For if it be admitted, (and nothing can be more eaſily admitted, nor more fully confirmed from the united teſtimony of revelation, reaſon, and experience) that man is diſtinguiſhed from the brutes by the faculty of thinking, not only analytically but ſynthetical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and thereby of living not only the ſenſual and natural, but alſo the moral and ſpiritual life, it may be rationally concluded, that the ſame diſtinction prevails in regard to the faculty of living eternally. For it muſt, on the ſame ground, be inferred, that he poſſeſſes a ſuperior de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of life or a form receptive of life more immediately from the Deity, whence he derives the capacity of being conjoined with the Deity by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment and affection, thus, by re-agency on his part; whence he conſequently alſo poſſeſſes the faculty of retaining the influent life, and in this retention conſiſts the ground of his eternal exiſtence.</note>

LIFE then is in all and every part of the body; but ſome parts are endowed with a much greater ſhare than others. In the brain it is as it were drawn to a focus. Indeed it is here, as we have juſt obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that fibre begins and circulation ends; conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently here alſo is the connexion between fibre and blood. No doubt, when the blood arrives at the brain it becomes highly refined, and imparts a ſublimate matter, which becomes the immediate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipient of life, whence it is diſtributed by the nerves to all the parts in the curious mechaniſm of man down to the ultimates of life. Now we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready obſerved, the leſs ſimple and homogeneous any ſubſtance is, the more liable it is to injury and perverſion. Dr. Hunter has ſhown that the ſerum of the blood is a maſs of heterogeneous ſubſtances, and is the loweſt form of animal life; therefore is the moſt liable to be affected by diſeaſe. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum is derived immediately from the alimentary ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. There it is that contagion firſt plants itſelf,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:031881_0027_0FEF097F5108A820"/>
and therefore the alimentary canal may well be called the ſtore-houſe of contagion. Here, like the ſkilful but cautious enemy, it commences its opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by progreſſively invading the weaker parts, until the inner fortreſſes of life are endangered.</p>
               <p>THERE are many directly and indirectly debili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating powers, which prepare the conſtitution for the reception of diſeaſe, and are therefore called</p>

               <p>AMONG the directly debilitating powers, we reckon cold or the abſence of heat, the greateſt; its fects, however, are always proportionate to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of intenſity, and the ſtate of the conſtitution on which it acts.</p>
               <p>A LARGE variety of injecta are of a ſedative or debilitating nature; plants in particular; all kinds of raw ſallads, except thoſe of a ſpicy or aromatic nature. Vegetable food, when too dilute; drinks in large quantities, that are not ſpirituous; an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure atmoſphere; ſloth, ennui, a habit of inactivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, a mind unemployed, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>EVACUATIONS, when immoderate or unnatural, are greatly debilitating; ſuch as the various ſpecies of epiſtaxis, menorrhagia, hemorrhois; alſo from the excretory organs and alimentary canal.</p>
               <p>SLEEP, that is not forced, is occaſioned by the abſtraction of ſtimuli, and therefore, when too
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:031881_0028_0FEF0983F4B9A288"/>
much indulged, produces weakneſs. There are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a variety of mental qualities, which operate as ſedatives on the body. Fear is the greateſt: It has been known totally to unhinge the mind's fab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric, ſuſpend all motion, and in fact every animal faculty, inſomuch as to produce ſyncope or ſwoons, and even death; diſappointments, of whatever kind; alſo deſpondency, with many others. Theſe are the moſt common among this claſs of directly weakening powers.</p>
               <p>THE indirectly debilitating powers are—Firſt, of the mind. Immoderate deſires of whatever kind; great mental exertion; a fixed attention to one train of thought; anger in exceſs. Unlimited in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence of ſenſual appetites is highly pernicious to the body, and certainly deſtructive of the mind's happineſs. An exceſs in eating, or, as it is better expreſſed, gormandizing, eſpecially upon food that is loaded with the richeſt ſpices and moſt powerful ſtimulants, is certainly injurious to the conſtitution, and prepares it for the invaſion of almoſt every ſpecies of diſeaſe.</p>

THE powers of life, by this mode of living, are ſtrained to the higheſt pitch, and when expoſed to diſeaſe, the conſtitution has no new or unemployed force to repel the enemy. The ſtrength collapſes, debility or exhauſtion, with all its ſad conſequences, enſue. It is to this circumſtance, mainly, we are to aſcribe the unuſual mortality of contagious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes which have of late prevailed in ſeveral capitals of the United States.</p>
               <p>HEAT, in exceſs, is the greateſt ſtimulus that operates on life; indeed it is the moſt powerful agent in nature; by it "rocks fall to duſt, and mountains melt away." When above 80° of Farenheit, it always injures.</p>

               <p>THE ſymptoms of the fever which we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed certainly manifeſt a very high degree of vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular irritability and excitement; the firſt and lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indication, therefore, is depletion by powerful e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuations, even to bleeding; and this with all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpeed. Jalap and calomel were early uſed for this purpoſe by the moſt celebrated practitioners of Boſton,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:031881_0030_0FEF09872E0693D8"/>
who I believe can give freſh teſtimony of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety and benefit of the uſe of this medicine, firſt recommended by Dr. Ruſh, of Philadelphia. My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf have witneſſed the moſt happy effects of this cathartic, when uſed agreeably to the judicious di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of my preceptor.</p>
               <p>IT is now generally thought that mercury, as uſed in this diſorder, produces its ſalutary effects chiefly by operating as a quick and powerful cathartic, when combined with jalap; thereby cauſing a large and ſudden depletion of the inteſtines and the excretories that here empty themſelves. It is more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over certain that mercury in all its operations, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways affects the liver more or leſs. I believe that in the bilious fever it has almoſt a ſpecific effect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this viſcus by changing its morbid actions and reſtoring its healthy functions, which, it cannot be doubted, are greatly deranged.</p>
               <p>DR. Ruſh enumerates the effects of the uſe of jalap and calomel in this fever as follows. 1. It raiſed the pulſe when low, and reduced it when it was preternaturally tenſe or full. 2. It revived and ſtrengthened the patient. 3. It abated the paroxyſm of the fever. 4. It frequently produced ſweats when given on the firſt and ſecond day of the fever. 5. It ſometimes checked that vomiting which occurs in the beginning of the diſorder; and it always aſſiſted in preventing the more alarming occurrence of this ſymptom about the 4th and 5th day. 6. It removed obſtructions in the lymphatic
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:031881_0031_0FEF098D8FC17668"/>
ſyſtem. 7. It prevented in moſt caſes a yellowneſs of the ſkin, by diſcharging the bile through the bowels as ſoon and as faſt as it was ſecreted.</p>
               <p>THE uſual doſe, and I believe the beſt propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned for an adult, was jalap 25gr. calomel 10gr. The intention for which this was given was not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered unleſs it produced four or five diſcharges.</p>
               <p>No other regard is to be paid to time in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of this medicine than that it be given as early in the diſeaſe as poſſible. If it ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, or is ſlow in the operation, opening injections ſhould be adminiſtered every one or two hours. One doſe was ſometimes ſufficient to open the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els; ſeveral, however, were more frequently neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, as the doſe was often thrown up by puking. In bilious fevers, there ſeems to be a conſtant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>production of morbid bile; once cleanſing the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, therefore, is not ſufficient; it will be proper to give a purge once a day as long as the fever laſts. After one or two effectual doſes of jalap and calo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel, as circumſtances require, other cathartics may be uſed; ſuch as Glauber's ſalt, cremor tartar, rheubarb, ſena, manna, &amp;c. either ſeparate or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined.</p>
               <p>To aſſuage the great heat of this fever, cloths dipped in cold vinegar, or vinegar and water, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the ſurface of the body have been found to do great ſervice.</p>
               <p>SOME have recommended flannel ſhirts wet in this manner to be kept conſtantly applied. And
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:031881_0032_0FEF098F233C6E78"/>
it has been practiſed by many phyſicians, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly Dr. Trotter, of England with manifeſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. It certainly has a tendency to extract the heat from the body, which always, in proportion to its intenſity, expands the teguments, thereby clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the pores by increaſing the denſity; of courſe perſpiration ceaſes.</p>
               <p>THE pain of the head, very diſtreſſing in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, was greatly moderated by ſimilar applications of cold water, or vinegar and water, to the pained part, neck and back.</p>
               <p>DRINKS ſhould be freely uſed during the inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory ſtate of the diſorder, to aſſiſt the operation of the phyſic, and to leſſen the heat within. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt any kind of tea is proper, ſuch as marſh mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, balm, &amp;c. lemonade, tamarind water, toaſt in water, apple in water, may be drank with ſafety and advantage.</p>
               <p>FOOD of all kinds is extremely improper until the criſis, unleſs it is unuſually protracted; and even then it ſhould be of the moſt innocent kind, and very cautiouſly adminiſtered.</p>
               <p>THE utmoſt pains ſhould be taken with the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient in reſpect to cleanlineſs. Stools ſhould be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately removed; the linen well aired and ſhift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as often as once a day. The chamber ſhould be as large as can be had, and conſtantly ventilated.</p>
               <p>BLEEDING in the firſt ſtage of the fever is ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recommended by Dr. Ruſh and others. It was
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:031881_0033_0FEF099224645860"/>
practiſed by them with much apparent ſucceſs. But in Boſton, the laſt ſummer, it was not ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied on as a neceſſary part of the cure: I believe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the fever was leſs inflammatory. The jalap and calomel in large doſes was found, in moſt caſes, ſufficiently depleting to take off the excitement and irritability of the vaſcular ſyſtem.</p>
               <p>DR. Chiſholm, in his treatment of the fever at Grenada, found that bleeding was by no means ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſible, and different antiphlogiſtics were ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. His whole dependence was upon mercury, which he gave in pills, compoſed of five grains of calomel, two of antimonial powder, and one of opium. This was repeated to the ſame extent, eight times in twenty-four hours. The propriety of this practice was juſtified by the ſucceſs, for if ſalivation was ſpeedily raiſed, the danger was removed and the patient recovered.</p>
               <p>NEXT to calomel in this form Dr. C. reckons vitriolic aether the moſt beneficial. He gave it in the following manner: a teaſpoonful in half a wine glaſs full of cold water. After this the patient was kept undiſturbed for two hours, when the doſe was repeated; and, in this manner, it was continued every two or three hours, till the ſpaſm of the ſtomach was entirely overcome. Given as above he found it extremely grateful to the patient, and that thirſt, nauſea, and oppreſſion often fled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="unknown:031881_0034_0FEF0993DD39E348"/>
SHOULD the fever change, in conſequence of the exceſſive ſtimulus of the morbid miaſma, from the inflammatory or ſynochus type, and become typhoid, then the tonic and ſtimulating plan muſt be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued. The ſigns of this change are the loſs of voice; tremulous motion of the tongue, or putting it out; the patient muttering to himſelf; catching at the bed-clothes, ſighing, weeping, and ſometimes laughing; difficult deglutition; paralyſis of the ſphincter muſcles; tremors; convulſions; ſyncope on being raiſed upright; gangrene of bliſtered parts; profuſe diarrhoea; dark coloured urine; eye-balls fixed and ſunk; the countenance ſhrunk, lengthened, ghaſtly, and diſcoloured; inſide of the mouth and tongue black and parched; deafneſs, or hearing very acute; the jaw fallen; immobility of the joints; watchfulneſs or conſtant ſleep; heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the breaſt; rattling of the throat; pulſe felt only at intervals.</p>
               <p>I WOULD, however, interpoſe a caution againſt the uſe of the diffuſible ſtimuli, unleſs an immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately favourable turn of the diſeaſe can be gained by them.</p>
               <p>THIS ſubduing one ſtimulus, (eſpecially if it has gained aſcendency even over life, which is always the caſe when an inflammatory fever changes to a typhus) by the ſuperior force of another ſtimulus, is like placing a perſon in time of battle between the two fires. It is much ſafer to let the powers of the conſtitution become quieſcent for a time, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:031881_0035_0FEF0998B82CE7B8"/>
they recover force to withſtand the diſeaſe: Or, let the ſtimulus of the diſeaſe act till the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from the power of habit, can adapt itſelf to the peculiar nature of the ſtimulus, and thereby eſcape deſtruction.</p>
               <p>BRANDY and water, or porter and water, when agreeable to the ſtomach, ſnake-root tea, now and then a cup of chicken, veal, or mutton broth, may be uſed in reſtoring the tone of the ſyſtem.</p>
               <p>IN moſt caſes of debility it is proper to wrap the limbs in flannel dipped in warm ſpirits; alſo to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply cataplaſms of bruiſed garlick or onion with muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard ſeed to the feet. But the principal depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, next to the uſe of mercurial medicines, for exciting a healthy action in the arterial ſyſtem, ſhould be on mild and gently ſtimulating food.</p>

they all recovered. The fourth was in a ſituation peculiarly unfavourable when attacked; ſhe took ſuch doſes of jalap and calomel, as were thought beſt adapted to her ſtate; and on the fourth day ſhe died.</p>
                  <p>THE caſe of Mr. Newell, who was taken with the diſeaſe, 18th September excited much aprehenſions in town. On the fourth day the ſkin became yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; on the ſixth petechiae were diſcovered over all parts of his body; and a moſt obſtinate dyſente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry followed by colliquative diarrhaea proved fatal on the 8th day.</p>
                  <p>WITH many patients, after ſlight rigors, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſe pain in the head, for the firſt twenty-four hours, together with a ſenſe of heat or burning at the ſtomach—a haemorrhage from the noſe often took place, and continued to be a troubleſome circumſtance for ſeveral days, without any remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mitigation of the ſymptoms. In theſe caſes, ſpontaneous vomitings rarely occurred—but when they did, large quantities of bile were thrown up from the ſtomach. In two caſes only, what is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the black vomit, took place.</p>

DIET.—All groſs food, eſpecially meats, when prepared with ſpices and pepper ſtimuli, which greatly inflame the blood, and fit it for diſeaſe, are to be avoided. Food ſhould be chiefly vegetables, cooked in a ſimple manner.</p>
               <p>DRINKS ſhould be moſtly of the acid kind. Porter is good; tamarind water; cream of tartar in water; apple in water, &amp;c.

THE chambers of the ſick <hi>muſt</hi> be viſited as much as humanity and the convenience of the ſick require, and no more. When the ſick are viſited, all the windows and doors ſhould be opened.</p>
               <p>DR. Chiſholm, who has written a treatiſe on the yellow fever, as it appeared in the iſland of Grenada, 1795, thinks that the effluvia of infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious diſeaſes do not extend themſelves beyond a limited diſtance from the perſon or thing from which they are emitted, ſo as to produce diſeaſe: This diſtance he thinks may be fixed at the utmoſt from ſix to ten feet.</p>
               <p>HE obſerved, 1<hi>ſtly,</hi> That when the diſeaſe had entered a dwelling, avoiding the chamber of the ſick, prevented the infection. 2<hi>dly,</hi> That merely entering the chamber of the ſick, without approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near to the diſeaſed perſon, never communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted infection. 3<hi>dly,</hi> That approaching ſo near the diſeaſed perſon as to be ſenſible of the foetor of his breath, or of the peculiar ſmell which is always emitted from the bodies of the ſick, or touching the bed clothes on which he lays, generally occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned nauſea, ſlight rigors, and often head-ach, at the moment, and ſome hours afterwards, produced the diſeaſe itſelf. 4<hi>thly,</hi> That actual contact, ſo that the perſpired fluid of the ſick perſon might adhere to the hands, &amp;c. of the healthy perſon, more certainly produced the diſeaſe. 5<hi>thly,</hi> That touching the wearing apparel of a perſon actually diſeaſed, or who had juſt recovered from the diſeaſe,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:031881_0041_0FEF09079146E9A0"/>
communicated infection as certainly as actual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact of the ſkin. 6<hi>thly,</hi> That the merely paſſing an infected perſon, or one who wore the clothes he had on, when labouring under the diſeaſe, if the effluvia proceeding from them were blown upon him, produced the diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>FROM the united teſtimony of Dr. Warren, Dr. Ruſh, and Dr. Chiſholm, it appears, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion always acts within four days after its appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to the body.</p>
               <p>WHETHER THE MIASMA OR CONTAGIOUS MATTER OF THE BILIOUS MALIGNANT FEVER, OF WHICH WE HAVE TREATED, IS AN IMPORTED OR A HOME PRODUCTION?</p>
               <p>A NEW doctrine has lately been broached by Dr. Mitchill, of New-York, reſpecting the cauſe of malignant diſeaſes, making it ſepton, or ſeptous acid.<note n="*" place="bottom">IN Dr. Mitchel's nomenclature, we find <hi>ſepton</hi> ſubſtituted for <hi>azote</hi> or <hi>nitrogene: ſeptous gas</hi> for <hi>azotic gaz</hi> or <hi>atmoſpherical mephitis; gazeous oxyd of ſepton,</hi> for <hi>dephlogiſticated nitrous air, ſeptic gas,</hi> for <hi>nitrous gas; ſeptous acid</hi> for <hi>nitrous acid, ſeptic acid,</hi> for <hi>nitric acid, ſeptate, ſeptite,</hi> for <hi>nitrate, nitrite,</hi> &amp;c.</note>
               </p>
               <p>AN inaugural diſſertation by Dr. William Bay, citizen of New-York, has juſt come to hand, and is declaredly a branch of this doctrine. His ſubject is the Dyſentery. The work is worthy attentive pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſal. But we are not convinced, as the author
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:031881_0042_0FEF09256280F648"/>
ſeems to be, that the diſeaſes ariſing from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations of dead animal and ſome vegetable ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are not putrid; not that the <hi>principle</hi> of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction is <hi>not putrefactive;</hi> not again, that ſepton is antiſeptic. See pages 9 and 10 of the introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>THESE notions, however, Profeſſor Mitchill him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf advances and endeavours to ſupport, as may be ſeen from the following paragraph, taken from the above treatiſe, page 99. appendix, A.</p>
               <p>He ſays,—"I reject altogether the notion of <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridity,</hi> as it is <hi>very generally ſuppoſed</hi> to be going on in the blood veſſels; I have no faith in the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of <hi>putrid ferments</hi> into the maſs of fluids. A putrefactive proceſs taking place in the contained parts of the living body except among the contents of the alimentary canal, is incompatible with life more than a few minutes. Putrefaction is a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an organic body into its elementary atoms or into new compounds. Now many of theſe are gaſſes whoſe extrication in the blood-veſſels would extinguiſh life in a very ſhort time. Beſides, the fluids produced by putrefaction having already un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone that operation, cannot be any more ſuſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible of it. They not only do not putrefy the muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, but, in the common acceptation of the term, they retard putrefaction in other ſubſtances. Thus, <hi>fixed air, nitrous acid,</hi> and volatile alkali, which are reckoned among the moſt active <hi>products of putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,</hi> are known to be the moſt powerful oppoſers
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:031881_0043_0FEF090C222063A0"/>
of it. And it may be laid down as a pretty broad fact, that ſuch ſubſtances as are <hi>ſeptic in their origin,</hi> are antiſeptic in their effects; and this from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things."</p>
               <p>I AM not ſatisfied with this reaſoning, neither do I think it concluſive. "A putrefactive proceſs tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place in the contained parts of the living body is incompatible with life for more than a few min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utes." The duration of life, while the putrefactive proceſs is going on in the body, is wholly according to the violence or rapidity of the proceſs. But if the putrefactive proceſs <hi>is</hi> ſo incompatible with life, why reject the idea of <hi>putrid ferments</hi> in the maſs of fluids? and why not call theſe diſeaſes ſo ſuddenly deſtructive to life, <hi>putrid?</hi> and why ſay, that the very principle or cauſe of theſe diſeaſes, which, from its ſuppoſed effects, is called ſepton, is anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeptic?</p>
               <p>WE grant that putrefaction is incompatible with life; and if it becomes general, the whole life is extinguiſhed. But it may exiſt in a <hi>part</hi> of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy without a total and immediate extinction of the <hi>whole</hi> life. If this were not the caſe, how came the idea of ulcerous putrefaction? It is allowed by all, that putrefaction may exiſt in the alimentary canal; perhaps always, in ſome degree. It is here, howev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that thoſe ſubſtances are ſelected and taken up, which afterwards receive and retain life, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a part of the body. This lacteal fluid, when there is a high degree of putrefaction in the <hi>prima</hi>
                  <pb n="45" facs="unknown:031881_0044_0FEF099E8D002000"/>
                  <hi>via,</hi> may in all probability become putrid, as it comes from the ſource of putrefaction: next the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum; and ſo on, till the whole maſs of fluids be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes corrupted, and life eſcapes. Or, in the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's own words, "Can it poſſibly happen that peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilential fluids ſhall come in contact with the lungs, ſkin and inteſtines, whoſe ſurfaces are thickly beſet with abſorbent veſſels; and that their noxious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſhall remain around the orifices of thoſe inhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tubes for a very long time, and yet no atom or particle of them be taken in? Will not a portion of them be ſucked up by the lacteals from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines, and by the lymphatics from the other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ſurfaces of the body, and through their chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels be conveyed into the <hi>maſs of blood?</hi> will not the <hi>blood,</hi> on receiving theſe <hi>foreign materials,</hi> aſſume <hi>new qualities,</hi> and, as it travels the round of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, carry with it miſchief and venom to the nervous ſyſtem." p. 92. More than this I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive was never underſtood by <hi>putrid ferments</hi> in the maſs of fluids.</p>
               <p>IN page 98, the Doctor ſeems to admit the ſame idea (if poſſible more fully, perhaps too much ſo) for he there gives it as his opinion that "the ſeptic gas does not produce death by its inflammatory ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the ſuperficial muſcles, but by its being mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a certain quantity with the <hi>blood;</hi> and after converſion to ſeptous or ſeptic acid, by conjunction with oxygen in circulating through the lungs, STIM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ULATING THE HEART TO DEATH, and utterly deſtroying <hi>all</hi> the irritability of that muſcle." Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:031881_0045_0FEF091BDF575890"/>
phenomena were never expected or known from the moſt rapid putrefaction in its moſt violent ſtage; and all this the Doctor allows is done within the veſſels of the circulating fluid. Firſt the ſeptic gas is converted into ſeptous or ſeptic acid, and then the deletereous effect is not by an inflammatory ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the ſuperficial muſcles, but by STIMULAT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING THE HEART'S MUSCLES TO DEATH! This, it is obſerved in the ſame page, can be done in the courſe of half a minute!</p>
               <p>HE obſerves further, "that it muſt not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agined, that, after peſtilential venom is inhaled into the <hi>blood-veſſels,</hi> death will in all caſes be the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. The offending matter may be carried from the body through the <hi>excretory</hi> outlets; or it may circulate a long time with the other <hi>fluids,</hi> and ſo <hi>ſeaſon</hi> both the <hi>veſſels and the heart</hi> to its action, that after a while, <hi>they,</hi> like the <hi>external parts, will grow inſenſible to its ſtimulus, and no longer have their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions diſturbed by it."</hi>—How can Dr. Mitchill deny the exiſtence of putrid ferments in the maſs of flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ids, after ſaying all this?</p>
               <p>BUT I do not fully underſtand, how it is that the offending matter <hi>ſeaſons</hi> both the veſſels and the heart to its actions, when juſt before it killed them both!</p>
               <p>WE grant that the life of a part, which has been deſtroyed by deleterious ſtimuli or putrefaction, may be reſtored or renewed by the application of congenial matter, and abſtracting the offending cauſe;
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:031881_0046_0FEED8F29E9D76A0"/>
but otherwiſe the interior organization will be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranged, and the whole life deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>I HOLD it as a truth that there is no life but in ſome form;<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>AN eminent Swediſh author, to whoſe writings I acknowledge my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf indebted for the ground of ſome other obſervations made in this work, reaſons thus: Not only animal and vegetable life have their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar forms, but alſo ſpiritual exiſtences; even thoughts and affections have their appropriate and diſtinctive forms. Theſe latter, <abbr>viz.</abbr> thoughts and affections, are commonly but unintelligibly denominated abſtract things, when in fact they are no more abſtracted from their appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, ſpiritual, or ſubſtantial forms, than viſion is abſtracted from its or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan the eye, or hearing from its organ the ear. But theſe forms, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, have nothing of groſs materiality in them, therefore are not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned by bodily ſight. But it may be aſked, what is affection and what is thought, in their ſubſtantiate forms or ſubjects. A ſatisfactory anſwer may be deduced from all and every thing in the body, where there are many viſcera, each fixed in its particular ſituation, and which operate their functions by changes and variations of their ſtate and form. That the viſcera are ſeverally employed in their reſpective op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erations, is well known; the ſtomach in operating its functions, and ſo the inteſtines, the kidneys, the liver, the pancreas, and ſpleen in theirs; and likewiſe the heart and lungs, each in its reſpective office: and all theſe motions are operated only intrinſically or within themſelves, and to be moved intrinſically is to operate by variations of ſtate and form. Hence it may appear, that the purely organic forms or ſubſtances of the mind are of a ſimilar nature, only with this difference, that the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the organic ſubſtances of the body are natural, and thoſe of the organic forms of the mind ſpiritual, and that both of theſe act as one by correſpondences. There can be no ocular demonſtration of the changes and variations of ſtate and form in the organic ſubſtances of the mind, which are affections, but yet they may be ſeen as it were in a glaſs, by the changes and variations of the ſtate of the lungs in ſpeaking and ſinging, there being a correſpondence, inaſmuch as the ſound of the voice in ſpeaking and ſinging, and alſo the articulations of ſound, which are words in ſpeech, and the modulations of the voice in ſinging, are effected by the lungs; ſound correſponds to affection, and ſpeech to thought; they are alſo produced thereby, and this is done by changes and variations of the ſtate and form of the organic ſubſtances of the lungs, and from the lungs by the trachea or wind-pipe in the larynx and glottis, and afterwards in the tongue, and laſtly in the mouth and lips. The firſt changes and variations of the ſtate and form of ſound are produced in the lungs, the ſecond in the trachea and larynx, the third in the glottis by various openings of its orifice, the fourth in the tongue by its various applications to the palate and teeth, the fifth in the lips by diſpoſing them in various forms: Hence it may appear, that the mere changes and variations of the ſtate of organic forms, ſucceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly continued, produce ſounds and the articulations thereof, which are ſpeech and ſinging. Now, foraſmuch as ſound and ſpeech are produced from no other ſource than from the affections and thoughts of the mind (for from the latter the former exiſt, and never without them) it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the affections of the will are changes and variations of the purely organic ſubſtances of the mind, and that the thoughts of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding are changes and variations of the form of their ſubſtances; ſimilar to what hath juſt been inſtanced in the lungs.</p>
                     <p>FORASMUCH as affections and thoughts are mere changes of the ſtate of the forms of the mind, it follows, that the memory is nothing elſe but the permanent ſtate thereof; for all changes and variations of ſtate in organic ſubſtances are of ſuch a nature, that when once they become habitual they are permanent; thus the lungs are habituated to produce various ſounds in the trachea and to vary them in the glottis, to articu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late them in the tongue, and to modify them in the mouth, and when thoſe organs are once habituated to them, they are in them and can be reproduced. See treatiſe on Divine Providence, No.279. Publiſhed by Thomas and Andrews at Boſton, 1796.</p>
                     <p>To me the above reaſoning is ſatisfactory. Something, in a degree ſimilar, may be ſeen in Dr. Darwin's Zoonomia, vol. 1ſt ſect. 4 to 12. His ideas, however, are not <hi>new;</hi> but his experiments are original and ingenious, and his proofs more in detail.</p>
                  </note> and the animal life of man has its <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar</hi>
                  <pb n="48" facs="unknown:031881_0047_0FEF090F6E913038"/>
form; this form conſiſts of almoſt an infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of parts, all poſſeſſing a <hi>vita propria,</hi> or a life peculiar to their functions, which is derived from the <hi>common</hi> life which reſides in the <hi>ſenſorium</hi> or brain; for the life of all the parts is <hi>one,</hi> as much as all the parts are one body. Now let any venomous ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance be applied to any one of theſe parts, and the <hi>whole life</hi> is affected from the injury done to the part; and this, becauſe the <hi>whole</hi> is connected with every
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:031881_0048_0FEF090474CFAB28"/>
part, and every part with the <hi>whole.</hi> This, howev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, is greater or leſs in proportion as the part is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected either remotely or nearly with interior or central life. Thus, poiſons applied directly to the heart, ſoon deſtroy its motions, and produce death; applied to the brain, the effect is ſtill more ſudden. But poiſons, however active, never can affect theſe organs, except through fluid media: I doubt wheth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er there is any perception by the nerves, but in this way. Now,</p>
               <p>DEATH never happens, or in other words animal life never leaves its material form, until this form is impaired by having its more ſubtle and animate principles or materials perverted or corrupted; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially thoſe which reſide in the brain and are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the <hi>blood</hi> or through this medium. This certainly is the caſe with all malignant diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes. Nor does this idea differ widely from Dr. Mitchill's notion of <hi>putrid ferments</hi> or <hi>putrefaction,</hi> which he defines, "a reſolution of an organic body into its elementary atoms."</p>
               <p>WHETHER <hi>ſepton</hi> or <hi>ſeptic acid</hi> really is the cauſe of malignant diſeaſes, is problematical; experiments and future obſervations have yet to decide. Neith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the affirmative nor negative is yet clearly or ſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isfactorily proved.</p>
               <p>I SUSPECT Dr. Mitchill has been led to adopt his opinion of the cauſe of peſtilential diſeaſes moſtly from <hi>appearances:</hi> Thus it is found that all thoſe
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:031881_0049_0FEF091A2895EC50"/>
ſpots and ſoils, where nitre is produced in greateſt abundance, are unhealthy, <abbr>viz.</abbr> Egypt, Perſia, and the Eaſt-Indies. But it does not follow, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe diſeaſes are connected with the ſoil in which nitre is found, that it is, in any ſhape or form, the cauſe of theſe diſeaſes. Nitre is commonly thought to be the <hi>reſult</hi> or <hi>reſiduum</hi> of putrefactions, and is very ſeldom found in a vaporous or unſaturated ſtate, in which it <hi>muſt be</hi> when taken into the ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem by cuticular abſorbents, or inhaled by the lungs in reſpiration. But I ſhall be anſwered, that ſepton or the radical of nitre is ſaturated by <hi>oxygen</hi> or <hi>vital air,</hi> which is taken from the atmoſphere, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by made unhealthy. But this would make hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen (inflammable air) the cauſe of theſe diſeaſes; for then this gas would be in undue proportion.</p>
               <p>SOME probable reaſon might be brought in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the opinion that oxygen or vital air, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be the ſubſtance with which it is combined, may be highly injurious, if not the cauſe proximate of many diſeaſes, when in over proportion; although it is in other circumſtances undeniably the great ſupporter of life and health. It is certain that it gives cauſticity to every preparation that acts as ſuch on the human ſyſtem. Without oxy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen there is no putrefaction, no change or waſte of ſubſtance; no corroſion, ruſt, or decay of metals or minerals.</p>
               <p>GREEN peas, green corn, &amp;c. when gluttonouſly eaten, have been known to produce a moſt diſtreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <hi>diarrhoea;</hi> and not unfrequently a <hi>cholera mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus.</hi> Theſe ſubſtances are ſaid to contain much oxygen.</p>
               <p>WHICH, therefore, of the above principles has the greateſt ſhare in the production of diſeaſes, will not be decided, until ſome ſtandard, or <hi>Gaſmetre,</hi> ſhall be invented, by which it can be known what is the peculiar ſtate of the atmoſphere when they prevail.</p>
               <p>IT is ſomewhat ſingular that the ſame principles, which by phyſicians in America is conſidered as the cauſe of peſtilential diſeaſes, in Europe is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolled as a ſovereign remedy for their cure and prevention.</p>
               <p>BUT more directly to the point in queſtion.—By ſome phyſicians it has been ſtrenuouſly contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and with much ingenuity of reaſoning, that the fever of Philadelphia, New-York and Boſton had its <hi>origin</hi> in thoſe places. Others ſay that it origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from <hi>fomes</hi> of foreign import.</p>
               <p>THE ſame cauſes muſt every where produce the ſame effects; and the ſame noxious ſubſtances in one place will produce the ſame diſorders as in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, all other circumſtances being the ſame.</p>
               <p>THAT there may be, in either of the above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned capitals, ſuch a peculiar ſtate of the atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere, or ſuch a combination of noxious ſubſtances as will give riſe to contagious diſeaſes, cannot be

diſputed. But it is within the ſouthern or middle latitudes that theſe diſeaſes moſt commonly have their origin. It is here that we find material quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in a more naked and uncombined ſtate, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently more powerfully active. Here putrefaction is ſudden, and vegetation rapid. Here alſo is the region of elementary contention and violence; hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricanes, tornadoes, ſulphureous exploſions, volca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noes, and earthquakes. Every ſpecies of tropical wind has its peculiar diſeaſes, the Monſoons, Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mattan, Samiel, &amp;c. The winds of theſe regions va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry their terrors; ſometimes involving all things in a ſuffocating heat; ſometimes mixing all the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of fire, air, water, earth together; ſometimes with a momentary ſwiftneſs paſſing over the face of the country, and deſtroying all things in their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage.</p>
               <p>AT Minorca and Gibraltar the winds which at times blow there from the interior of the country are very deſtructive, and at the Falkland Iſlands an extraordinary wind is felt, occaſionally, ſo blaſting as to cut the herbage down, equal to the raging of fire; the leaves are parched and crumbled to duſt. So at Goree, on the river Senegal, there is an eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly wind from the inland parts, with which thoſe who are ſuddenly met by it in the face are ſcorched, as by a blaſt from a furnace.</p>
               <p>BUT beyond all others in its dreadful effects, is the <hi>Samiel,</hi> or mortifying wind, of the deſerts near Bagdad. The camels, either by inſtinct or experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:031881_0052_0FEF0912780B1F48"/>
have notice of its approach, and are ſo well aware of it, that they are ſaid to make an unuſual noiſe, and cover up their noſes in the ſand. To eſcape its effects, travellers throw themſelves as cloſe as poſſible to the ground, and wait till it has paſſed by, which is commonly in a few minutes. As ſoon as they, who have life, dare to riſe again, they exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine how it fares with their companions, by pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at their arms or legs; for if they are deſtroyed by the wind, their limbs are abſolutely mortified, and will come aſunder. See Adams's Philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Lectures.</p>
               <p>In northern latitudes the atmoſphere is uniform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly temperate and neutral; and if there are malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant diſeaſes, here originated, it muſt be more in conſequence of idleneſs, neglect of cleanlineſs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and external, or ſome moral default, than of ſituation.</p>
               <p>All this being agreeable to fact, the opinion that the miaſma of malignant diſeaſes, more eſpecially the one of which we have treated, is imported from ſome ſultry climate, ſeems moſt probable.</p>
               <p>FEW capitals, perhaps none, are more heathfully ſituated than Boſton. It is on a peninſula, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ventilated on all ſides by water breezes. The ſtreets almoſt all are ſo much inclined as to be waſhed and cleanſed by every ſhower. None—or very few places where filth can collect and ſtagnate without great neglect of ſcavenger duty. On the
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:031881_0053_0FEF09ABCE493DE8"/>
weſt ſide is a large common of 20 acres or more extent covered with verdure, with a mall adjoining: A ſpot more beautiful and recreative is not found in any country. A walk here may well be called a healthful luxury.</p>
               <p>AN elegant State-houſe, and other rich buildings; the ſurrounding back country, with its hills and vales; the intervening waters, and other agreeable objects which diverſify the proſpect, all unite to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this place extremely delightful.</p>
               <p>THUS favourably circumſtanced, to what muſt it be owing, ſhould Boſton be again viſited with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious malady? No doubt to ſtreet filth and other impurities which adulterate and deſtroy the healthy qualities of the air, and render it a fit vehicle for the circulation and extenſion of the peſts of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, here originated, or, introduced from ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern climates.</p>
