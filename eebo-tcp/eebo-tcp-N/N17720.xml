            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Subscribers (to whom the Editor thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully professes his obligations) may reasonably expect an apology for the delay, which has at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the appearance of THE CONTRAST; but, as the true cause cannot be declared with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leading to a discussion, which the Editor wishes to avoid, he hopes, that the care and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, which have been bestowed upon this work, will be accepted, without further scrutiny, as an atonement for his seeming negligence.</p>
            <p>In justice to the Author, however, it may be proper to observe, that this Comedy has many claims to the public indulgence, independent of its intrinsic merits: It is the first essay of American genius in a difficult species of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position; it was written by one, who never cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:022948_0006_0FBAC52B647B0CE0"/>
studied the rules of the drama, and, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, had seen but few of the exhibitions of the stage; it was undertaken and finished in the course of three weeks; and the profits of one night's performance were appropriated to the benefit of the sufferers by the fire at <hi>Boston.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These considerations will therefore it is hoped, supply in the closet the advantages, that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from representation, and dispose the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to join in the applause, which has been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed on this Comedy by numerous and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious audiences in the Theatres of <hi>Philadelphia, New-York,</hi> and <hi>Maryland.</hi>

                     <p>No, I don't say so: It may be very becoming to saunter round the house of a rainy day; to visit my grand-mamma, or to go to Quakers' meeting; but to swim in a minuet, with the eyes of fifty well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed beaux upon me, to trip it in the Mall, or walk on the battery, give me the luxurious, jaunty, flowing, bell-hoop. It would have delighted you to have seen me the last evening, my charming girl! I was dangling o'er the battery with Billy Dimple; a knot of young fellows were upon the platform; as I passed them I faultered with one of the most bewitching false steps you ever saw, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered myself with such a pretty confusion, flirting my hoop to discover a jet black shoe and brilliant buckle. Gad! how my little heart thrilled to hear the confused raptures of —  "<hi>Demme, Jack, what a delicate foot!</hi>" "<hi> Ha! General, what a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd — </hi>"</p>

                     <p>Fie! fie! Charlotte, <stage>[stopping her mouth]</stage> I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test you are quite a libertine.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>CHARLOTTE.</speaker>
                     <p>Why, my dear little prude, are we not all such libertines? Do you think, when I sat tortured two hours under the hands of my friseur, and an hour more at my toilet, that I had any thoughts of my aunt Susan, or my cousin Betsey? though they are both allowed to be critical judges of dress.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>LETITIA.</speaker>
                     <p>Why, who should we dress to please, but those who are judges of its merit?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>CHARLOTTE.</speaker>
                     <p>Why a creature who does not know <hi>Buffon</hi> from <hi>Soufleè</hi> — Man! — my Letitia — Man! for whom we dress, walk, dance, talk, lisp, languish, and smile. Does not the grave Spectator assure us, that even our much bepraised diffidence, modesty, and blush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, are all directed to make ourselves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> good wives and mothers as fast as we can. Why I'll undertake with one flirt of this hoop to bring more beaux to my feet in one week, than the grave Maria, and her sentimental circle, can do, by sighing sentiment till their hairs are grey.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>LETITIA.</speaker>
                     <p>Well, I won't argue with you; you always out talk me; let us change the subject. I hear that Mr. Dimple and Maria are soon to be married.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>CHARLOTTE.</speaker>
                     <p>You hear true. I was consulted in the choice of the wedding clothes. She is to be married in a delicate white sattin, and has a monstrous pretty brocaded lutestring for the second day. It would have done you good to have seen with what an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected indifference the dear sentimentalist <hi rend="margQuotes">turned over a thousand pretty things, just as if her heart did not palpitate with her approaching happiness,
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:022948_0023_0FBAC2F7302929A0"/>
and at last made her choice, and</hi> arranged her dress with such apathy, as if she did not know that plain white sattin, and a simple blond lace, would shew her clear skin, and dark hair, to the greatest advantage.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>LETITIA.</speaker>
                     <p>But they say her indifference to dress, and even to the gentleman himself, is not entirely affected.</p>

                     <speaker>CHARLOTTE.</speaker>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>LETITIA.</speaker>
                     <p>It is whispered, that if Maria gives her hand to Mr. Dimple, it will be without her heart.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>CHARLOTTE.</speaker>
                     <p>Though the giving the heart is one of the last of all laughable considerations in the marriage of a girl of spirit, yet I should like to hear what anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quated notions the dear little piece of old fashioned prudery has got in her head.</p>

                     <speaker>LETITIA.</speaker>
                     <p>Why you know that old Mr. John-Richard-Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert-Jacob-Isaac-Abraham-Cornelius Van Dump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, Billy Dimple's father, (for he has thought fit to soften his name, as well as manners, during his English tour) was the most intimate friend of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria's father. The old folks, about a year before Mr. Van Dumpling's death, proposed this match: the young folks were accordingly introduced, and told they must love one another. Billy was then a good natured, decent, dressing young fellow, with a little dash of the coxcomb, such as our young fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows of fortune usually have. At this time, I really believe she thought she loved him; and had they then been married, I doubt not, they might have jogged on, to the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nd of the chapter, a good kind of a sing-song lack-a-daysaical life, as other honest married folks do.</p>

                     <p>Upon the death of his father, Billy went to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land to see the world, and rub off a little of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troon rust. During his absence, Maria like a good girl, to keep herself constant to her <hi>nown true-love,</hi> avoided company, and betook herself, for her amuse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to her books, and her dear Billy's letters. But, alas! how many ways has the mischievous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of inconstancy of stealing into a woman's heart! Her love was destroyed by the very means she took to support it.</p>

                     <p>How? — Oh! I have it — some likely young beau found the way to her study.</p>

                     <p>Be patient, Charlotte — your head so runs upon beaux. — Why she read Sir Charles Grandison, Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rissa Harlow, Shenstone, and the Sentimental Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; and between whiles, as I said, Billy's letters. But as her taste improved, her love declined. The contrast was so striking betwixt the good sense of her books, and the flimsiness of her love-letters, that she discovered she had unthinkingly engaged her hand without her heart; and then the whole transaction managed by the old folks, now appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed so unsentimental, and looked so like bargain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a bale of goods, that she found she ought to have rejected, according to every rule of ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, even the man of her choice, if imposed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her in that manner — Clary Harlow would have scorned such a match.</p>

                     <p>Well, how was it on Mr. Dimple's return? Did he meet a more favourable reception than his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters?</p>

                     <p>Much the same. She spoke of him with respect abroad, and with contempt in her closet. She
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:022948_0025_0FBAC2FBEEF9FC58"/>
watched his conduct and conversation, and found that he had by travelling acquired the wickedness of Lovelace without his wit, and the politeness of Sir Charles Grandison without his generosity. The ruddy youth who washed his face at the cistern every morning, and swore and looked eternal love and constancy, was now metamorphosed into a flip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant, palid, polite beau, who devotes the morning to his toilet, reads a few pages of Chesterfield's let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and then minces out, to put the infamous principles in practice upon every woman he meets.</p>

                     <speaker>LETITIA.</speaker>
                     <p>Why, she thinks her word too sacred to be trifled with. Besides, her father, who has a great respect for the memory of his deceased friend, is ever telling her how he shall renew his years in their union, and repeating the dying injunctions of old Van Dumpling.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>CHARLOTTE.</speaker>
                     <p>A mighty pretty story! And so you would make me believe, that the sensible Maria would give up Dumpling manor, and the all-accomplished Dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as a husband, for the absurd, ridiculous reason, sorsooth, because she despises and abhors him. Just as if a lady could not be privileged to spend a man's fortune, ride in his carriage, be called after his name, and call him her <hi>nown dear lovee</hi> when she wants money, without loving and respecting the great he-creature. Oh! my dear girl, you are a monstrous prude.</p>

<pb n="6" facs="unknown:022948_0026_0FBAC2FD30F28C50"/>
or wishes to break, with Mr. Dimple, depend upon it, she has some other man in her eye. A woman rarely discards one lover, until she is sure of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. — Letitia little thinks what a clue I have to Dimple's conduct. The generous man submits to render himself disgusting to Maria, in order that she may leave him at liberty to address me. I must change the subject.</p>

                     <p>I do not know how that is, but, you may depend upon it, 'tis a done affair. I have it from the best authority. There is my aunt Wyerley's Hannah, (you know Hannah — though a black, she is a wench that was never caught in a lie in her life;) now Hannah has a brother who courts Sarah, Mrs. Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gut the milliner's girl, and she told Hannah's bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Hannah, who, as I said before, is a girl of undoubted veracity, told it directly to me, that Mrs. Catgut was making a new cap for Miss Blooms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, which, as it was very dressy, it is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable is designed for a wedding cap: now, as she is to be married, who can it be to, but to Mr. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digo?

And then to return full fraught with a rich collection of circumstances, to retail to the next circle of our acquaintance under the strongest injunctions of secrecy, — ha, ha, ha! — interlarding the melancholy tale with so many dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful shakes of the head, and more doleful <hi rend="margQuotes">Ah! who would have thought it! so amiable, so prudent a young lady, as we all thought her, what a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous pity! well, I have nothing to charge my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with; I acted the part of a friend, I warned her of the principles of that rake, I told her what would be the consequence; I told her so.

                     <p>My brother is the very counterpart and reverse of me: I am gay, he is grave; I am airy, he is solid; I am ever selecting the most pleasing objects for my laughter, he has a tear for every pitiful one. And thus, whilst he is plucking the briars and thorns from the path of the unfortunate, I am strewing my own path with roses.</p>

                     <p>Hands off, Letitia. I feel the rage of simile up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me; I can't talk to you in any other way. My brother has a heart replete with the noblest sentiments, but then, it is like — it is like — Oh! you provoking girl, you have deranged all my ideas — it is like — Oh! I have it — his heart is like an old maiden lady's band-box; it contains many costly things, arranged with the most scrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous nicety, yet the misfortune is, that they are too delicate, costly, and antiquated, for common use.</p>

                     <p>No, indeed; he makes no pretension to the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. He'd ride, or rather fly, an hundred miles to relieve a distressed object, or to do a gallant act in the service of his country: but, should you drop your fan or bouquet in his presence, it is ten to one, that some beau at the farther end of the room would have the honour of presenting it to you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had observed that it fell. I'll tell you one of his antiquated, anti-gallant notions. — He said once in my presence, in a room full of company — would you believe it — in a large circle of ladies, that the best evidence a gentleman could give a young lady of his respect and affection, was, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour in a friendly manner to rectify her foibles.

sentiment. Now you may judge what a time I had with him, in my twelve months visit to my father. He read me such lectures, out of pure brotherly affection, against the extremes of fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, dress, flirting, and coquetry, and all the other dear things which he knows I doat upon, that, I protest, his conversation made me as melancholy as if I had been at church; and, heaven knows, though I never prayed to go there but on one occasion, yet I would have exchanged his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation for a psalm and a sermon.

                     <p>Indeed you are mistaken; my errand is not of amusement, but business; and as I neither drink nor game, my expences will be so trivial, I shall have no occasion to sell my notes.</p>

                     <p>Then you won't have occasion to do a very good thing. Why, there was the Vermont General — he came down some time since, sold all his musty notes at one stroke, and then laid the cash out in trinkets for his dear Fanny.

                     <p>I shall be ever willing to contribute as far as it is in my power, to adorn, or in any way to please my sister; yet, I hope, I shall never be obliged for this, to sell my notes. I may be romantic, but I preserve them as a sacred deposit. Their full amount is justly due to me, but as embarrassments, the natural consequences of a long war, disable my country from supporting its credit, I shall wait with patience until it is rich enough to discharge them. If that is not in my day, they shall be transmitted as an honourable certificate to posterity, that I have humbly imitated our illustrious WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON, in having exposed my health and life in the service of my country, without reaping any other reward than the glory of conquering in so arduous a contest.</p>

                     <p>Though it is of little consequence to me of what shape my coat is, yet, as to the height of the fashion, there you will please to excuse me, sister. You know my sentiments on that subject. I have often lamented the advantage which the French have over us in that particular. In Paris, the fashions have their dawnings, their routine and declensions, and depend as much upon the caprice of the day as in other countries; but there every lady assumes a right to deviate from the general <hi>ton,</hi> as far as will be of advantage to her own appearance. In America, the cry is, what is the fashion? and we follow it, indiscriminately, because it is so.</p>

                     <p>Therefore it is, that when large hoops are in fashion, we often see many a plump girl lost in the immensity of a hoop-petticoat, whose want of height and <hi>en-bon-point</hi> would never have been remarked in any other dress. When the high head-dress is the mode, how then do we see a lofty cushion, with a profusion of gauze, feathers, and ribband, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by a face no bigger than an apple; whilst a broad full-faced lady, who really would have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared tolerably handsome in a large head-dress, looks with her smart chapeau as masculine as a soldier.</p>

                     <p>Positively this Mall is a very pretty place. I hope the cits won't ruin it by repairs. To be sure it won't do to speak of in the same day with Rane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagh or Vauxhall; however it's a fine place for a young fellow to display his person to advantage. Indeed, nothing is lost here; the girls have taste, and I am very happy to find they have adopted the elegant London fashion of looking back, after a genteel fellow like me, has passed them. — Ah! who comes here? This, by his aukwardness, must be the Yankee colonel's servant. I'll accost him.</p>

                     <p>Why, yes; there's Tabitha Wymen the deacon's daughter, at home, she and I have been courting a great while, and folks say as how we are to be married; and so I broke a piece of money with her when we parted, and she promised not to spark it with Solomon Dyer while I am gone.

My mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter instantly dropped upon his knees, with eyes swimming with love, cheeks glowing with desire, and in the gentlest modulation of voice, he said — My dear Caroline, in a few months our hands will be indissolubly united at the altar; our hearts I feel are already so — the favours you now grant as evidence of your affection, are favours indeed; yet when the ceremony is once past, what will now be received with rapture, will then be attributed to duty.</p>

upon her person." Extremely just, my lord; every day's delightful experience confirms this. "If her face is so shocking, that she must, in some degree, be conscious of it, her figure and air, she thinks, make ample amends for it." The sallow Miss Wan is a proof of this. — Upon my telling the distasteful wretch, the other day, that her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance spoke the pensive language of sentiment, and that Lady Wortley Montague declared, that if the ladies were arrayed in the garb of innocence, the face would be the last part which would be admired, as Monsieur Milton expresses it, she grin'd horribly a ghastly smile.

                     <p>My master and I obtain our knowledge from the same source; — though, gad! I think myself much the prettier fellow of the two. <stage>[Surveying himself in the glass.]</stage> That was a brilliant thought, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuate that I folded my master's letters for him; the folding is so neat, that it does honour to the operator. I once intended to have insinuated that I wrote his letters too; but that was before I saw them; it won't do now: no honour there, positive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. — "Nothing looks more vulgar, <stage>[reading af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectedly]</stage> ordinary, and illiberal, than ugly, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>even, and ragged nails; the ends of which should be kept even and clean, not tipped with black, and cut in small segments of circles" — Seg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of circles! surely my lord did not consider
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:022948_0058_0FBAC33FF48E5498"/>
that he wrote for the beaux. Segments of circles! what a crabbed term! Now I dare answer, that my master, with all his learning, does not know that this means, according to the present mode, to let the nails grow long, and then cut them off even at top. <stage>[Laughing without.]</stage> Ha! that's Jenny's titter. I protest I despair of ever teaching that girl to laugh; she has something so execrably na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural in her laugh, that I declare it absolutely dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>composes my nerves.

                  </sp>

                     <speaker>JENNY.</speaker>
                     <p>So, Mr. Jonathan, I hear you were at the play last night.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>JONATHAN.</speaker>
                     <p>At the play! why, did you think I went to the devil's drawing-room?</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>JENNY.</speaker>
                     <p>The devil's drawing-room!</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>JONATHAN.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes; why an't cards and dice the devil's device;
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:022948_0060_0FBAC342EFC23A10"/>
and the play-house the shop where the devil hangs out the vanities of the world, upon the tenter-hooks of temptation. I believe you have not heard how they were acting the old boy one night, and the wicked one came among them sure enough; and went right off in a storm, and carried one quarter of the play-house with him. Oh! no, no, no! you won't catch me at a play-house, I warrant you.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>JENNY.</speaker>
                     <p>Well, Mr. Jonathan, though I don't scruple your veracity, I have some reasons for believing you were there: pray, where were you about six o'clock?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>JONATHAN.</speaker>
                     <p>Why, I went to see one Mr. Morrison, the <hi>hocus pocus</hi> man; they said as how he could eat a case knife.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>JENNY.</speaker>
                     <p>Well, and how did you find the place?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>JONATHAN.</speaker>
                     <p>As I was going about here and there, to and again, to find it, I saw a great croud of folks go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into a long entry, that had lantherns over the door; so I asked a man, whether that was not the place where they played <hi>hocus pocus?</hi> He was a very civil kind man, though he did speak like the Hessians; he lifted up his eyes and said — "they play <hi>hocus pocus</hi> tricks enough there, Got knows, mine friend."</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>JENNY.</speaker>
                     <p>Well — </p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>JONATHAN.</speaker>
                     <p>So I went right in, and they shewed me away clean up to the garret, just like meeting-house gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery. And so I saw a power of topping folks, all sitting round in little cabbins, <hi rend="margQuotes">just like father's corn-cribs;</hi> — and then there was such a squeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the fiddles, and such a tarnal blaze with
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:022948_0061_0FBAC34651050E40"/>
the lights, my head was near turned. At last the people that sat near me set up such a hissing — hiss — like so many mad cats; and then they went thump, thump, thump, just like our Peleg threshing wheat, and stampt away, just like the nation; and called out for one Mr. Langolee, — I suppose he helps acts the tricks.</p>

                     <speaker>JENNY.</speaker>
                     <p>Well, and what did you do all this time?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>JONATHAN.</speaker>
                     <p>Gor, I — I liked the fun, and so I thumpt away, and hiss'd as lustily as the best of 'em. One <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looking man that sat by me, seeing me stamp, and knowing I was a cute fellow, because I could make a roaring noise, clapt me on the shoulder and said, you are a d — d hearty cock, smite my timbers! I told him so I was, but I thought he need not swear so, and make use of such naughty words.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>JESSAMY.</speaker>
                     <p>The savage! — Well, and did you see the man with his tricks?</p>

                     <speaker>JONATHAN.</speaker>
                     <p>Why I vow, as I was looking out for him, they lifted up a great green cloth, and let us look right into the next neighbour's house. Have you a good many houses in New-York made so in that 'er<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                     <speaker>JENNY.</speaker>
                     <p>Not many: but did you see the family?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>JONATHAN.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, swamp it; I see'd the family.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>JENNY.</speaker>
                     <p>Well, and how did you like them?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>JONATHAN.</speaker>
                     <p>Why, I vow they were pretty much like other families; — there was a poor, good natured, curse of a husband, and a sad rantipole of a wife.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>

                     <speaker>JONATHAN.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes. There was one youngster, they called him Mr. Joseph; he talked as sober and as pious as a minister; but like some ministers that I know, he was a fly tike in his heart for all that: He was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ask a young woman to spark it with him, and — the Lord have mercy on my soul! — she was another man's wife.</p>

                     <speaker>JONATHAN.</speaker>
                     <p>Why they came on as thick as mustard. For my part, I thought the house was haunted. There was a soldier fellow, who talked about his row de dow, dow, and courted a young woman: but of all the cute folk I saw, I liked one little fellow — </p>

                     <speaker>JENNY.</speaker>
                     <p>Aye! who was he?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>JONATHAN.</speaker>
                     <p>Why, he had red hair, and a little round plump face like mine, only not altogether so handsome. His name was — Darby; — that was his baptizing name, his other name I forgot. Oh! it was, Wig — Wag — Wag-all, Darby Wag-all; — pray, do you know him? — I should like to take a sling with him, or a drap of cyder with a pepper-pod in it, to make it warm and comfortable.</p>

                     <speaker>JONATHAN.</speaker>
                     <p>I wish you did, he is a cute fellow. But there was one thing I did'nt like in that Mr. Darby; and that was, he was afraid of some of them 'ere shoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing irons, such as your troopers wear on training days. Now, I'm a true born Yankee American son of liberty, and I never was afraid of a gun yet in all my life.</p>

                     <p>Why, I vow I began to smell a rat. When I came away, I went to the man for my money again: you want your money, says he; yes, says I; for what, says he; why, says I, no man shall jocky me out of my money; I paid my money to see sights, and the dogs a bit of a sight have I seen, unless you call listening to people's private business a sight. Why, says he, it is the School for Scandalization. — The School for Scandalization! — Oh! ho! no wonder you New-York folks are so cute at it, when you go to school to learn it: and so I jogged off.</p>

                     <p>It must be so, Montague! and it is not all the tribe of Mandevilles shall convince me, that a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to become great, must first become dissipated. Luxury is surely the bane of a nation: Luxury! which enervates both soul and body, by opening a thousand new sources of enjoyment, opens, also, a thousand new sources of contention and want: Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury! which renders a people weak at home, and accessible to bribery, corruption, and force from abroad. When the Grecian states knew no other tools than the axe and the saw, the Grecians were a great, a free, and a happy people. The kings of Greece devoted their lives to the service of their country, and her senators knew no other superiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty over their fellow-citizens, than a glorious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence in danger and virtue. They exhibited to the world a noble spectacle, — a number of inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent states united by a similarity of language, sentiment, manners, common interest, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon consent, in one grand mutual league of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. — And, thus united, long might they have continued the cherishers of arts and sciences, the protectors of the oppressed, the scourge of tyrants, and the safe asylum of liberty: But when foreign gold, and still more pernicious, foreign luxury, had crept among them, they sapped the vitals of their virtue. The virtues of their ancestors were only found in their writings. Envy and suspicion, the vices of little minds, possessed them. The va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious states engendered jealousies of each other; and, more unfortunately, growing jealous of their great federal council, the Amphictyons, they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got that their common safety had existed, and would
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:022948_0069_0FBAC3542DD58D10"/>
exist, in giving them an honourable extensive pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative. The common good was lost in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit of private interest; and that people, who, by uniting, might have stood against the world in arms, by dividing, crumbled into ruin; — their name is now only known in the page of the historian, and what they once were, is all we have left to admire. Oh! that America! Oh! that my country, would in this her day, learn the things which belong to her peace!</p>

                     <p>Sir, there is no character so respectable as that of a soldier. And, indeed, when we reflect how much we owe to those brave men who have suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed so much in the service of their country, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured

to us those inestimable blessings that we how enjoy, our liberty and independence, they demand every attention which gratitude can pay. For my own part, I never meet an officer, but I embrace him as my friend, nor a private in distress, but I insensibly extend my charity to him. — I have hit the Bumkin off very tolerably. <stage>[A side.]</stage>

when a man of the world and a finished co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet meet, who perfectly know each other: but how delicious is it to excite the emotions of joy, hope, expectation, and delight, in the bosom of a lovely girl, who believes every tittle of what you say to be serious.</p>

In my opinion, the man, who, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretensions of marriage, can plant thorns in the bosom of an innocent, unsuspecting girl, is more detestable than a common robber, in the same pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, as private violence is more despicable than open force, and money of less value than happiness.</p>

                     <p>Cautious, Sir! <hi rend="margQuotes">No person more approves of an intercourse between the sexes than I do. Female conversation softens our manners, whilst our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, from the superiority of our literary ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, improves their minds. But, in our young country, where there is no such thing as gallantry, when a gentleman speaks of love to a lady, whether he mentions marriage, or not, she ought to conclude, either that he meant to insult her, or, that his intentions are the most serious and honourable.</hi> How mean, how cruel, is it, by a thousand tender assiduities, to win the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of an amiable girl, and, though you leave her virtue unspotted, to betray her into the appearance of so many tender partialities, that every man of delicacy would suppress his inclination towards her, by supposing her heart engaged! Can any man, for the trivial gratification of his leisure-hours, affect the happiness of a whole life! His not having spoken of marriage, may add to his perfidy, but can be no excuse for his conduct.</p>

                     <p>Pardon me, Madam; that is the avocation of a man of taste. But, for amusement, I positively know of nothing that can be called so, unless you dignify with that title the hopping once a fortnight to the sound of two or three squeaking fiddles, and the clattering of the old tavern windows, or sitting to see the miserable mummers, whom you call ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, murder comedy, and make a farce of tragedy.</p>

                     <p>Faith, Madam, I cannot tell; for I sat with my back to the stage all the time, admiring a much better actress than any there; — a lady who played the fine woman to perfection; — though, by the laugh of the horrid creatures round me, I suppose it was comedy. Yet, on second thoughts, it might be some hero in a tragedy, dying so comically as to set the whole house in an uproar. — Colonel, I presume you have been in Europe?</p>

                  <sp>

                     <speaker>DIMPLE.</speaker>
                     <p>Believe me, colonel, you have an immense plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to come; and when you shall have seen the brilliant exhibitions of Europe, you will learn to despise the amusements of this country as much as I do.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>MANLY.</speaker>
                     <p>Therefore I do not wish to see them; for I can never esteem that knowledge valuable, which tends to give me a distaste for my native country.</p>

                     <p>I have, a little: and by it have discovered, that there is a laudable partiality, which ignorant, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travelled men entertain for every thing that belongs to their native country. I call it laudable; — it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jures no one; adds to their own happiness; and, when extended, becomes the noble principle of patriotism. Travelled gentlemen rise superior, in their own opinion, to this: but, if the contempt, which they contract for their country, is the most valuable acquisition of their travels, I am far from thinking that their time and money are well spent.</p>

                     <p>It cannot possibly be true! The son of my old friend can't have acted so unadvisedly. Seventeen thousand pounds! In bills! — Mr. Transfer must have been mistaken. He always appeared so pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and talked so well upon money-matters, and
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:022948_0083_0FBAC3723259B988"/>
even assured me, that he intended to change his dress, for a suit of clothes which would not cost so much, and look more substantial, as soon as he married. No, no, no! it can't be; it cannot be. — But, however, I must look out sharp. I did not care what his principles or his actions were, so long as he minded the main chance. Seventeen thousand pounds! — If he had lost it in trade, why the best men may have ill-luck; but to game it away, as Transfer says — why, at this rate, his whole estate may go in one night, and, what is ten times worse, mine into the bargain. No, no; Mary is right. Leave women to look out in these matters; for all they look as if they did'nt know a journal from a ledger, when their interest is concerned, they know what's what; they mind the main chance as well as the best of us. — I wonder Mary did not tell me she knew of his spending his money so foolishly. Seventeen thousand pounds! Why, if my daughter was standing up to be married, I would forbid the banns, if I found it was to a man who did not mind the main chance. — Hush! I hear somebody coming. 'Tis Mary's voice: a man with her too! I shou'd'nt be surprized if this should be the other string to her bow. — Aye, aye, let them alone; women understand the main chance. — Though, i faith, I'll listen a little. <stage>[Retires into a closet.]</stage>

                     <p>Do you then disapprove my suit, Madam, or the abruptness of my introducing it? If the latter, my peculiar situation, being obliged to leave the city in a few days, will, I hope, be my excuse; if the former, I will retire: for I am sure I would not give a moment's inquietude to her, whom I could devote my life to please. I am not so indelicate as to seek your immediate approbation; permit me only to be near you, and by a thousand tender as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siduities, to endeavour to excite a grateful return.</p>

You must — you ever ought to consider that man as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of you, who seeks an interest in your heart, contrary to a father's approbation. A young lady should reflect, that the loss of a lover may be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, but nothing can compensate for the loss of a parent's affection. Yet, why do you suppose your father would disapprove? In our country, the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are not sacrificed to riches, or family-ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grandizement: — should you approve, my family is decent, and my rank honourable.</p>

                     <p>Why, such a tarnal cross like you never saw! — You would have counted she had lived upon crab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apples and vinegar for a fortnight. But what the rattle makes you look so tarnation glum?</p>

                     <p>Coolly do you call it? Why, I vow, she was fire-hot angry: may be, it was because I buss'd her.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>JESSAMY.</speaker>
                     <p>No, no, Mr. Jonathan; there must be some other cause: I never yet knew a lady angry at being kissed.</p>

                     <speaker>JESSAMY.</speaker>

                     <speaker>JONATHAN.</speaker>
                     <p>Grace! Why, does the young woman expect I must be converted before I court her?</p>

                     <speaker>JESSAMY.</speaker>
                     <p>I mean graces of person: for instance, my lord tells us, that we must cut off our nails even at top, in small segments of circles; — though you won't

                     <p>That's the very fault, Mr. Jonathan. Besides, you absolutely misplace it. I was told by a friend of mine, that you laughed outright at the play the other night, when you ought only to have tittered.</p>

                     <speaker>JONATHAN.</speaker>

                     <p>Why you know, Mr. Jonathan, that to dance, a lady to play with her fan, or a gentleman with his cane, and all other natural motions, are regulated by art. My master has composed an immensely pretty gamut, by which any lady, or gentleman, with a few years close application, may learn to laugh as gracefully, as if they were born and bred to it.</p>

                     <speaker>JONATHAN.</speaker>

                     <speaker>JESSAMY.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes. It comprises every possible display of jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularity, from an <hi>offettuoso</hi> smile to a <hi>piano</hi> titter, or full chorus <hi>fortissimo</hi> ha, ha, ha! My master em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys his leisure-hours in marking out the plays, like a cathedral chanting-book, that the ignorant may know where to laugh; and that pit, box, and gallery, may keep time together, and not have a snigger in one part of the house, a broad grin in
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:022948_0088_0FBAC37B622D34E0"/>
the other, and a d — d grum look in the third. How delightful to see the audience all smile toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then look on their books, then twist their mouths into an agreeable simper, then altogether shake the house with a general ha, ha, ha! loud as a full chorus of Handel's, at an Abbey-commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>

Aye! there's the sting; for, were I assured that Maria was happy, my heart is not so selfish, but that it would dilate in knowing it, even though it were with another. — But to know she is unhappy! — I must drive these thoughts from me.

                           <l>Love, free as air, at sight of human ties,</l>
                           <l>Spreads his light wings, and in a moment flies.</l>
                        </q>
Come then, my charming angel! why delay our bliss? The present moment is ours; the next is in the hand of fate. <stage>[Kissing her.]</stage>

                     <p>Sir, — upon my honour — all I know is, that I was talking to this young lady, and this gentleman broke in on us, in a very extraordinary manner.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>VAN ROUGH.</speaker>
                     <p>Why, all this is nothing to the purpose: can you explain it, Miss? <stage>[To Charlotte.]</stage>

                     <speaker>LETITIA.</speaker>
                     <p>I can explain it to that gentleman's confusion. Though long betrothed to your daughter, <stage>[to Van Rough]</stage> yet allured by my fortune, it seems, (with shame do I speak it) he has privately paid his addresses to me. I was drawn-in to listen to him by his assuring me, that the match was made by his father without his consent, and that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to break with Maria, whether he married me or not. But whatever were his intentions respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your daughter, Sir, even to me he was false; for he has repeated the same story, with some cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el reflections upon my person, to Miss Manly.</p>

                     <speaker>LETITIA.</speaker>
                     <p>Nor is this all, Miss Manly. When he was with me this very morning, he made the same un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generous reflections upon the weakness of your

                     <p>Ha! since I have lost Letitia, I believe I had as good make it up with Maria. —  Mr. Van Rough, at present I cannot enter into particulars; but, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, I can explain every thing to your satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in private.</p>

                     <p>There is another matter, Mr. Van Dumpling, which I would have you explain: — pray, Sir, have Messrs. Van Cash &amp; Co. presented you those bills for acceptance?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>DIMPLE.</speaker>
                     <p>The deuce! Has he heard of those bills! Nay, then, all's up with Maria too; but an affair of this sort can never prejudice me among the ladies; they will rather long to know what the dear crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture possesses to make him so agreeable. <stage>[A side.]</stage> Sir, you'll hear from me. <stage>[To Manly.]</stage>

                     <speaker>MANLY.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, Sir: — This sword was presented to me by that brave Gallic hero, the Marquis DE LA FAY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ETTE. I have drawn it in the service of my country, and in private life, on the only occasion where a man is justified in drawing his sword, in defence of a lady's honour. I have fought too many bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles in the service of my country to dread the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of cowardice. — Death from a man of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour would be a glory you do not merit; you shall live to bear the insult of man, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt

                     <p>I'll venture that, Sir. — The reputation of my life does not depend upon the breath of a Mr. Dimple.
