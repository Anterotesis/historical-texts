            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     </gap> unto Him. How, How can I go on in Sinning againſt ſuch <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nmatcheable</hi> goodneſs! Truly, the Natural Inference to be drawn from this admirable <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of God, is That: Iſa. 55.7. <hi>Let the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Return unto the Lord, &amp; He will have Mercy on him, &amp; unto our God, for He will abundantly Pardon.</hi> One would think, This were enough to break the Heart of the moſt obdurate and obſtinate Sinner in the World. What? After all thy hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible <hi>Sinfulneſs,</hi> O man, will the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of God, receive thy Returning Soul into its Embraces? And beſtow Everlaſting <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Bleſſedneſs</hi> upon thee? Surely, An Heart well-ſteeped in the Oyl of ſuch goodneſs will be no longer able to Reſiſt the Calls unto <hi>Repentance</hi>! When we are aſſured, Lam. 3.25. <hi>The Lord is good unto the Soul that ſeeks Him</hi>; it na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally <hi>Leads</hi> us to Reſolve, <hi>O my God, I will ſeek thee, I will ſeek thee, &amp; no longer Sin againſt thee!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of God <hi>Leads</hi> us to reckon <hi>Sin,</hi> the moſt unreaſonable and abominable <hi>Evil.</hi> Since God is <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> it ſelf, what muſt that be, that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary

to God? Certainly, <hi>Sin</hi> muſt be very <hi>Evil,</hi> becauſe it is contrary to <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> it ſelf. Tis with good Reaſon, that <hi>Sin</hi> is called, Joh. 17 15. <hi>The Evil.</hi> But the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of God then pronounces it an unreaſonable Thing to Sin againſt God; and loudly calls upon us, <hi>To abhor that which is Evil</hi>: And ſuch <hi>Abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> implyes <hi>Repenta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>It was of old ſaid, <hi>Ye that Love the Lord, Hate Evil.</hi> Oh!

Why ſhould I by Sn, violate the Laws of the only Wiſe GOD, &amp; find fault with that Will of Heaven, which is nothing but a tranſcript of the moſt Exquiſite Wiſdom?

               <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of God <hi>Leads</hi> us to Deteſt Sin, under the Character of the Higheſt <hi>Ingratitude</hi> unto the moſt High

It is not poſſible to offer any <hi>Contempt</hi> or <hi>Miſchief</hi> unto the Almighty, but what is offered by Sin continually. Yea, <hi>Sin</hi> ſtrikes at the very <hi>Life</hi> of God Himſelf: It fetches an impotent ſtroke at the very Heart of the Everliving God; The Aim of Sin is to <hi>

                  <q>The poor Chriſtian Captives, that are taken by any of thoſe Helliſh Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, belonging to the Emperour of <hi>Morocco,</hi> are brought up to <hi>Macqueneſs</hi>; being kept at Hard work, from Day-light in the Morning till Night: carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Earth on their Heads in great Bask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, driven to and fro, with barbarous Negroes by the Emperours Order; and when they are drove home by the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes at Night, to their Lodging, which is on the cold Ground, in a Vault or hollow place in the Earth, laid over with great Beams athwart, and Iron Bars o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them; they are told in there, like Sheep, and out in the Morning; and if any be wanting, he quickly ſecures the Negroes, and ſends out a parcel of his Guard, to look for them. Their Food is Bread, made of old rotten Barley; and their Drink, Water, when they can get it: Many times, when they are hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried unto their work in a Morning, not knowing, whether they ſhall be able to
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:001123_0034_0FB040651FD7B3F0"/>
undergo their Afflictions till Night and when they are drove Home, expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Reſt, the Tyrant ſends ſome of his Negroes, to hurry them again to work, either to hale down Walls, cut Gates, or the like; keeping them both Day and Night, many times without either Bread or Water, which is all their Suſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enance. When they have done That, the Negroes dare not drive them home, before he gives Order, leſt they be kill'd for their ſo doing. When they have his Order, they drive them home, tell them over, and ſo lock them up until Day-light in the Morning. There are Three Hundred and Forty Engliſhmen (<hi>ſayes he</hi>) in this ſore Captivity.</q>

               <p n="4">IV. It is a Remarkable <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of God, That now the Deliverance of theſe our Friends is accompliſhed, and in a ſignal <hi>Anſwer to Prayer</hi> accompliſhed, and this not without great Obſtrctuions to the <hi>Accompliſhment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such was the known Treachery and Perfidy of the Falſe Tyrant, who held theſe our Friends in Bondage, that every one deſpaired of their Deliverance.</p>
               <p>For inſtance;</p>
               <p>In the Year, 1680. the Engliſh Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, which were under this fierce Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, ſent over a Petition to the King of <hi>England,</hi> that ſomething might be done for them. An Engliſh Captain being ſent over, came to an Agreement with him, for their Deliverance, and the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives were actually put into his Hands.
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:001123_0044_0FB04071EA5616C8"/>
The <hi>Shack</hi> of the Jews, who had order to build a Town for this Faithleſs Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, came to him, telling him that if he would let him have the <hi>Christians,</hi> to build the <hi>Jews-Town,</hi> he would give him as much Money as the Engliſh Captain had agreed with him for. The next Morning, this <hi>African Monſter</hi> ſent out his Negroes, to drive back the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, which were hurried again to their old Slavery, in the Cruelleſt manner ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable: And there was an end of the matter! Though the Vengeance of God quickly purſued that Jew, who not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Connivance of the Emperour, had his Brains horribly trod out, by one who purpoſely Rode over him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Time, the ſett Time for Favour,</hi> was not <hi>then</hi> come. <hi>Now</hi> 'tis; and this with a Touch from Heaven upon the Heart of a <hi>Devil Incarnate</hi> compelling him to deal more truly than he uſe to do.</p>
               <p>The Difficulty of Gathering the <hi>Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome</hi> was at laſt got over; every other Impediment was removed: And, <hi>who art thou, O Mountain, that ſhall sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>What has brought all this about? Oh! 'Tis PRAYER, 'Tis PRAYER, that has done it all.
