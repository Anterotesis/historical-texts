            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Here he has laid together an admirable variety of just &amp; wise &amp; useful observations; many of which run counter to some of the receiv'd Notions of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and at first view do not a little surprise and shock our Minds; but upon an impartial conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration they approve themselves to our enlighten'd reason, and challenge our belief &amp; entertainment of them, as <hi>true</hi> and <hi>faithful sayings.</hi> He largely and clearly proves the vanity of this World; the vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Sin; the wisdom, excellency &amp; manifold ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of Religion, and the necessity of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious in order to being happy.</p>

In a <hi>good Name</hi> is imply'd true <hi>solid religion;</hi> the reality, as well as a repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation for it.</p>
                  <p>AND the Words carry in them this great truth, That <hi>a deserved good Name, or just character for wisdom &amp; piety, is really more valuable, than all the pomp, &amp; pleasures, &amp; profits of this transitory World.</hi> A <hi>good Name</hi> is what all, that have any sense of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency or humanity, do put a <hi>high estimate</hi> upon, and rate even next unto <hi>Life:</hi> but to <hi>deserve</hi> a good Name is in truth <hi>more</hi> to be valu'd &amp; desir'd than Life it self.

The good Man finds in the ways of religion the <hi>most solid</hi> pleasures, &amp; obtains the <hi>truest</hi> honours, and <hi>durable</hi> riches. He is <hi>rich towards GOD,</hi> a Favourite of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, &amp; entituled to an <hi>Inheritance in Light,</hi> a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Glory; and when call'd out of this World, receives an <hi>open and abundant entrance</hi> thereinto. He then leaves behind him the <hi>Memory of the Just,</hi> which is <hi>blessed:</hi> He leaves his deceased <hi>body</hi> to take it's sweet <hi>rest</hi> in the unactive and impassible Grave, as in a bed of ease and honor, till the bright Morning of the Resurrection; while his <hi>better part,</hi> the immortal Spirit within him, in the moment of his dissolution <hi>returns to GOD,</hi> it's great Creator, Redeemer &amp; Judge; <hi>into whose hand</hi> the departing Saint resign'd it, and by whom it is <hi>received to Glory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>HENCE from these blessed prospects of faith, the wise Preacher adds that noble passage, (the latter clause in our Text, and which only is design'd to employ our present Meditations,)—<hi>The day of Death is better than the day of one<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002336_0005_0FDB2AD18662DB70"/>
speaks of bodily Death, and of natural Birth. He sets these two <hi>extreme</hi> points, <hi>one over against the other,</hi> without regarding the <hi>intermediate</hi> space; as if there was no more in the World, (so vain a thing he judg'd it,) but <hi>a time to be born,</hi> and <hi>a time to die.</hi> And (which is a paradox to foolish Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sualists) the <hi>latter</hi> he votes the more happy period. Not indeed that <hi>Death</hi> merely in a <hi>natural &amp; irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective</hi> sense, is better than one's nativity: Nor that it is preferrible with respect to <hi>all</hi> men, the bad as well as good: No; for to the <hi>wicked,</hi> Death is <hi>the King of Terrors;</hi> the beginning of never-ending Sorrows; the dark entry, into blackness of darkness; the wages of Sin, and the gate of Hell. As for them that <hi>die in their sins,</hi> it were <hi>better for such, if they had never been born.</hi>—The Expression then must be understood in a <hi>restrain'd</hi> and <hi>qualified</hi> sense. It is not every one, but the <hi>godly man</hi> alone, that is here spoken of, the man of a good Name, the man of Wisdom. The Day of <hi>such</hi> an one's death, is better to him, than the Day of his Birth. <q>Tho' as to <hi>others</hi> there was <hi>Joy</hi> when Child was <hi>born</hi> into the World and where there is <hi>Death</hi> there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

DEATH in a <hi>physical</hi> consideration is a disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the vital union between Soul &amp; Body; and so is a terrible <hi>Evil,</hi> very shocking to humane nature.

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>DEATH translates the Elect into a state of</hi> Retribution; <hi>Birth only introduc'd them into a state of</hi> Probation. The present Life is their working season, and time of preparation for Eternity: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

And thus it is often, the Saints are so troubled at or by the grievous ways of bold Transgressors, that they cry out one and another, <hi>Wo is me that I dwell in Mesech, that I sojourn in the tents of Kedar!</hi> and their wish for the <hi>wings of a Dove,</hi> that so they might <hi>flee away and be at rest.</hi>—Yea, here on Earth, the Society of the Godly <hi>among themselves,</hi> is wretchedly imbitter'd &amp; sour'd by the unhappy relicts of the old Leven in them.

of glorified Spirits is <hi>eternal:</hi> their beauty unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; their inheritance incorruptible, their crown unperishable, a more enduring substance, a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. In which respect the Saints in heaven are vastly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier than <hi>Adam</hi> in innocence; and are <hi>as the Angels of GOD;</hi> dwelling in a Kingdom which cannot be moved, in life everlasting. When Believers die, they do in a most emphatical sense <hi>pass from Death unto Life.</hi> Death is the Soul's flight into <hi>the land of the living,</hi> the ocean of divine life; even a state of blessedness, <hi>eternally progressive.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THUS in various regards, <hi>it is made evident that the day of a godly man's death, is better than the day of his birth.</hi> In the day of his death he is <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered</hi> from innumerable <hi>Evils,</hi> which in the day of his birth he was either suffering of or subject unto. And in the day of his Death, he <hi>receives</hi> possession of innumerable &amp; inestimable <hi>Felicities,</hi> infinitely superior to all the advantages and blessings which that state can possibly afford, that in the day of his birth he entred into. He had privileges in his birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day: he has privileges in his death-day: yet <hi>the last are more than the first; and better is the end of his life, than the beginning thereof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>BUT before I come to the Application, let me just hint here one thought further, which is, That as the day of a Believer's death is preferable to the day of his birth, with respect to <hi>himself,</hi> his own <hi>comfort and happiness:</hi> so it is preferable likewise with respect to GOD, his <hi>glory</hi> and praise. <hi>Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints.</hi> When a Saint dies, GOD <hi>receives more glory,</hi>

At his death the <hi>peculiar love and rich grace</hi> of GOD towards the dissolved Person is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play'd in receiving his separated Soul to infinite happiness. At his <hi>birth,</hi> the Person himself could not <hi>actively</hi> praise GOD for his goodness: at best he cou'd only <hi>borrow</hi> assistence from others; and <hi>sinful Men</hi> on earth were his mouth, if any at all praised GOD on his behalf, in the day he was born: but now in the day of his <hi>death,</hi> the Saint <hi>himself</hi> blesses GOD: he ascends to GOD in the chariot of praise, incircled with a bright guard of shouting <hi>Angels:</hi> He enters into <hi>Zion,</hi> the city of GOD, with songs and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting joy upon his head: All <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Scrap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Form a right judgment of both; get a fixed belief of the happy difference between them; and be often entertaining your minds with serious reflections upon the same.

                  <p>Again, <hi>LET Believers possess their souls in humble patience.</hi> The saints, when by an eye of faith they take a view of the unseen treasures and glories reserved for them in the coming world, are apt sometimes to grow too <hi>uneasy</hi> and <hi>discontented</hi> under the various trials they meet with here; and with inordinate eagerness to <hi>wish</hi> for their <hi>dismission,</hi>

                     </gap> ye have done the will of GOD, ye might receive the promise.— And verily since the promise is so great and precious, the Believer has need to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Again, <hi>LET Believers be full of praise an thanksgiving to GOD, under the blessed prospect they have before them.</hi> You have all possible rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons for gratitude and praise; whether you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the <hi>greatness</hi> of that good and happiness which expects you; or <hi>what divine love has done</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare you for and entitle you to it; or how <hi>undeser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> the favour; or what an astonishing <hi>distinction</hi> is made between you, and apostate Spirits with the common herd and unbelieving world of mankind <hi>O consider these things and praise the Lord.</hi> Bless his holy name, and say continually, Let GOD

                  <p>Again, <hi>SEE that you live a life of obedience, and walk as becomes your privileges and expectations.</hi> Are you the heirs of divine love; and do you look for such things, as a translation to heaven in the day of death, and a resurrection to glory in the day of judgment; <hi>what manner of persons</hi> ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness? See then that you endeavour to <hi>walk worthy of the Lord</hi> unto all pleasing: that you strive to answer your character, and live up in some measure to the ends and bonds of your redemption by CHRIST; being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the grace and knowledge of our Lord JESUS CHRIST: mourning over the deplorable remains of that sin and misery, which you brought into the world with you; sitting loose in your affections from all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-enjoyments; being watchful against sin; and very diligent that you may be found of your Judge in peace, without spot and blameless. In aword, as you expect to be distinguish'd from sinners in the happiness of your death; so let it be your care to be distinguished now by the holiness of your life; having your conversation in heaven, and not being conformed to this present world.

In the many instances of <hi>mortality</hi> you have seen, more especially of late, you have had this lesson very convincingly read unto you. And many of you have lately been visited with <hi>Sickness;</hi> which is the beginning and presage of a dissolution. The LORD has chasten'd you sore: but he hath not given you over to death. The sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of death compassed you, and the pains of hell gat hold upon you: you found trouble and sorrow. Then (it may be) you call'd upon the name of the LORD; and made vows to him in the anguish of your souls. And behold, the LORD hath dealt bountifully with you: you was brought low, and
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:002336_0023_0FDB2B0CB15706F8"/>
he helped you. O <hi>consider the</hi> patience <hi>of a good GOD in sparing of you:</hi> and hearken to his voice, <hi>both in your sickness and recovery;</hi> whereby he loudly calls upon you to consider your latter end and so to number your days as to apply your heart unto wisdom. <hi>O that there were such an heart in you!</hi> That you wou'd study the ends, and comply with the calls of Providence to you, both in your affliction and relief: that you may learn righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness from his judgments, and by his goodness be led to repentance: be awaken'd to confess your sins and give glory to GOD; in whose hands your breath is, and before whose eyes are all your ways.</p>
                  <p>Consider, <hi>TO prepare for death is the most impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant business of life.</hi> Time is a trifle to Eternity; Earth is nothing to Heaven. The end of your being in this world is, by serving and glorifying GOD to prepare for another. The grand concern is to finish well, to die safely, and be lodged happily in the future state. It matters little how it fares with you here, if you are well-provided for hereafter. Eternal Salvation is the one thing needful. And nothing that is gain'd in the ways of sin, will coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervail the loss of that.

2.

                  <p>THE <hi>first Day of the first Month</hi> is a famous Day in Scripture, for many memorable Actions &amp; Events. 'Twas on <hi>this</hi> Day that <hi>Noah</hi>

A <hi>good beginning</hi> of the New-Year!—And so was that in <hi>Hezekiah'</hi>s Time <note n="†" place="bottom">2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29 17</note>, when on the first Day of the first Month, he began to <hi>repair</hi> and purify the <hi>Temple,</hi> and set in order the Service thereof; having it in his heart at the same Time to covenant with the LORD GOD of Israel, that his fierce wrath might turn away from Them.</p>
                  <p>BY these and other Things, <hi>the first Day of the first Month</hi> has been <hi>signaliz'd,</hi> and hath contracted a sort of solemnity; and challenges a <hi>special Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard</hi> from Us, in the annual Reversion of it; not

indeed a <hi>superstitious Observation</hi> of it as holy Time, but an Application of it to some religious Exercises, which at this Juncture are peculiarly seasonable. And accordingly it has been the laudable <hi>Usage</hi> of many serious Christians both ancient and modern, to <hi>distinguish</hi> this Day (in the Yearly Returns of it) by agreeable Exercises of Devotion: Which pious Custom they have found to contribute exceedingly to the inflaming their Zeal, exciting their Diligence, and promoting their attainments in Religion. And this Reflection (methinks) is Argument enough to <hi>recommend</hi> the Practice, were there no <hi>Scripture</hi>-Rule to <hi>enforce</hi> it. But I doubt not, The Precept in my <hi>Text</hi> is a sufficient Warrant. For tho' the <hi>Jewish Institution</hi> of a Sin-offering on a New-Year's Day be <hi>out of Date;</hi> Yet the general <hi>Reason</hi> of the Solemnity remains in full force. Christians are still to offer <hi>spiritual Sacrifices,</hi> tho' the Legal or Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial be abrogated: and we have the <hi>same occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> as the <hi>Jews</hi> had, to solemnize the Beginning of the Year, by presenting these unto GOD. And will it not be our <hi>Reproach,</hi> to fall short of <hi>Them</hi> in Care of our Souls, and Duty to our great Master &amp; Benefactor?</p>
                  <p>BUT (to say no more here) surely it can't be amiss to begin the <hi>Year</hi> with Religion; with which every <hi>Week,</hi> yea every <hi>Day</hi> shou'd commence. GOD in the <hi>First</hi> and <hi>Best</hi> Being, and the supreme LORD of all our Time: Hence the <hi>First</hi> of every period and Season belongs to Him; and therefore the <hi>First-Fruits</hi> of the yearly Revolution should be consecrated to his Glory and Service.</p>

BY <hi>the good Hand of our God upon us,</hi> We are are now arriv'd to the Beginning of another year, according to the common Account. And as it falls out in Providence, our New-Year's Day is the L<hi>ord's Day,</hi> [is Sacrament-Day with us,] and so is filled up with religious Dutys. Thus we begin the year with GOD.—Now <hi>the LORD keep this in the Imagination of the Tho't of our Hearts,</hi> and <hi>establish our way before Him:</hi> and grant that the Services and Entertainments of the present Day may have a good Influence on the whole succeeding Year: that, if we are <hi>spared this Year also,</hi> we may on the Sabbath, which will <hi>close</hi> the year, still feel the happy Impressions of this Sabbath, and have them abundantly increased.</p>
                  <p>THERE are special <hi>Meditations,</hi> religious <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,</hi> and <hi>Actions,</hi> which are eminently sutable to <hi>preface</hi> &amp; introduce the year withall. Wherefore I thought, to put you in Mind of These, and exhort you to them, would be a <hi>word in season.</hi> And the LORD grant it may be not only seasonable, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so <hi>profitable</hi> both to You and to Me, being <hi>mixed with Faith!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>MY Business now then is to direct you in, and excite you to, a good Improvement of a New-year's Day.</p>
                  <p>THE Method I shall go in is this; (1) I shall mention &amp; recommend some things respecting the year <hi>past.</hi> (2) Others that respect the year <hi>begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi>

                  <p>SOME think, this first Month has it's Name from <hi>

<pb n="54" facs="unknown:002336_0030_0FDB2B1D1DC5BFF8"/>
But 'tis most commonly thought, it derives from <hi>Janus</hi> (a famous Person in heathen Story, supposed to be the same with <hi>Noah</hi> in sacred Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) who was wont to be painted with <hi>two Faces,</hi> which at once saw things past and future.—And agreeably <hi>this Month</hi> (that wears his name) has like him a <hi>two-fold Aspect,</hi> it points backward as well as forward. Accordingly the customary <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription</hi> of the Year at present is <hi>Double;</hi> both the Year passing, and that advancing come into the usual Date of things. This may give us occasion, not improperly to take <hi>both Years</hi> under our conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Wherefore as propos'd before,</p>

                  <p>THUS to <hi>begin the Year with GOD,</hi> is the most hopeful way to render it a <hi>good</hi> and <hi>holy,</hi> a <hi>prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous</hi> and <hi>comfortable</hi> Year. This is a way to <hi>engage</hi> our selves to <hi>spend the Year with GOD,</hi> in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and for his Glory. It is a proper and very effectual means to keep up a lively Zeal for GOD, to keep us close to Duty, to make us wise in the Improvement of our Time, and quicken us to an unwearied activity in doing the Work of the Year. Moreover, This is a way to <hi>engage the special Presence of GOD</hi> to be with us through the Year; which is the Source of all true Prosperity, and which we have absolute need of, to direct and protect us in all our Ways, to assist and succeed us in all our Undertakings, to supply our Wants, and sweeten out Enjoyments, to support us under Afflictions, and make every Event (whether prosperous or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse) to work together for our real (that is spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual) Good. These Benefits are the desirable Fruits of the Divine Presence; and what, a <hi>good beginning of the Year</hi> has a happy Tendency to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure unto us.</p>

BUT furthermore, Another special <hi>Design</hi> of this sacred appointment was to stir them up to a <hi>thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> acknowleging of the Divine <hi>Goodness,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the <hi>Year</hi> (which now they were come to the Period of) had been encompass'd <note n="†" place="bottom">

It was insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, as a solemn <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> unto GOD for the Harvest and Vintage newly gather'd in; to put them in mind, that the Mercies they had receiv'd were all from the Divine Providence: and that unto this they must look, for the like supplies in the Year ensuing.</p>
                  <p>HENCE infer; We shou'd sometimes seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously look back upon &amp; consider the <hi>Hardships</hi> and Difficulties our <hi>Fore-fathers</hi> met with, in their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to and settling in this Land: we shou'd call to mind their mean Circumstances and desolate Condition; and be very humble in our own eyes, when we remember our low Beginnings.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>AGAIN, I might observe to you,</hi> That the great <hi>Goodness</hi> of GOD to our <hi>Fore-fathers</hi> in bringing them safe to this Land, planting them in it, protecting and prospering of them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> should sometimes be thankfully commemorated by us their Posterity.

                  <p>BUT the Observation that I shall here most insists on, is this, That <hi>as every Year</hi> ends, <hi>We shou'd do something like observing the Feast of</hi> Tabernacles <hi>or</hi> In-gathering. <hi>Gospel-Duty</hi> was of old prophesy'd

                  <p>THUS we see in part what were the Laws of this Feast of Tabernacles or In-gathering, and in some measure the Meaning of them. Now since <hi>Gospel-Duty</hi> is represented, in the fore-mention'd Prophecy of New Testament Times, under the notion of <hi>keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Feast of Tabernacles,</hi> this intimates <hi>what</hi> GOD <hi>expects from Christians,</hi> even that all those <hi>Graces</hi> be brought into Exercise and exhibited in their Lives, which were especially acted and signify'd in this Feast of old. Likewise, since this Feast was observ'd among the <hi>Jews</hi> in the <hi>End</hi> of the Year (according to the civil Calculation of their Year) and since it was prophesy'd, that <hi>Christians</hi> under the Gospel shou'd keep this Feast <hi>from Year to Year,</hi> at the times appointed for this Solemnity; it seems but an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment of that Prediction, if at every Year's End we take Occasion to do something like obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Feast of Booths or In-gathering. Indeed the whole <hi>Life</hi> of Christians shou'd be a perpetual keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Feast of Tabernacles, in a spiritual and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical Sense. <hi>Every day</hi> we shou'd be worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as in that Feast; Going to CHRIST, the true &amp; living <hi>Temple,</hi> with our spiritual <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, Prayer, Thanksgiving, Charity, and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; Going <hi>up</hi> to CHRIST by lively acts of Faith; Going <hi>forth</hi> to JESUS <hi>without the Camp</hi>

Thus the Gospel teaches Christians to live <hi>continually;</hi> and such a Life wou'd be a perpetual keeping the Feast of Tabernacles.

and pleasing to GOD.

Our Saviour therefore gave 'em this Word (the best the cou'd be) to carry home with them. It was affecting to him, to think, that all that Assembly were soon to divide &amp; scatter; that He himself was never more to see their Faces on this occasion (having now begun his dying Year) our indeed ever like to have an Opportunity again of speaking to so great a Body of People together, at least under such Advantages.

                  <p>HENCE our Savior <hi>takes his leave</hi> of the People, in the most proper manner, with this solemn Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in our Text.

Some that heard him before, <hi>did not bred his Words:</hi> He now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>renews</hi> the Gospel-Call unto them. Others perhaps had taken <hi>some notice</hi> of his Preaching and were <hi>almost perswaded</hi> to receive the Gospel: Now to <hi>confirm</hi> the Impressions made on such &amp; to finish the good Work begun in their Souls, He <hi>again</hi> preaches to them; inviting those who had the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of a holy Thirst after GOD, to come unto HIM, and drink.</p>
                  <p>BUT finally, <hi>This might be occasion'd by certain</hi>

Or have they been stinted to certain Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures; and limited, only so far as may consist with such &amp; such Ends &amp; Designs?</p>
                  <p>FURTHERMORE, (and I shall add only this one word, which perhaps might more properly have been placed before) <hi>Have your Desires been Active and Industrious?</hi> Has your Thirst put you upon diligent <hi>Endeavours</hi> to obtain the desired Blessings? Or, have you contented yourself with <hi>idle Wishes,</hi> (such as the Desires of the Generality are) mere, lazy, fruitless Wouldings? Many Sinners seem wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully affected now and then under some awakening Word, or rousing Providence; and perhaps express their Desires in very pathetical Terms: but they don't proceed to sutable Efforts &amp; Endeavours; they take no Pains, to obtain that which they pretend so vehemently to long after.

Soul (as one observes) is in the Original the <hi>running</hi> Soul, the Soul that runs up and down (in quest of some desired good) from one Means to another; leaving none unattempted". Thus we shou'd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press our longing after CHRIST, and his Benefits. We must make due Improvement of all proper Means &amp; follow him in every Way of his Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. We must go to the Wells of Salvation, to the Brooks of Water; and lay our Mouths to every Conduit-Pipe. If one Means will not do, then we shou'd try another; if the more ordinary fail, then apply extraordinary: and never satisfy our selves in any Duty or Ordinance, unless we meet with CHRIST (the desire of our Souls) therein, and of the Fulness that is in him, receive some pretious Gifts.—Now let it be inquir'd: Had it been thus with you, in the general Course of your Life past and particularly this last Year? Have you been going to CHRIST, weary and thirsty, in the way of his holy Institutions; diligently improving the Means of Grace, and religiously attending all Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Ordinances, with the whole Bent of your infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Powers?</p>

                  <p>HOSEA (as Criticks observe) us'd a Style ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry close &amp; sententions, peculiar to himself; and in some places it seems to be like <hi>Solomon's</hi> Proverbs.</p>
                  <p>ISAIAH used a Style more copious &amp; flowing, but incomparably curious &amp; polite, full of majesty, and full of oratory; sometimes sublime &amp; towering always elegant and lively. But</p>
                  <p>JEREMIAH was less of an Orator: his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of speaking was more familiar, plain, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polish'd. However, there appears a great deal of holy <hi>flame</hi> &amp; server in his Preaching. He was a very painfull, faithfull, zealous Prophet. In the nineteen first chapters of his Book of Prophecies, we have some of his <hi>Sermons;</hi> (I suppose, in abstract; perhaps <hi>Baruck's</hi> Roll might have many of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largements) and here we find a Variety of the most pathetical Exhortations, with the most mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Admonitions, Reproofs and Warnings. But all very little regarded by the Men of that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, to whom he preach'd. It was a great favour
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:002336_0068_0FDB2B8151704F48"/>
to the People, that this excellent Minister so long continu'd laboring in the word, and zealously af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting them. And yet it seems he had but little success in his Ministry; which is the melancholy Lot of many of the best Preachers in all times of the World. They had him a great while among them, but to very little purpose. They des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis'd his youth, and regarded not his age. They gave him very base, harsh, and ungrateful Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He seems to have met with more ill Usage and Persecution, than any of his brethren the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. He calls himself <hi>a man of Contention to the whole Earth;</hi> and complains of his people, saying, <hi>Every one doth curse me,</hi> thô I have done no man any wrong. Neither the innocence of the Dove, nor the Wisdom of the Serpent, cou'd secure him from unjust Calumny, Malice, and Ill will. As became a faithful Prophet, he set himself to bear Witness a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst, and to reform, the Corruptions of the Times: but was always oppos'd, and malign'd by his thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less and ungenerous Country-men. They despis'd his preaching, sought to ruin his Reputation, and even to take away his Life. This in many places be pathetically complains of; and particularly in our Context, which I shall read to you, and make some brief Remarks upon. Verse 18 &amp; 19. <hi>Then said they, Come, and let us devise devices against Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah: for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet: come and let us smite him with the tongue, and let us not give beed to any of his words. Give heed to me, O LORD, and bearken to the voice of them that contend with me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="131" facs="unknown:002336_0068_0FDB2B8151704F48"/>
Now if we reflect, we shall find, that the <hi>Occasion</hi> of the People displeasure at the Prophet was his <hi>plain dealing</hi> with them, his faithfull reproving their Sins, and warning them of approaching Judgments. The occasion is hinted in the introductory word, T<hi>HEN said they,</hi> &amp;c. Which affords us this Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; That <hi>it is sometimes the Humour of a vain World, to be enrag'd at the Ministers of GOD, for their Fidelity and holy Zeal:</hi> because they don't prophesy smooth things, and flatter Sinners in their Carnality and Hypocrisy? but with plainness of speech tell them their whole Duty, sharply rebuke their Sins, &amp; set the awfull Threatnings of GOD before them; This kindles their Anger.—But what an <hi>unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable</hi> humour is this, and how very <hi>wicked?</hi> 'Tis as if the Patient shou'd fly in his Physician's face: and as if one shou'd rudely spurn at a Messenger from his Royal Master.</p>
                  <p>AGAIN, if we consider <hi>Who the Persons were,</hi> that thus malign'd the Prophet, namely <hi>Professors of Religion;</hi> we may very naturally observe, That <hi>Formalists</hi> in Religion, when their <hi>Lusts</hi> are <hi>touch'd and grated upon</hi> in the faithful preaching of the Word, do usually turn the vilest <hi>Haters</hi> of GOD's <hi>Servants,</hi> and shew the most implacable Enmity to them: and this many times under the cloke of sanctimonious <hi>Zeal</hi> and with a carnal dependence on their <hi>Temple-Privileges:</hi> For thus they insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. <hi>The Law shall not perish from the priest, nor Counsel from the Wise, nor the Word from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet; Come, let us smite him, &amp;c.</hi> As if they shou'd have said, He is a <hi>false</hi> Prophet, and contradicts our Teachers, (who have the promise of GOD's perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual

                  <p>AGAIN, We might observe, That when any are <hi>enrag'd</hi> at the Servants of GOD, it is too common for them to <hi>propagate</hi> their undue Prejudices among their Companions.—Then <hi>said</hi> they, come <hi>let us &amp;c.</hi>—They call'd on &amp; stir'd up one another.

BUT the only DOCTRINE, I design to insist upon is this—</p>
                  <q>WHEN a professing People have by their Sins provoked GOD to Anger, it is a Duty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent on the Saints &amp; Servants of GOD among them, to use all proper means to turn away the Divine Wrath, and obtain a Recovery of the Divine Favour towards them.</q>
                  <p>IT is the <hi>work &amp; office</hi> of GOD's Ministers not only to warn the <hi>Wicked</hi> and reprove the Unruly: but likewise to admonish the <hi>Godly,</hi> to teach them in the things of GOD, and put them in mind to be ready to every good Work, <hi>Tit.</hi>3. 1.—My business now is, in the name of CHRIST, and by his help, to exhort the Children and Servants of GOD to a Duty, very seasonable at this time, though too much neglected; I mean the endeavouring to reconcile a provoked GOD to a sinning People, &amp; using pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per methods to put a stop to the course of his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that we may not be consumed utterly.</p>
                  <p>IN the Doctrin are several Propositions ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd, or imply'd. As,</p>
                  <p>PROP. I <hi>GOD is</hi> angry <hi>with his own professing People, when they sin against Him.</hi> Sin exposes them, as well as others to the wrath and destructive ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of the Almighty. An External Profession and Covenant-Privileges are no sure Defense of a People; no Screen from wasting Judgments, if they sin against the holy One of Israel. GOD sees Sin in his own People, as well as others: and the Provocation in them is not at all the less; nay, 'tis vastly greater,
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:002336_0073_0FDB2B8F29F10F80"/>
being aggravated by the Advantages they enjoy a boy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> others.—That GOD is angry at Sin in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing People, might be evidenced from Divine De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations, Threatnings and Warnings; and from many sorrowfull Examples of Vengeance, &amp;c.—National Sins bring national Judgments every where. But if <hi>Israel,</hi> (the holy Nation) sin, they shall be punish'd <hi>seven times more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>PROP. II. <hi>WHEN GOD's wrath is kindled against a provoking People, He is yet</hi> reconcilable to them; ready to forgive, and to turn from the fierceness of his holy anger; easy to be intreated, and willing to reverse the sentence of wrath, upon the easiest and most condescending Terms. Hence when he is, angry at a People, he often spares them a while, &amp; only threatens and warns them, and uses means to prevent their Ruin. And when he comes to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, he ordinarily begins with fewer and lesser Judgments, proceedings gradually, from gentler strokes to severer scourges <note n="*" place="bottom">

PROP. V. <hi>WHEN GOD has a Controversy with his People, it is the Duty of all his Saints and Servants among them,</hi> to do what they can to <hi>turn away his wrath from them, and obtain a blessed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation.</hi> In all approved methods they must do what in them lies, to recover the Divine Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and secure the Divine Presence with such a People, which is all their Safety, Glory and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness. They shou'd <hi>thrust into the Gap,</hi> and stand between an offended GOD, and a provoking Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; doing their utmost by <hi>interceding</hi> with Him to stop the Current of his Judgments. And then likewise they should endeavor to <hi>repair the Breach,</hi> that Sin has made; and remove the provoking Cause of Divine Wrath, by using most diligently all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per means to effect a true and thorough <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> among a backsliding People. Thus there is Work, first respecting <hi>GOD,</hi> and secondly, respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Men;</hi> which they are called to attend.</p>

Indeed some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we find this Man of GOD passionately beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Divine Appearances for him against his <hi>more malignant</hi> Persecutors, &amp; <hi>prophetically</hi> imprecating Judgments upon them; but as to the People in <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> he was a hearty &amp; constant Intercessor for their peace &amp; welfare; &amp; herein has set a worthy <hi>Example,</hi> to Posterity, which challenges universal Imitation.—Now to <hi>excite</hi> the Servants of GOD hereunto, I shall here briefly represent to them some of those <hi>Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> which the Saints are under to make <hi>interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for a professing</hi> People, among whom they dwell, to turn away the Divine Wrath from them.</p>

a Prayer, it renders them <hi>greatly belov'd,</hi> and very acceptable to him.—Which consideration affords a very strong argument to enforce the duty upon them: since they are bidden to <hi>chuse the things that please GOD,</hi> and to walk worthy of the LORD, unto all pleasing.</p>

                  <p>IN praying for <hi>Israel,</hi> the Saints shew their <hi>Love</hi> to the House and Cause of GOD; and their <hi>Desire toward the Remembrance of his Name.—</hi> Besides, by their prayers to GOD, they make an open <hi>Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment</hi> of their dependence on him for needfull salvations, and their belief of his ability &amp; willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to save his People, &amp;c.

                  </p>
                  <p>THESE Instances may suffice to show, that the <hi>Saints</hi> have a <hi>strong Interest</hi> in the Court of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and by their Prayers do often prevale to keep off, moderate, or remove Judgments from a People; and sometimes obtain a Reprieve even for places ripe for Ruin and devoted to Confusion. Indeed
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:002336_0079_0FDB2B980E95BFD8"/>
in some extraordinary cases, the LORD declares, as in Jer. 15. 1. <hi>Tho'</hi> Moses and Samuel <hi>stood before me. yet my mind could not be towards this people.</hi> And as in Ezek.14. 14. <hi>Tho' these three men, Noah</hi> Daniel and Job <hi>were in the land, they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness, saith the Lord God:</hi>—Yet these words plainly carry this <hi>Intimation,</hi> that such men have <hi>Power with GOD,</hi> and that he will <hi>ordinarily</hi> forgive much, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear long, <hi>for their sakes.</hi> Hence when the LORD is unalterably resolv'd to bring speedy Destruction on a People, <hi>he bids his Servants not to pray for</hi> 'em any more; because he wou'd not be put to the pam of denying their ardent requests. See Jer. 7. 16.</p>
                  <p>Now since the Godly have such an <hi>Interest</hi> at the Throne of Grace; and since GOD <hi>expects</hi> their Intercessions; and the <hi>Public</hi> has a just <hi>Title</hi> to the benefit of them; it hence evidently follows, they <hi>ought</hi> to give themselves unto prayer &amp; supplication.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>IN so doing, they will consult their own</hi> Peace and Welfare. <hi>They shall not seek God's face in vain.</hi> If he grant the Petitions that they ask, they will have their share in the public Tranquillity and Prosperity: The prospect whereof shou'd encourage 'em to Prayer. Jer. 29. 7. <hi>Seek the peace of the city,—and pray unto the Lord for it; for in the peace there of shall ye have peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>BUT however, their Prayers shall return into their own bosoms, and shall not return empty. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily; it shall go <hi>well</hi> with praying Saints, thô it go if with a sinning People, Such are sometimes <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampled</hi> from common Calamities. GOD orders the destroying <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> not to touch them. They are

                     <hi>mark'd for favor</hi> and protection. (Ezek.9. 4, 6.) And this prospect shou'd encourage them to pray. Zeph. 2. 3. <hi>Seek ye the Lord, all ye meek of the earth: it may be ye shall be bid in the day of the Lord's an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</hi>—Howbeit, their prayers shall be accepted of GOD, and abound to their good Account in the day of the LORD. They are all hung upon the file; and shall be remember'd, and recompensed in that day when a Cup of cold Water given to a Disciple, shall not be forgotten, nor lose it's Reward. There is a blessed Promise in Psal. 122. 6. <hi>Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: They</hi> shall prosper <hi>that love thee:</hi> Which as it intimates, that they are <hi>not Zion's Friends,</hi> who do not pray for her welfare; so it as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures a <hi>Reward</hi> to them that are her praying Friends.</p>
                  <p>HENCE from a principle of Self-Love, the Saints are strongly oblig'd to the Duty under considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Their own Interest is a Bond upon them, and bespeaks their diligent attendence to the Work.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>THE Saints are many times oblig'd to pray for their People, when a day of GOD's anger is passing over them,</hi> because their own sins have conspir'd <hi>to pull down Judgments upon them.</hi> The Sins of GOD's own Children, which in times of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation they fall into, are peculiarly offensive to the pure Eyes of his glorious Holiness &amp; Justice; and are instrumental, as well as the Sins of open and daring Transgressors, to kindle a fire in Zion, and call down Vengeance of a Place. The most zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Magistrates the most faithfull Ministers, and even the best of GOD's people, can seldom acquit themselves from contributing to the publick guilt and misery, by their own personal sins, or by their
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:002336_0080_0FDB2B9E27E60CE0"/>
being someways accessory to the sins of others. Sometimes a <hi>Jonah,</hi> the LORD'S <hi>Prophet,</hi> the best man in the Ship, may more immediately occasion the Storm. Sometimes a good old <hi>Eli,</hi> the High-Priest of Israel, may by a criminal want of Zele, and a foolish Connivence at ways of wickedness, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke GOD to make a Breach upon his house, and a dreadful Gap in the Walls of Jerusalem, Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a <hi>David,</hi> King in Israel, and a man after GOD's own heart, may by great transgressions provoke GOD to send a wasting Pestilence on his People, or lay them open to the devouring Sword. Sometimes a <hi>Solomon,</hi> the wisest man, may by his foolish ways provoke GOD to stir up Adversaries against Israel, and make a breach among the Tribes of his People. Sometimes an holy <hi>Hezekiah</hi> may, by the Pride of his heart, &amp; a criminal Ingratitude to GOD (as well as a wicked <hi>Manasseh</hi> by his Murders &amp; other horrid sins) have a peculiar hand in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wrath upon Judah and Jerusalem.—Thus the most eminent and faithful Servants of GOD may sometimes by their own Provocations help to lay open the Sluices of divine Vengeance, and make a Gap to let In Wrath upon a backsliding People. And it is very rare, that any of the Saints can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt themselves altogether from this Imputation.</p>
                  <p>Now surely it must needs be very <hi>congruous,</hi> &amp; most agreeable to the Rules of <hi>Equity</hi> and <hi>Propriety,</hi> that GOD's Children and Servants deeply <hi>sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathize</hi> with a People under Afflictive visitations, which <hi>they themselves</hi> have been in a greater or less degree <hi>Instruments</hi> of procuring to them; and to deprecate those Judgments, which their own Sins <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

                  <p n="7">7. <hi>THE Saints shou'd be led to this duty, by the</hi> Example <hi>of GOD's Servants in all Ages.</hi> They have the practice of the Saints in all times of the World to confirm them herein.

                  <p>BUT then if you wou'd be heard in your Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, you must <hi>take heed how you pray.</hi> Let me hint a few things here, by way of Direction.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) YOU <hi>must pray,</hi> confessing <hi>the Publick Guilt: in the first place humbling your Souls before GOD for your own Sins, and then for the Sins of others.</hi> Herein you have holy <hi>Daniel</hi> for an Example, <hi>Dan.</hi>9. 20.

His <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session</hi> you may read, in the foregoing Context.—You have also the Example of pious <hi>Ezra:</hi> See the 9th Chapter of his Book. You have likewise the Example of godly <hi>Nehemiah;</hi> who when he pray'd day &amp; night, for the Children of Israel, did also <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess the Sins of the Children of Israel; his own Sins, &amp; the Sins of his Father's House:</hi> the Sins of their <hi>Kings. &amp; Princes, &amp; Priests, &amp; Prophets, &amp; Fathers, &amp; all the People.</hi> See the <hi>first &amp; ninth</hi> Chapters of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah's</hi> Book. And the whole Book of <hi>Jeremiah's</hi> Prophecy, as well as that of his Lamentations, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds with <hi>Humiliations,</hi> and with <hi>Consessions</hi> of the sins of GOD's People.—It has been the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per &amp; Practice of the Saints in <hi>all</hi> Ages to mourn the Public Guilt, when asking for Publick Mercies; to confess the Sins of the Times &amp; Places in which they liv'd; the Sins of all Orders and Degrees of Persons; the Sins of Magistrates, Ministers and People. It is the Character of the Godly, that they <hi>sigh and cry for all the Abominations, that are done

Even thus must you (Our praying Saints) humble your Souls before GOD, for the Sins that are found among us; and in the name of our Rulers, and Priests, and People of all degrees, make penitent Confessions to the LORD, if you expect to be heard in your Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations for the Restoring of his Favor and Pity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Land.</p>
                  <p>Again,</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) <hi>YOU must pray justifying of GOD.</hi> You must make such humble Acknowlegements, as those, to the Glory of GOD:—<hi>The Lord is righteous;</hi> for we have rebelled against his Commandment. It is of the LORD's <hi>Mercies</hi> that we are not <hi>consumed,</hi> because his Compassions fail not <note n="‖" place="bottom">

                        <hi>Ezra</hi> 9 13, 15.</note>—Let not all our Trouble seem little: Howbeit, thou art <hi>just</hi> in all that is brought upon us; for <hi>thou</hi> hast done <hi>right,</hi> but we have done <hi>wickedly</hi>

You must, in their Name, take to your selves the Shame and Blame of their Destruction; ascribing Righteousness to your Maker, and sanctifying the HOLY ONE of Israel.</p>

You must leave it to Him to bestow what Good he pleases; by what Means, &amp; in what Season, he shall see fit. You must wait patiently for the LORD, without Discontent or Despondency under delays of favourable Appearances, As he Isa.8. 17. <hi>I will wait upon the LORD, who hideth his face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for him.</hi> It is said of him that <hi>believeth</hi> that he <hi>maketh not baste</hi>

may obtain, for an unreformed Place, some little <hi>Respite,</hi> or Reprieve for a while from Destruction. But unless there by a <hi>Public Repentance</hi> and tho'ro' Reformation among a sinfull People, they can't ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the Recovery of Divine Favour. The Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the Land must themselves learn Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness from Divine Threatnings and Judgments; else the LORD will not visit them with his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not be appeased to them.—Hence the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of GOD must use their endeavors to <hi>find out</hi> and <hi>reform</hi> those Sins and Sinners that provoke GOD to anger, if they wou'd prevent or remove the Effects of his fiery Indignation. It is remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, when <hi>Achan</hi> had committed a <hi>Trespass</hi> in the accursed thing, and wrath fell on all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of Israel for it, that <hi>Joshua</hi> and the Elders, betaking themselves to Fasting and Prayer, without sutable Care to find out and punish the Sin they probably suspected, met with that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke from GOD, (Josh. 7. 10, &amp;c.) <hi>The Lord said to Joshua, Get thee up; wherefore liest thou upon thy face? Israel hath sinned; I will not be with you any more, except ye destroy the accursed Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son from amongst you. Up sanctify the People,</hi> &amp;c. This shou'd awaken the Saints to add unto their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Prayers the most active &amp; vigorous Endeavours, in their several Stations, and according to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective Capacities, to effect a blessed Reformation among us; and oppose the growth of Vice and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiousness, which is too much become the genius and Complexion of the unhappy Times we live in, to the great dishonour of GOD, the reproch of our christian Profession. the injury of our common

Welfare, and the danger of our being laid waste by yet heavier Calamities, unless a speedy and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Repentance</hi> Prevent. To promote <hi>this is</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Duty of all, and will be the Endeavour of such as have a just Regard to the public Good.</p>
                  <p>BELIEVE it; without a tho'ro' Reformation there will be no Remission of the crying Sins of our Land; and unactive Wishes are not sufficient to obtain the desired Reformation. Indeed we must acknowlege and affirm constantly, that it <hi>belongs to</hi> GOD alone (as the efficient Cause) to revive dying Religion among his People. Means and Instruments can't by any Virtue or Efficacy of their own, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce this great and noble Effect; but need a Divine Hand to actuate and Succeed them. It is only the Ministration of the Spirit, that can turn away Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godliness from Jacob, and cause Righteousness to run down Jerusalem's Streets, as a River. And GOD expects to be <hi>inquired of,</hi> to be <hi>sought to</hi> by Prayer, till he come and bestow this comprehensive Blessing upon us. Nevertheless, he expects also, that his praying Saints use their utmost <hi>Endeavours</hi> in the Application of all those Means, that have a Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to the Revival of GOD's Work among us. You must study the best Methods or Expedients for this End, &amp; every one in his place, according to his Talent, put them in Execution. You must search out the impediments or Obstructions that are in the way; &amp; seek the speedy Removal of them. You must <hi>stand up for God against the Workers of iniquity,</hi> and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to <hi>teach Transgressors his Ways.</hi>—Prayers and Tears are not all the Weapons, to be used in the defense of GOD's Cause among a declining Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:002336_0088_0FDB2BAF5426FF20"/>
those are not the only Instruments, which the work of Reformation calls for. Unactive Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations are like be as successless and insignificant, as prayerless Endeavours. You must not sit still, and idly neglect the due Use of Means, looking that GOD shou'd do the whole Work alone. You must not fit down <hi>astonied,</hi> (as <hi>Ezra</hi> in a like case) sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing all Attempts desperate, and in vain. No; but GOD expects, that you be <hi>up &amp; doing;</hi> that in the strength of the LORD JESUS CHRIST you go forth to labor, and employ all your Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with Zele &amp; Vigor, in setting forward and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on a Work of so great Importance to the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of GOD, to the Publick Safety and Prosperity, as well as to your own Comfort &amp; Security. <hi>Suffer ye</hi> then <hi>the word of Exhortation;</hi> and let every one apply himself to the diligent performance of the Duty incumbent on him in his place.</p>
                  <p>I know, indeed the Discouragements, that lie in the way, seem not a few, nor very small.

Let us pursue that solemn Charge, (Jer. 15. 19.) <hi>Let them return unto thee, but return not thou unto them.</hi> Let us gird up our Loyns, and put on the whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of GOD; not be slothfull in business, but fervent in Spirit, serving the LORD; warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bold and resolute and strong in the LORD, thô also humble and meek and wise: <hi>of some having Compassion, and pulling others out of the Fire.</hi> If any go on still in their Trespasses, and hate to be reformed: spurn at all the endearing methods of Persuasion, yea laugh at the shaking of the Spear, and account our most awfull spiritual Weapons but as Stubble; yet let them <hi>know that the Irophers of God have been among them.</hi> Let us not shun to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare</hi> unto them <hi>all the Counsil of God;</hi> being instant in season, and out of season; Exhorting and rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with all Authority; and ceasing not to warn every one night &amp; day with tears, if by any means we may <hi>save some;</hi> at least deliver our own <hi>souls,</hi>

and keep them pure from the blood all men,—Now to quicken ourselves to such Fidelity &amp;Diligence, let us labour to get our Hearts inspired with a greater Hatred of Sin; with a more tender Pity towards the Souls of Sinners; with a more generous Ardour for the public Good; with a more confirmed Hope in the Mercy of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, and a more inflamed Zele for the Glory of GOD.—I shall only add under this head; I wou'd not be mistaken, as to what I have said here with respect to those in the Ministry: it is not design'd to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct, excite or reprove my reverend Fathers and Brethren, so much as to admonish and quicken my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; and to let the People know what is the Duty of Ministers: that seeing what Obligations lie upon us to be faithfull &amp; open-hearted in our dealing with them, in this dark and degenerate day, they may not so angrily resent the performance of our Duty, as they are apt to do.</p>
                  <p>BUT now I proceed to offer a word or two to Christians who move in a <hi>less public Sphere,</hi> Thus I might call upon the <hi>Teachers of our Schools,</hi> the Tutors of our Children &amp; Youth, to use their utmost Endeavors for the propagating of Religion among the rising Generation. You have peculiar Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages in your hands for this End; which GOD and the Public justly expect you improve with the greatest Care &amp; Diligence. You shou'd use your Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in reforming the Manners of vitious Youths &amp; Children. You shou'd use your Knowlege &amp; Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in giving them seasonable Instructions about their Spiritual Concerns and opening to them sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Doctrines, in the most familiar manner. You
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:002336_0095_0FDB2BBF0D8F2930"/>
shou'd use your utmost Wisdom and Care to affect their Consciences with Divine Truths, and bring them to reverence all serious Dictates, from within; to study and conform to the practical Lessons of the Gospel; to love and practise secret Prayer, Reading GOD's Word daily, &amp;c. You shou'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the State of their Souls, and watch over their Ways: frown on the first appearances of Evil and check the beginnings of Sin; but cherish and encourage every hopefull Symptom. You shou'd labour to mortify betimes their youthfull Lusts; to restrain their exorbitant Passions, &amp; rectify all irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Affections; <q>to subdue every <hi>proud,</hi> ambitious and haughty Spirit at it's first appearance; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce every <hi>peevish</hi> and discontented Humour, to correct every <hi>selfish</hi> niggardly Temper; to civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize &amp; reform every <hi>ungenerous</hi> ungratefull Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position; and to kill all the seeds of Vice:</q> On the Contrary endeavor to implant good and sober Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in their young minds; to bring them into the Liking and Practice of all Theological &amp; Moral Virtues; and form their Souls to worthy ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Designs, and excellent Tempers; that they may be "usefull Citizens of this World, and hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Candidates for heaven". In thus doing, you'll show a just Concern for the Good of both the present and succeeding Generations; and such a public Spirit, well becomes your public Capacity.</p>
                  <p>FURTHER, I might direct the Exhortation to <hi>Heads of Families,</hi> and call upon them to walk within their Houses (like <hi>David)</hi> with a perfect heart, and like <hi>Abraham</hi> to command their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Houshold to serve the LORD. Families
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:002336_0096_0FDB2BC702D0C3A0"/>
are the first <hi>Source</hi> and <hi>Seminary</hi> of the Church &amp; Common-Wealth: and upon the well-ordering of them does not a little depend the Flourishing and Prosperity of both. The Neglect of Domestic Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Houshold-Piety is the Rise and Spring of innumerable Mischiefs to a People; and speaks all Religion to be in a decaying expiring posture among them. This is the great Wound &amp; Disease of this Place &amp; People, that <hi>Family Worship</hi> and Discipline is shamefully <hi>cast off</hi> by multitudes, and so <hi>remisly</hi> attended by the Generality; that there are so many Tabernacles of Iniquity, so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Houses of the Wicked among us, wherein GOD is not served; and that among the Godly themselves, there is such a lamentable Decay of Family-Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in all the parts of it. Family-<hi>Prayer</hi> is too much degenerated into a Formality. Family-<hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction</hi> is not duely upheld: and Family-<hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> seems to be almost lost and perisht out of the Earth. Children do not honour their Parents, and Servants do not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

They don't bring up their Children in the <hi>Admonition</hi> of the LORD, nor <hi>command</hi> their Household to keep his ways; but a criminal Indulgence reigns &amp; prevales.—Now these Family-Disorders are very provoking to GOD, the GOD of all the Families of the Earth, who looks down from his holy Habitation, into the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations of Men, and beholds all that is amiss in our Houses, <hi>For these things</hi> among others, Divine Justice has lately been visiting us with <hi>corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Dispensations. GOD has been distributing Sorrows in his Anger, and smiting our Houses with the Rod. How many are there among us that may take up the Lamentation, and say, <hi>I am the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of his Wrath: my Virgins end my young men are fallen: the Children and the sucklings thou hast slain them in the day of thine An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Thou hast called at in solemn day my Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors round about, and best compassed me with Gall, and Travel: thou hast covered me with ashes, and made my Chain heavy. Thou hast pulled me in pieces, and, made me Desolate—</hi> How great have our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily-<hi>Distresses</hi> been of late, by reason of the Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Sickness spreading so swiftly thro' the Town, and so fatally? The Slain of the LORD have been many: GOD hath been breaking our Families with great Breaches, with very grievous Blows. And has he not been herein <hi>pouring our Wickedness</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us? Have not our Family-<hi>Sins</hi> drawn down these Effects of his holy Vengeance on our guilty Heads? Shou'd we not <hi>hearken to the voice of his Rod,</hi> which loudly calls upon us to put away all Iniquity far from our Tabernacles? And since he has been mixing so much Mercy with his Judgments however severe, shou'd we not by his Goodness be <hi> led to Repentance?</hi> After all that is come upon us for our evil Deeds, if we go on to break his Commandments, may we not justly fear, that GOD in his holy Providence will renew the Tokens of his Displeasure? If young People, like the Sons of good old <hi>Eli,</hi> make themselves vile, and their Parents, like him, restrain them not; what can they expect but to be punished <hi>like him,</hi>
                     <pb n="188" facs="unknown:002336_0097_0FDB2BC991130860"/>
and to have their <hi>Houses</hi> visited with still heavier Judgments? Wherefore, if you wou'd not drink yet deeper of the Cup of Divine Fury, &amp; when you are come out of one Fire, go into another which shall devour you, be <hi>

Let this <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily-Reformation</hi> be vigorously and generally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd in; and it will open to us the fairest Prospects of a public Reformation. For the most zelous Attempts of <hi>Magistrates, Ministers, Tutors,</hi> &amp;c. towards the Reformation of Manners, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly among the rising Generation, will be but of little Significancy, without the concurrent Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors of <hi>Heads</hi> of Families. The work must begin and take it's Rise <hi>here.</hi> Salt must be first cast into these little Springs; else the waters in general are not like to be healed. Let every Parent and Master then take up <hi>Joshua's</hi> pious Resolution, (Josh. 24. 15.) <hi>As for me, and my house, we will serve the Lord</hi>—And that of <hi>David</hi> (Psal. 101. 2, &amp;c.) <hi>I will walk within my house with a perfect heart. I will set no wicked thing before mine Eyes. I will not know a wicked Person. Whoso privily standreth his neighbor, him will I cut off</hi> from my Family and Employ. <hi>He that worketh Deceit, shall not dwell within my house,</hi> &amp;c. Let every one resolve upon and set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Reforming his own House, keep up a strict Discipline there, and diligently use the Influence and Authority he has over his Children &amp; Servants, to engage them in a real Love and Obedience to the Law of the LORD. This is the way to form and fit them to be Blessing to the Public, in their

day and generation; this is an excellent Medium to revive and propagate Religion in the Land; and consequently to regain the lost Presence and Favour of GOD, and secure the same to rising Posterity: which (methinks) shou'd be every one's solicitous Care and Ambition.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>NOW in the last place,</hi> I come to speak unto Christians <hi>at Large,</hi> to all Professors of Religion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd in a <hi>private Capacity.</hi> Every one of the meanest Rank and lowest Circumstances in the World, had some Occasions and Opportunities to promote and strengthen the Interests of Religion; and in his place shou'd lend a helping Hand, for this Purpose, Christians in private (as well as those in public) Stations, are indispensably oblig'd, for the honor of GOD and the general Good, each of them in their respective places to be buisy and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in the Cause of Reformation. This is incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on you as <hi>Christians,</hi> &amp; as <hi>Subjects;</hi> as Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church, and as Members of the Common Wealth. A Regard to the Good of the World, to the Safety and Prosperity of the Land, the Town, and N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>i borhood where you dwell, shou'd influence you to do your utmost for the averting and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peasing of GOD's righteous Anger; and by Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence for the suppressing those Sins, which have inflamed the Divine Displeasure against us.—You must not go about to <hi>shift off</hi> from yourselves this Work of Reformation, as if it belong'd only to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, Ministers, and other Authorities. No, it shou'd be every single Person's Concern. It is a common Duty, and universally obliging. Some undeed have greater Advantages than others. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:002336_0098_0FDB2BCB24212540"/>
ever, let your sphere of Activity be never so small, and your Opportunities never so few; yet you are <hi>not without</hi> your Opportunities.—The least Star has it's Light; the meanest Member, it's use. There are various Ways, in which private Christians may display their zele for Religion, and minister to it's Support &amp; Increase. Thus, You may contribute not a little to serve the Design of Reformation, as by your fervent Prayers, so by a bright <hi>Example</hi> of all Virtue &amp; Goodness. <hi>Let your Light plan so shine before others, that they seeing your good Works, may likewise be induced to glorify GOD.</hi>—You may also do good by <hi>serious Discourse</hi> in your friendly Converses with others. Wherefore let your <hi>Speech be always with Grace,</hi> seasoned with Salt, and good to the use of godly edifying: such as may manifest grace in him that speaks, &amp; minister Grace to him that hears.—Again, You may be serviceable, by <hi>brotherly Watch</hi> over your Fellow Christians, and a faithful attending the several Duties, which Chruch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Order doth require at your hands. 1 Thes. 5. 14. <hi>Now we exhort you Brethren, Warn them that are unruly, comfort the feeble-minded,</hi> &amp;c. Heb. 3. 13. <hi>Exhort one another daily while it is called, To day, lest any be hardned through the deceitfulness of Sin.</hi> Tit. 2. 1, 3. <hi>Speak thou the things which become sound doctrine;—that the aged Women be teachers of good Things; that they may teach the young women to be sober,</hi> &amp;c. How narrow and inferiour soever your sphere is, undoubtedly there are some within it. some Relatives or Acquaintance, that you may use a Freedom with, who need your Counsils, Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions Admonitions, and the like; which you shou'd
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:002336_0098_0FDB2BCB24212540"/>
be ready to dispense unto them, as the Case may require—Moreover, You may do much Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice by making prudent &amp; seasonable <hi>Informations</hi> or <hi>Complaints</hi> to Authority against open &amp; daring Offenders. You shou'd call for Civil Justice, to be done upon criminal Delinquents; and for Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical Discipline to be exercised upon scandalous Impenitents. If it be an Iniquity to be punish'd by the Judges, a Sin that exposes to <hi>Temporal</hi> Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, You must inform the Magistrate; <hi>Go and tell</hi> Moses <hi>of it,</hi> as they, Lev. 24. 11. Or, if it be an offence that exposes to <hi>Spiritual</hi> Censures, <hi>Go tell it unto the Church,</hi> as our Saviour directs, <hi>Mattb.</hi>18. 17. This you must do, if you wou'd not partake of other mens sins &amp; plagues. Deut. 13. 6. &amp;c. <hi>If thy Brother, or thy Son, or thy Daughter, or the Wise of thy Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som, or thy Friend which is as thine own Soul offend, thine eye shall not pity him, neither shalt thou spare, neither shalt thou conceal him. And all Israel shall hear &amp; fear, and shall do no more any such wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness.</hi> To inform Authority is the way to wash your own hands from the Guilt; and to put away the Evil from the Community, if Justice be duly administer'd. As then you would be just to your own Souls, and true to the Public Interest, you must be faithfully in this Matter; and especially are you called to be so, in this time of prevailing Iniquity.—In a word, You must <hi>rejoyce in acts I Justice,</hi> against provoking Evils among us; thankfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the holy Zele &amp; faithful Service of Pious Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, Ministers, &amp; Tutors; and do and you can encourage their hearts, and strengthen their hand in their Work.

I shall here crave Leave to add a few Sentences borrow'd, and then conclude this long Discourse. "Here is a wide and noble Field (says one) before us, for all good Men to shew their Zele, and exert themselves in: and cou'd but all good. People so far agree, as to lay down their undue Heats and Animosities; and to let their Warmth and Zele run together for a while, in this Channel; to imploy their Prayers, their Labours their Parts, and their Purses, to extirpate that Impiety and Profaneness, which reigns amongst us, and is the occasion of separating the Favour and gratious Presence of GOD from us; who (though He may bear for a while in expectation of our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment) can never delight to do good to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious and impenitent People: we need not doubt when we have thus made <hi>our Peace with GOD,</hi> He will heal our Divisions among our selves (which probably are a just Judgment of GOD upon us for our other Sins, one of the bitter Fruits of that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality, Unbelief and Contempt of the Gospel, which first took Root amongst us) and incline our hearts to <hi>Peace one with another.</hi>

There are enough abroad, that watch for our Halting; we need not lay open one another's Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities Devouring Beasts enough there are, which with open mouths wait to make a Prey of us".—'Tis Pity, we shou'd destroy our selves.
