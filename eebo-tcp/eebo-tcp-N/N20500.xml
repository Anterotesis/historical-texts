            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE</head>
            <p>SINCE the writing the following diſcourſe and prayer, the publiſher has been greatly ſolicited by many of the auditors, for copies thereof.</p>
            <p>Therefore in purſuance to the repeated requeſts that has been made, the publiſher hath made uſe of the preſs to convey the ſame to the public with hopes it may be uſeful to ſome and that no diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage will enſue to any individual.</p>
            <p>The publiſhing of good books hath oftentimes been of great ſervice, nay, hath been the means of kindling a holy fire in the hearts of the luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm.</p>
            <p>It cannot be expected that the reading of the following diſcourſe will be attended with the ſame power, as at the time of delivery, except being touch'd by that power which cauſed them to flow forth</p>
            <p>It is not the province of the editor to ſay much or to multiply words, but hopes the enſuing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe and prayer may be read with a ſolid and ſober mind.</p>
            <p>It is the indiſpenſable duty of every one, to be careful how they handle the golden veſſels (holy
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:026895_0003_0FD24B90AEB6A610"/>
words) of the Lord's houſe, and ſee that they profane not the temple of God with unhallowed tongues.</p>
            <p>I therefore ſhall leave the iſſue to the all-wiſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer of all good things.</p>
            <p>The publiſher having not ſeen the author of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing diſcourſe, ſince ſhe delivered it, the public cannot expect to have her approbation for publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame; but he hath ſhewn it to many who were preſent at the time of delivery, and they are unanimous in their opinion it is the ſubſtance of what they heard.</p>

            <head type="sub">(Theſe words being moſt inſiſted on in the foregoing part of the diſcourſe, the editor hath thought proper to prefix the ſame.)</head>
            <p>IF I miſtake not, our dear Lord and Saviour, Jeſus Chriſt, both he and his diſciples that were with him, were invited to a marriage that was to be in Cana of Galilee, which place he graciouſly pleaſed to honour with his heavenly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; and even there manifeſted himſelf by his omnipotent and divine power, in a moſt wonderful and miraculous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
            <p>Since my ſitting down here amongſt you in this meeting, the thoughts of it came into my mind, without the leaſt ſtudy or premeditation. I could not be ſilent, thinking it to be my duty, in obedience to the divine will; for I deſired not the ſound of my voice to be heard, but would much rather hear than be heard; but apprehending it to be my duty, as that eminent apoſtle and ſervant of our Lord did, to whom a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of the goſpel was commited; who ſaid, <hi>Woe be unto me if I preach not the goſpel!</hi> I heartily wiſh, and it is the earneſt deſire of my mind, that thoſe that are now concerned, may be ſolicitous; and O! that it may be the concern of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry individual, that is here preſent, to invite this heavenly gueſt, that we all might be favoured with his heavenly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and made to partake of his divine comforts. If we were thus ſolicitous and engaged in our minds, we might have great reaſon to expect his gracious preſence to be with us, as he our dear Lord hath promiſed, ſaying; <hi>Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there will I be, and bleſs them.
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:026895_0005_0FD24B95F0D45208"/>
Whereſoever two or three are gathered together in my name</hi> (that is, my power) <hi>there will I be in the midſt of them, and I will bleſs them.</hi> What wonderful condeſcenſion is this to his children and people, to be ſo highly favoured with his heavenly prefence!</p>
            <p>In this he fulfils his promiſe which he hath made to his diſciples, as he expreſſes himſelf in another place, ſaying <hi>I and my Father will come and ſup with them, and we will make our abode with them.</hi> O! bleſſed inhabitant, and heavenly gueſt! O! that it may be the happy experience of the preſent parties here concerned, and that they may be favoured with the heavenly manifeſtation of divine love, that they may witneſs his ſtupendous power to viſit, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, guide and direct them!</p>
            <p>We find that at the marriage in Cana there was to be a watch. <hi>Whatſoever he bids you do, that do.</hi> Here they were to watch for the divine command. O! that we may be all a watching and have our eye to him that is both willing and able to help, and is ſtrength in weakneſs and riches in poverty; that we may adhere to his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly teaching, which is found to them that ſeek him, as he himſelf hath graciouſly promiſed who ſaid, <hi>He that ſeeketh me, ſhall find me, and he that cometh to me I will in no wiſe caſt off.</hi> Here our bleſſed Lord ſheweth his unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able love to the ſons and daughters of men, to be thus gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly viſited by the Lord of life and glory! O! that thou, O Lord may be invited! and O! that it may be the ſolicitation of every mind that is here met, and are anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to hear what may be ſpoken; that, by and through thy inward appearance in their hearts, they may be brought to know and experience thy divine will. This was the ſhort prayer of my ſpirit ſince my ſitting down among you. I heartily wiſh it was the concern of every one that is here. If it was the concern of us all, we ſhould have cauſe to rejoice in our coming together: and it would do our ſouls good to be thus favoured by Divine Love, who is the Lord from Heaven, the Quickening Spirit, the God of Truth. O! may there be a true and zealous labouring and working to ſeek to him. O! may we be favoured with his heavenly company, that we may come to know him to be with us; and have the happy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:026895_0006_0FD24B974D8E0FF0"/>
to witneſs his power, and taſte of his bleſſing. By this experience we ſhall come to know his heavenly power to preſerve, and his divine inſtruction to teach us, who ſpeaks as never man ſpoke, who is the Wonderful Counſellor, the Mighty God, and Prince of Peace, the Everlaſting Father, and of the increaſe of his government there ſhall never be an end.</p>
            <p>Now what great advantage would this be to the children of men, to know and witneſs this great power to rule and reign in them, whoſe right it is to rule and reign; and have the experience of his love and favour, who is the Mighty God, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords; that He might take upon him the government and direct us in his ways.</p>
            <p>As we come under his government, and are obedient to his divine and heavenly inſtructions, we ſhall come to know his kingdom to be come, and his will to be done in us as it is in heaven; and have that excellent prayer of our Lord an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered; <hi>Thy kingdom come; thy will be done on earth as is done in heaven.</hi> O! what an excellent and heavenly expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience it is to have the mind reſigned to the will of our heavenly father! to know the kingdom of God to be come in righteouſneſs, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt? O! the heavenly rectitude of mind the people of God enjoy! what ſweet tranquility of mind do they poſſeſs where the kingdom of God is come? where righteouſneſs and peace is known? and where the Lord Jeſus rules and reigns?</p>
            <p>It was obſerved before, that at the marriage which the Lord honoured with his preſence, they had a watch. The ſervants that attended, were to watch and obey the orders given them, which was, <hi>Whatſoever he bids you do, that do.</hi> And they waited for the divine command. Now, here was the advantage they had that were waiting upon the Lord: by their waiting and watching they come to know the Lord's will, and obey his orders.</p>
            <p>We find that, at the marriage, there was a want of wine. What was the expreſſion to the ſervants that attended? It was, <hi>Whatſoever he bids do, that do.</hi> And we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member they were ordered to put water into the pots, which were not to be handed forth till he ordered: and they
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:026895_0007_0FD24B99EFB420B0"/>
waited for the divine command. Here our Lord ſhewed his miraculous power. Here it was our Bleſſed Lord made the water wine, and then ordered the ſervants that waited to hand it forth. Obſerve. The water was firſt made wine by a miraculous and divine power. It was then, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſervants had to hand it to the company that was preſent. How gracious was our Lord, how great was his power, in ſhewing forth this miracle? I could not but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire his great love and wonderful condeſcenſion to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind!</p>
            <p>Now, let us obſerve the expreſſion in the orders given, which was, <hi>Whatſoever he bids you do, that do.</hi> And he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected the water that had been made wine, to be handed to the governor of the feaſt, that he might taſte it; and he taſted it, and thoſe that were at the marriage. What was then expreſſed? It was <hi>The laſt wine is the beſt.</hi> O Friends, I cannot but admire the great love and condeſcenſion of our dear Lord, in beſtowing his gifts to his children and people; how he manifeſted his power amongſt them; and how condeſcending he is to thoſe who are anxious to know the water being made wine, that the ſpirits of the contrite might be revived, and thoſe that are ready to faint might be refreſhed by the handing forth of divine love, which is the wine of his kingdom, prepared and given by him that is ſtrenth in weakneſs and riches in poverty. Our own ſtrength as men and creatures, is as water, be our educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation ever ſo high, and our wiſdom but fooliſhneſs. It is like water and not wine, be it ever ſo excellent, till taught of the Lord by his inſpeaking word. The Lord he prepares it. It is his power alone, which is the ſame that it ever was, that thoſe who are truly concerned, come to know and witneſs a true and peaceable tranquility of mind. O that his company may be rightly and truly ſought after, that all thoſe that are here preſent may be ſolicitous to hear his voice, which ſpeaketh as never man ſpoke; that every one may attend to his divine teaching and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly inſtruction: that they may taſte of the wine of his preparing, and when he orders his ſervants to hand it forth to the people, they may have it to ſay (from a true and real experience,) <hi>The laſt wine is the beſt.</hi> This has been the concern of my ſpirit among you, that you may wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs his power to be with you, and in the midſt of you. It is
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:026895_0008_0FD24B99F4BCBF68"/>
his power only can do it. It is his power alone that can effect it.</p>
            <p>I have ſometimes thought the Lord is wonderfully mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting his power, even to the working of miracles. It is he that is the cauſe of the water being made wine, not thoſe that hand it forth. If he doth not prepare it, if he doth not make it, and if he doth not order it to be given, it is but water and not wine, which cannot profit the people. It is not the quantity but the quality that can ſatisfy thoſe that are ſeeking the Lord for divine help and ſtrength. This has been upon my mind as I have been engaged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you: and I think it was in ſome degree a miracle.</p>
            <p>I do not want to monopolize other perſons places, or to take up the room of any other here. I could be more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to hear than to ſpeak; but, methinks when I feel of the water being made wine, I dare not but hand forth a little of the divine bleſſing, in order that the gueſts which have been here invited, may partake of the heavenly wine. The Lord prepares it himſelf. He is inviting his children to come and refreſh themſelves with the wine of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. O, if people did but ſee, if their minds were right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerned; and if there was but a true ſeeking to him, there would be a taſting of the wine of his preparing.</p>
            <p>O that the eye of the mind was but ſingle to him, and to his dear Son our Lord, in whom the father is well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, who ſaid, <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed!</hi> It is my ſincere deſire that there may be a hearkening to him, and a hearing of his heavenly voice, that you may come to be acquainted with him, and obey his voice that is the true Miniſter of the Sanctuary and Biſhop of his Church and People, whom God the Father ſends, is the earneſt prayer of my ſpirit.</p>
            <p>Now, if the eye were ſingle to him, and our expectations from him, and not from the arm of fleſh; we ſhould know the Lord Jeſus, who is all-powerful to be our redeemer. I ſay, if there was but a hearing of the voice of him, whom the prophet ſpake of, ſaying. <hi>A prophet ſhall the Lord your God raiſe up, like unto me. Him ſhall you hear in all things; and he that doth not hear him, ſhall be cut off from among his people.</hi> If we did but hear and obey God, we ſhould come to know his power to be amongſt us. O that there may be a truſting in the Lord, and a dependance on his ſpirit and power to teach and inſtruct us, is the earneſt concern
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:026895_0009_0FD24B9B0F7F7FB0"/>
of my mind. Is is he that ſpeaketh truth and no lie, for he is a God of Truth.</p>
            <p>As we come to be diveſted of Self, as there is no leaning on our own underſtanding, [<hi>Lean not to your own underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but truſt in the Lord</hi> (ſaid an eminent ſervant of God) <hi>truſt in the Lord, and he will help thee</hi>] not to lean on words nor the acquired arts and parts of the creature, be them ever ſo high and excellent; but in true humility of mind, with a perfect reſignation to his will, to wait upon the Lord for his divine appearance in your hearts; for it is they that ſeek him ſhall find him: the humble he will teach his way, and the meek he will guide in judgment. It is them he will fill with his heavenly oil; and thoſe that thirſt after righteouſneſs he will fill with his heavenly wine.</p>
            <p>But O Friends! there muſt be a watchfulneſs and a care not to lean on our own underſtanding, or on our own cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, that is ſo apt to fill the mind. If we come to expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience this, O how ſhall we be taught of the Lord! taught by him that is truth and no lie, for he is a God of Truth.</p>
            <p>It is the true and humble ſeeking ſoul ſhall be bleſſed of the Lord, and thoſe that hunger and thirſt after righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; it is they and they only, that ſhall obtain the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord;</hi> but the rich and full they ſhall be ſent empty away. Thoſe that think great of their abilities, and they that are lifted up in their own imaginations, they are thoſe that ſhall be ſent empty away. The ability is not in man, nor is the ſtrength in the creature, but it is in the God of Truth. Great is the God of Truth! The Lord from Heaven is above all Gods, and above all beings and principalities, both in Heaven and Earth. Bleſſed be the God of truth! It is He that teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the people truth, and brings them to be acquainted with himſelf. It is by the manifeſtation of Chriſt Jeſus the truth is come to be known, as he himſelf hath expreſſed, ſaying, <hi>I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life. I am the way; nor is there any other way to come to the Father, for there is no other name given amongſt men, but the name of Chriſt, whereby mankind can be ſaved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is Chriſt Jeſus, which is Life and Truth, that would raiſe us from ſin and death to a life of righteouſneſs. If there was but a ſeeking to him, and a deſire to be taught by him, what advantage would we then receive! Our ſorrow would be then turned into joy, and our weakneſs
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:026895_0010_0FD24B9C8CB73408"/>
into ſtrength; we ſhould then come to know the promiſe of the Lord to be riches in poverty, and ſtrength in all our weakneſs. All thoſe that do put their truſt in him, and have an eye ſingle to him, that are ſolicitous for his divine inſtruction, and ſeek him with all their whole heart, who ſeeks the doctrine from his mouth, ſhall be made to know him that is the God of Truth. If thine eye be ſingle to him, thy whole body ſhall be full of light; that is, if thou art ſingly looking to God, and to his divine appearance in thine own heart, thou ſhalt come to know him that is God, whom to know is life eternal, and be made acquainted with his truth; for what is to be known of God, is made manifeſt in man. (This is ſcripture doctrine.) It is there he is manifeſting and revealing himſelf againſt ſin and wickedneſs, and againſt every evil way.</p>
            <p>He that maketh manifeſt is light, and in him there is no darkneſs at all. If thine eye be ſingle, thy whole body ſhall be full of light; thou ſhalt ſee what the Lord would have thee to do, and what to leave undone. In him there is no confuſion, but the confuſion is in the creature, for want of ſingly looking to God; and this want is the cauſe of the want of a true devotion to, and worſhipping God aright, who is to be worſhipped in ſpirit and in truth; for ſuch doth the father ſeek to worſhip him. There muſt be no dependance on fleſh and blood; for fleſh and blood ſhall never enter into heaven. The apoſtle Paul conferred not with fleſh and blood, but gave up freely to the heavenly viſion, to the inſtruction of the Spirit of Chriſt Jeſus, as himſelf hath ſaid. <hi>I conferred not</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>with fleſh and blood, but ſtraightway gave up to the heavenly viſion.</hi> He did not receive the goſpel from man, but from the Lord from Heaven. Obſerve how bold he ſpeaks his own expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, <hi>I conferred not with fleſh and blood. I received it not from man, but by adhering to the light of Chriſt Jeſus, the heavenly inſtructor; who is the way, the truth, and the light, that enlighteneth every man that cometh into the world; who is the Lord from Heaven, and King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We find that it was given to the apoſtle juſt mentioned, to preach Chriſt Jeſus to the Jews as well as the Gentiles; though to the Jews he was a ſtumbling-block and to the Gentiles fooliſhneſs. It was by obedience and a reſignation
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:026895_0011_0FD24BA4F1BABA68"/>
to the divine truth revealed in him, that he became an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent inſtrument in the hand of God, to diſcourage vice and immorality, and had to preach righteouſneſs; for it is the Righteous, my friends, that exalteth a nation, but Sin is a ſhame to any people. This is inſtruction to mankind. This is what the Apoſtle of our bleſſed Lord had to diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute. It was the great buſineſs his Maſter ſent him to do, to preach righteouſneſs and diſcourage immorality, that Sin might be put an end to, and Righteouſneſs (which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alteth a nation) be eſtabliſhed. This was the end for which Chriſt came into the world, and was propheſied of him; and that a long time before he came in that prepared body which he received of the Father; that he was to put an end to ſin and finiſh tranſgreſſion, and in the room there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to eſtabliſh everlaſting righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>Now, if ever the work of righteouſneſs is done, if ever it be rightly and truly performed, it muſt be begun at home, in our own hearts; for (obſerve) Chriſt came to take away ſin, and in the room thereof to eſtabliſh ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting righteouſneſs. We may alſo take notice of another expreſſion of an eminent ſervant of our bleſſed Lord, that God <hi>ſo loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son</hi>— (what for?)—<hi>to take away ſin, in order that he might redeem to himſelf a peculiar and holy people, zealous of good works.</hi> How can we but be concerned that the glorious end for which Chriſt came, might be anſwered; that ſin, which is a ſhame, might be put an end to, and tranſgreſſion finiſhed, that righteouſneſs which exalteth a nation be eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>If we were truly ſincere, if we were true miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, how anxious would we be, how zealouſly would we labour, that ſin might be put an end to, and tranſgreſſion finiſhed! There is no room left for ſin, nor place for tranſgreſſion; but the Lord directs to righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and without holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord with comfort; for the Lord is of purer eyes than to behold ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity with approbation. There is no people that are ſo beloved of the Lord, that he can approve of ſin in them. It is not forms or modes of religion, or a formal righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, nor the inventions of men will do; but it is through obedience and ſanctification we are made righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and by being waſhed with the water of regeneration we come to be cleanſed from ſin and pollution.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:026895_0012_0FD24BA744611030"/>If we come to be beloved of the Lord, it muſt be by experiencing his love in us, and being obedient to his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly will. It is the obedient ſoul ſhall live. It is he that ſhall eat the good of the land, and drink of the wine of his kingdom. All thoſe that do his will ſhall know of his doctrine. It is they that ſhall be taught of the Lord, as our dear Lord ſaid, <hi>He that doeth my will ſhall know of my doctrine.</hi> O may there be a real concern in every heart, and an earneſt deſire raiſed in each of our minds, that ſin may be put an end to, and tranſgreſſion finiſhed! If we were ſolicitous enough for this, what a divine energy and ſtrength would be put into our minds, that everlaſting righteouſneſs might be brought in, and the kingdom of Chriſt be eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>If we were true Chriſtians taught of the Lord, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous for his honour, we ſhould be made to know more and more, and be made ready to open to him, and will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to take on us his heavenly yoke, that would yoke us to his croſs, and draw our inclinations to himſelf. <hi>It is good for a man to bear the yoke in his youth,</hi> ſaith the Scripture of truth. Here is a beautiful compariſon. It is compared to a yoke of young oxen that are yoked together, and are taught to draw, which they cannot do till they obey the yoke. It is as we come under the divine yoke, and are yoked to his croſs, and made to obey, we are taught to draw and become ſerviceable in the creation, and uſeful to one another; for he is only fit to live, who is fit to die. For this very end have we a being in the world, that we might glorify God, who gives us life, breath and being. This has been the concern of my mind ſince I entered this city, in the love of my heavenly Father, to call unto the inhabitants thereof, that they might eat of the fruit of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, which is the way to life, and become obedient to the voice of wiſdom, which is calling them in the ſecret of their hearts. The Lord in his mercy, is calling unto the ſons and daughters of men; he is calling them from dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to light, from the power of ſin and Satan to ſerve the living God. I cannot but admire his unſpeakable love and wonderful mercy that he beſtows on his people! Methinks there is a door of mercy open, which none can ſhut but he that has the key of David, who openeth and none can ſhut, and ſhutteth and none can open. A door of mercy is open, and mercy is handing forth; and if there be not a comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:026895_0013_0FD24BA88AB13A78"/>
if there be not a coming up in obedience to righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the door of mercy will be ſhut. This is plainly ſet forth in the parable of the virgins.</p>
            <p>We may remember, that when the bridegroom came, the fooliſh virgins had no oil in their lamps; and they ſaid unto the wiſe, <hi>Give us of your oil.</hi> What was the anſwer of the wiſe? It was a very reaſonable one,—<hi>Not ſo, leſt there be not enough for you and us. Go and buy for yourſelves. And when they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with them, and the door was ſhut;</hi> and an anſwer was made to the fooliſh virgins, when they wanted to enter, <hi>I know you not.</hi> A diſmal ſentence it was, and will be pronounced to the wicked,—<hi>Depart from me, I know you not.</hi> I hope that this may never be the caſe of any that are here. The fooliſh had a name to virgins as well as the wiſe; but that would no<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> get them an entrance. Though they had a name to virgins, it did not prevent the anſwer, <hi>I know you not.</hi> Obſerve: Here was both a name and profeſſion to religion. Both had the name to virgins but the fooliſh wanted oil: they wanted righteouſneſs. The time was elapſed; the door of mercy was ſhut; an anſwer was made; and a woeful ſentence pronounced,— <hi>Depart from me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I know you not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You have heard of him that ſpeaketh as never man ſpoke, who ſpeaketh in the ſecret of your hearts. But though you have heard, you may be no better than he that built his houſe upon the ſand. When the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that houſe, it fell, becauſe it was not built upon a rock. So will it be with thoſe who truſt to a name of religion, and a formal righteouſneſs, but neglect to come up in obedience to the word of grace in their hearts. I hope, and I earneſtly pray, that this may never happen to any that is in the hearing of my voice. The Lord, in his mercy bleſs you and keep you: may his infinite power preſerve and protect you!</p>
            <p>But he that built his houſe on the rock, when the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that houſe, it fell not, becauſe it was built upon a rock; ſo will he ſtand who builds on the divine rock, Chriſt Jeſus the Son of God, and ſure foundation. Againſt him the gates of Hell ſhall never prevail. The floods may come and the winds may blow, and waves of temptation may raiſe themſelves high,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:026895_0014_0FD24BAA02ED4098"/>
he ſhall ſtand in the day of trial, becauſe he is built on the Divine and Eternal Rock.</p>
            <p>Therefore let none deceive themſelves, for <hi>ſuch as you ſow, ſuch ſhall you reap.</hi> If you ſow to the ſpirit, you ſhall of the ſpirit reap life everlaſting; but if you ſow to the fleſh, a miſerable crop ſhall you reap. It is by experiencing the work of righteouſneſs wrought in us we come to taſte of the bleſſing; and <hi>O that it may be the caſe!</hi> is the earneſt pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that accompanies my mind; and that you may know his gracious favour and mercy to be with you, and keep you! Suppoſe I ſhould ſay it hath attended me here, for which my ſoul doth bleſs the Lord, who hath come down to his people, and is making his power known in bleſſing the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of Zion. We cannot but worſhip at the throne of his footſtool, who is God over all, bleſſed in himſelf.

            <p>BE pleaſed, O Lord! to prepare our hearts, and put into our minds, to commemorate thy goodneſs.

Thy truth is gone forth, and we cannot forbear to beſeech thee, in behalf of mankind all the world over (let their names or profeſſion be what it may) that thouſands or tens of thouſands may be brought home by thy Son; and that thou wouldſt make thyſelf known by manifeſting thyſelf to them.

Holy Lord God, as we have known thy infinite mercy to be with us, O be thou pleaſed, once more to reach unto the hearts of ſuch as rebel againſt thee. It's thy power alone can effect it.

O Lord, remember the poor in heart, we humbly beſeech thee, even thoſe whoſe knees are ready to ſmite together, that have no might or ſtrength of their own, and who are ready to periſh. All ſuch as rebel againſt thee, turn thou, O God, their minds to thee. Thou, O God, art known in thy own temple the heart. It is there only that thou art to be felt and worſhipped.

               <hi>SOME ACCOUNT OF</hi> ISAAC SHOEMAKER, <hi>OF THE</hi> Townſhip of Cheltenham, in the County of Philadelphia (Son of <hi>JOHN SHOEMAKER</hi> of the ſame Place) who departed this Life on the <hi>31</hi>ſt Day of the ſeventh Month <hi>1779,</hi> in the twenty fifth Year of his Age.</head>
            <p>HE was a young man of an active diſpoſition and vigourous conſtitution, who in the general tenor of his conduct and converſation was preſerved from what in the world's eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is accounted groſs or immoral; yet in his company, dreſs and deportment evidence a leaning to levity, and fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for things in their nature vain and unſubſtantial; of the emptineſs and corrupting tendency whereof he was at time made ſenſible, by the faithful admonitions of the Divine Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitor in his own mind, as appears from ſome of his expreſſions near his departure out of time; when through the renewed extendings of heavenly favour, he was mercifully viſited and awakened from a ſtate of inſenſibility; under the quickening influences whereof, he had to warn and admoniſh his former aſſociates and others, againſt indulging themſelves in the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities and folies of a periſhing world; ſome of whom having been meaſureably reached thereby, have ſignified a deſire that the weighty expreſſions uttered by him in that ſolemn ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, might be communicated and diffuſed for the benefit of the youth of his acquaintance and others; which if weighed with becoming ſeriouſneſs and depth of attention, might miniſter profitable inſtruction, and tend to laſting edification. This inſtance of heavenly condeſcention and divine regard affording renewed cauſe in humble admiration to ſay,

               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:026895_0018_0FD24BB4C7C1FE10"/>About ten days before his deceaſe, between the hours of eight and nine in the evening he fell into a ſtate of ſilence, and became ſpeechleſs and incapable of bodily action, his mouth being open and his jaw ſet: thus he lay nearly three hours, ſuppoſed by the family and divers of the neighbours preſent, to be in a trance. Upon his recovery, he ground his teeth together, ſo as greatly to affect the hearers, and twice or thrice ſighed deeply. After which, appearing like one raiſed from the dead, under great concern and exerciſe of mind, he began to ſpeak with a ſtrong voice, to the aſtoniſhment of thoſe in company; ſaying,
<q>Oh! that I could tell you what I have ſeen and underwent. It would pierce the hardeſt heart amongſt you; perhaps ſome may think there is no hell, but I have to tell you there is a hell, and a dreadful one too; and the grinding of my teeth is nothing to the grinding and gnaſhing of teeth in hell. And there is a heaven and a ſweet one too; where angels cloathed in white robes ſit at the right hand of God ſinging praiſes to his great name; I have to declare it unto you at the peril of my ſoul, but ſome will not believe though an apoſtle ſhould riſe from the dead. You may think I am not in my ſenſes, but I knew you all as you came into the room, am perfectly in my ſenſes, and God hath opened my mouth on your account, and that you might declare it unto others. Narrow is the way that leads to life, and few there be that find it; but broad is the way that leads to deſtruction, and many are going in that way.</q>
(Proceeding in a bemoaning accent.)
<q>I have lived to this age without knowing what God real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is, until this night. I have been often viſited, but did kick and rebel. Three years ago, I had a ſight that I ſhould be brought to the brink of the grave, but it was not ſhewn me whether I ſhould recover or not; but if I do, I am deſirous that I might be made an inſtrument to convert thouſands into the right way. I wonder (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued he) that I ſhould undertake to be the head of a family and not capable to teach them their duty towards God: there is a neceſſity for parents and heads of fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies to bring up their children and others under their care, in plainneſs of ſpeech and apparel, keeping humble, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to impreſs their tender minds with a ſenſe of their duty towards God. Many let their children run about the ſtreets, hearing (which is often uſed in this land) the holy name of Jeſus taken in vain. My parents
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:026895_0019_0FD24BB9807D55F0"/>
when I was young, were drawn ſo much into the cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things of this world, that they did not teach me as they ought to have done my duty towards God.</q>
To his wife he uttered himſelf thus:
<q>My dear conſort, my boſom friend, mourn not for me, there are many diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and trials to be met with in our paſſing through this world; retire to thy father's houſe, live a ſober, virtuous life. If it ſhould pleaſe God to take me out of the world this night, I would have none to take it to heart; no, not to ſhed a tear.</q>
He was divers times drawn forth in fervent ſupplication, and expreſſed himſelf
on this wiſe:<q> Oh! Lord Jeſus, be pleaſed to look down with an eye of pity upon me; on my father, be with him and comfort him in his old age, under the afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and trials that may be ſuffered to come upon him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> On my aged mother, be her ſtrength and ſupport all the days of her life; who has been a kind and tender mother to me, all my days; and hath ſince my ſickneſs, in my diſtreſs, pointed out the right path for me to turn into, when I was ready to fall into deſpair, under a ſenſe of my manifold tranſgreſſions, directing me to look forward towards my dear Redeemer, whoſe blood is ſufficient to waſh away all our ſins, which I have experienced the truth of. Be pleaſed, if it be thy will, look down upon mankind univerſally, reconcile all men to one another and to thyſelf, that there may be no more blood ſpilt in the land, if it be thy bleſſed will; not my will, but thine be done.</q>
Alſo ſinging praiſes to God for his many great mercies to him.</p>
            <p>Being deſirous of ſeeing divers of his acquaintance not preſent, he ſaid:
<q>They know not what God really is; ſome of them have in their breaſts the ſpirit of envy and bitterneſs.</q>
Under much concern that they may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed from that wrathful ſpirit, he earneſtly beſought the Almighty to turn their hearts to love and good will.
<q>I wonder, (ſaid he) that God hath not ſent his juſt judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and deſtroyed this place, for wickedneſs and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart.</q>
He deſired to be made ſubject to the divine will, and ſaid,
<q>I have no will of my own, not my will but thine be done.</q> To his brothers he ſaid, <q>Remem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ber your Creator in the days of your youth, dreſs plain and walk humble before the Lord; never mind what your comrades ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for we muſt all become fools for Chriſt's

ſake, that we may be made wiſe. Make Him your ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, keep the world under your feet; attend meetings with your father and mother both on firſt and other days of the week; when met, turn your minds inward and ſolidly think what you came about, and endeavour to know God for yourſelves; do not as I have done; I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten went to meetings and ſometimes did think on thoſe things, but ſoon let them ſlip, letting my mind out at fine cloaths and gay dreſs, contriving how to exceed in grandeur.</q>
To his apprentice boy he ſaid,
<q>I have heard thee uſe many idle words and paſſed it by without proper notice, I beg thee may break thyſelf of them, or God will pronounce his judgments againſt thee.</q>
deſiring the company to withdraw out of the room and to be left alone in ſtillneſs, he ſaid,
<q>I think I have done with fleſh, I have ſaid all that I have to ſay unto you;</q> then lifting too his hands he ſaid, <q>Oh! holy Jeſus how ſweet do I feel thee!</q>
All being gone out of the room, he devout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and loudly deſired (in the hearing of ſome friends in the adjoining room) that God might be pleaſed to ſtop the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of blood.</p>
            <p>After which he appeared like one whoſe mind is redeemed from the earth and much ſwallowed up in a ſenſe of that ſweetneſs he had been ſo marvellouſly favoured with; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing in this frame of ſpirit to the cloſe of his time; and we doubt not but he now reſts in peace and quiet with the Lord.</p>

            <p>'Many are often alarmed in conſcience hereby the word and voice of God, who ſtop the ears and ſlight thoſe warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; but the great and final alarm of the laſt trumpet they cannot ſtop their ears againſt, nor eſcape it. It will unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſeize upon and further waken them finally to judgment: They that will not be alarmed in their conſciences unto re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentances, nor out of their ſins here, muſt certainly be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmed to judgment hereafter.'</p>
            <p>'Whoſoever do now willfully ſhut their eyes, hate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn or ſhun the light of Chriſt, or his appearance within, ſhall at laſt be made to ſee, and not be able to ſhun or hide themſelves from his glorious and dreadful appearance from heaven with his mighty angels, as with lightning and in flaming fire, to render vengeance on all them that know not God, and obey not this Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. 1 Theſ. iv. 17. Matt. xxiv. 17. Luke xvii. 24. Dan. xix 6. Job. xxxvii, 3.'</p>
            <p>'And tho' many now evade and reject the inward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions and judgments of the light, and ſhut up the records or books thereof in their own conſciences, they ſhall all be at laſt opened, and every one judged of theſe things record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therein and according to their works. Rev. xx. 12, 13.14.15.'</p>
