            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A LETTER, FROM Batiſta Angeloni to Manzoni.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>NOTHING has leſs truth in it than what Voltaire and abbé le Bland have ſaid relating to the Quakers in this kingdom: it is plain from what the firſt has writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that he either was never in their company, or did not attend to their cuſtoms. He deſcribes one of theſe gentry, with whom he dined, as taking off his hat, and aſking a benediction on his repaſt; in which he muſt be abſolutely miſtaken: it being the eſtabliſhed maxim of this ſect, never to perform that ceremony. A Quaker aſks no bleſſing from heaven before he eats, and has not gratitude enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn thanks after he is fill'd. To ſay the truth, thoſe of the church of England do both in a becoming manner.</p>
            <p>If it was the ſpirit of religious enthuſiaſm that actuated the firſt Quakers; it is a ſpirit of another kind, which reigns amongst them at preſent. If ſimplicity of dreſs, and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of ſpeech, aroſe from the humble conſideration of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature, in the beginning; it is love of ſingularity, pride, and perſonal advantage, which has taken poſſeſſion of their hearts, and which continues their dreſs and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in this age.</p>
            <p>No creature on this globe has half the arrogance of a Quaker; he accoſts the king with Friend George, the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter with Neighbour William, and this without the leaſt reluctance, diſtruſt of himſelf, or mark of confuſion. What can argue greater inſolence than this of meeting thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, upon equal terms, and treating them with the utmoſt
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:009839_0003_0F7A503470E165B0"/>
familiarity, whoſe characters all the world agree to revere? the ſon of a Quaker has more confident aſſurance at ten years old, than the wildeſt officer of the king's guards at twenty-five.</p>
            <p>They call themſelves Chriſtians, but I know not what title they have to that appellation; there is no ſacrament in uſe in their religion: in fact, they ſeem to be a ſet of fataliſts, who agree to call that cauſe which moves them to action, a ſomething proceeding from the ſpirit. I have heard it affirmed in their company, that the reſurrection of the body is not an article of their faith, if they have any at all.</p>
            <p>As their number is but ſmall, they draw advantage from that circumſtance, being all united in the general intereſt of the ſect. They are almoſt all in trade, and therefore once in the year they meet in ſeveral towns in England, to know the ſtate of thoſe parts of the country: to thoſe places of rendezvous one or more of the Quakers of the towns within two hundred miles always come. At this time their real deſign of meeting is concealed, by praying and preaching; it is a religious act to the eye, but a political one at the heart; every Quaker who aſſembles brings the ſtate of the Trade of that town from whence he comes along with him; the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular buſineſs of every grocer, mercer, and other tradeſman; his induſtry, manner of living, and expences: by this means the wholeſale dealers of London, Briſtol, and other great towns, are acquainted with the characters and commerce of all the tradeſmen in the kingdom: they know whether their buſineſs is ſuch as that they may be ſafely truſted with goods, if induſtry, and all other requiſites for thriving in trade, are obſerved in their affairs.</p>
            <p>Thus the Quakers in the leſſer towns and cities of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland are ſpies on the actions of the inhabitants, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their ſect from loſſes in trade. And for this reaſon they endeavour to eſtabliſh one of that perſuaſion in every town, if there are none already, who may bring annual intelligence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:009839_0004_0F7A5035B61FAEB0"/>Singularity to moſt people's apprehenſion ſtands in the place of merit; a gimcrack in ſhell-philoſophy will lay out twenty guineas for a ſhell that is ſingular, and without a fellow, though ugly and ill ſhapen; at the ſame time he will not give a farthing for that which has the moſt elegant ſhape and greateſt diverſity of colours, if the ſpecies is nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous. Thus it is not beauty, but ſingularity which makes it eſteemed.</p>
            <p>It is the ſame thing amongst men; a Quaker with his ſingularity of dreſs, ſelf-ſufficient behaviour, laconic ſtyle, and air of riches, the laſt of which he never fails to inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate to all his cuſtomers, catches the eyes of tradeſmen in the country; the apparent probity and power of ſelling cheap becauſe wealthy, create him buſineſs; men in the country are deſirous of talking with ſuch a man, and thus deal with him from that ſingularity in him, and that whimſical diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in themſelves.</p>
            <p>The Quakers are extremely punctual and honeſt in trifles, conſcious that men wear out their characters before they make their fortune, who proceed otherwiſe in trades where riches are gotten by degrees.</p>
            <p>But, in matters of conſequence, the right of the thing is not the queſtion; the power of obtaining it by artifice is the only object to be conſidered; and, if a fortune can be made at once, there is little heſitation about the manner how.</p>
            <p>Is it not a little ſurpriſing, that a ſet of men of ſuch prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples as the Quakers profeſs, could be ſuffered to take root in any nation? notwithſtanding they have covered all the political maxims which they adopt, by the veil of religion. In the laſt rebellion which happened in England, they openly avowed that their principles would not allow them to oppoſe it. This was nothing to be remarked in a Quaker, and drew no ſarcaſm on the ſect: yet a man of the eſtabliſhed church would have been ſtigmatized for a Jacobite, that had declared any thing like this.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:009839_0005_0F7A50363A0D4C30"/>Their religion, it ſeems, will not ſuffer them to bear arms, What can be more ridiculous than this principle, to a man who knows human nature, except the people who indulge them in this humour?</p>
            <p>What right have any ſet of men to the protection of a government in times of peace, who will not aſſiſt with every power they poſſeſs to defend their country in times of war? their taxes are not greater than other peoples.</p>
            <p>Are the catholics more ridiculous in indulging monks amongst them without contributing to ſave their country by arms, than the Britons in permitting a ſect amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who openly avow that their religion will not ſuffer them to defend their country?</p>
            <p>Another indulgence their obſtinacy has procured them is this; they are ſuffered to affirm before a magiſtrate that which all other ſubjects of this crown are obliged to depoſe upon oath on the Evangeliſts. In order to obſerve the effect of this ſufferance, I have frequently attended trials where theſe people have been witneſſes, and thro' the whole courſe of my obſervation I have never found them give an explicit anſwer when it could make againſt their friends; nay, the chicanery and ſearch of the council could not draw an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer which was not filled with ambiguities.</p>
            <p>Their cauſe of demanding this privilege is the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing reaſon for its not being allowed them; it is evident they imagine that there is ſomething more obligatory, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and binding in an oath, than in an affirmation: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſince all the individuals of a nation ought to be under the ſame influence and apprehenſion in the adminiſtration of an oath, it was extremely ill underſtood to grant this liberty of affirmation to any ſet of men whatever. It is a road that leads to injuſtice; it is injuſtice itſelf, that one man ſhould be ſubjected to the terrors of eternal puniſhment, for the breach of that which another only conceives as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of a common nature.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:009839_0006_0F7A5036ACB25E18"/>That the legiſlature and the Quakers themſelves conceive an affirmation to be of an inferior obligation on the perſon who takes it, to that of an oath, is certain: no man what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever crime he is guilty of, can be executed on the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Quaker; and no Quaker has refuſed taking his oath to the execution of one that has rouſed his righteous ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, by robbing him. Thus the legiſlature thinks it an indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and not equally obligatory, by making this difference in caſes of life and death.</p>
            <p>The Quaker who takes the common oaths of the country, in caſes of being robbed, cannot at other times plead con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience againſt it with juſtice; becauſe either his conſcience admits of doing what it knows to be wrong on theſe occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or he ſcreens himſelf from what he thinks to be right in others, and has no real exception againſt.</p>
            <p>For theſe reaſons if he is ſuffered to take his affirmation in caſes of property, he ſhould not be indulged to take his oath in thoſe of life and death. He ought to adhere to his conſcience throughout, and not change the nature of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation as his intereſt and inclination permit him. In truth, it is a weakneſs to excuſe a ſet of men from oaths in thoſe inſtances, where all others of the kingdom are oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to take them.</p>
            <p>Such are the Quakers: I leave you to decide if they are that ſimple primitive people which Voltaire and abbé le Bland have told you; have they not found means to obtain advantages which ſavour of refined cunning, and ſecure themſelves in ſafety behind the maſk of religion whilſt the nation is fighting their battles?</p>
            <p>The celebrated ſyſtem of P***, which has been ſo much praiſed and for ſo little reaſon, is abſolutely impracticable amongst men: indeed it is eaſy to preſerve peace with the Indians, who are purchaſed by ſmall preſents to continue it; but can they buy off the French, who are preparing to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe their dominions in America? will the ſpirit of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:009839_0007_0F7A50397AEC9840"/>
ſerve them in that caſe? and what has been ſaid with reſpect to their indulging all religions amongst them, is not true, the catholics are excepted: the ill effects of a general naturalization is ſenſibly felt amongst them, the Germans being at preſent ſo numerous that they preſerve their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, laws, education, and intereſt ſeperate, which is no ſmall inconveniency to the country; and would as probably live under a French, as an Engliſh government.</p>
