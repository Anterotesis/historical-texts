         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>IF any ſhould ſay of me, as Dr. Mayhew ſaid of Mr. John Cleveland, viz. "An obſcure perſon, of little note," I have only to ſay, that thereby I have greatly the advantage. The low trees in the valleys, are not ſo expoſed to winds, and hurricanes, as the tall trees on the mountains.</p>
            <p>If any ſhould ſay, that the following performance, is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>correct, inelegant, homely piece, I ſhall only ſay, that a wiſe man never deſpiſes wholeſome food, becauſe it is ſerved up in an homely diſh. Such as it is, I venture to ſend it forth for thy careful peruſal: And deſire nothing more of thee, than that thou ſhouldeſt impartially, and candidly, compare what Mr. Foſter delivered, and what I have ſaid againſt it, with the word of God; and as truth turns the ſcale in thy mind, ſo let thy practice be conformable thereto.</p>
            <p>Miſtakes in the effentials of religion while in this life, may prove fatal to us in the world to come. Therefore, it is of the higheſt concern, that we dig deep, and lay our foundation upon a rock; even the rock Chriſt Jeſus: And not truſt to our doing much towards our own ſalvation; that if ever we are aved, we muſt work it out. And it will be but a cold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, to graceleſs church-members, when they ſhall cry, Lord, Lord, we have eat, and drank, in thy preſence, &amp;c. And he ſhall ſay unto them, Depart from me, I never knew you, ye workers of iniquity.</p>

            <head>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE CALLED STANDING CHURCHES, AND THOSE CALLED STRICT CONGREGATIONALISTS, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>IT has been thought by many, that diſputes in matters of religion, have been hurtful thereto; and from thence have rejected all diſputes in religious affairs. Although, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that many controverſies in religious affairs, where maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery has been ſought, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> tended much to deſtroy vital piety, and godlineſs; yet, I believe, that many controverſies that have been in the chriſtian church, have tended greatly to clear ſome truths, that have been in the chriſtian church, and hath made them appear more bright and glorious, than ever they would as yet, if they had never been diſputed. As for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, Atheiſm, and Deiſm, that have been advanced in the world, have produced arguments againſt them, that have made the being of God, and the truth of divine revelation, appear in a very glorious light. And ſo it has been, reſpecting how much ſinners can do towards their ſalvation by works of their own: And alſo who have right to church memberſhip, and the ſpecial ordinances of the goſpel.</p>
            <p>Having had opportunity to read a ſenmon, and a charge, delivered by Mr. Iſaac Foſter, and the right hand of fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, delivered by Mr. Ruffel, at the ordination of Mr. Emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Foſter, in Killingly, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> ſociety, 22d day of January, A. D. 1778; I thought there was a fit opportunity preſented, to anſwer a queſtion that has been aſked by many, in theſe late years, viz. What is the difference, between thoſe called Standing Churches, and thoſe called Separates, (or a the law of this State hath termed them, Strict Congregationaliſts?) 
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:043597_0004_101D5A510833B370"/>
And this I ſhall attempt, by making ſome remarks upon ſaid ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mon, charge, and right-hand of fellowſhip; and then give the reader a ſhort account, of the ſentiments of the ſeparate churches, ſo far as it reſpects gathering churches, and church government; by which the difference may be ſeen, and ſo people will need to aſk the queſtion no more. And,</p>
            <p>Firſt. With reſpect to ſaid ſermon, I ſhall only remark the deficiency in it. The text laid a proper foundation, to have ſhewn, how miniſters of Chriſt, come by the word of the Lord that they a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e to preach, or ſpeak to the people; but this is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely neglected, and only a few hints given, how the faithful preacher, will preach faithfully: And ſo people are left in the dark, as to what makes a goſpel miniſter; whether it is Chriſt, or human learning, or both, or whether it is Pope, Biſhop, Preſbytery, or Aſſociation. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, I ſhall take notice and conſider ſome things hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out by Mr. F. in his charge to his ſon. <q>Always oppoſe in your preaching, (faith he) that wicked, abominable opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that prevails in the country at this day, viz. That the unregenerate can do nothing but ſin;—nothing that will, in the leaſt, forward their eternal ſalvation: That all their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours can only aggravate guilt.</q> This then is what he calls wicked and abominable. But let us examine what he calls wicked and abominable, and ſee if they are not ſome of the great truths of God, revealed in his word to loſt ſinners. Chriſt hath told us, that, <q>a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit; neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.</q> The apoſtle faith, <q>The carnal mind, is enmity againſt God, is not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to his law, neither indeed can be.</q> Further, God hath ſaid of man, that, <q>Every imagination of the thoughts of his heart, was only evil continually.</q> I know of no medium, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a ſtate of nature, and a ſtate of grace; — between a ſtate of entire enmity againſt God, and a ſtate of reconciliation with God. An unregenerate perſon, is in a ſtate of depraved na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, at enmity with God, every part, power, and faculty of his ſoul, fixt againſt God, and in oppoſition to his law. And i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> impoſſible that he can perform one act of obedience out of love to God; and love to God is what he requires, of all ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional 
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:043597_0005_101D5A52A4E121B0"/>
beings, in order to their ſervices being acceptable to him. And is it poſſible that a child of the devil, and enemy of God, can do any thing but ſin againſt God? We are told in God's word, that their plowing is ſin, and their ſacrifices an abomination. But Mr. F. hath implicitly charged his ſon, to tell ſinner, that they can do ſome hing beſides ſin; that is, that they can perform ſome holy actions: For there is no me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium between ſin, and holineſs. Chriſt hath determined the point, that a corrupt tree cannot bring forth good fruit. And therefore, he hath charged his ſon, to preach directly againſt the word of God. I do not mean to be underſtood, that there is no actions done by ſinners, that are conſidered abſtractly in themſelves, but what is ſin; far from it: But then conſidered, as the ſinners acts, they are all wrapt up in ſin. This was the caſe with Jehu, he did right in executing God's wrath, upon the houſe of Ahab: And yet God declared by the prophet, that the days ſhould come, when he would avenge the blood of Jezreel, upon the houſe of Jehu. And why? Becauſe, Jehu did not act from a principle of love to God; but with a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous mind; and therefore it was all ſin in him. Hear what that great divine, Mr. Boſton, hath ſaid to this point; his words are theſe, <q>Object. But God is a merciful God, and he knows we are not able to anſwer theſe demands; we hope therefore to be ſaved if do as well as we can, and keep the commands as well as we are able. Anſ. Though thou art able to do many things, thou art not able to do one thing aright; thou canſt do nothing acceptable to God: John xv 5. Without me you can do nothing. An unrenewed man, as thou art, can do nothing but ſin, as we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready evinced. Thy beſt actions are ſin, and ſo they increaſe thy debt to juſtice.</q> Dr. Gill, in his ſermon upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate of the church, faith, <q>There is no good thing in unregenerate men, and therefore no good thing can come out of them; they have no true knowledge of that which is good, and much leſs to do it; they have no inclination or deſire, nay, an averſion to it; they have no free will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, nor power to perform; it may as reaſonably be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thſtles, as good 
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:043597_0006_101D5A55475C6640"/>
works to be done by an evil man; a wicked man is to every good work reprobate and unfit. A man muſt firſt be a good man before he can do good works; men begin at the wrong end, when they propoſe to do good works, in order to make themſelves good men; the firſt concern ſhould be to have a good work of grace upon the heart, which is the Lord's work; the tree muſt firſt be made good, ere the fruit will be good.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now if what has been ſaid, will ſtand for truth, as it moſt certainly will, then it will determine the two next particulars. That ſinners can do nothing, that will forward their eternal ſalvation: That all their endeavours can only aggravate guilt. For how is it poſſible, if the unregenerate can do nothing but ſin, that it ſhould be otherwiſe? It is only increaſing their debt to juſtice.</p>
            <p>Further, Mr. F. charges his ſon to tell ſinners, <q>They can do much towards their own ſalvation:—That if ever they are ſaved, they muſt work it out.</q> Now, I conceive that the ſalvation of ſinners, conſiſts in theſe two things, the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their debt to juſtice, and a real change of heart, from ſin to holineſs. Without theſe two things being done, for, and in, ſinners, they can never be ſaved. Now, where is the ſon or daughter of Adam, that can do much towards pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his debt to juſtice; or changing his heart, from ſin to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs? If they can do much, I pray how much? Can they do half, or two thirds? If ſo, why not all, as well as much? And ſo conſequently, Chriſt is dead in vain. The word of God hath taught us, that the ſalvation of ſinners, muſt be all by works; or all by grace; there is no mixing them together. See Rom. iv. 4, 5. and chap. xi. 6. <q>Now to him that worketh, is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt. But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteouſneſs. And if by grace, then it is no more of works; otherwiſe grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then it is no more of grace; otherwiſe work is no more work.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But Mr. F. ſays, <q>According to God's gracious conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they can do much towards their own ſalvation,</q> &amp;c.

But let us inquire into this affair, and ſee how much a ſinner can do, even under the gracious conſtitution of the goſpel. The apoſtle ſums up the whole of his preaching, in thoſe few, but comprehenſive expreſſions, viz. <q>Repentance towards God; and faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</q> Now, it is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary for the ſalvation of ſinners, even under the gracious conſtitution of the goſpel, that ſinners repent, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the goſpel; and that repentance, and faith, that are of a ſaving nature, are both the work of God's ſpirit upon the ſouls of men: And they are as unable to repent, and believe the goſpel, as they are to ſatisfy the law by works of their own; for if they could do much towards repentance, and faith, of themſelves, then ſalvation would not be all by free grace, from the foundation to the top ſtone. I wonder, how much Mr. F. thinks the Epheſian believers did towards their own ſalvation, that the apoſtle faith, were dead in treſpaſſes and ſins; and that it was God that quickened them; and that it was by grace they were ſaved, through faith, and that not of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but it was the gift of God. The bible hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> told ſinners, that they can do much towards their own ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but the reverſe, that it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runeth, but of God, that ſheweth mercy. And that it is God, that muſt work in us both to will, and to do, or we never ſhall be ſaved. See the opinion of the Aſſembly of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines at Weſtminſter, upon this point. Conſiſs. chap. IX. fect. III. <q>Man by his fall, into a ſtate of ſin, hath wholly loſt all ability of will, to any ſpiritual good, accompanying ſalvation; ſo as a natural man, being altogether averſe from that good, and dead in ſin, is not able by his own ſtrength, to convert himſelf, or to prepare himſelf thereunto.</q> Thus, I think Mr. F's. opinion, is not ſcriptural, nor calviniſtical; but a motley mixture of works and grace, and contrary to the opinion of the moſt found orthodox Divines, that have wrote upon the ſubject.</p>
            <p>Mr F. ſeems to inſinuate, as if the opinion he oppoſes, is ſome new opinion, that is prevailing in the country at this day. But he is miſtaken: It is the good old opinion, that has been held ever ſince there was a church on earth. Nor will I ſay, 
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:043597_0008_101D5A598E11BEE0"/>
that his opinion is a new opinion, though I am ſorry to ſee it prevailing in the country, at this day. It is as old as Caln's day, he attempted to do <hi>much</hi> towards his own ſalvation, by bringing the product of his own labour, an offering, to appeaſe an offended Deity; and it was as good an offering, as any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate perſon ever brought to God ſince.</p>
            <p>Mr. F. charges his ſon, to <q>ſtop the mouths of theſe unruly and vain talkers and deceivers.</q> But pray, who are theſe vain, and unruly talkers, who muſt have their mouths ſtopt? Why, horrid to think! they are Chriſt, and his apoſtles, and prophets; and not only ſo, but that venerable Aſſembly of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines at Weſtminſter, with a cloud of calviniſt writers. But he has ſet his ſon an hard toſk, that he never will accompliſh in this world, and I am ſure he will be of a different opinion from his father, when he arrives at the world to come.</p>
            <p>There is one thing more, that Mr. F. calls a wicked opinion, viz. <q>That the unregenerate can do nothing that has any more tendency to holineſs, than the exerciſe of luſt.</q> Which is an opinion I never heard of before, in them terms, and therefore I ſhall leave it as I found it.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, Mr. F. has told his ſon, that, <q>Baptiſm is the only badge of church memberſhip, appointed by Chriſt.</q> And from thence has directed him, <q>to baptize all thoſe chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that are born of baptized parents, or whoſe anceſtors were in covenant with God.</q> Upon which I would ſay, that although I am fully perſuaded in the doctrine of houſhold baptiſm, yet I am very different in my opinion from Mr. F. in what he has ſaid.</p>
            <p>Firſt, In what he has ſaid reſpecting baptiſm's being the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly badge of church memberſhip.—As the word <hi>baage</hi> ſignifies a cognizance, or coat of arms, and as cognizance ſignifies knowledge, or a privilege which a corporation has to hold a plea, &amp;c. It will follow, from Mr. F's. principle, that all baptized perſons, have a right to claim full privilege of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip in the church of Chriſt: Or in other words, that they are members of the viſible church. Baptiſm I allow to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to memberſhip in the viſible church; but not the only badge of church memberſhip. Is a perſon baptized in the 
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:043597_0009_101D5A5B1DCA2110"/>
church of Rome, known to be a member of the church of Chriſt? Are children baptized in the half-way covenant, known to be members of the church of Chriſt? Surely, they are not more in the church, than their parents were which got them baptized; which were but half-way in. Suppoſe a Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh prieſt had wandered from home, and got among the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abites, and Amorites, and had fallen to circumciſing their children: Would they thereby be known to be members of the viſible church? Are all thoſe perſons baptized by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate and Baptiſt miniſters, cognized members of the viſible church? Surely Mr. F. won't allow it. Neither do I think that he believes his own aſſertion. It would be difficult to prove from the bible, that the primary deſign of the inſtitution of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, or baptiſm, was to be the only badge of church memberſhip; or even to be a badge of church memberſhip to all upon whom them ordinances were adminiſtered. Dr. Owen ſaith, that in order to our being known to be members of Chriſt's viſible church, it is neceſſary, <q>That every man's own voluntary conſent, and ſubmiſſion to the ordinances of Chriſt in that church whereunto he is joined, is required for his union therewith, and fellowſhip therein.</q> If baptiſm is the only badge, by which the church of Chriſt, and its mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, are known; then the Proteſtant church of Scotland long ago, were miſtaken in their notes, by which the church of Chriſt is known; which they avow, and affirm to be, <q>Firſt, The true preaching of the word of God—Secondly, The right adminiſtration of the ſacraments of Chriſt Jeſus— Thirdly, Eccleſiaſtical diſcipline, uprightly miniſtred, as God's word preſcribeth; whereby vice is repreſſed, and virtue nouriſhed.</q> But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, If what Mr. F. has ſaid, <q>That all thoſe chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that are born of baptized parents, or whoſe anceſters were in covenant with God,</q> are to be baptized, then it will follow, that there is not a perſon on earth, of the human race, but what are proper ſubjects of baptiſm. If we may go back four generations, I ſee not why we may not go back a thouſand generations; and as all men deſcended from pious Noah, that was in covenant with God, ſo all men have an equal right to baptiſm. I ſuppoſe, that it was upon this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, that the Spaniſh miſſionaries drove the Mexico Indians, 
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:043597_0010_101D5A5D713E4ED8"/>
ſword in hand, into the water, by thouſands in a drove, and baptized them; or declared them to be baptized—And it ſeems by the manner of Mr. F.'s delivering himſelf to his ſon, in this affair, as if he intended he ſhould baptize all he could lay hands upon, willing or unwilling, aſked or unaſked. But as his opinion in his affair has no foundation in the word of God, and as it has been ſo ſully refuted, by the learned Mr. Boſton, it will be needleſs for me to add.</p>
            <p>I proceed, in the next place, to take notice, and conſider, thoſe words in the charge. <q>Ever reject that church-deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing opinion, that makes grace a term of communion in the viſible church; which opinion has no foot-ſteps in the word of God, nor was ever known in the church, till that man of ſin aroſe, whoſe coming was after the working of ſatan, with all ſigns and lying wonders.</q>
            </p>
            <p>When I firſt read theſe words, I was aſtoniſhed that any man in this day of great light, ſhould be ſo bold as to tread under foot, not only the word of God, but the opinion of great, learned, and pious divines, that have wrote upon the ſubject, and have demonſtrated from the word of God, and from the nature of the ordinance of the Lord's ſupper, the neceſſity of grace in order to a due attendance thereupon, whoſe little<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fingers were thicker in divinity, than Mr. F.'s loins. But when I came to conſider the affair, I was ſatisfied that God, in his providence, ſo ordered it, that upon ſo public an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the real ſentiments of our ſtanding churches, (as they are called) ſhould be brought out to public view. I take it for granted, that as Mr. F. was appointed by the venerable coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, that aſſiſted in the ordination, to be their mouth in giving the charge, that he ſpake their minds, eſpecially as none of them objected to what he ſaid; and therefore, it may juſtly be ſaid, that all thoſe miniſters, and churches, that aſſiſted in ſaid ordination, hold to, and profeſs, the ſame principles that Mr. F. advanced, (though I hope, and charitably believe, that not all who are called ſtanding churches, and miniſters, hold ſuch unſcriptural opinions; yet I have reaſon to fear, they are very ſcarce.) Thus, I think, that venerable council, have ingenuouſly publiſhed their ſentiments to the world, ſo that from this time forward, we need not aſk them what their ſentiments are in the above particulars.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:043597_0011_101D5A626A01D090"/>
I proceed therefore, to give ſome evidence of what I have ſaid—That Mr. F. in aſſerting, that grace is not a neceſſary term of communion in the viſible church, hath trodden under foot, not only the word of God, but the writings of ſome of the greateſt divines. And</p>
            <p>Firſt, The ſcriptures, in giving the characters of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt's viſible church, every where ſpeak the reverſe of his opinion. I ſhall name a few of them. Pſalm xv. 1, 2. Lord, who ſhall abide in thy tabernacle? Who ſhall dwell in thy holy hill? He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and ſpeaketh the truth in his heart.—Pſalm xxiv. 3, 4. Who ſhall aſcend into the hill of the Lord? And who ſhall ſtand in his holy place? He that hath clean hand and a pure heart."—From which it may be ſeen, that truth in the heart, or heart purity, was neceſſary even in the old teſtament times, for thoſe that would dwell <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> holy hill. And it always was, and always will be, a truth, that without <hi>faith</hi> it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is impoſſible to pleaſe God. So Rom. i. 7. To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be ſaints. I Cor. i. 2. Unte the church of God, which is at Corinth, to them that are ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified in Chriſt Jeſus, called to be ſaints. Eph. i. 1. To the ſaints which are at Epheſus, and to the faithful in Chriſt Jeſus. Heb. iii. 1. Wherefore holy brethren, partakers of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly calling. I Peter, ii. 5. Ye alſo as lively ſtones, are built up a ſpiritual houſe, an holy prieſthood, to offer up ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſacrifices, &amp;c. All which ſcriptures hold forth, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the neceſſity of grace, but the profeſſion of grace, by ſuch as were members of Chriſt's viſible church.—Now, with what propriety graceleſs perſons, by their own profeſſion children of the devil, can be called faints, holy brethren, and lively ſtones, is beyond me to explain. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, The ſcriptures that ſpeak of the union, between Chriſt and his church, all ſuppoſe grace as neceſſary to that union. Read the whole book of Canticles; and many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions in the prophets, as, I am married unto you, faith the Lord—Thy Maker is thy huſband, the Lord of Hoſt is his name. All which ſuppoſe, that there was not only an inward union, ſubſiſting between the Lord, and his church; but a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible covenant relation, wherein the church had profeſſed to be a chaſte virgin, eſpouſed to one huſband, even Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:043597_0012_101D5A63F2129E68"/>
So the near union between the members of Chriſt's viſible body, ſuppoſes grace as neceſſary to that union, The apoſtle compares the church of Chriſt to the human body; and tells us it was knit together in <hi>love.</hi> Now, if the ſaving grace of love, or true charity, is not neceſſary to be in the church in this world, in order for its union, and communion; or if Chriſt can be pleaſed with a graceleſs bride, in this world; I ſee not, why he may not have a church in <hi>hell,</hi> where hatred reigns, and be well pleaſed with it; eſpecially when (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Mr. F.) he ſees them have the only badge of church memberſhip. But the apoſtle hath fully ſettled the point, in telling us, <q>That our fellowſhip is with the Father, and his ſon Jeſus Chriſt; and one with another.</q> That is, that fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, or union with God, in Chriſt, is that, that lays a foundation, for our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> fellowſhip one with another, in his church in this world. Again,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The expreſs command of God forbids graceleſs memberſhip, and communion, in his viſible church. See Ezek. xliv. 7, 8, 9. In that ye have brought into my ſanctuary, ſtrangers, uncircumciſed in <hi>heart,</hi> and uncircumciſed in fleſh, to be in my <hi>ſanctuary,</hi> to pollute it. And ye have not kept the <hi>charge</hi> of my holy things. <hi>Thus ſaith the LORD,</hi> no ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, <hi>uncircumciſed in HEART,</hi> nor uncircumciſed in fleſh, ſhall <hi>enter into my ſanctuary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall, in the next place, cite ſome paſſages, out of ſome of the moſt approved divines, that ſpeak very different from Mr. F. in the point now under conſideration. <hi>Urſin,</hi> upon the queſtion, Who ought to come to the ſupper? tells us,
<q>The ſacraments are appointed, for the faithful and converted only, to ſeal the promiſes of the goſpel to them, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm their faith.</q> And further he ſaith, <q>That God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to all the uſe of the ſacraments, yet the lawful uſe, which is not without faith and repentance.</q> Mr. Boſton, in his ſermon upon the union of the body of Chriſt, faith, <q>It is not in your power to know certainly, and infallibly, who are real members of this body; but the viſible body of Chriſt, is made up of ſaints by profeſſion; and as ſuch, they admitted to the Lord's table, upon their deſire.</q> The pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Mr. Williſon, in his ſacramental catechiſm, has this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, <q>Ought all who come to the Lord's table, to have ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:043597_0013_101D5A6713B424C8"/>
grace, as neceſſary to qualify them for it? Aoſ. Yes; for without ſaving grace in the heart, we are uncapable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> faith, love, and repentance, which are neceſſary in partak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this ordinance.</q> The late Mr. Edwards, has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated the neceſſity of grace, in order for church commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, in ſuch a light, that all his opponents, have not been able to gain-ſay his arguments, from ſcripture or reaſon. The Proteſtant church of Scotland, in their confeſſion of faith, ſay,
<q>The ſupper of the Lord, we confeſs to appertain to ſuch only, as be of the houſhold of faith.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I will tranſcribe a few articles, from the confeſſion of faith, of the <hi>Vaudois</hi> churches, in the vallies of Piedmont; which churches are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally allowed to have kept neareſt to the primitive ſtandard, in the dark days of popery, of any churches in the world.
<q>Art. 24. That God hath gathered together a church in the world, for the ſalvation of mankind. Art. 25. That this church is the company of the faithful, who being elected of God, before the foundation of the world, and called by an holy vocation, are united together for to follow the word of God, believing that which he teaches, and living in his fear. Art. 30. That he has inſtituted his holy ſupper, for the nouriſhment of our ſouls, to the end, that by a true and lively faith, by the incomprehenſible virtue of the Holy Ghoſt, eating effectively his fleſh, and drinking his blood, and uniting us moſt inſeparably to Chriſt, in him, and by him, we may have eternal life.</q>—Dr. Hugh Knox, in his eſſay upon a preparation for the Lord's ſupper, faith, <q>It is evident, from the very nature and deſign of this ordinance, that it belongs only to true diſciples, and real chriſtians. It is a nouriſhing ordinance; but ſuch only can be nouriſhed who have life: Beſides, the grace of faith, love, hope, &amp;c. which are properly exerciſed in this ordinance, can only be exerciſed by real, living chriſtians. It is a ſolemn renewal of our covenant with God; but how can they renew a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which they never entered into at all? How can ſuch as are in league with the devil and their luſts, be ſaid to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into covenant with God? What ſincerity can there be in ſuch a tranſaction as this! Does it not imply the moſt inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, bare-faced mockery.</q>— 
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:043597_0014_101D5A6A482A87C8"/>
Thus, reader, you have a fair opportunity of judging for yourſelf, whether Mr. F. is not criminally guilty, in aſſerting, that grace, as a term of communion in the viſible church, has no footſteps in the word of God; but took its riſe from the man of ſin.</p>
            <p>I remember, not many years ſince, in converſation with an eminent miniſter, in one of the ſtanding churches, to have aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, how far he extended his communion? His anſwer was, to all that make the chriſtian profeſſion. I aſked him if he held communion with thoſe churches, that held, that grace was not neceſſary for memberſhip in the viſible church? His anſwer was, no, no more than he would with infidels. I aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him why? His anſwer was, becauſe they did not make the chriſtian profeſſion. And for my part, I never could find a church in all the bible, that was built upon a graceleſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, that ever God owned for his viſible church. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, with a little variation from Mr. F's. words, I would ſay, that his opinion of graceleſs communion, has no foot-ſteps in the word of God: Nor was ever known in the church, till error aroſe, and taught that works were meritorious.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that hold to graceleſs communion, make uſe of the tares, and wheat, growing together, to prove their opinion: But ſtop, reader, a minute, and pauſe upon the parable, and aſk, who ſowed them tares among the wheat? Did God ſow them; or even order them to be ſowed? No, it was the devil that ſowed them, while men ſlept. And may we not juſtly ſay, that all who plead for graceleſs communion, are <hi>advocates</hi> for the <hi>devil,</hi> and labouring to aſſiſt him in his work?</p>
            <p>I always thought, when we give a miniſter a charge, we ought to take the ſame from the word of God; but that part of Mr. F's. charge, that reſpects graceleſs communion, was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver taken from the word of God; and I am humbly of the opinion, was the firſt that ever was delivered in them terms, ſince there was a church on earth.</p>
            <p>I only add, that as there is no difference, between the church militant, and the church triumphant, as to the nature of their union, and communion, only in the degree of it, I ſee not, why graceleſs ſinners may not be as capable of holding com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the church triumphant, as with the church mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant. The church militant is ſaid to be one body, and one
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:043597_0015_101D5A6E449A0A20"/>
bread—one body and one ſpirit; and if ſinners are capable of being one body, and one bread—one body, and one ſpirit, with the ſaints in this life, why not in the life to come? Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry argument that might be brought, to bar ſinners out of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, might be uſed with equal force, to bar them out of the church on earth. I do not mean to be underſtood, that I think there ever will be a pure church on earth: But I mean, as Mr. Boſton has well ſaid, that unregenerate perſons, are no more of the body of Chriſt in reality, than a wooden leg is part of the human body. I proceed,</p>
            <p>Laſtly, To conſider thoſe words in the right-hand of fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, viz. <q>It is with real pleaſure, that we once more behold a candle lighted in this golden candle-ſtick.</q> The firſt thing that came into my mind, when I read theſe words, was, that it was calling things by wrong names. I ſuppoſe that the young gentleman, was of the ſame opinion with his honoured father, that gave him his charge; and the church over which he was ordained, was agreed with them in their principle of graceleſs communion. Now, it is beyond me to comprehend, how ſuch a church can, with propriety, be called a golden candle-ſtick. They are not ſo by profeſſion, but the reverſe; they profeſs, that gold is not neceſſary, in building the church of Chriſt: Or in other words, that grace, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> a term of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, or memberſhip among them, is a church-deſtroying opinion, that took its riſe from the man of ſin. Were I to give the right-hand of fellowſhip to a miniſter, and church, that held grace as a term of communion, a church-deſtroying opinion, it ſhould be conceived in the following terms, viz. That it is with real ſorrow of heart, that we once more behold a graceleſs miniſter, ſit in this graceleſs church, (ſo by their own profeſſion) a blind leader of the blind, that are in danger of falling into the ditch together.</p>
            <p>It may be thought by ſome, that I reject all that was ſaid in the ſermon, charge, and right-hand of fellowſhip. Far from it; many things were excellently well ſaid. But thoſe things that I have remarked upon, eſpecially in the charge, I take to be very poiſonous. Neither would I be thought to inſinuate, that there is no real ſaints in ſuch churches, as hold to grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs communion. But then they are not viſible ſaints, nor do they have communion with the churches that they belong to, 
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:043597_0016_101D5A70D6DCA940"/>
as the body of Chriſt; but live a lonely life, as to the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of ſaints, except it be in a private manner.</p>
            <p>Thus, reader, I have made thoſe remarks that I purpoſed, upon the proceedings of the foreſaid ordination. And that you may have a clear view of the difference, between thoſe miniſters, and churches, that aſſiſted in ſaid ordination, and thoſe church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es called ſtrict congregationaliſts, I will repreſent them to you, in the following manner, by ſitting the one over againſt the other.</p>

            <p n="1">I ſhall, in the next place, give a ſhort account of the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or principles, of the Separates, (ſo called) ſo far as it reſpects gathering churches, and church government.</p>
            <p n="1">I. As to a confeſſion of faith, and platform of church go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, we are generally agreed, in Weſtminſter confeſſion of faith, and Cambridge platform of church diſcipline (with ſome few exceptions.) But then, we look upon no human compoſures of divine authority, no further than they agree ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly with the word of God. And therefore we believe, that the word of God, contained in the ſcriptures, of the old, and new teſtament, to be the only uncring rule of faith and practice.</p>
            <p n="2">II. We believe, that where there is a competent number of viſible profeſſing ſaints, ſo ſituated in the providence of God, as that they can conveniently meet together; and other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of providence concurring, to make duty plain, have a good right to embody together, in a church ſtate, without any reſpect to town, or pariſh lines.</p>
            <p n="3">III. That the manner of their embodying together, ought to be, by a declaration of each other, of a work of God's grace upon their ſouls—And a ſpecial reſpect, ought alſo to be had, to the fruits of grace, that will certainly diſcover themſelves, in the life and converſation of true believers. And they ought alſo, to enter into a voluntary covenant to walk together, in all the laws, ordinances, and inſtitutions of the goſpel; and to be ſubject to the diſcipline of his kingdom. And theſe rules ought to be obſerved in all after admiſſions into their ſociety.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:043597_0018_101D5A76A2079BE0"/>
IV. We believe, that a competent number of viſible pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing ſaints, thus embodying, and covenanting together, are a viſible church of Chriſt; and have good right, full power, and lawful authority, delegated to them, by Chriſt their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful head, to act, and tranſact; every thing within themſelves, that is neceſſary to their well-being, as a church of Chriſt, viz. To admit their own members; and reject them in caſe of ſin unrepented of—To try, prove, and examine their own can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didates for the miniſtry—To chuſe them into office; and to put them into office by ordination; and to depoſe them from officeſhip, in caſe of ſin, by which their officeſhip is forfeited.</p>
            <p n="5">V. We believe, that as a church is a free voluntary ſociety, and ought to be in bondage to no man, in matters of religion; that as they have right to chuſe their own miniſters, ſo it is their duty to ſupport them, without ever making uſe of civil law for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. We believe, that brethren in church covenant together, ought never, in any ordinary caſes, to go to law with one another, while they remain in that relation together.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. We believe, that all thoſe gifts of prayer, exhortation, or preaching, that are in the church; and are approved by the church; ought to be improved in the church, in their proper place, for the edification of the church, which is the body of Chriſt in a myſtery.</p>
            <p>Thus, reader, I have gone throngh with what I propoſed, in ſhewing the difference between thoſe called Standing Churches, and thoſe called Strict Congregationaliſts, by which I think the difference may be ſeen; and ſo the queſtion may be determined in peoples minds.</p>
            <p>Therefore, I ſhall conclude this ſmall piece, by anſwering ſome objections; and making ſome reflections upon the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going remarks; and ſome addreſſes to ſeveral ſorts of perſons, or profeſſors.</p>
            <p>From what has been ſaid reſpecting ſinners being unable to do any thing but ſin, I foreſee that ſome objections will ariſe. As firſt. If ſinners be under an utter inability to do any good, how can God require it of them? &amp;c. I find this objection ſtated by Mr. Boſton, and therefore I will anſwer it in his words, viz. God made man upright, gave him a power to do every thing he ſhould require of him: This power man loſt by his own fault. We were bound to ſerve God, and to do whatſoever he commanded us, as being his creatures; and alſo, 
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:043597_0019_101D5A785AE8F638"/>
we were under the ſuperadded tie of a covenant, for that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Now, we having, by our own fault, diſabled ourſelves, ſhall God loſe his right of requiring our taſk, becauſe we have thrown away the ſtrength he gave us, where-withal to perform it? Has the creditor no right to require payment of his money, becauſe the debtor has ſquandered it away, and is not able to pay him? Truly, if God can require no more of us than w are able to do, we need no more to ſave us from <hi>wrath,</hi> but to make ourſelves unable for every duty: And ſo the deeper one is immerſed in ſin, he will be the more ſecure from <hi>wrath.</hi> Now, if God can require of men the duty they are not able to do, he can in juſtice puniſh them for not doing it, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their <hi>inability.</hi> If he has power to exact the debt of obedience, he has power alſo to caſt the inſolvent debtor into priſon, for not paying of it.</p>
            <p>I find another objection ſtated, and anſwered, by the ſame author, that I ſuppoſe will naturally ariſe, in ſome people's minds, againſt what I have ſaid, viz. Why then do you preach Chriſt to us; call us to come to him, to believe, repent, and uſe the means of ſalvation? Anſ. Becauſe it is your duty ſo to do. It is your duty to accept of Chriſt, as he is offered in the goſpel, to repent of your ſins, and to be holy in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of converſation: Theſe things are commanded you of God, and his command, not your ability, is the meaſure of your duty. Moreover, the calls, and exhortations, are the means, that God is pleaſed to make uſe of, for converting his elect, and working grace in their hearts:—Upon very good ground may we, at the command of God, who raileth the dead, go to their graves and cry in his name, <q>Awake, thou that ſleepeſt, and ariſe from the dead, and Chriſt ſhall give thee light.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But, methinks it would be well for ſinners to conſider, that their inability is a voluntary, wilful inability. It is not a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural inability, that hinders ſinners from doing their duty to God, and their neighbour: But it is a moral inability, that hinders them from doing what God requires of them. Their wills are oppoſed to the will of God: Their underſtandings are dark, and they chuſe to have them ſo. Their affectio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> are turned away from God, and ſet upon the creature more than upon the creator; and ſinners are well pleaſed that it ſhould be ſo. God requires that we give him our hearts, in all that we do; but an unregenerate ſinner, never did give his 
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:043597_0020_101D5A7F71C7E968"/>
heart to God, in any thing that ever he did; he never gave his heart to God, in one religious duty that ever he attempted to do: And the reaſon is, becauſe he does not love to give his heart to God; if he choſe to give his heart to God, it would not be in the power of men, or devils, to hinder him from it; and therefore, the whole of the blame lies at the ſinner's door. Therefore, ſinners ſhould know, that unleſs their hearts are changed by renewing grace, they never will, they never can perform one act of obedience acceptable to God. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, are far from doing <hi>much</hi> towards their own ſalvation. They muſt be born again—born from above, or they cannot ſee the kingdom of God.</p>
            <p>Perhaps ſome unregenerate ſinner will ſay, If I thought I ſhould do nothing towards my ſalvation, by all my prayers, reading the word of God, attending upon public worſhip, maintaining the goſpel, and giving alms to the needy, &amp;c. I would leave off all thoſe duties, and try no more.—Truly thou haſt brought out the affair juſt as it is; and at once has diſcovered the ſpring, and motive of all thy good doings. Not a love to God, nor to his law; but a ſeeking juſtification by thy own doings. And this is the higheſt motive, of all the doings of the unregenerate. But let me tell thee, if ever thou art converted, thou wilt be brought to cloſer work than this; thou wilt be brought to as great extremity, as Iſrael was in Egypt; that keep the law you muſt; and keep the law you cannot, till you are driven out of all ſelf-dependance, and brought to fall into the hand of God juſt as you be, a poor, wretched, helpleſs, miſerable, blind and naked creature; and will have no plea before God, but ſovereign mercy, and that only, through the merits of a crucified Redeemer.</p>
            <p>Again, from what has been ſaid, it may be ſeen, what was the grounds, and reaſons of our ſeparation from the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed churches—The three capital articles in our ſeparation from the ſtanding churches, were theſe, viz. Firſt, Their holding to, and practiſing upon, the principle of graceleſs communion.—Secondly, The miniſters, or miniſtry, ingroſſing into their hands, the power of church government, and the power of miniſter-making, or the ſole right of ordination.—Thirdly, The churches ſubmitting under the government of a certain body of eccleſiaſtical laws, made in this State. To which may be added, many things of leſſer note, as may be ſeen in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding pages.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:043597_0021_101D5A8105DD3880"/>
Moreover, from the preceding remarks, and obſervations, it may be ſeen, that the people called Separates, are, as to their profeſſion of faith, and practice, truly ſcriptural, apoſtolical, calviniſtical, and congregational.</p>
            <p>Once more, from the foregoing remarks, it may be ſeen, that the ſentiments advanced by Mr. F. and his brethren, are the ſoul, life, nerves, and ſinews of <hi>arminianiſm,</hi> and border very cloſely upon the popiſh doctrine of merit. It ſeems that their notion about the ſalvation of ſinners, is, that by the death of Chriſt, ſinners are ſet again upon their own legs, to work out their own ſalvation; or at leaſt that they can do <hi>much</hi> towards it. That ſinners can be better to-day, than they were yeſterday, and to-morrow, than they were to day, and ſo by little and little, they can grow into true chriſtians—They do not tell ſinners, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> they are totally depraved, and can never bear any fruit to God until they be born again. And that the new birth, is entirely effected by the agency of the ſpirit of God, ordinarily working by the word of truth.</p>
            <p>What remains ſhall be by way of addreſs. And, Firſt, To thoſe of my brethren of the ſtrict congregational profeſſion.</p>
            <p>Beloved brethren, It appears that the days we live in, are perilous days; perilous on various accounts; but in none more than in the overſpreading of errors, and falſe opinions, in matters of religion—The doctrine of juſtification by works, ſeems ſtrangely to inſinuate itſelf into mens minds—The doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of graceleſs communion in the church, is again openly avowed by ſome—The doctrine of univerſal redemption, is making a ſtrange, and unaccountable progreſs, in our land, of late—To which may be added, an ove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> flowing of ſin, and wickedneſs of every ſort; curſing, ſwearing, lying, cheating, ſtealing, oppreſſion, blaſph my. ſabbath breaking, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the goſpel, &amp;c. And to make the ſcene yet more dreadful, chriſtians, that ſhould b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>alt of the earth, have loſt their ſavor; wiſe and fooliſh virgins, ſlumbering and ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together; and to cloſe up the horrors of our day, God himſelf, hath in a great meaſure, withdrawn the kind influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of his good ſpirit from this people, and is leaving us to blindneſs of mind, and hardneſs of heart; and is become al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as a ſtranger in our land, except it be by the judgments of his hand. Therefore, my brethren, let me entreat you to live up to the profeſſion you have made; it is high time to awake out of ſleep, to ſtand upon your watch, to witneſs a 
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:043597_0022_101D5A86664C8CD8"/>
good confeſſion, by your lives and converſation in the midſt of a crooked and perverſe generation. Eſpecially have your minds rooted and grounded in the truth, that ſo you may not be eaſily carried about with every wind of doctrine; ſtudy the word of God; make it the man of your council; conform to its rules and precepts, in your whole conduct in the world; hold faſt the things you have been taught, knowing of whom you have learned them; labour according to your ability, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, to inſtill into the minds of thoſe you are converſant with, the pure doctrines of the goſpel; ſuch as the total de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravity of man by the fall; the neceſſity of regeneration, in order to ſeeing the kingdom of God; juſtification by faith without the deeds of the law; the abſolute unfitneſs for church communion, without ſaving grace; the eternity of hell tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, unleſs we be waſhed from our ſins, in the blood of Chriſt, &amp;c. Labour eſpecially to inſtill theſe truths, and all other truths of the goſpel, into the young and tender minds of your children, and thoſe under your immediate care; that ſo they may be a generation of God's praiſe, and not of his wrath. Let your light ſo ſhine before men, that others beholding good work, may glorify your father which is in heaven, and ye become the epiſtle of Chriſt, read and known of all men.</p>
            <p>Secondly, To thoſe miniſters, and churches, that hold to, and profeſs the principles advanced by Mr. F. in his charge to his ſon, Suffer me to propoſe the following queries: Firſt, Whether it can be proved from the word of God, that a perſon believing in his heart, that an unregenerate perſon can do ſomething beſides ſin; that is, can bear good fruit; that they can do much towards their own ſalvation; that if ever they are ſaved, they muſt work it out—can be a true believer in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt? Secondly, Whether a perſon profeſſing the above ſentiments, can be a viſible ſaint? Thirdly, Whether it can be proved from the bible, that a miniſter, believing in his heart, and profeſſing with his mouth, the above ſentiments, can be a true miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt? Or that a church, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing the above opinions, and alſo that grace, as a term of communion in the viſible church, is a church-deſtroying opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that took its riſe from the man of ſin—can be a viſible church of Chriſt?</p>
            <p>Now, if the affirmative of the above queries, cannot be proved from the word of God, then I affirm theſe two things: Firſt, That no rational being of the human race, is bound in 
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:043597_0023_101D5A8961DAAFE0"/>
duty, to hear ſuch miniſters preach; or to hold communion with ſuch churches. Secondly, That it is the indiſpenſable duty of all people, to come out from, or be ſeparate from ſuch miniſters, or churches, and touch not the unclean thing.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, As there is ſome miniſters, and churches, in this land, that are called ſtanding miniſters, and churches, that differ as widely from the opinions advanced by Mr. F. as any of the Separates do; ſome at leaſt, that I have ſome knowledge of; and I truſt, are labouring to promote the ſame intereſt of the Redeemer, that I hope the people called Separates are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in. To all ſuch, ſuffer me to propoſe the following queries: Firſt, Whether it is not the duty of chriſtians, that are agreed in the eſſentials of religion, to labour to walk toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as far as poſſibly they can; eſpecially in ſuch a day as we live in, when the united ſtrength of all true chriſtians is called for, to oppoſe that flood of corruption, both in doctrine and practice, that is ſo prevailing in our land at this day? Thirdly, Whether the difference between ſuch churches, and thoſe of us that are called ſtrict congregationaliſts, is ſo great, that it ought to bar us from a fellowſhip together, or a free communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one with another? Thirdly, Whether it is not the duty of ſuch churches, to break off their connection with ſuch churches as hold to, and practiſe upon, the principles, and opinions, advanced by Mr. F. at the aforeſaid ordination?</p>
            <p>Laſtly, To people in general, into whoſe hands theſe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers may come, eſpecially in the State of Connecticut, I ſhall only ſay, that matters of a religious nature, are things of the higheſt concern; and therefore ought not to be taken up upon truſt. The doctrine of an implicit faith, held to in the church of Rome, has long ſince been exploded by the Proteſtant churches. We ought not, therefore, to condemn others, in the thing that we allow. It is the duty of all men to ſearch the ſcriptures for themſelves; and form their opinions, and practice, in matters of religion, according to the beſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they can obtain, of the will of God, in his holy word. This is a duty, and a privilege, that all men have a right to enjoy, (provided they do not abuſe it to acts of licentiouſneſs, or diſturbance of the commonwealth) and cannot be deprived of, without an infringement upon the liberties of conference; a liberty which no man ought to give up, or can give up, without parting with his birthright; and ought to be contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, even to the loſs of all earthly things.—The principal 
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:043597_0024_101D5A8B16324BF8"/>
deſign of my writing theſe papers, is to put people upon ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſcriptures for themſelves; eſpecially in thoſe things that I have oppoſed Mr. F. in. And to let people know what the difference is, between thoſe called ſtanding churches, and thoſe called (by an act of aſſembly paſſed in May ſeſſions, 1777) ſtrict congregationaliſts; who by ſaid act are freed from taxes to ſupport the eſtabliſhed miniſtry, or meeting-houſes in this State, under certain limitations, and reſtrictions;<note place="bottom">It could have been wiſhed, that ſaid act had extended to all ſuch churches as are deſcribed in it, in their infant ſtate; and whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> they are deprived of ordained miniſters among them, by death or otherwiſe, which I think is but reaſonable. And I hope our Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Aſſembly will find it their duty, as well as their glory, ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneouſly to make that addition to ſaid act.</note> that ſo people, that are like minded with us, may take the benefit of ſaid act of aſſembly, and not be obliged to pay their money for that which is not bread, nor their labour for that which ſatisfieth not.—It is likely, that many people, when they hear the words <hi>ſtrict congregationaliſt</hi> uſed, form ſome barbarous ideas about the principle, and the profeſſors of it; but if I may uſe the term without offence, I would ſay, that it is true chriſtian whigiſm, and raiſes the noble mind of man above the low, ſervile, prieſt-ridden condition, that chriſtendom has been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſunk into, as whigiſm in a civil ſtate does the minds of men above tyranny<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore, I have given a ſhort ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of our principles, ſo far as it relates to gathering church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and church government; and hope, all my readers will carefully examine the ſame by the word of God, and form their practice according to the beſt light they can obtain therefrom.</p>
            <p>P. S. It may be thought by ſome, that in what I have ſaid, reſpecting thoſe that plead for graceleſs communion, are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate, for the devil that I have reproached that good man, Mr. Stoddard. To which I would ſay, that we look upon it no unjuſt reproach to ſay that Solomon of old was an idolater, or at leaſt introduced idolatry into Iſrael; and as his great grand-ſon Joſiah, beat down his high places; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Mr. Stod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard's grand-ſon Jonathan, hath fairly beat down what his grand-father laboured to build up! So that none ſince, have been able, to exculpate Mr. Stoddard, from being an advocate for the devil, in his pleading for graceleſs communion in the church. Although he was, perhaps, as good a man, as King Solomon of old.</p>
