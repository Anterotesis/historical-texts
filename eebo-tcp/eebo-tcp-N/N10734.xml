            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE claim in favour of the parent state to raise a revenue on the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, by parliamentary authority, has been repeatedly and unanswer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably refuted. Not a man among us, but the dependants on ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial authority, whose sentiments ever run in the same channel with their interest, wants arguments to convince him that our happy constitution entitles us to give or withhold our money, at our own dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions. In this, we are only on a f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To effect this, and by that means, to raise a revenue on the colonies, sufficient to place the minister on firm ground at home, while he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ramples on the liberty of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, both there and in America, has been the steady pursuit of the ministry for many years past. To this end, though doubtless not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent to Parliament, acts have been framed, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing duties on our trade, for the express purpose of augmenting his Majesty's revenue, and enacting forfeitures on a breach of those acts to be recovered before a ministerial tool, in an admiralty court, and against the genius of our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

How conspicuous, on this occasion, was the virtue of our colonists? We volun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Had we persisted a little longer, the duty on tea would doubtless have been ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>en off. But flattered by our want of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance, a flagitious ministry are still pursuing the design to levy that duty; not so much expecting it will afford any important augmentation of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, as to establish thereby, both in principle and precedent, that parliament can constitutionally tax us at discretion.

To execute this, the ships in our dry good trade, were interdicted the importation of tea. No expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, therefore, was left to the ministry, unwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in their endeavours for the establishment of tyranny; but that of engaging a body of men, on

To execute the scheme, a base corrupt set of monopolists, the East India company, who under the forms of law had long since engrossed to themselves the importation of that, and many other valuable articles of commerce into the British empire, lent their aid. Contrary to the principles upon which they were incorporated, and in defiance of the commercial rights of all the rest of their fellow subjects, they bec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lous design of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving their stock, by enslaving America: A number of ships loaded with that dutied article, were sent to different colonies on the continent, purely to put our virtue to the trial, and in hopes that their cargoes would be landed without opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is obvious, that had the designs of our enemies succeeded, the right of parliament to tax us, had, by our own consent, been established.— Had those teas been landed, the duties must have been paid.—The bare permission of the import would have implied our submission to the tax, And the impossibility of preventing a sale of the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, have insured the levy of that tax. Besides the ministry and the East India company were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized, in the fullest manner, of our fixed resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against receiving tea on those terms. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptiously, therefore, they undertook to execute a scheme, highly unjust in it self, and which no individual dared to attempt. Should a poll or land tax be imposed upon us by parliament, should an attempt be made to levy it, would not resistance be the necessary consequence? It certainly would; because in that case nothing but resistance could rescue us from the most abject vassalage; upon such a principle of resistance, the British constitution is founded, and to the authority of that principle do we owe the blessings of the revolution, and the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular blessing of being governed by the august house of Hanover. Now in what does the duty in ques<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion differ from a poll or land tax? Tea is become a necessary of life to us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But were it only a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by what rule or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> can a revenue be raised on the conveniencies, or even the luxuries of life, without our consent. The attempt to load us with the duty in question, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever designed, was in reality, a stab at the vitals of our liberty. The only alternative left us, is, to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose with prudence, and be free; or submit impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly and be slaves. No man, therefore, who coolly reflects on the necessary and destructive consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that must attend the unopposed importation of any commodity for consumption, subject to a duty, imposed not only without our consent, but against our express and avowed constitutiona<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t, can wonder at the conduct of our spirited brethren, the Bostonians; they were complimented with the first token of ministerial favour, by the arrival of the tea ships destined for their port—With a patience that will always do honour to their prudence, they deferred its destruction to the last moment: they demonstrated to the ship Captains and consignato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the most determined resolution against the landing of the cargoes; remonstrated in the most pressing terms, against every fruitless expectation on this head, and urged every motive to hasten the departure of the ships: But in vain; those who were entrusted with the care of the commodity, turned a deaf ear to every argument and persuasion, either vainly hoping, that it might at last be landed without opposition, or that it would be seized and sold for payment of the duty, with as much advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the proprietors, thro' the favour and conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of government, as if it had been regularly entered and the duties paid in conformity to the revenue act—Little however did they imagine, that the people would have resolution enough to sacrifice it to the liberty of their country: The hour at length arrived, when the duty was payable, or the tea confiscable; no alternative being left, it was thrown into the harbour: This was not an act of wanton and lawless sport, but of inevitable necessity. The tea could not have been landed without pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the duty. This the revenue act expressly forbade; the discharge of that duty, with the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of the people, would have been conclusive evidence, of their admission that a British Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment have a right to tax us, and the Bostonians, in that case, could with little grace have disputed that right, on the arrival of future cargoes. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore obvious, that the subject of contest, between the ministry and those injured subjects, is the parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amentary claim of taxation; a claim totally unte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable—upon any principles in our constitution, and as totally inadmissable by British subjects; the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty sacrificed, is indeed made one of the causes for punishing the Bostonians, but the supposed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, done to his Majesty's revenue, is the real and capital reason. The ability and the honour of the colonies, are sufficient to reimburse the sufferers, with interest. They will doubtless do it, when ever par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the cabinet, on receiving the account of the tragi-comedy at Boston, is easy to be conceived. While the minister enjoyed a large share of influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in the senate of one of the most powerful people under the sun, he found himself bravely opposed, by the virtuous compatriots in America. He flattered himself, nevertheless, on recollection, that terror would, on this side of the water, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce that abject servility and compliance, which in some states, is unhappily effected by corruption. In this view, at a late period in the present session, he procured an act of Parliament to be passed, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled,
"An act to discontinue, in such manner and for such time as are therein mentioned, the landing and discharging<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lading or shipping, of goods, wares, and merchandise, at the town, and within the harbour of Boston, in the province of Massachusetts Bay, in North America."

"About a sortnight ago,"

A most horrible picture of lawless anarchy, and wild confusion this! in which the masterly hands of Governor Hutchinson and the commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners, mark every figure. A person ignorant of the talents of those base informers, would naturally imagine the town of Boston to be in a state of open rebellion; and yet it is a truth, that there is not a more decent and orderly set of people in the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish empire.

Upon this passage of law history, which speaks a language vastly disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant from that in which our frequent petitions for redress of grievances have been rejected, the great oracle of the law observes that it is an excellent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to be followed whensoever <hi>any</hi> act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment shall be made in England concerning Ireland.

and the powers of legislation are inseparable. For if the authorities I have adduced are of any weight, it would seem that neither of those powers can in strict law be exercised over any people who are not actually represented. Besides, the assertion is a plain <hi>petetio principii.</hi> It takes for granted the very point in dispute, as far as concerns America. In Britain the same identical people are the subjects both of legislation and taxation, and are actually represented in the exercise of both powers. In that country, this circumstance renders the two powers inseparable; but will it follow that they are so considered in the abstract<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and under all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances? Does not the assertion prove too much for our adversaries?

               </gap>h our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, with unspiring calumny, charge upon us. The truth is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that by the antient consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of England, the assent of the subject was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, in the formation of every law, whether for the police, the distribution of justice, or the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of government. Since the annexation of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and the colonies to the imperial crown of the realm, a new combination of circumstances hath arisen, which makes a relaxation of the rigid rule of law absolutely necessary, yet as little as may be, and with a due attention to the antient rights of Englishmen. The empire is no longer one integral, but consists of many distinct parts, having their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective different, and sometimes jarring, interests. Hence arises the necessity of binding the empire to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by one superintending great council. But the authority of this council over all the parts of the empire, aggregately considered, can only be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised in cases of extreme necessity, and to prevent a disunion in the regulation of our clashing inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests in commerce, * and in controlling the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of contrariety in our general system or law; it is only necessary, and can therefore be constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally exercised only in those cases. To this every wise American will most cheerfully submit Every further, and of course unnecessary extent of it, I hope as it is our duty, it will ever be our principle, by all just and prudent measures to oppose.</p>
            <p>The act in question<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after reciting the impossibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of carrying on commerce safely, and collecting his Majesty's duties at Boston, absolutely shuts up the port against all imports but the necessaries of life and the Kings stores, and against all exports whatsoever; transfers the seat of commerce and the customs, to Salem, an inferior town of the colony; and inforces its own execution, with the most severe penalties and forfeitures. Nay to cut off their most distant prospect, of any commercial intercourse with the rest of the world, it is rendered highly penal, for any ships to be found at anchor in, or hovering within a league of Boston bay. And any of the King's sea officers, and those of his customs, are entrusted with the most extraordinary power of compelling such ships, even by force, to such stations <hi>as the officer shall assign</hi>; and a six hours delay in complying with the arbitrary mandate of the petty tyrant, subjects to a forfeiture of vessel and cargo. There is indeed, in a proviso, the seeming traces of sympathy, which are totally obliterated in an instant, for while it admits their fellow subjects to supply them coastwise with <hi>fuel and victual<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It requires every vessel thus employed, to repair first to Marblehead, and there to be furnished with a cocket and a let-pass, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The very same proviso, with the like undistinguishing spirit with which the first enacting clause was dictated, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes all his Majesty's confessedly unoffending subjects from the trade of Boston, subjects their ships and vessels, lying at anchor in the port, as well as those hovering or riding at anchor, in or within a mile of the bay, to the same hardships with the inhabitants of the t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

"that the bos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton bill will be productive of a train of evils, and that they will certainly have cause to repent it."
— The seizures are directed by the act to be made by the usual sea officers, and those of his Majesty's customs; by implication to be prosecuted for in the unconstitutional admiralty courts, and condemned on the evidence of interested witnesses, privately examined, according to the usage of those courts, and without that security which a trial by jury gives the subject; and the very custom house offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, who by the act are supposed to have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured by the Bostonians, are entitled to be partakers of the spoil. How wantonly will seizures, under such circumstances, be made, when those hirelings of administration, already exasperated by supposed insults from the inhabitants, and prompted by a prospect both of gain and revenge, see very little danger of miscarriage from an unequal bench, and while the terror of treble costs is held up against the victims of their resentment and avarice! But mark the conclusion of this singular and unparalleled prohibition. By another clause it makes "void every charter party, bill of lading, and other contract relating to voyages to and from Boston, which have been entered into, and that shall be entered into, as long as the act remains in force. It is easy to conceive that many hundreds of voyages may thus be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed in the various parts of his majesty's domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, without the possibility of knowing the existence of the act. In consequence of this clause, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, how numerous and inevitable will the disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of such contracts be, and how ruinous to the honest unoffending sufferers?

Pennsylvanians in your turn. You are, doubtless, with a sympathetic anxiety, desirous to know when, and by what means the suffering Bostonians are to be eased of their present burthen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I answer (if we may judge from the act) never, till they submit to a worse, I mean an abject compliance with the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of an arbitrary Ministry; and of what nature this compliance must be, the act plainly points out. It declares, that
"whenever it shall be made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to his Majesty, in Privy Council, that peace and obedience to the laws shall be so far restored in the said town of Boston, that the trade of Great-Britain may safely be carried on there, and his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's customs duly collected, and his Majesty in Council shall adjudge the same to be true, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty shall and may set limits to the port of Boston, and assign, within the same, so many open places, quays, and wharfs, for the landing and lading goods as he shall think proper,"
with severe penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for landing and lading goods at any other places. But the act expressly inhibits his Majesty from thus far opening the port
"until it shall sufficiently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to him that full satisfaction hath been made by or on behalf of the inhabitants of the said town of Boston"
to the East-India Company "for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of their goods;" and until it shall be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified to his Majesty, in Council, by the Governor or Lieutenant Governor of said province, that reasonable satisfaction hath been made to the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of his Majesty's revenue, <hi>and others</hi> who suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the riots and insurrections above mentioned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the months of November and December 1773, and the month of January 1774. Before the passing of this act, the inhabitants of the town of Boston, by title derived under the charter of the colony, were in the full possession and enjoyment of their right to the whole bay and harbour of Boston, and the lands adjoining and contiguous thereto, to be used by them as their own property, in such a manner as the law of the land, before the passing of this act, permitted. In that state of things they were not limited to any wharfs or quays for landing and ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping their goods; but such places were used for that purpose, as superior conveniency pointed out. By this means many of the inhabitants of the town were induced, at a great expence, to make proper improvements for the accommodation of trade, in which probably the estates of many now chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s good subjects will probably be ruined. With respect to such persons, therefore, the punishment infl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>cted on them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in a degree, a forfeiture of their estates, the restoration of which will depend on the good pleasure of the Crown: a severe punishment; which, considering how indiscriminately it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may fall principally on the innocent— <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gain, it is evident from the act, that in the sense of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, the interruption of the trade of Great-Britain to Boston, and of the receipt of his Majesty's customs in that port<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> refers to no other matters than the destruction of the East-India Company's tea, and the loss of those duties<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the Crown, with which it was charged. It therefore follows, that in the intention of Parliament, the port is to continue shut until the inhabitants fully and explicitly submit to the importation of dutied tea, and other imposts from time to time, thus circumstanced or in other words, recognise the right of the British Parliament to tax them. Should this expedient succeed, it is evident that the submission required, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ll not be confined to Boston only, New York and Pennsyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania have already done acts which must of course draw from the British Parliament an equal degree of resentment. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. Should the other colonies decline so explicit an opposition to the principle of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary taxations on the colonies, they must of course submit to the exercise of that authority; since, whatever may be urged concerning the possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of evading those laws, by a virtuous resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, against consuming the commodity thus charged, the articles may be so varied and increased in their number, as to drive them at length to the necessity of opposing their importation, or quietly submitting to parliamentary taxations. It is, however, evident, that the Ministry are bent on the establ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>But even should his Majesty be supposed to have a discretionary power, independent of any instance in a course of trade, to judge that peace and good order, and an obedience to the laws, are so far restored as that the trade of Great-Britain may safely be carried on there, and his Majesty's customs be duly co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lected; yet, does not the act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment totally subject the liberty of trade, and in that case, and its consequences, the property of all his Majesty's subjects entirely to his mercy and discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? And does not this so far forth amount to an actual forfeiture, declared by act of Parliament? If such punishment was really due to the Bostonians indiscriminately, for the destruction of private pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, &amp; the consequential loss of certain duties to his Majesty, in one instance, why was is not declared, by authority of Parliament, in so many words, that their liberty of trade, and their property, were and should be forfeited into the hands of the Crown? Had it been so declared (though the Bostonians might then, as they now may, resort to the grace of their sovereign) yet every freeman on this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent would, in that case, doubtless, have taken the alarm, and been fired with indignation. The virtue, the honour, and the clemency of our present most gracious sovereign, are indeed greatly to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fided in; but none who have a proper sense of liberty would think of parting with that security which the law and the constitution give them, in exchange for the grace and favour of the Crown.</p>

And notwithstanding their extensive commerce and numerous manufactories, thousands of its inhabitants are scarcely above perishing thro' want. The colonies annually consume near a third part of their manufactures; and of their imports to a very great amount. A total stop to such consumption must in a few months fill that island with bankrupts and beggars, and cover its face with the utmost distress and desolation.

By these means the mother country will be brought back to the constitutional and just standard of her supremacy, consisting in her power to regulate the trade of the empire, in all its various discordant parts, and superintend the whole political fabrick; to prevent those changes which may work a disunion, and of course a disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the grand machine. In this seat of supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, every wise, every virtuous American wishes to see her so securely placed, that she may consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutionally sway her sceptre over her American children to the end of the world.</p>
            <p>It is true that those means which are necessary for our relief, will be peculiarly mischievous to our brethren in Great Britain. But the mischief will not lie at our doors. We shall doubtless heartily lament their distresses; but it is not our duty to prevent them by resigning our liberties. They have it in their power to command redress. Let them in one body apply to the crown, not thro' a minister, but in person, and with respectful decency. Let them assault the royal and clement ear, with their cries and complaints —He will doubtless interpose for their and our relief; let the whole body of British electors instruct their representatives, against the evils under which the whole empire groans; let them behold and lament the dreadful consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of bribery, and let them resolve for the future, to be incorruptably virtuous.</p>
            <p>Arts, my dear friends, the most malignant and poisonous to your liberties will doubtless be prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised by dirty hirelings and base dependants on this side of the water, to divert you from the glorious resolution, I have mentioned. To the soft persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of such, turn a deaf ear, <hi>charm they ever so sweetly.</hi> If you do not, they will allure you, and thro' your ears (can you bear the piercing thought?) your dear, your unoffending posterity, in all ages to come, into the most abject and disgraceful slavery.</p>
            <p>Why would you be persuaded to leave a duty to be performed by your descendants, which you owe to yourselves, to them, to the world? Why re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to extend the sacred barrier of virtuous liberty, that the nations of the earth may admire it, and admiring catch the noble ardor of freemen? Why leave to your children to do what you can better atchieve for yourselves and for them? You are all anxious to make by the sweat of your brows, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable inheritances for them; but can you leave them a better, a more inestimable inheritance on this side of eternity, than that liberty to which the all wise, the all bountiful author of universal nature has entitled them, by making them rational creatures? Consider then if you devolve the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous task on them, you discourage them by your example. You establish against them a powerful

precedent, by your abject cession of your liberty. Born in less happy times, totally ignorant of the experimental sweets of virtuous freedom, they will not be so strongly impressed by those powerful mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to purchase it, as you are to secure it. You know its true value; they will be ignorant of it. Besides, freemen are naturally active, slaves as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally inactive. In this view, those who are to fill your places, will not enjoy that vigour which you possess, to shake off the chains of slavery.</p>

            <p>Moreover you should do every thing in your power to encourage your brethren in New England. The Bostonians are already, by being foremost in the struggle, secluded from all commerce; the others stand ready to shut up their ports, and with impatient eyes they all look to the westward for proper countenance and support. The cause is a common cause; why should we not be seen active in it? Can you expect that they alone should do the whole work? Why will you put even their singular virtue to an unnecessary trial?

            <p>You, my fellow citizens, are inhabitants of the metropolis of this colony; you have appointed a committee of fifty one persons, with an indetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate power to correspond with the neighbouring colonies: As far as you have enabled them, and prudence would permit, they have executed their trust—They have, among other things, informed our brethren the Bostonians, that the late alarming measures, relative to that antient and respectable town, which has so long been the seat of freedom, fill our inhabitants with inexpressible concern—That they consider their cause as the common cause; and that to the redress of their injuries it is equally our duty and our interest to contribute; that we think them justly entitled to the thanks of their sister colonies, for asking their advice, in a case of such extensive consequence; that as the cause is general, and concerns the whole continent, they conclude that a congress of deputies, from the colonies in general, is of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The committee, while their duty remained undefined, could not possibly go farther. It would be leaving too great a hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship on them, to exact their continuance of so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary a correspondence, without a public and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press declaration of our sentiments, on a subject of such infinite importance. This will serve not only as a guide to our committee, who seem fully dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to speak the language of the inhabitants, but will afford our sister colonies the most conclusive evidence of our ardour and sincerity in the common cause.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hew the propriety of subjecting our exports to some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per restraints. With respect to those to Great-Britain, besides the remittance of money, they usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally consist in lumber, iron, wheat, flower, pot and pearl ashes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and other articles, which are absolutely necessary to her. The article of tobacco, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly a staple of Virginia and Maryland, affords not only a very considerable revenue to the Crown, but yields great profits to the British merchants in their trade with foreign nations. Our West-India colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies are wholly indebted to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> this continent for the materials for transporting their rum and sugars to the different parts of the British empire. On those articles depend no inconsiderable part of the trade and revenue of the mother country, as well as the whole wealth of our brethern the West-Indians. It is well known that they have near eighty members in Parliament, who, as long experience demonstrates, are unanimously in the Interest of the Ministry. While, therefore, unhappy necessity obliges us to distress our mother country by discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing both our exports and imports in relation to her, the same necessity requires us to suspend our supply of staves, hoops, and heading, and all kinds of lumber, without which the manufacturers of sugar and rum must stop, and the whole weight of the West-India interest in the House of Commons by that means be forced into the scale on the side of America, making at the same time a proper al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance for the shipping of such quantities of those articles only as will enable us to support our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with the foreign islands. Should it be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected that such an extensive suspension of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce will excite Parliament to deprive us of our foreign trade, or shut up our port: To this it may be answered, that before such a measure can possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly take place, the necessities of the mother country will compel our relief. Besides, for the reasons al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready assigned, the interdiction of that commerce will effectually debar us of the profits we derive in a course of trade with France, Spain, Portugal, and the ports of the Mediterranean in general; all which ultimately center in our mother country. And as this will increase her distresses, by the una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable impossibility which it will occasion, of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the immense load of our British debt already contracted, there is no rea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>on to fear she will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive us of our foreign trade, or shut up our port. The proposed resolves are as follows:</p>
            <p n="1">1st. That it is the clear and unquestionable right of his Majesty's subjects in these colonies to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from all taxes but those imposed on them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectively, in their respective legislatures, with the consent of their own representatives.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. That therefore all taxes and duties imposed on the persons, estates, trade, or occupations of his Majesty's subjects in the colonies, by authority of Parliament, and for the purpose of raising a revenue, are totally unconstitutional, and a manifest infringement of the most essential rights of British subjects.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. That therefore the act of Parliament com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the revenue act, and all other acts of Parliament now in being, whereby the trade of the colonies is subjected to duties for the purpose afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, are altogether unconstitutional, and in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves absolutely null and void.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. That the exercise of authority by the British Parliament, in imposing taxes and duties on the colonies, for the purpose aforesaid, will render their representations in Assembly useless and unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary in that most essential department.</p>
            <p n="5">5thly. That the act of Parliament lately passed for shutting up the port of Boston, or any other means or device under colour or pretext of law, to compel them, or any other of his Majesty's Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can subjects, to submit to parliamentary taxations, are subversive of their just and constitutional liberty.</p>
            <p n="6">6thly. Resolved, that we do fully approve of the measures hitherto pursued by our brethren the Bos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonians, for relieving themselves from the aforesaid burthens, and that they are now suffering in the common cause of British America.</p>
            <p n="7">7thly. That therefore it is the indispensible duty of every colony on this continent to unite, and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually exert themselves for the repeal of the said act for shutting up the port of Boston, and every other act of Parliament whereby they are taxed for raising a revenue.</p>
            <p n="8">8thly. That it is the opinion of this city, that a joint resolution of the principal colonies on thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, totally to cease from all exports to, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports from Great Britain, and all supplies of lumber to the sugar colonies in America, with an exception only of such as will be necessary to bring home the returns of North American cargoes, from the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign sugar colonies, will be the only effectual means to secure a repeal of all the said acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
            <p n="9">
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:013605_0013_0F905B9D028C2538"/>9thly. That therefore the inhabitants of this city, hereby declare to the world, their readiness cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to enter into a general association for that purpose.</p>
            <p n="10">10thly. That to this end a general congress of deputies be convened, from the colonies on this continent, without delay, to resolve on the most effectual means for defending their common rights and liberties, at this most critical and alarming cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis.</p>
            <p>And lastly, that the committee of correspondence for this city, do immediately communicate these resolves to our brethren in the other colonies, and do their utmost endeavours to accelerate the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of such congress.</p>
            <p>May the infinitely wise and beneficent sovereign of the universe, in this most critical conjuncture, be the gracious director of all our counsels, and the unerring conductor of all our ways.—May <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>oacher of new-fangled doctrines, contrary to the laws of this kingdom, and subversive of the rights of Parliament. My Lords, this is a heavy charge, but more so when made against one stationed as I am in both capacities, as Peer and Judge, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender of the law, and constitution. When I spoke last, I was indeed replied to, but not answered. In the intermediate time many things have been said. As I was not present, I must now beg leave to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer such as have come to my knowledge. As the affair is of the utmost importance, and in its conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences may involve the fate of kingdoms, I took the strictest review of my arguments; I re-examined all my authorities; fully determined, if I found myself mistaken, publicly to own my mistake, and give up my opinion; but my searches have more and more convinced me that the British Parliament have no right to tax the Americans. I shall no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A constitution grounded on the eternal and immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble laws of nature; a constitution whose founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and centre is liberty, which sends liberty to every subject that is or may happen to be within any part of its ample circumference. Nor, my Lords, is the doctrine new, 'tis as old as the constitution; it grew up with it; indeed it is its support; taxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and representation are insepa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y united; God hath joined them, no British Parliament can separate them; to endeavour to do it is to stab our very vitals. Nor is this the first time this doctrine has been mentioned; seventy years ago, my Lords, a pamphlet was published, recommending the levying a parliamentary tax on one of the co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; this pamphlet was answered by two others, then much read; these totally deny the power of taxing the colonies; and why? Because the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies had no representatives in Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

               </gap>ic or private<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was given to these pamphlets; no censure passed upon them; men were not startled at the doctrine, as either new or illegal, or derogatory to the rights of Parliament. I do not mention these pamphlets by way of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but to vindicate myself from the imputation of having first br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ched this doctrine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:013605_0019_0F905BA20DF96480"/>My position is this—I repeat it—I will maintain it to my last hour—taxation and representation are inseparable This position is founded on the laws of nature; for whatever is a man's own is absolutely his own; no man hath a right to take it from him without his consent either expressed by himself or representative; whoever attempts to do it, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts an injury; whoever does it, commits a rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery; he throws down and destroys the distinction between liberty and slavery. Taxation and representation are coeval with, and essential to this constitution. I wish the maxim of Machiavel was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, that of examining a constitution, at certain periods, according to its first principles; this would correct abuses and supply defects. I with the times would bear it, and that men's minds were cool enough to enter upon such a task, and that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentative authority of this kingdom was more equally seated. I am sure some histories of late <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> have done great mischief; to endeavour to fix the era when the House of Commons began in this kingdom, is a most pernicious and destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive attempt: to fix it in an Edward's or Henry's reign is owing to the idle dreams of some whimsical, ill-judging antiquarians. But, my Lords, this is a point too important to be left to such wrong-headed people. When did the House of Commons first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin? When, my Lords? It began with that constitution; there is not a blade of grass, which, when taxed, was not taxed by the consent of the proprietor.</p>
            <p>There is a history written by one Carte, a history that many people now see through; there is another favourite history, much read and admired. I will not name the author, your Lordships must know whom I mean, and you must know from whence he pilfered his notions concerning the first beginning of the House of Commons. My Lords, I challenge any one to point out the time when any tax was laid upon any person by parliament, that person being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in parliament. The parliament laid a tax upon the palatinate of Chester, and ordered commissioners to collect it there, as commissioners were ordered to collect it in other counties; but the palatinate refused to comply, they addressed the King by petition, setting forth, that the English parliament had no right to tax them; that they had a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> of their own; that they had always taxed themselves; and therefore desired the King to order his commissioners not to proceed. My Lord, the King <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the petition; he did not declare them either seditious or rebellious, but allowed their plea, and they taxed themselves. Your Lordships may see both the petition and the King's answer, in the records in the Tower. The clergy taxed themselves; when the parliament attempted to tax them, they stoutly refused, said they were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented there, that they had a parliament of their own, which represented <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>; that they would tax themselves; they did so. Much stress has been laid upon Wales, before it was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> as it now is, as if the King, standing in the place of their former Princes of that country, raised money by his own authority: But the real fact is otherwise: for I find that, long before Wales was subdued, the nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern counties of that principality had representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and a parliament or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> had a parliament, as it now has, if your Lordships will examine the old records, you will find, that when a tax was to be laid on that country, the Irish sent over here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentatives; and the same records will inform your Lordships what wages those representatives received from their constituents. In short, my Lords, from the whole of our history, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the earliest period, you will find that taxation and representation were always united; so true are the words of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summate reasoner and politician Mr. Locke. I before alluded to his book. I have again consulted him; and, finding that he writes so applicably to the subject in hand, and so much in favour of my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, I beg your Lordships' leave to read a little of his book.—"The supreme power cannot take from any man any part of his property without his own consent:' and B. II. 130-139, particularly 140, Such are the words of this great man, and which are well worth your Lordships serious attention. His principles are drawn from the heart of our constitution, which he thoroughly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, and will last as long as that shall last; and to his immortal honour, I know not to what, under Providence, the revolution and all its happy effects are more owing than to the principles of government laid down by Mr. Locke. For these reasons, my Lords, I can never give my assent to any bill for taxing the American colonies, while they remain unrepresented; for as to the distinction of a virtual representation, it is so absurd as not to deserve an answer; I therefore pass it over with contempt. The forefathers of the Americans did not leave their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive country, and subject themselves to every danger and distress, to be reduced to a state of slavery; They did not give up their rights; they looked for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, and not for chains, from their mother coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: By her they expected to be defended in the possession of their property, and not to be deprived of it; for, should the present power <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, there is nothing which they can call their own; or, to use the words of Mr. Locke, "what property have they, in that which another may be right <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
