            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ADDRESS. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>MY Deſign in this Addreſs is to repreſent, to the People in this Country, the very great Importance of treating the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> who live among us, and upon our Borders, in a juſt, kind and charitable Manner; and that we do, by all proper Means and Methods, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to attach them to us, and to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Intereſt. This, I apprehend, is a Subject that has been too much neglected, and that greatly wants to be ſet in a clear and juſt Light. And I ſincerely wiſh that ſome Gentleman of greater Abilities and Addreſs than I can pretend to, would take it in Hand: Tho' if my weak Endeavours may be a Means of mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others to do Juſtice to a Subject of ſuch Weight, I ſhall heartily rejoice in it.</p>
            <p>That I may offer what I have to ſay in the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt conciſe Manner I can, I ſhall go into the following Method.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhall endeavour to ſhew, that it is of vaſt Importance to the <hi>Britiſh Provinces</hi> and <hi>Colonies</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> eſpecially to the <hi>Provinces</hi> of the <hi>Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts, New-York,</hi> and <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> that they be in good Terms with the <hi>Indians,</hi> and attach them to their Intereſt. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall endeavour to ſhew, by what <hi>Means</hi> this may be effected: Or what are the moſt likely Methods to bring it to paſs.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:007917_0003_102E00F54AFBFB30"/>
1. I am to ſhew, that it is of vaſt Importance, that we be in good Terms with the <hi>Natives;</hi> and that we engage them in our Intereſt. I freely grant, that the <hi>Indians,</hi> ſimply conſidered, are not of ſuch great Conſequence to us. We can ſubſiſt without them. But yet, their Trade is a conſiderable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, worthy the Care of any politick People, and managed as it might, and ought to be, would yield us great Profit. But if we conſider them with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>War,</hi> as attached to us, or to our <hi>Enemies,</hi> they are of the laſt Importance to us; for they certainly have the Ballance of Power in their Hands, and are able to turn it for or againſt us, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they ſtand affected to us. <hi>Canada,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable as it is, and from which, ſeparate from the <hi>Indians,</hi> we have little or nothing to fear, in Time of War; <hi>Canada,</hi> I ſay, would be more than a Match for us, in caſe they join with them againſt us. He muſt be a great Stranger to, and very ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of, the Circumſtances both of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> who is not ſenſible of this. Our Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are ſuch, that we cannot guard ourſelves againſt the Incurſions of ſuch Enemies in Time of War; for our <hi>Frontiers</hi> are of vaſt Extent, and border upon the adjacent Wilderneſs; which, tho' almoſt inacceſſible to us, yet is the very Element in which they delight to live. They are at Home in it. The People therefore who inhabit our Frontiers, while they follow their neceſſary Buſineſs, are expoſed to be an eaſy Prey to them; and many of them have been ſurpriz'd in their Fields and Houſes, and in a moſt barbarous Manner put to Death. A ſmall Number of <hi>Indians,</hi> encouraged and ſupported by the <hi>French</hi> (which they are ready enough to do) can eaſily keep us in a conſtant Alarm, put us to an immenſe Charge, deſtroy many, and impoveriſh more, in our expoſed Places, and not put themſelves
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:007917_0004_102E00F8A0E259A8"/>at all out of their Way; yea, find their Account in it; for as they live by Hunting, ſo where Game is moſt plenty they are beſt off: And where can they find a better Supply, than among our Cattle, Sheep, and Corn-Fields? There they live at Eaſe, diſtreſs and impoveriſh us, and the adjacent Wilderneſs is their Refuge. By retiring into it, they are ſoon out of our Reach; and long Experience has taught us how ineffectual the Meaſures we have taken for our Safety and Defence have proved.</p>
            <p>Some, I am ſenſible, will ſay, let us not be at any Coſt and Pains to gain the Friendſhip of ſuch a perfidious Crew, but let us deſtroy them all. Quickly ſaid indeed, but not ſo ſoon nor ſo eaſily effected. Thoſe Perſons who are for deſtroying them would doubtleſs ſoon do it, were they firſt bound and delivered up to them. But one Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion here is, how we ſhall get them into our Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? And another is, Whether it would be ſo hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, generous and Chriſtian-like, to take away their Lives, were that in our Power, as it would be to cultivate Friendſhip with them, and to ſeek their beſt Good? If we ſhould be ſo ſanguine as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to deſtroy them, it would doubtleſs prove a vain Attempt; and ſerve only to drive them to the <hi>French,</hi> who would be very ready to receive and protect them. If we neglect them, and take no Meaſures to engage them in our Intereſt, or to cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate Friendſhip with them, this will probably ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them indifferent to us, and diſpoſe them to hearken to the enticing Inſinuations of <hi>Romiſh</hi> Emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries; and our Situation muſt be very unhappy, when they become engaged in the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt.</p>
            <p>If it be objected, that the <hi>French</hi> have already gained a large Number of <hi>Indians</hi> to their Intereſt, and therefore if we uſe our beſt Endeavours to gain others, it will avail nothing; for thoſe who are
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:007917_0005_102E00FA3B0709C8"/>devoted to the <hi>French,</hi> will nevertheleſs diſtreſs us in Time of War. I reply,</p>
            <p>It is very true, that the <hi>French</hi> of <hi>Canada,</hi> thro' their Policy and Vigilance, have taken the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of our Neglect, and gained a large Number of the <hi>Natives</hi> to their Intereſt, and are gaining more and more every Year; and ſome even from among our own <hi>Indians.</hi> They ſpare neither Coſt nor Pains to accompliſh their Deſigns of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, being ſenſible enough how advantageous it is to them, and how injurious to us; and if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to be active, and we negligent, as in Times paſt, is it not too probable that they will, in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Time, attach to themſelves all the <hi>Indians</hi> in <hi>North-America?</hi> Does it not then concern us to uſe proper and vigorous Endeavours to prevent this apparent Miſchief, by counter-working the <hi>French?</hi> who are, I ſuppoſe, tampering with all the Tribes of <hi>North-America,</hi> to engage them in their Intereſt. And ſhould we ſucceed in our Endeavours (as it is highly probable we might, if proper Steps were taken) ſo as to engage the <hi>Five Nations,</hi> and ſome other Tribes, in hearty Friendſhip with us; and eſpecially if we ſhould beſtow ſuch Favours upon them, as would induce them to ſettle upon our Frontiers; it would in all Probability prevent the Evil ſpoken of in the Objection; for the <hi>Indians</hi> from <hi>Canada</hi> would not moleſt us, if a Number of the Natives, in hearty Friendſhip with us, were placed in our Borders. Of this we have had a very plain Proof the laſt War, in the Safety of <hi>Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> and the adjacent Places, from any Attempts of the Enemy from <hi>Canada.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Stockbridge</hi> is in the very Road of, and more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to, the <hi>Indians</hi> from <hi>Canada,</hi> than any other Place whatever; and yet we ſee that the Enemy turned off Eaſt to <hi>Connecticut-River,</hi> and Weſt to

               </gap> more expoſed, were not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted. This, ſo far as we can diſcern, was owing to a ſmall Number of <hi>Indians</hi> dwelling at <hi>Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> who are our hearty and faſt Friends; which the Enemy being ſenſible of, cared not to come within their Reach, leſt they ſhould be taken in their own Snare. And if we ſhould encourage the Settlement of other <hi>Indian</hi> Towns upon our Frontiers, where Hunting is moſt handy to them, as <hi>Stockbridge</hi> has been encouraged; ſhould we give them Townſhips of Land ſuitable for their Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, build a Meeting-Houſe and School-Houſe in each Town, and ſupport Miniſters and School-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in them; would not this convince them that we are their true Friends, and ſeek their Good? Would it not induce them to ſettle in our Borders? eſpecially thoſe of them who are deſirous that they themſelves and their Children ſhould be inſtructed? Would they not be a Guard to us in Time of War? And if, after all, we ſhould meet with ſome Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from the <hi>Indians</hi> of <hi>Canada,</hi> might it not be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually prevented, by playing our <hi>Indians</hi> upon them, as they do theirs upon us? And would not the Charge of all this be a Triſle, compared with that of defending ourſelves in Time of War? But if we neglect them, and take no Meaſures to culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Friendſhip with them, and eſpecially if we deal injuriouſly by them, ſhall we not put an Advantage into the Hands of the <hi>French</hi> (which they will not fail of improving) to engage them in their Intereſt, and to employ them againſt us in Time of War? which would prove a very great Calamity to us, if not our utter Ruin. Theſe Things conſidered, is it not of very great Importance, that we be at good Terms with the neighbouring <hi>Natives?</hi>

               </gap> with the <hi>Indians,</hi> if we would engage them in hearty Friendſhip with us.</p>
            <p>And here, in general, our Conduct towards them muſt be ſuch as ſhall make them ſenſible that we are indeed their hearty Friends; and ſuch alſo as ſhall convince them that it is their Intereſt and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to be in Friendſhip with us. Nothing ſhort of this, I apprehend, will attach them to us, ſo as to anſwer the Ends propoſed. If we often treat with them, renew the Friendſhip, and beſtow upon them large Preſents: Or, as they phraſe it, Smoke to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, brighten the Chain, or put the Brands to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to kindle up the former Fire; and yet leave Room for them to ſuppoſe that this proceeds nor from true Friendſhip, but rather from Fear of them, or from Suſpicion that they will join with our Enemies, &amp;c. this will never be ſufficient to engage them; the utmoſt we can rationally expect from it is, that they will not openly break with us, but keep up a Shew of Friendſhip, that they may have the Benefit of future Preſents at our Hands.</p>
            <p>Again, if we ſhould by any Means convince them that we are their true Friends, and yet not go into ſuch Meaſures with them as ſhould turn to their <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,</hi> they would hardly be engaged for us. As all other People are governed by <hi>Intereſt,</hi> ſo are they. And the principal Handle we can take hold of, to attach them to us by, is their <hi>Intereſt,</hi> and that would not fail of doing it. If a Tribe of <hi>Indians</hi> can ſell their Skins to us for <hi>Twenty Shillings,</hi> and buy their Blankets for <hi>Ten Shillings;</hi> they will never go to <hi>Canada</hi> where they muſt ſell their Skins for <hi>Ten Shillings,</hi> and give <hi>Twenty Shillings</hi> for a Blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket. Convince them that it is much for their Intereſt
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:007917_0008_102E01011F8922A8"/>and Advantage to be our Friends and Allies, and we need not fear but that they will be ſo. Now, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to convince them that we are truly their Friends, and that it is their Intereſt to be ours, we muſt,</p>
            <p>In the firſt Place, treat them according to the Rules of Equity and Juſtice. We muſt not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud and oppreſs them, but be honeſt and juſt in our Dealings with them.</p>
            <p>The Natives, with whom we have to do, are Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of ſo much Sagacity, that they can diſtinguiſh between juſt and injurious Treatment, as well as other Men. They are alſo as ready to reſent, and perhaps more forward to revenge Injuries, than any other People under Heaven. If therefore we treat them in an unjuſt Manner, we may rationally expect that they will be ſo far from being our Friends, that they will join with our Enemies, and ſeek Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of Revenge.</p>
            <p>It is well known, that the <hi>Indians</hi> are generally addicted to Drunkenneſs, and that when they have taſted a little Liquor, they have a ſtrong Thirſt for more, and will part with any Thing they have, for a ſufficient Quantity to make them drunk.—And is it not as well known, that we have taken the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of this their vicious Appetite, and for a few Quarts of Rum have purchaſed valuable Effects of them? Have not private Perſons thus made their Gains of them, notwithſtanding the good Laws that have been in Force to prevent it? And is not this the Manner of all private Traders, who go among their ſeveral Tribes for Gain?</p>
            <p>In our publick Dealings with them at our Truck-Houſes, where Rum has been freely ſold them, Care has been taken that they ſhould not be cheated, but that they ſhould have the full Value of what they had to ſell: An Indian therefore, who was Owner of a Pack of Beaver, Deerſkins, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:007917_0009_102E0103AEACC2D0"/>valuable Goods, could buy a large Quantity of Rum, and might get drunk perhaps ten times, or more; whereas, if he had fallen into private Hands, he muſt have contented himſelf with being drunk but once or twice. Which of theſe proves moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to the <hi>Indians</hi> in the End, I ſhall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to determine.</p>
            <p>When they are thus intoxicated, they fall out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, fight; and ſometimes kill one another, and ſome have drunk themſelves dead on the Spot. An Inſtance of each of theſe there has been, if I am rightly informed, at <hi>Fort Dummer,</hi> ſince that has been improved as a Truck-Houſe. And whether the Guilt of that Blood does not lie upon us, I leave others to judge.</p>
            <p>Now, if we treat the <hi>Natives</hi> in this Form, will they, can they, live with us? Will not the Law of Self-Preſervation oblige them to leave us, and to go where they may be better uſed? Some of the <hi>Five Nations</hi> plainly ſpeak it out, and ſay, "We cannot live with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch;</hi> they bring us ſo much Rum, that it deſtroys us; we muſt go to the <hi>French,</hi> who will let us have but little ſtrong Drink." Thus we alienate the <hi>Indians</hi> from us, and as it were oblige them to go over to the <hi>French,</hi> who are often our Enemies, and fail not to employ them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us in Time of War. And if we proceed to deal thus injuriouſly with them, what can we expect but that they will leave us, and be a ſevere Scourge to us?</p>
            <p>Tho' the <hi>Indians,</hi> are ſunk below the Dignity of human Nature, and their Luſt after Drink expoſes them to be cheated out of what little they have; yet this gives us no Right to deal unjuſtly by them. They have a natural Right to Juſtice, and may, with great Propriety, challenge it at our Hands, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we profeſs to be ſubject to the Laws of <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:007917_0010_102E010741A1A5F8"/>which teach us to do <hi>that which is altogether juſt.</hi> And we ſhould be ſo far from taking the Advantage of their Ignorance, Vice and Poverty, to defraud them of what is their juſt Right, that we ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be moved to Pity, and compaſſionate their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable State, and be <hi>Eyes to the Blind,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I am fully perſuaded, that if we were upright and juſt in all our Tranſactions with them; if our Trade with them was put into the Hands of faithful Men, who would deal juſtly by them; and if they were ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with all Neceſſaries for themſelves and Families at a moderate Price, it would not be in the Power of all the <hi>French</hi> at <hi>Canada</hi> (ſubtle as they are) to alienate them from us. The <hi>French</hi> are not upon equal Ground with us in this Affair. For their Northern Climate is much more inhoſpitable and ſevere than ours is: Their Country is not ſo productive of thoſe Fruits, which the <hi>Indians</hi> very much live upon, as ours: Nor can they afford Goods which are proper and neceſſary for the <hi>Indians</hi> at ſo cheap a Lay as we can: Therefore we can give them thoſe Advantages which <hi>Canada</hi> cannot. We can, without Damage to ourſelves, make it their Intereſt to adhere to us: And when Experience has once taught them, that their Intereſt lies with us, they will want no other Inducement to engage them to us: Yea, it will not only attach thoſe of them to us, who are not yet gone to <hi>Canada,</hi> but it will induce thoſe who are, to return to their Brethren, for the Sake of the Profit they might reap by it; eſpecially if we give them all the Advantage we can, conſiſtent with our own.</p>
            <p>As unjuſt and abuſive Treatment of the <hi>Indians</hi> tends naturally to alienate them from us, and to turn them off to the <hi>French;</hi> ſo a Series of juſt and faithful Dealing with them would be likely to attach them to us, and to make them our faſt Friends.
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:007917_0011_102E0108E10166E0"/>This again appears from the Temper and Conduct of that Part of the <hi>Tribe</hi> of the <hi>River Indians</hi> who live at <hi>Stockbridge.</hi> For tho' they were, for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Time, extremely jealous, that we had ſome ill Deſign upon them, even in the Favours they received at our Hands (a Jealouſy founded, I ſuppoſe, upon the ill Uſage the <hi>Natives</hi> have too often been the Subjects of) yet by the juſt Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they, for a Courſe of Years, have met with from the <hi>Government,</hi> from Mr. <hi>Sergeant,</hi> Mr. <hi>Woodbridge,</hi> and others, they are become our hearty Friends; willing to live or die with us, whether in Peace or War.</p>
            <p>It is very true, that in order to obtain the End propoſed, our Trade with the <hi>Indians</hi> muſt not be in private Hands. It muſt not be in the Power of every private Perſon to treat them as he pleaſes. We may upon good Grounds deſpair of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing treated with Equity and Juſtice, if every one may gratify his avaricious Temper in dealing with them. Our trade therefore muſt be of a publick Nature, and muſt be committed to the Care and Management of faithful Men: Not to ſuch as will ſeek the Service, and make Friends to procure the Poſt for them; (certain Indications of a Self-ſeeker) but Men of Uprightneſs and Integrity muſt be ſought out; ſuch, and ſuch only, muſt be truſted with Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſuch Importance: Good Inſtructions muſt be given them, which muſt be carefully adhered to.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Indian</hi> Trade at <hi>Canada</hi> was in private Hands; if every private Perſon there might deal with the <hi>Indians</hi> at Pleaſure, we might then hope that thoſe who are gone from us would ſoon return; for, in that Caſe, it is ſuppoſable enough that they would not meet with much better Uſage there than they do here; tho' it is ſcarcely ſuppoſable that they
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:007917_0012_102E010A84792FF8"/>would meet with much worſe. The <hi>French</hi> Trade with the <hi>Indians</hi> is wholly in the Hands of publick Officers, (if I am rightly informed) and a private Man, if he wants a Dear-ſkin, a Beaver-ſkin, &amp;c. is not allowed to purchaſe of an <hi>Indian,</hi> but muſt go to the publick Stores. Upon the Suppoſition that thoſe Officers are faithful, and deal juſtly by the <hi>Indians,</hi> it is ſurely a wiſe and politick Method to engage them in their Favour. And ſo long as every private Perſon in the Engliſh Government is at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to trade with them, when, and where, he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and to cheat them out of what they have, what can we expect but that they will repair to <hi>Canada,</hi> where they may be better uſed? Is it not owing to the ill Treatment they have met with from the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> that ſo many of them are gone already? And if no proper Meaſures are taken to prevent their being ill uſed, will not thoſe who are yet behind ſoon follow their Brethren? Yea, if we furniſh them with large Quantities of Rum, make them drunk, and then defraud them of what they have, do we not reduce them to a Neceſſity, either of living low and miſerable with us, or of going from us, that they may fare better? How low, how diſpirited, how miſerable and brutiſh theſe few are, who live within our Borders, is too manifeſt. And whether we, by our ill treating of them, have not contributed to their Miſery, is worthy of our ſerious Enquiry. Yea, would it not be proper for us to enquire, Whether we have not, by our Neglect and Abuſe of them, provoked Heaven to let looſe the Natives upon us, who have been one of the ſoreſt Scourges that we were ever chaſtiſed with? What Multitudes have they, in a moſt cruel Manner, murdered in our Borders? How many of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours have they led into Captivity? Some of whom have been redeemed at a very great Expence, and
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:007917_0013_102E010CC2DF5618"/>others are become either Pagans or Papiſts, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſtill in a foreign Land. And who can count the Coſt we have been at, to defend ourſelves againſt their Incurſions?</p>
            <p>If the Britiſh Government ſhould be diſpoſed, in Time to come, to ſet up and maintain a publick, honeſt and juſt Trade with the <hi>Five Nations,</hi> or any other Tribes, thereby to attach them to us, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote their true Intereſt, with other valuable Ends, that might thereby be anſwered; this Objection perhaps would ariſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That ſuch a Proceeding will be a very great Expence to the Publick, for our Trade cannot be ſafe, unleſs it be protected by a conſiderable Force. A Fort muſt be built, and a Garriſon of 50, 60, or perhaps 100 Men, with their proper Officers, muſt be maintained at each Place where the Trade is ſet up; therefore the Advantage would not countervail the Coſt. To this I reply,</p>
            <p>If ſuch Garriſons ſhould be thought neceſſary in the Places where a Trade is ſet up, to be a Guard to it, the Charge would nothing like equal that of an Indian War, which perhaps it might prevent.</p>
            <p>But further, I apprehend that the Charge of ſuch Garriſons might be ſpared; and that, inſtead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neceſſary, they would prove very injurious to the Deſign; and that it would be a very wrong Step to be taken in that Affair.</p>
            <p>All who are in any good Meaſure acquainted with the <hi>Indians</hi> know, that they are extreamly jealous, leſt any Incroachments ſhould be made upon them; and it is not ſtrange it ſhould be ſo, conſidering what has paſt over them. And if a Number of armed Men were placed among them, and Forts built for the Defence of our Trade, they would be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious that ſomething hoſtile was intended, and we ſhould not be able to remove the Suſpicion. They
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:007917_0014_102E010E5D88E9C0"/>would behold us with a jealous Eye, and perhaps take Meaſures to fruſtrate the whole Deſign.</p>
            <p>The moſt effectual Way to induce them to truſt us, is to truſt them; and they will be ready enough to protect our Trade if we deſire it, and ſhew that we confide in them to do it. And when a little Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience has taught them how advantageous ſuch a Trade would be to them, they would be ready e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to do it, for their own Advantage. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhould deſire them to admit a Trader into one of their own Forts, or to build a Fort at our Charge in ſome convenient Place for ſuch a Deſign, and to take Care that our Trade be ſafe; this would tend to convince them, both of our Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to, and of our Confidence in, them; and they would not only be pleaſed with it, but alſo ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to ſhew us that we may ſafely truſt them: And were I to be the Truck-Maſter, I ſhould eſteem myſelf much ſafer in their Protection, than in a Garriſon of 100 <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men: For if ſuch a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon ſhould be placed among them, they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves would ſuſpect ſome ill Deſign carrying on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them; and the <hi>French</hi> would infallibly tell them, that tho' we pretended Peace and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, yet our Deſign in the End is to diſpoſſeſs them of their <hi>Country.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If indeed a Truck-Maſter ſhould prove an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful Servant, and enrich himſelf by defrauding them, he might have Occaſion for <hi>Engliſh</hi> Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to protect him and his Stores; but if they found him faithful, friendly and juſt in his Dealings with them, they would be as careful of him as of their own Eyes, and venture their own Lives for him. What would not the <hi>Indians</hi> of <hi>Stockbridge</hi> have done for Mr. <hi>Sergeant</hi> in his Day, whom they had found to be their true and hearty Friend? And what would they not now do for Mr. <hi>Woodbridge,</hi> of
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:007917_0015_102E0111F89828C0"/>whom they have had the like Experience? <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> will be as ready as the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and perhaps much more ſo, to ſerve and protect, if there be Occaſion, thoſe whom they have found to be their faithful and real Friends.</p>
            <p>In a Word, I apprehend, that if we had in Times paſt treated the Natives according to the Rules of Equity and Juſtice, it would have been quite ſufficient to have engaged them in our Intereſt, and to have kept them in Amity and Friendſhip with us; and that, even now, they might in a little Time be attached to us, by ſuch Treatment: But this, I confeſs, I deſpair of, if every private Perſon muſt be left at his Liberty to treat them as he pleaſes, and to defraud them of all they have; which I take to be the Caſe in <hi>New-York</hi> Government, who lie next to the <hi>Five Nations,</hi> and have their Trade; tho' in this <hi>Province</hi> we have good Laws in Force to reſtrain private Perſons from ſelling them ſtrong Drink.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We ſhould alſo exerciſe that Kindneſs and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity towards them, that ſhall convince them that it is for their Intereſt to be in Friendſhip with us. We ſhould not, in a Caſe of ſuch Importance, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ourſelves with being barely juſt in our Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them, but we ſhould alſo be kind and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous, as a proper Expedient to obtain the End propoſed: I am aware, I ſhall here be quickly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with this Exclamation;</p>
            <p>What! <hi>kind</hi> and <hi>generous</hi> to ſuch an ungrateful evil Crew! To which I ſhall only anſwer, We have good Authority for being <hi>kind to the Unthankful, and to the Evil.</hi> And if that good Being who recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends it to us, had not given an Example of it, in his Dealings with us, how deplorable had our State been? This kind Temper and Behaviour is recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to us in the Goſpel, not only becauſe it is the Will of our heavenly Father that we ſhould be
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:007917_0016_102E011399894EC8"/>kind, but alſo becauſe the Exerciſe of it anſwers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Ends; produces very good and deſirable Effects; ſuch as Love, Friendſhip, Peace, &amp;c. And while we make a Profeſſion of Chriſtianity, it is Pity the Practice of it, in ſo material an Article, ſhould be objected againſt. And is it not very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per that we ſhould exerciſe Kindneſs and Generoſity to the poor Natives, when there is a ſtrong Probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of its being of very happy Conſequence both to them and us?</p>
            <p>A great deal of Kindneſs and Generoſity has been exerciſed towards the River <hi>Indians</hi> at <hi>Houſatunnuk,</hi> by this <hi>Government,</hi> by the honourable <hi>Corporation</hi> at Home, by their honourable and reverend <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners</hi> at <hi>Boſton,</hi> by the Rev. Mr. <hi>Hollis,</hi> by the Rev. Mr. <hi>Sergeant,</hi> Mr. <hi>Woodbridge,</hi> and others; and the Conſequence has been very happy as to them; they are brought to the Knowledge of the Goſpel, and to a Chriſtian Profeſſion; and many of them, we hope, to the ſaving Knowledge of God. We alſo have found the Benefit of this kind Uſage of them; for thereby they are become our hearty Friends, are united to us in their Affections, and were a Means, in the Hand of Providence, of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering our moſt Weſtern Frontiers the laſt War. And were the like Kindneſs ſhewn by us to other Tribes, is there not Room to hope that the Effects might be alike happy? If Townſhips, ſuitable for <hi>Indians</hi> to ſettle in, were provided in our Frontiers, and it were propoſed to them, that if they would come and ſettle in them, they ſhould not only enjoy the Land as their own, but alſo have a Miniſter ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among them to inſtruct them in the Chriſtian Religion; and alſo a School-Maſter to teach their Children to read and write; would not this induce many of them, eſpecially of the better Sort, to come and ſettle in our Borders? And would they
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:007917_0017_102E0116066CFD30"/>not cover our Frontiers in caſe of a War with <hi>France?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What has been done for the <hi>Indians</hi> at <hi>Stockbridge,</hi> has doubtleſs been much obſerved and approved of by the <hi>Natives</hi> far and near. That there is a School ſet up at <hi>Canada,</hi> in Imitation of Mr. <hi>Sergeant</hi>'s School at <hi>Stockbridge,</hi> and a large Number of Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars in it, we have heard and receive for Truth. That the <hi>French,</hi> who eſteem Ignorance to be the Mother of Devotion, and do not deſire to teach the <hi>Indians</hi> any Thing more than to ſay their Beads, and to croſs themſelves, have done this out of Choice, is not at all likely. They do not deſire that their <hi>Indians</hi> ſhould become a knowing People. But yet, being ſenſible that the Report of Mr. <hi>Sergeant</hi>'s School had ſpread itſelf far and wide, and that their <hi>Indians</hi> were pleaſed with the Method the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had taken to furniſh the <hi>Natives</hi> with Knowledge, they apprehended, that unleſs ſomething like it were done among among them, there would be Danger of the <hi>Indians</hi> repairing to us for Inſtruction, and to prevent this, and to engage them to themſelves, they ſet up their School. This, I conjecture, is the Truth of the Caſe. And if ſo, it is manifeſt that the <hi>Indians</hi> are inclined to ſeek after Knowledge; and therefore would be diſpoſed to hearken to ſuch kind and generous Propoſals, if they were made to them. And who can tell but that this, that, or the other Tribe, would gladly ſettle ſuch Towns, if they were invited to it in a proper Manner?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Another Step, and perhaps the moſt promiſing one we can take, to engage the <hi>Indians</hi> in Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with us is, to ſend Miſſionaries among their reſpective Tribes, Miniſters and Schoolmaſters, to inſtruct them in the Principles, and to perſuade them to the Practice of Chriſtianity. Tho' they have ſo long lived near us, and been converſant with us, yet
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:007917_0018_102E0118E047A048"/>they remain ignorant of the Way of Salvation, Strangers to the Goſpel, and are periſhing for lack of Knowledge: A Caſe that might well move our Pity and Compaſſion towards them, and put us up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doing what we can for their Relief. And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our former Neglect of Things of this Nature has not been provoking to Heaven, may be worthy of our ſerious Enquiry.</p>
            <p>The Intereſt the Rev. Mr. <hi>Barclay</hi> had in the <hi>Mohawks,</hi> while he was with them, the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Manners he wrought among them, their Willingneſs to receive Inſtruction, and their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagedneſs to proſecute Learning, are a plain Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation that faithful Miſſionaries would be welcome to them. And the <hi>Five Nations</hi> being neareſt us, and their Friendſhip of very great Conſequence, it might be proper to begin with them: And what has been done among them by Mr. <hi>Barclay</hi> and others, might be no ſmall Help in the Caſe. If we ſhould ſend Perſons well qualified for the Buſineſs to reſide among them, and ſupport them well, there would be no Foundation for any Jealouſy that we have an ill Deſign upon them, and if at any time ſuch Jealouſies ſhould ariſe, they would ſoon ſubſide, upon the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> having a little Experience of our Kindneſs and Friendſhip to them. The prudent Conduct and faithful Labours of ſuch Miſſionaries might, by the Bleſſing of God, ſerve to remove their Barbarity, correct their Manners, reform their Lives, promote in them virtuous Sentiments, and by Degrees form them to true Religion. This we may hope would be the happy Event, with Reſpect to many of them, tho' not to all; and if, by much Labour and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, it might be brought to paſs, ſhould we not find our Account in it; for what would be the Charge of ſupporting a few Miſſionaries, compared with that of an <hi>Indian</hi> War? And is there not great
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:007917_0019_102E011C00E0C310"/>Probability that ſuch Meaſures would in a few Years Time attach them to us in a hearty Friendſhip? And if the <hi>Five Nations,</hi> who are a Terror to, and have in great Meaſure the Command of, other Tribes, were indeed our Friends, and made ſo by ſuch Obligations laid upon them, would it not be an effectual Means of reſtraining other <hi>Indians</hi> from giving us Trouble in caſe of a War?</p>
            <p>The general Objection here, I am ſenſible, will be;—There is no Likelihood of ſucceeding, and therefore it is not worth While to make any Trial; it would only be to ſpend Labour and Money to no good Purpoſe. To which I reply,</p>
            <p>How can we draw the Concluſion before we have made the Experiment? Have we ever made any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Trial, and found ourſelves diſappointed? And can it be looked upon juſt to draw ſuch a Concluſion, in a Caſe of ſuch Importance, unleſs we had better Grounds for it?</p>
            <p>It is true, Mr. <hi>Sergeant</hi> made a Viſit to the <hi>Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quehanna Indians,</hi> Mr. <hi>Brainard</hi> alſo, in his Day, did the ſame, without Succeſs; but we know that the Excuſe thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> made was, that they held their Lands of the <hi>Five Nations,</hi> and therefore could not comply with ſuch a Motion, till their Conſent was firſt obtained. And beſides, ſhall we eſteem two or three Viſits made by private Perſons a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Trial in this Caſe? Sufficient indeed it was to ſhew that thoſe good Gentlemen were poſſeſt of an excellent Spirit, and of a laudable Zeal for the Good of the poor Natives; but yet I apprehend not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to diſcourage further Attempts. If thoſe Gentlemen, who went in a private Capacity, had ſuſtained a publick Character, perhaps they had been more regarded. But however, when we have uſed our beſt Endeavours, and they indeed prove un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſsful, we may be excuſable; but can we look
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:007917_0020_102E011D9C490720"/>upon ourſelves ſo, if we fit ſtill, and uſe no Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours for the Help of thoſe poor benighted People?</p>
            <p>If proper Attempts ſhould be made for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianizing the <hi>Five Nations,</hi> there would, I am ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, ſome notable Difficulties lie in the Way, but yet perhaps none but what might be ſurmounted.</p>
            <p>One Difficulty that would doubtleſs attend ſuch a laudable Undertaking, would ariſe from thoſe who maintain a private Trade among them, from which they reap great Gain; eſpecially by the Article of Rum, too much of which they convey to them; and by the Influence of which the <hi>Indians</hi> are eaſily defrauded.</p>
            <p>Theſe Traders would be very ſenſible, that if Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity ſhould prevail among thoſe <hi>Nations,</hi> the <hi>Hope of their Gain</hi> would be <hi>gone,</hi> and <hi>ſeeing by this Craft they have their Wealth,</hi> they would uſe their utmoſt Endeavours to diſſuade the <hi>Indians</hi> from embracing the Ways of Religion. They in Fact did ſo at <hi>Houſatunnuk,</hi> where the Number of <hi>Indians</hi> was ſmall, and their Trade not ſo conſiderable. How much more then will they do it, if Endeavours ſhould be uſed to convert the <hi>Mohawks,</hi> whoſe Trade is vaſtly more advantageous? But as the <hi>Indians</hi> at <hi>Houſatunnuk,</hi> by Mr <hi>Sergeant</hi>'s Help, ſaw thro' the Artifice they uſed, and were made ſenſible of the ſelfiſh Views of the Traders, ſo doubtleſs the <hi>Five Nations</hi> may eaſily be informed, and the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction ſoon removed.</p>
            <p>Another Difficulty will ariſe from the falſe Inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Romiſh</hi> Emiſſaries, who will not fail to tell them, that we are about to teach them a falſe Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and if they hearken to us, they will all cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be damned. But when thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly informed of the Conduct of the <hi>French,</hi> and other Roman Catholicks, how they deny the Uſe of the Bible to the common People among themſelves,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:007917_0021_102E011FD49D30F0"/>and that they have no Deſign to acquaint the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> with the Word of God: And on the other Hand, that our Deſign is not to impoſe upon them, but to open the Bible to them, to enable them to read it, and to judge for themſelves; will not this ſatisfy them of our honeſt Intentions towards them, and of the Safety and Propriety of their examining Things, that they may form a Judgment for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves?</p>
            <p>A third, and perhaps much the greateſt Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that would attend this good Deſign is, that thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> eſteem themſelves Chriſtians already, and value themſelves upon their being as good Chriſtians as their Neighbours. Mr. <hi>Sergeant,</hi> in his Journal of <hi>November</hi> 25, 1734, ſays,— <q>The <hi>Mohawks</hi> are generally Profeſſors of Chriſtanity, but for want of Inſtruction have but little of it in Reality.—</q> They are ſo ignorant of the Principles of Religion, that they know not the Difference between one who is baptized, and calls himſelf a Chriſtian, and one who lives agreeably to the Rules Chriſt has given us to walk by. They are not ſenſible of the Neceſſity of being conformed to thoſe Rules of Virtue and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which Chriſt has preſcribed. <hi>Romiſh</hi> Emiſſaries have baptized ſome of them, others (as I have been informed) have been baptized by <hi>Dutch</hi> Miniſters; and they eſteem it a Privilege belonging to them to have their Children baptized, whenever they preſent them, without any Regard being had, either to the Qualifications of the Parent, or the religious Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Child. When the Rev. Mr. <hi>Spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer</hi> was among them a few Years ago, they were much diſpleaſed that he declined baptizing ſome Children, whoſe Parents were notoriouſly ignorant, vicious and wicked. Some <hi>Indians</hi> from <hi>Canada,</hi> who had an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Woman to their Mother, came a few Years paſt to <hi>Weſtfield</hi> to viſit their <hi>Engliſh</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:007917_0022_102E0122EDB32860"/>Relations there, and while they ſtaid at that Place, they had a Child born, and were much offended with the Rev. Mr. <hi>Balantine,</hi> who declined bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing of it, as they deſired. Since the Rev. Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> has been at <hi>Stockbridge,</hi> one of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawks</hi> reſiding there had a Child born, and was highly affronted becauſe Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> did not bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize it upon his Deſire. From theſe Inſtances it is evident, that they account their Children have Right to Baptiſm, whenever they deſire it. And being baptized, they eſteem them good Chriſtians, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever their Converſation may be; for they derive their Notions of Chriſtianity, not from the Bible (to which they are Strangers) but from the Example of the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> with whom they are conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, and who profeſs themſelves to be Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>And ſo far forth as being baptized, in the fore-mentioned Manner, and calling themſelves Chriſtians will make them ſo, they are ſo to be eſteemed. Now theſe Things being ſo, it may prove a difficult Thing to make them ſenſible, that Drunkenneſs, and other vicious Practices, are inconſiſtent with Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity; becauſe theſe Chriſtians, who fall under their Obſervation, give them an Example of Vice, and go ſuch Lengths therein.</p>
            <p>But yet I apprehend this Difficulty might alſo be removed, by giving them a juſt and true Account of the Nature and Extent of the Chriſtian Religion, by informing them what the Will of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is; how he expects that we ſhould be conformed to his Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to his Laws. The <hi>Indians</hi> are as capable of hearing Reaſons, and giving them their Weight, as other Men; and it is becauſe they know not what Chriſtianity is, that they eſteem themſelves Chriſtians, in their preſent Circumſtances. When they are made acquainted with the Terms of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, propoſed in the Goſpel, and what they muſt
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:007917_0023_102E012521B86E58"/>do that they may inherit eternal Life; when they are well inſtructed in the Doctrines of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they will be ſenſible that the Religion which they now have, is little or nothing like that which is taught by the Goſpel. When Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> refuſed to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize a <hi>Mohawk</hi> Child born at <hi>Stockbridge</hi> (which I have before mentioned) and they were very much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with him on that Account, he went to them, gave them the Reaſons of his Conduct, and inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them as clearly as he was able, of the Nature and End of Baptiſm: Thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> received the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orce of his Reaſons, and appeared to be ſatisfied and contented, when he had taken Pains to inform them. And I doubt not but proper Inſtruction and Information would remove the Difficulty I have been ſpeaking of.</p>
            <p>Tho' Chriſtianizing thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> may prove a difficult Work, yet if our Endeavours might, by the divine Bleſſing, be ſucceeded, would not the Advantage thence ariſing to them, and us, more than compenſate the Pains and Expence we ſhould be at? And is there not ſo much Ground to hope for Succeſs, as ſhould induce us to make the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment?</p>
            <p>I ſhall now conclude, by briefly ſuggeſting a few Things, not yet mentioned, the ſerious Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which may excite us to uſe our beſt Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours for the Converſion of the neighbouring <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> to the Chriſtian Faith.</p>
            <p n="1">1. And in the firſt Place, ſhould not the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the divine Bounty and Goodneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon us, excite us to employ Part of that undeſerved Goodneſs to promote the Knowledge of God, our bountiful Benefactor, among thoſe who are deſtitute of it? Thro' the undeſerved Favour and Bleſſing of God, we have been proſperous in our ſecular Affairs, ſucceeded in our Huſbandry,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:007917_0024_102E0128425DBE50"/>Trade, &amp;c. and are become a wealthy People. And, were we as willing as we are able, might <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               </gap> not ſpare large Sums for the Propagation of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel among the Heathen? Ought we not then to ſhew our Gratitude to the glorious Author of all our Comforts, by employing a Part of his Bounty to promote the Redeemer's Kingdom? Is it not fit that we ſhould thus <hi>honour the Lord with our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance?</hi> Does it not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> Reproach upon us, who make an high Profeſſion, that we expend ſo little to promote the Knowledge <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

               </gap> among the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,</hi> and ſo much to ill Purpoſes? Were what we employ in unneceſſary Expences, by which Pride and Luxury are indulged and nouriſhed, employed in the laudable Method I am recommending; would it not be ſufficient well to ſupport a Multitude of Miſſionaries among the neighbouring Tribes? Would it not probably be a Means of turning many of them <hi>from the Power of Satan to God?</hi> And would it not be <hi>an Odour of a ſweet Smell, a Sacrifice acceptable, well pleaſing to God</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Phil. iv 18</note>? And ſeeing God, by his Bleſſings, has enabled us to contribute to ſuch a good Deſign, ſhould we not chearfully give of our Subſtance, for the ſpiritual Benefit of the periſhing Heathen?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Should not the Light and Grace of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, which we, thro' divine Goodneſs enjoy, by a ſtronger Argument ſtill to ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>te us to endeavour the Converſion of the Heathen?</p>
            <p>A few Generations back we were in a State of Heatheniſm, as they now are: <hi>Aliens from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth of Iſrael—and without God in the World</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Epheſ. ii. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note>. But, thro' divine Goodneſs, <hi>the Day ſpring from on High has viſited us,</hi> and we enjoy the Light and Privileges of the Goſpel-Diſpenſation. Seeing then God has had Compaſſion on us, and beſtowed upon us thoſe richeſt Bleſſings, ought we not to have
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:007917_0025_102E0129DC9DBEA0"/>Compaſſion on the neighbouring Heathen, and uſe our beſt Endeavours that they alſo may be made Partakers of the Light and Bleſſings of the Goſpel?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Should we not be moved to ſuch charitable Endeavours from the Conſideration of the wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and forlorn Circumſtances, in which the poor <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi> appear before our Eyes? We often behold thoſe piteous Objects, appearing half naked, and almoſt ſtarved; which is the Effect of their vicious Way of Living. We ſee them alſo in the Depths of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and Barbarity; wholly unacquainted with the Way of Salvation, and quite unconcerned for their eternal Good: And yet their Powers, both of Body and Mind, are not inferior to our own. Were they brought to Civility and Induſtry, they might ſtand upon equal Ground with us, reſpecting the Comforts of Life; and were they inſtructed in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Things, made acquainted with the great and important Truths of the Goſpel, they might ſtand as fair for the Kingdom of Heaven as we do. Should not our Eyes therefore affect our Hearts, when we behold them in ſuch miſerable Circumſtances? And ſhould we not exert ourſelves in all proper Ways for their Help? Did the Wounds of the poor Man <hi>half dead,</hi> who <hi>fell among Thieves,</hi> plead with ſo much Eloquence for human Compaſſion, as the unhappy State of the poor <hi>Natives</hi> does for Chriſtian Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? And if the Compaſſion of a <hi>Samaritan</hi> was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the former, how much more ſhould the Bowels of a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> be moved by the latter?</p>
            <p n="4">4. The noble Example of ſome generous and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Perſons, at Home, may well excite us to liberal Contributions for the Benefit of the poor Heathen.</p>
            <p>Not only publick Societies, but alſo private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> have generouſly and liberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contributed for the Benefit of the <hi>Natives,</hi> in this diſtant Part of the World. Tho' they are at 3000 Miles Diſtance, and never beheld, as we do, thoſe
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:007917_0026_102E012C44E7EBA0"/>miſerable Objects; yet, from a truly pious and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Spirit, they have ſent over their liberal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions, that the Heathen, by their Means, may be informed in the Way of Life. <hi>Verily, they ſhall not loſe their Reward.</hi> A noble Example they ſet before us, moſt worthy our Imitation: And how can we excuſe ourſelves, if we neglect to copy after it? Some indeed may plead their Inability, but this is not the Caſe of all. Are there not among us ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wealthy Merchants and Traders? Are there not alſo many Farmers, who abound in Wealth, upon the Lands which were, a few Years ago, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the <hi>Indians,</hi> who now ſtand in Need of their Charity? Should not ſuch Perſons be moved, by the generous Examples of others, to help for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the noble Deſign of converting the Heathen? Yea, are not the People in general able to do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to help forward ſo good a Deſign? And will it not lie as a Reproach upon us, if we, who make a high Profeſſion of Religion, prove void of Charity, when we are ſo loudly called to the Exerciſe of it, not only by the laudable Example of generous Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactors at Home; but alſo by the periſhing Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the neighbouring <hi>Indians?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall only add my hearty Wiſhes, that this <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican</hi> Continent, which, for Ages unknown, has been a Seat of Darkneſs, and <hi>full of the Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Cruelty,</hi> may become a Scene of Light and Love; that the Heathen in it, who have been wont to thirſt after Blood, may <hi>hunger and thirſt after Righteouſneſs; That the Wilderneſs and ſolitary Place may be glad for them, the Deſart rejoice and bloſſom as the Roſe;—That the Glory of</hi> Lebanon <hi>may be given unto it, the Excellency of</hi> Carmel <hi>and</hi> Sharon; <hi>That they may ſee the Glory of the Lord, and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of our God</hi>
