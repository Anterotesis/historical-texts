            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>UNBIASSED reaſon clearly dictates, that God has an original inalienable right and propriety in all things; and particularly in mankind—a right to make what uſe of them he pleaſes. And that he is not obliged to render an account, why he deals with one in this, and another in that manner. Becauſe, as creatures, they are his abſolute property, and, as ſinners, are obnoxious to his wrath.</p>
            <p>BUT it is evident that the divine diſpoſal, relatively to mankind, has met with great oppoſition and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint—Is a doctrine very diſagreeable to human pride—And is what the Apoſtle labored to eſtabliſh, in the text and context, againſt the carnal reaſonings, and ſelf-conceited pretenſions of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and all <hi>others</hi> who have the audacity to deny, or queſtion God's abſolute right, and uncontrolable authority to diſpoſe of men and things according to his ſovereign pleaſure.</p>
            <p>THE ſubject of diſcourſe in this chapter is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the extenſion of ſaving mercy to the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> The former prided themſelves in their deſcent, their privileges, and their legal righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.

               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:024750_0006_0FC864D3DF843CC0"/>As it may tend to relieve the minds of ſome read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, I ſhall divide the diſcourſe, it being lengthy, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to three parts.</p>
            <p>THE FIRST PART, Containing an attempt to explain the text.</p>
            <p>To do this orderly and clearly it is neceſſary to inveſtigate the meaning of God's having mercy on whom he will have mercy.</p>
            <p>MERCY, when applied to God in the Bible, is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times uſed with greater latitude, than at others. The divine character, generally ſummed up in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is ſometimes expreſſed by mercy. But mercy, more ſtrictly conſidered, is a branch of holineſs—is of the nature of benevolence; yet doth imply ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the object towards which it is exerciſed, whereby it is differenced from benevolence in a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral view. Benevolence reſpects being—intelligent exiſtence. Mercy reſpects the ill-deſerving. Great favor may be ſhown, much good, may be conferred upon the innocent: but favor ſhown to the innocent is not of the nature of mercy, ſtrictly conſidered: becauſe mercy is contrary to deſert; or the good, which is the effect of mercy, is ſo far from being merited by thoſe who are the recipients, that they deſerve only evil.</p>
            <p>WE may, therefore, define mercy applied to God by ſaying, It is the divine inclination to do good to the ill deſerving.</p>
            <p>ACCORDING to this definition, mercy may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed from compaſſion, as well as from bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence. It is true, that mercy and compaſſion are oftentimes uſed ſynonimouſly; yet ſtrictly ſpeaking, miſery is the object of compaſſion, without joining to it either innocence, or ill deſert: whereas mercy has reſpect to miſery well deſerved.</p>
            <p>Now, as all mankind are ſinners, "for there is none righteo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, no, not one," and conſequently, odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to divine purity, and obnoxious to divine wrath: ſo all the good things men enjoy ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:024750_0007_0FC864D89BD52710"/>
as flowing to them from mercy. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable bleſſings conſerred upon them in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate, are mercies equally numberleſs. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it appears, that in different ways and degrees, all have experience of mercy from God. It is evident, however, that, in the text, mercy is not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in this general ſenſe. <hi>Here</hi> reſpect is had, not only to diſcriminating, but alſo to ſaving mercy. That which, in a lower ſenſe, may be called diſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating mercy, is exerciſed towards many who are not the ſubjects of ſaving mercy. Diſcriminating mercy is exerciſed in temporal bleſſings and ſpiritual privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges. Some abound in riches; and enjoy better health of body than others do. Some are under bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter advantages in reſpect to ſociety: and better ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages for mental and moral improvement, than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are. And there are more powerful operations of the Holy Spirit on the minds and conſciences <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſome, than of others, who yet may be left to ſtifle their convictions, and never experience the change of regeneration and a ſaving converſion to God. And in ſuch reſpects it may be truly ſaid, He hath mercy on whom he will have mercy.</p>
            <p>THAT, in the text, particular reference is had to ſaving mercy, is evident from the tenor of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in this chapter. For it was obviouſly Paul's deſign to vindicate the divine conduct, in rejecting the body of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> nation, and extending ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercy to the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Moreover, it is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently evident from the latter part of the verſe. Whom he will he hardeneth. For they who are not hardened, are ſoftened, i.e. renewed and ſanctified: becauſe there is no medium between theſe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaving mercy is <hi>here</hi> intended.</p>
            <p>As there is a difference in the exerciſe of divine mercy, in other reſpects; ſo there is a moſt wide and important difference in the exerciſe of ſaving mercy. It is not beſtowed upon all mankind; but upon ſome
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:024750_0008_0FC864D9C87C4D60"/>
only—even thoſe upon whom God is pleaſed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow it. In the text, and many other places, the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of mercy is reſolved into the will or ſovereign pleaſure of the Deity. No reaſon is <hi>he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> aſſigned only his will. He hath mercy on whom he will have mercy. What then, are we to underſtand by this mode of ſpeaking?</p>
            <p n="1">1. WE are not to conceive that God acts from mere will, as this is generally underſtood, when applied to men. The potentates of the earth are frequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented as acting from <hi>mere</hi> will, to ſignify that they act tyrannically, contrary to all reaſon and equity; by diſplaying their power, in numberleſs ways of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and oppreſſion, to gratify their ambition and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varice. The will of God, in the exerciſe of his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving mercy, is not <hi>arbitrary</hi> in any ſuch ſenſe. For no wrong is done to thoſe upon whom he doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow his mercy: neither is partiality exerciſed, in the ſenſe that being partial or a reſpecter of perſons, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies any thing mean and unworthy.</p>
            <p n="2">2. WE are not to conceive that God acts without wiſdom—without a regard to that which upon the whole is beſt, in the choice he makes of theſe, upon whom he is determined to beſtow his ſaving mercy. The divine will is not blind, nor capricious. Altho' we are not able to inveſtigate them, no doubt there are good and ſufficient reaſons, why God beſtows his ſaving mercy upon ſome, and not upon others. And why thoſe very perſons upon whom he doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow it, rather than others. But, in reſpect to this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, his tho'ts are not our tho'ts—are high above them, as the heavens are high above the earth. It is not, becauſe ſome are more noble, wiſe, and mighty than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; or have done more to recommend themſelves, than others have done. It is thoſe, upon whom, in his infinite wiſdom, God ſees beſt to beſtow it: Whoſe ſalvation will moſt effectually conduce to his own glory, and the illuſtrious diſplay of his grace.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:024750_0009_0FC864DE78E6D178"/>3. "HE hath mercy on whom he will have mercy" ſignifies to us; That God hath and exerciſeth a right to do what he will with his own.</p>
            <p>ALL men being ſinners, he is not obliged to exerciſe his ſaving mercy towards any. And it lies in his own breaſt to determine on whom he will confer it; and on whom he will not. By this, we ſee, the exerciſe is <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary,</hi> in reſpect to <hi>ſubjects.</hi> Neither they upon whom ſuch mercy is beſtowed, nor they upon whom it is not beſtowed, have any claims to advance. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if any are ſaved; their ſalvation muſt be the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of <hi>mere</hi> mercy, ſovereign grace.</p>
            <p n="4">4. WE may farther obſerve, That this mode of ſpeaking doth naturally lead us to conceive; that as mercy is the only ſpring of ſalvation: So in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of it, God is ſelf moved, and perfectly free. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing out of himſelf, ſtrictly ſpeaking, doth induce God to ſhew mercy. The exerciſe of ſaving mercy, in its whole extent, flows from his infinitely free ſelf-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved propenſity. It is true, God exerciſes mercy in a view of the guilt, and ruin of ſinners: For if ſin had not taken place, there would have been no room for the exerciſe of it. Therefore we may humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, Sin was permitted to take place, to prepare the way for the manifeſtation of divine juſtice, in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of ſome; and that the infinitely merciful heart of the Deity might work forth, in the pardon &amp; ſalvation of others: And that the moſt important ends, reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Deity himſelf, and the created intelligent ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, might be accompliſhed in the final reſult. But the whole ſcene is laid, and the exerciſe conducted in ſuch a manner, as to make it manifeſt; that when God beſtows his ſaving mercy upon any, he acts of, from, and for himſelf. And the regard ſhown to thoſe upon whom he confers his ſaving mercy is rather ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, than original and ultimate: or if ultimate, yet certainly, not ſupreme.</p>
            <p>ON the whole, God hath determined the objects of
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:024750_0010_0FC864DFC13858F0"/>
ſaving mercy according to the counſel of his own will, and ſo as to anſwer his own moſt important ends. Not needing, nor aſking any aſſiſtance; not looking upon himſelf amenable to any creature. And without pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the leaſt attention &amp; regard to thoſe circumſtances and diſtinctions, men are apt to think, ought to influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in ſuch a determination, and conſequent proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure. For, "Who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counſellor?" inſtructing and aid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in what he ought to reſolve and do. "Or who hath firſt given to him?" Certainly none.</p>
            <p>MANY are ready to think it is proper they ſhould be the objects of divine favor, on account of their.de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent; or becauſe they have ſuperior abilities and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages; or becauſe they have made a profeſſion of religion, are civil and moral in their behaviour, and if not ſinleſs, are leſs criminal &amp; unworthy than many oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers they could eaſily name. Or becauſe they have taken abundant pains to recommend themſelves to divine fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor. Indeed there is a great variety of particulars, implying different circumſtances and diſtinctions which take place among mankind, on account whereof they are apt to imagine, God will ſhew them his ſalvation. But the Almighty doth not regard thoſe diſtinctions, in which weak mortals are ſo apt to pride themſelves. He doth not make leſs comparative guile and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs the ground of his choice; For upon ſome he beſtows ſalvation whoſe guilt is very great—even up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the chief of ſinners. Some of one; and ſome of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother nation are ſaved. Some deſcended from wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy progenitors; others not ſo deſcended. Some of ſuch a ſtation and employment are choſen; others of the like ſtation are rejected. And where there is a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milarity of circumſtances, it is probable, ſome are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; others not.</p>
            <p>We cannot determine beforehand who will be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, From the ſituation <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>en are in, the way they
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:024750_0011_0FC864E139442FD0"/>
purſue, the exertions they make, we cannot know that God hath ſaving mercy in deſign for them. It is not poſſible to know that God will beſtow mercy upon one, or another before he doth beſtow it; unleſs he ſhould be pleaſed to reveal his purpoſe, in reſpect to certain perſons, to ſome of his ſervants. But he is not wont often, if ever to do this. And although the ſituation ſome perſons are in, who have not as yet obtained re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generating grace, may render it more probable they will obtain mercy, than that others in general will, and more probable in the given ſituation, that they in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſhall obtain, than it would be, were they not in ſuch a ſituation: Yet no ſituation—no external circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, or even ſtate of mind perſons may be in antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to regeneration, ought to be conſidered, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the leaſt influence in the divine determination, reſpecting the beſtowment of his ſaving mercy.</p>
            <p>ON the other hand; when we find ſaving mercy, in event is conferred upon perſons, who were in ſuch a particular ſituation, external and internal, we are to conceive they were brought thereunto, becauſe God purpoſed to ſave them.</p>
            <p>HAVING thus ſtated what we are to underſtand by God's having mercy on whom he will have mercy. The way is prepared.</p>
            <p>II. To inveſtigate the meaning of the counterpart to this, And whom he will he hardeneth.</p>
            <p>IT is true that he hardeneth whom he will, as it is that he hath mercy on whom he will; becauſe the ſame pen of inſpiration aſſerts both. They on whom he hath mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy are regenerated, are united to Chriſt, are juſtified, and ſhall be ſaved: ſeeing, as hath been obſerved, there is a particular reference, not to common and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuous; but to ſpecial ſaving mercy. Conſequently, by the hardened we are to underſtend thoſe who are, or ſhall be leſt in an imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap>t unbelieving ſtate to the laſt—to their eternal ruin and deſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>n. For the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of remaining impenitent and unbelieving to the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:024750_0012_0FC864E38F822B48"/>
end of this probationary ſtate will be endleſs ruin &amp; mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery. Of the truth of this doctrine the Scriptures afford abundant proof. At preſent, I ſhall only refer to the 22d. verſe, which is not only in point, but deciſive. For <hi>here</hi> we are taught, that God will ſhew his wrath, and make his power known on the veſſels of wrath fitted to deſtruction, and endured with much long ſuffering. Now ſhould theſe veſſels be eternally happy after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been ever ſo many millions of ages in torment; they would be veſſels of mercy, and not veſſels of wrath. And ſalvation, rather than deſtruction would be their end—that to which they are fitted.</p>
            <p>WE are compelled to underſtand the text to mean being hardened in this awful ſenſe. The ſcope of the Apoſtle evinces it: which was the rejection of the <hi>Jews</hi> through unbelief to their deſtruction, and the exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſaving mercy to the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> The adduced inſtance of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> whoſe heart was hardened to his deſtruction, proves it. For this inſtance is brought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to ſupport the declaration ſtated in the text. As he hardened <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to his deſtruction: ſo whom he will he hardeneth to their deſtruction. And more than all this, the antitheſis uſed in the text doth neceſſarily require ſuch a conſtruction. Becauſe, although there are various reſpects and degrees, according to which, ſeveral perſons may be ſaid to be hardened, and even the ſame perſon at different times. Yet if any ſhould be hardened in impenitence ten, twenty, forty years or more: but ſhould be renewed by divine grace, and ſaved at laſt; upon ſuch God would have mercy in the ſenſe of the text. Therefore it is evident, this would deſtroy the contraſt—would leave no oppoſition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe upon whom he hath mercy, and thoſe whom he hardeneth.</p>
            <p>THE expreſſion, he hardeneth, is uſed in a metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical ſenſe. It is borrowed from particular <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> that are called hard; ſuch as a ſtone, piece of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="15" facs="unknown:024750_0013_0FC864E56F6A9C60"/>
and changed. They will reſiſt a conſiderable power applied to alter them. And ſome bodies naturally hard, being worked upon, will grow harder ſtill. Whereas ſubſtances that are ſoft will readily yield, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing way to impreſſions made upon them. Hardneſs, when applied to the mind, doth import an unaptneſs to be rightly moved and affected; a bent to reſiſt the truth, and oppoſe the authority and commands of God. Leaving the metaphor—a hard is the ſame with a ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, proud, unholy heart. And according to the degree of ſelfiſhneſs, and oppoſition to truth and holineſs is the degree of hardneſs. And laſtly, whatſoever ſerves to render men's minds ſtupid, averſe to good, proud and ſtubborn, may be ſaid to harden them.</p>
            <p>WHAT being hardened doth intend may now be ſeen. But the great queſtion is, what we are to underſtand by, whom HE will HE hardeneth? Or in what ſenſe may it be truly ſaid God hardeneth any man? For it needeth not to be a laboring point in our minds, that he ſhould harden whom he will, if we can find a conſiſtent ſenſe, in which he may be ſaid to harden any one. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that which will ſerve to vindicate his character in hardening any one, may ſerve as well to vindicate it in hardening another, and as many as he ſhall ſee fit to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. For, if doing it in one inſtance implies no deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of his holineſs; doing it in ten, or ten thouſand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances will imply no denial thereof—It being eaſy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to ſee, that where there is no denial or oppoſition in a ſingle inſtance; there will be none in ever ſo many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the ſame nature. The queſtion returns, what are we to underſtand by whom HE will HE hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eneth?</p>
            <p>THIS indeed is a tremendouſly delicate ſubject; and by uſing great freedom and boldneſs of enquiry there may be danger of our conceiving, and uttering what ſhall be exceedingly reproachful to the Deity. And there ſeemeth to be danger on both hands; So that by ſteering beyond the proper point to avoid <hi>Scylla</hi>; we
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:024750_0014_0FC864EA1B9D2B08"/>
fall into <hi>Charybdis.</hi> And this I apprehend we ſhall do. If on one hand, we wholly deny any interpoſition <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and divine diſpoſal in reſpect to the taking place of ſin, and a continued ſeries—a confirmed ſtate in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ending in eternal ruin and deſtruction. Or by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing more, in any eſſential reſpect, to a divine inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and diſpoſal than ought to be aſcribed, on the other. And it may not be eaſy to determine which would be moſt injurious and reproachful. Yet, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, it is not poſſible for us to fix the point preciſely, by aſcertaining with exactneſs, how far the will, and diſpoſal of the Deity are concerned in this delicate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair.</p>
            <p>To proceed with humility and due caution in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, it may be obſerved, that ſince God hardeneth whom he will, it is certain his will, in ſome ſenſe, muſt be concerned in hardening men; and the active verb hardeneth doth import ſome divine agency and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal. So that, without flat contradiction to the plaineſt aſſertion of the pen of inſpiration, we cannot wholly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the will and agency of God. From this however, it doth not follow, that there is the ſame agency or exertion of divine power in producing the event called ſin, and hardneſs of heart, as there is in producing the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect called holineſs. And notwithſtanding the divine will &amp; diſpoſal are concerned in the former; they may be, &amp; we may have reaſon to apprehend they are concerned in a very different ſenſe and manner, in the latter, i. e. in the communication of holineſs, and conſervation of ſaints in a holy ſtate. Indeed this mode of ſpeaking doth not neceſſarily imply, that God exerts any imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate influence at all in hardening men. For, ſhould we ſuppoſe ſin—hardneſs of heart to take place in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of the ſuſpenſion of a particular kind of influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which by many hath been called ſupernatural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, producing, &amp; continuing holineſs in creatures: Even as the abſence of light is darkneſs; as night fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the going down of the ſun, without any poſitive
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:024750_0015_0FC864EDD087C408"/>
immediate exertion to produce night or darkneſs—I ſay, on ſuch a ſuppoſition, the manner of ſpeaking in the text, would not be improper. For the night—dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is ſometimes repreſented as being made, yea crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And, we ordinarily ſay the abſence of light cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth darkneſs.</p>
            <p>IT is true, that ſin is in oppoſition to holineſs; ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs to benevolence; ſo that we may invariably ſay ſelfiſh and benevolent exerciſes are contrary to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And it is certain, that holy benevolent exerciſes in creatures are the effect of divine exertion; do take place in conſequence of the influence of the Holy Ghoſt upon the heart. For God worketh in the ſaints, "both to will and to do of <hi>his</hi> good pleaſure." It is alſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that men do not act independently of God, when they act ſinfully. God doth not withhold every kind of influence and ſupport. If he ſhould they would ceaſe to be. There would be no ability, no ſufficiency for any kind of perception, and exerciſe. "In him we live, move, and have our being." This is true in reſpect to the wicked, as it is in regard to others. But it doth not follow, becauſe holy, and ſinful exerciſes are oppoſite to each other, and holy exerciſes are the effect of a divine ſupernatural operation; that ſinful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes muſt be the fruit of any ſimilar exertion of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power. For the ſame efficiency that produces an effect of one kind may not be neceſſary to produce an effect of another, and an oppoſite kind. Allowing the ſame cauſe may produce different, and even oppoſite effects; as the ſame fire that melts wax, and fuſes me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals will dry, and harden humid ſoft clay: Yet, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, in nature's ample field we ſhall not find an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, affording a deciſive proof, that the ſame cauſe doth produce oppoſite effects in the ſame ſubject; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs there is a materil variation in ſome circumſtance, or circumſtances attending the ſubject, and then indeed as to the caſe in hand, the ſubject is not the ſame. And many conſiderable effects ſeem to be produced, or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:024750_0016_0FC864F849C66160"/>
by privation of influence, rather than by poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive exertion. A river congealed ſo as to form a bridge ſufficiently ſtrong for an army, with ammunition and baggage to paſs ſafely over, is a great, real, ſenſible ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. How is it produced! Not by the preſence and powerful influence of the ſun; but by his abſence, or the faint influence of his beams. It is true, there can be no ice without water; and there can be no water without an omnipotent hand to create it: alſo, the preſence and power of God in the beams of the ſum is neceſſary to keep the water in a warm flowing ſtate. But that, the beams of the ſun being withdrawn, there is need of a ſuperadded influence to turn the flowing water into a congealed ſtate may not eaſily, if at all, be made to appear. And who would chooſe to affirm? There may not be ſomething as great, and even more conſiderable in reſpect to moral voluntary effects, than in regard to thoſe which are natural and mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal: where there is no pretence of any proper agency in the ſubjects of the effects, or their mediate cauſes.</p>
            <p>LET it be farther obſerved, That, in regeneration and ſanctification, the Scriptures aſcribe a peculiar in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition and influence to God, This argues that ſinful exerciſes are not the effect of divine influences in the ſenſe holy excrciſes are. Should it be urged, "that although the extrinſic influence which produces holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in creatures is not the ſame with that which produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſin: Yet as creatures have no independent ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy for any kind of perception and volition, there neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily muſt be an extrinſic divine influence, and as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately exerted, to the production of ſinful, as of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly volitions." Anſwer. This will not follow. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſinfulneſs of volitions may proceed from a privative, rather than a poſitive cauſe. In other words. According to Scriptural repreſentation there ſeemeth to be a peculiar, and what hath been called ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural influence, in producing holy perceptions and volitions, which influence is over and above that
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:024750_0017_0FC864FA0A4D5C10"/>
general influence—extrinſic exertion, neceſſary to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the way for perceptions and volitions, to take place in creatures. i. e. to enable them to underſtand and chooſe. If ſo; then there is not a neceſſity of influence tantamount to this, to prepare the way for ſinful exerciſes to take place. Becauſe the ſuſpenſion of the kind of influence, which hath been mentioned, may be attended with this conſequence. Sinful exerciſes may be conceived of as taking place, without any other kind of influence—extrinſic exertion, than what is neceſſary, to enable man to underſtand, chooſe and act.</p>
            <p>To ſum up the whole, I think it is more ſafe, and doth better accord with the Scriptures to ſay, That God orders the occaſion; and for wiſe, and important ends, doth not interpoſe that influence, which in the given circumſtances, would be neceſſary to prevent ſin and impenitence; than that he cauſes ſin and impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence by his own poſitive and immediate energy. And that he permits, which is to ſay doth not effectually prevent, than that he produces, or infuſes ſuch hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>SOME very bold inquirers, and reaſoners, may cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure this permitting; ordering the occaſion; not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting; as making uſe of expreſſions, too lenient and timid. And may urge, that ſuch a ſtating of the caſe is only an expedient to relieve the imagination; but doth afford no relief to any real difficulty. In regard to ſuch perſons I would farther obſerve. Although I do not aſſert, that the ſuppoſition of ſuch a direct, poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive agency in the taking place, the continu nce, and prevalence of wickedneſs in the ſyſtem, as they may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon; would neceſſarily involve the idea, or conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence that God is the author of ſin, in ſuch a ſenſe, as to render the ſinner leſs criminal, and ſin leſs odious to the divine being, than it would appear to be on any other ſuppoſition, and the Scriptural repreſentatious make it to be. And although the abettors of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, poſitive agency of the Deity in the production of
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:024750_0018_0FC864FB815308F8"/>
all moral evil, for ought I chooſe to ſay to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, may have clear conceptions of the evil of ſin, juſt deſert of the ſinner, and God's infinite hatred and aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſin: Yet there ſeems to be ſomething in it which doth naturally, if not neceſſarily ſhock the mind. And, as I apprehend, hath a powerful tendency to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice the minds of people in general, and of many pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous well-meaning perſons (who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> able to purſue references metaphyſically refined) againſt the ſyſtem of truth revealed in the Bible, and lead them to entertain very unworthy thoughts of the bleſſed God, the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fountain of being and good. And after all, it ſeems to be a philoſophical point, reſpecting the manner of accompliſhing the divine purpoſes, about which it is not neceſſary the world ſhould be exerciſed.</p>
            <p>As Paul drew the conſequence, whom he will he hardeneth, from what is ſaid concerning <hi>Pharaoh</hi>—our conceptions may poſſibly be aſſiſted, by bringing into view what is narrated of <hi>him</hi> in the hiſtory given by Moſes.</p>
            <p>GOD ſent Moſes to demand of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> permiſſion for the children of Iſrael to go, and offer ſacrifice in the wilderneſs; but told him, that he would harden <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s heart ſo that he ſhould not let the people go. When Moſes delivered the meſſage to <hi>Pharaoh</hi>; he anſwered, "who is the LORD that I ſhould obey his voice to let Iſrael go? I know not the LORD, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will I let Iſrael go." <hi>Pharaoh</hi> made the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſerve with hard bondage in brick, and mortar. His pride and covetouſneſs could not conſent, to looſe the <hi>ſervice</hi> of ſo many men. Therefore, inſtead of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with the demand God made by Moſes he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered a heavier taſk to be impoſed upon <hi>them.</hi> By the divine command, Moſes began to work ſigns and wonders to convince the king of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that he was really ſent by God, and influence him to comply with his demand. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> called for his magicians; <hi>Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> and <hi>Jambres</hi> withſtood Moſes. And ſo long as
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:024750_0019_0FC864FD052980B0"/>
they did ſomething in imitation of the miracles wrought by Moſes and Aaron, this ſerved to fix him in his reſolution, not to let the people go. When the magicians could not produce lice; but owned themſelves defeated, and that what Moſes did was the finger of God; it is not improbable <hi>Pharaoh</hi> thought Moſes did this; becauſe he had greater ſkill in magic, than <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres,</hi> and thereby his heart was hardened. When the magicians were farther contoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: ſo that they could not ſtand before Moſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the blains that broke forth upon them; as they did upon man and beaſt throughout all the land of Egypt. It is ſaid,."the LORD hardened the heart of <hi>Pharaoh.</hi>" Yet, after this it is ſaid, "<hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſinned yet more, and hardened his heart he and his ſervants." And when the judgments ſucceeding the hail were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted it is repeatedly ſaid, "the LORD hardened the heart of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>". And although at laſt, by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of all the firſt born in <hi>Egypt, Pharaoh</hi> was conſtrained to let the people depart; they had not gone far before he recanted, and purſued them with his chariots and horſemen, the LORD hardening the heart of the king of <hi>Egypt</hi> to do this, and the hearts of the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> Which is thus expreſſed: "the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emy ſaid I will purſue, I will overtake, I will divide the ſpoil: my luſt ſhall be ſatisfied upon them; I will draw my ſword, my hand ſhall deſtroy them."</p>
            <p>HERE a moſt wonderful ſcene was laid open: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable in reſpect to manifeſting the extreme wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, and hard-hear edneſs of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and his <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi>; and diſplaying the power and glory of JEHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VAH in the deliverance of his people, and the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and overthrow of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians.</hi>" "For the LORD triumphed gloriouſly by throwing the horſe and his rider into the ſea." Upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion it was proper to aſk in a ſtrain of devout admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, as Moſes did, "who is like unto thee O Lord among the gods! who is like thee, glorious in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:024750_0020_0FC864FE94B00158"/>
fearful in praiſes, doing wonders?"</p>
            <p>No one who reads and attends to the whole narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ought to entertain the leaſt doubt, whether this ſcene, antecedently to its being opened, was compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in the divine plan. And it is evident, there was a previous certainty that <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> heart would be har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened. And that God raiſed him up for this very pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that he might ſhew his power in him, and that his own glorious name might be declared throughout all the earth.</p>
            <p>BUT how are we to underſtand this? Shall we ſay, "that God intended to make his power known by har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dening <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> heart, in virtue of his own poſitive immediate energy, working ſuch hardneſs in his heart?" Anſwer. This doth not appear from the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory: but rather this. God intended to make his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er known in many ſtupendous miracles wrought to convince, and perſuade <hi>Pharaoh</hi>; whoſe heart he did not ſee fit, by any poſitive efficiency, to prevent grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hard, and increaſe in obduracy, notwithſtanding all that was ſaid and done calculated to reduce him to a willing ſubjection and compliance. And to make his power and name glorious by triumphing over him, as he did at laſt, in his deſerved deſtruction.</p>
            <p>IT may be obſerved, that three modes of expreſſion are uſed in ſetting forth the hardneſs of <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> heart. The LORD hardened his heart; his heart was hardened: and he i. e. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> himſelf hardened his heart. According to this account, his hardneſs is ſometimes aſcribed, neither to God, nor to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> directly, leaving room to ſay it was occaſioned, in part, by certain circumſtances. And although theſe circumſtances were ordered by the wiſe holy provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God: yet this may be far from amounting to a direct poſitive divine efficiency in producing ſuch hardneſs. And it is evident, there was no ſuch agency of the Deity in the affair as to prevent his hardneſs of heart being with propriety aſcribed to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:024750_0021_0FC86506E221DAA0"/>
And as it is ſometimes aſcribed to <hi>himſelf</hi> it is apparent, there was no compulſion—there was no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than a moral neceſſity, of his remaining in a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened ſtate. Or what conſiſted in his own inclination and choice. <hi>He</hi> acted ſpontaneouſly; <hi>he</hi> choſe to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify his avarice by detaining the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; notwithſtanding all that was ſaid and done, to gain a compliance with what was demanded of him by Moſes, in the name of JEHOVAH.</p>
            <p>THEREFORE, the narration given by Moſes only ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it neceſſary we ſhould maintain, that hardening the heart of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was comprehended in the divine plan—That it was previouſly certain he would conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in a hardened ſtate, God not being obliged thereto, and not ſeeing fit to prevent it, by the efficacious influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of his ſpirit and grace. And in this, or ſome ſenſe like this, it may be ſaid God hardeneth whom he will. He hath determined whom he will harden, and upon whom he will have mercy. There is a previous certainty in reſpect to a certain number unknown to us, but perfectly well known to God, who will be harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their eternal ruin: notwithſtanding all that hath been, is, or ſhall be done, to prevent it. That is to ſay, who after their hardneſs and impenitent heart, will treaſure up to themſelves wrath and damnation, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing the riches of his goodneſs, long-ſuffering and forbearance. Whom the goodneſs of God (however well adapted in itſelf to that purpoſe) will not lead to repentance; nor the divine ſeverity drive from the love, and purſuit of their evil ways. In all of whom God will make his power known; and at laſt, not only declare his name throughout all the earth; but render it divinely glorious to the utmoſt extent of creation, and to the endleſs ages of eternity; as he will alſo, the exceeding riches of his grace in their ſalvation, upon whom it ſhall pleaſe him to have mercy.</p>

               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:024750_0022_0FC86509E0D5F1E0"/>THE SECOND PART. Containing ſome proof and illuſtration of the doctrine.</p>
            <p>WE may now proceed,</p>
            <p>III. To evince and illuſtrate this great truth, that it belongs to God—is one of his eſſential prerogatives to have mercy on whom he will have mercy, and to harden whom he will harden.</p>
            <p>THE following arguments may ſufficiently evince &amp; illuſtrate this important doctrine.</p>
            <p>ARG: I. GOD hath an original inalienable right and propriety in all things. Therefore it belongs to him —is his eſſential prerogative to have mercy on whom he will, and to harden whom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> will.</p>
            <p n="1">I. WHEN we ſay this belongs to God, is a divine prerogative, we do or ought to mean, that it is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to Deity, an original inalienable prerogative. That it belongs to him in an abſolute independent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; ſo as to render it abſurd to ſay, or ſuppoſe it doth not belong to him: ſo abſurd, as that the denial thereof doth imply a denial of the ſupremacy, perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and glory of Jehovah; and is tantamount to the denial of the exiſtence of a Deity, the firſt cauſe, and laſt end of all things.</p>
            <p>WHEN the Pſalmiſt ſaith, "power belongeth unto God," he no doubt means, that original abſolute pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er belongs to him, inherently, and eſſentially. That he doth not in the leaſt degree derive his power from any other, and is not at all dependent on any other for the exerciſe of it. And ſtrictly ſpeaking, that he doth not derive it from himſelf; any more than he derives his exiſtence from himſelf: But this power is in him ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily, with a neceſſity abſolute, like that of his being.</p>
            <p n="2">2. IT may eaſily be ſeen, that the denial of abſolute perfection, perfection original and every way exempt from derivation, implies a denial of divine exiſtence, although, in our conception, and the order of ſtating things, we place exiſtence firſt. For divine exiſtence is the exiſtence of a being abſolutely perfect. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:024750_0023_0FC8650C03E3F8C0"/>
ſince in the idea of Deity abſolute perfection is included, we cannot admit the idea of ſuch exiſtence, without being compelled to admit the idea of abſolute perfection, as neceſſarily pertaining thereunto: And to deny ſuch perfection is impliedly, to deny the exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to which the perfection doth neceſſarily belong.</p>
            <p>WE may indeed Without this conceive of exiſtence, and call it Deity: however it is not Deity, ſtrictly ſpeaking, but our own falſe conception, and vain ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination. It may be proper alſo to obſerve here, That the will of God ever is, and neceſſarily muſt be wiſe and good in the higheſt ſenſe: becauſe it is repugnant to the idea of abſolute perfection to admit the poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the contrary. For, if his will, in any inſtance and reſpect, ſhould be unwiſe, not good this would be a proof of the want of abſolute perfection.</p>
            <p n="3">3. WHEN we conſider God as poſſeſſing abſolute per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, originally and independently. And alſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him as the creator of all things. Of whom, through whom, and to whom are all things!" That he hath an original inalienable right and propriety in all things, to order and diſpoſe of them according to his wiſdom and good pleaſure, is implied therein, or doth flow therefrom by infallible conſequence. In ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that it will amount to a denial of his abſolute per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and his divine exiſtence, by neceſſary implicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to deny he hath ſuch an inherent inalienable right.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As it thus appears, That it belongs to God to diſpoſe of all creatures and things, according to the counſel of his own will: Therefore it belongs to God —is his eſſential prerogative to have mercy on whom he will, and to harden whom he will; as the matter hath been explained. For a denial of this, is, in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, a denial of his right to diſpoſe of all creatures and things as he pleaſeth; becauſe this is comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in his having ſuch an original inalienable right. Conſequently, by what hath been ſaid, a denial of this will involve a denial of his abſolute perfection—his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:024750_0024_0FC8650D892CE468"/>
exiſtence.</p>
            <p>IN all the divine arrangements, perhaps, there is no higher, brighter diſplay of prerogative; than what is exerciſed in the Salvation and Damnation of ſinners. And we may not limit the divine prerogative, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the exerciſe of it in other matters; but deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it doth extend to this. However contrary to the pride, the overweening conceits men have of themſelves; and however they may be diſpoſed to ſet up, and maintain their notions of independent power and liberty to chooſe for themſelves, and fix <hi>even</hi> their eternal ſtate: Yet God aſſerts it to be his prerogative to have mercy on whom he will, and to harden whom he will. And on good ground; for it doth eſſential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and neceſſarily belong to him.</p>
            <p>ARG. II. Juſtice and mercy are eſſential to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine character—a character, complete in all perfection. Therefore it belongs to God, to have mercy on whom he will have mercy, and to harden whom he will har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</p>
            <p n="1">1. IF juſtice, <hi>even</hi> punitive juſtice, be not a perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it is an imperfection. And, if it be an imperfection, then the character of Jehovah revealed in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, "To me vengeance belongeth, I will repay ſaith the Lord," is a bad character. And the Bible doth not give us the knowledge of the true God. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, if mercy be not a perfection, it is an imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For, in a moral conſideration, there is no me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium between perfection and imperfection. We ſee then, it is impoſſible that mercy and juſtice ſhould not be a beauty, or a blemiſh in the divine character. And we ſee with equal evidence, that mercy and juſtice are included in the idea of abſolute perfection.</p>
            <p n="2">2. IF mercy and juſtice are eſſential to the divine character; it is proper that theſe ſhould be made to appear in exerciſe, in events. The propriety of theſe being made to appear is the ſame, with the propriety of the divine character or abſolute perfection, being
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:024750_0025_0FC8651078272710"/>
made to appear: becauſe the character cannot be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted, if any thing eſſentially diſtinguiſhing in the character, is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eft out. Moreover, the character cannot be ſeen, cannot be underſtood by creatures; unleſs it is manifeſted in ſome ſuitable effects, or work, For none but God himſelf, by intuition, ſelf conſciouſneſs can know who, and what he is.</p>
            <p>By this it appears, that in denying the propriety of mercy and juſtice being exerciſed, there is implied a denial of the propriety of abſolute perfection being made to appear, as belonging to the divine character. And this will run us into a denial of abſolute perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and in fine the denial of a God—will land us in atheiſm.</p>
            <p n="3">3. IF ſin had not taken place, never had and never ſhould take place, there would have been no room and opportunity; and conſequently no poſſibility, that pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitive juſtice and redeeming mercy ſhould be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. It is no limitation of divine power, on ſuch a ſuppoſition, to ſay there would not be a poſſibility. For, in ſuch a caſe, the poſſibility implies a contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And it is no limitation of divine power to ſay God cannot do what implies a contradiction, A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction is not the object of power. Hence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, That ſin muſt be comprehended in the projection of a plan, deſigned and calculated to exhibit abſolute perfection of character to the minds of creatures. And in the ſame view, a divine decree relative to ſin in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, and ſuch a diſpoſal of things in the ſyſtem, as ſhould be followed with this event, wholly by the fault of the creature, was neceſſary.</p>
            <p n="4">4. SIN hath taken place in this lower world, by the fault of man, according to the determinate counſel and foreknowledge of God. And, in unſearchable wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, he hath deviſed a method, that of redemption by Chriſt, according to which mercy can be exerciſed in the ſalvation of ſinners, conſiſtently with juſtice, and to the honor of the divine law and government. It there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:024750_0026_0FC8651556489ED0"/>
belongs to God—is his eſſential prerogative to beſtow mercy on whom he pleaſes, and inflict deſerved puniſhment on whom he pleaſes. Mercy on thoſe, in his unſearchable wiſdom, he finds it beſt ſhould be made the ſubjects of mercy: And puniſhment on the reſt, the veſſels of wrath fitted to deſtruction, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured with much long ſuffering.</p>
            <p>By this it is demonſtratively evident, That the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the character, &amp; diſpoſal of the ſtate and circumſtances of creatures, particularly the eternal ſtate of men, is God's peculiar province, and eſſential prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative. That it belongs to him originally, and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendently; is what he cannot be diveſted of by any, and indeed is that of which he cannot diveſt himſelf: It being eſſential as abſolute perfection, involving juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and mercy, is eſſential; and the denial of it, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the denial of divine exiſtence.</p>
            <p>ARG. III. GOD actually hath mercy on ſome, and hardeneth others, Therefore it belongs to him to have mercy on whom he will and to harden whom he will.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THE fact is certain, becauſe it is aſſerted in the Holy Scriptures. He hardened <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his <hi>ſervants</hi> to their deſtruction. He had mercy on <hi>Paul,</hi> and many <hi>others</hi> have been the ſubjects of his ſaving mercy. The fact cannot be queſtioned, unleſs we will queſtion the truth of the Bible.</p>
            <p n="2">2. IF it be ſo done in a few inſtances or a ſingle inſtance of each ſort; it may be done in more, <hi>even</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s many as God ſees fit and beſt. And as the weight of objection, ſuppoſing any are diſpoſed to object, muſt lie againſt his hardening whom he will; becauſe it may be fairly preſumed none will find fault, that God exerciſes ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving mercy, except it be in this point of light, that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes it, toward ſome &amp; not others, thoſe toward whom he exerciſes it, being no leſs guilty &amp; ill-deſerving, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent to the exerciſe thereof, than thoſe in whoſe favor he doth not exerciſe it. But this will bring the
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:024750_0027_0FC865186A9E0CA8"/>
objector to the other point, whom he will he harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. I ſay, then, If God doth harden any—doth ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of things in the ſyſtem that they are hardened to their eternal deſtruction, as teſtimony concerning fact evinces he hath done. Then it belongs to him, it is his province ſo to do. For he never did, and it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble he ever ſhould act out of his real province, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his eſſential prerogative. It alſo follows; that it is his prerogative to harden whom, and as many as he will. For, if the thing itſelf implies any oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to abſolute perfection—the holineſs of the Deity; ſuch oppoſition will be implied in a ſingle inſtance. And if one inſtance doth not imply oppoſition; neither will two, ten, or ten thouſand; becauſe ten thouſand nothings are nothing.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By what hath been ſaid it is manifeſt; that from the inſtance of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the <hi>other</hi> inſtances men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the context, with great propriety the Apoſtle drew the conſequence. Therefor hath he marcy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eneth. If he hardened <hi>Pharaoh</hi> he may harden <hi>whom</hi> he will. There can be nothing to object againſt his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, let him do it in another, and ever ſo many other inſtances, as many as he pleaſes; any more than there is for his having done it in that inſtance.</p>
            <p>WE muſt therefore prove, that he did not harden <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and that he never hath hardened <hi>any</hi>; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the conſequence will follow, let us make ever ſo many, attempts to evade it.</p>
            <p>ARG. IV. THE potter hath power over the clay, of the ſame lump to make one veſſel unto honor, &amp; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to diſhonor. Therefore it belongs to God to have mercy on whom he will, and to harden whom he will.</p>
            <p>THIS illuminating proof is ſuggeſted by Paul himſelf as an anſwer to the objection ſtated thus, verſe 19. "Thou wilt ſay unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? for who hath reſiſted his will?" After having ſaid, "Nay but O man, who art thou that replieſt againſt
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:024750_0028_0FC8651B388E6C90"/>
God? Shall the thing formed ſay to him that formed it, Why haſt thou made me thus? He adds, "Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the ſame lump to make one veſſel unto honor, and another unto diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor?"</p>
            <p>THE ſame compariſon is frequently uſed to repreſent God's ſovereign power and uncontroulable authority in his diſpoſal of men and things. Iſaiah ſaith XLV. 9. "Woe unto him that ſtriveth with his maker, <hi>Let</hi> the potſherd <hi>ſtrive</hi> with the potſherds of the earth. Shall the clay ſay to him that faſhioneth it, What makeſt thou? or thy work, He hath no hands?" And Jeremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah, XVIII. 2—7. "Ariſe and go down to the potter's houſe, and there I will cauſe thee to hear my words. Then I went down to the potter's houſe, and, behold he wrought a work on the wheels. And the veſſel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter; ſo he made it again another veſſel, as ſeemed good to the potter to make it. Then the word of the LORD came to me ſaying, O houſe of Iſrael, cannot I do with you as this potter? ſaith the LORD. Behold, as the clay <hi>is</hi> in the potter's hand, ſo <hi>are</hi> ye in mine hand O houſe of Iſrael."</p>
            <p>HERE ſeveral things may be obſerved. As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. THE potter acts in regard to the clay juſt as he pleaſes. He holds no conſultation with it; and if he ſhould the clay could not inform him what is proper to be done. He only conſults himſelf; he forms his own plan; he moulds and faſhions the clay according to his own ſkill, and pleaſure. Of the ſame lump he makes ſome into larger ſome into ſmaller veſſels; ſome into one ſhape, ſome into another, ſome he deſigns for this, ſome for that purpoſe, juſt as he will—as he conceives will beſt anſwer his own ends; in diſplaying his work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip, or in gaining profit.</p>
            <p n="2">2. IN this affair no one pretends to find fault. It is readily granted by all that the potter hath power over the clay; that it belongs to him—is his unqueſtionable
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:024750_0029_0FC8651F4BAA1968"/>
prerogative to faſhion the clay as he pleaſeth.</p>
            <p n="3">3. IT appears from the above cited paſſages, That as clay is in the potter's hand; ſo are men, and all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the hand of God. And that there is no room to queſtion his power, right and prerogative, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of them as he pleaſeth; any more than to queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the power the potter hath over the clay, to mould and faſhion it as he pleaſeth.</p>
            <p n="4">4. WE may add, that this figure is not ſufficient to give a full idea. Nor can any ſimilitude be introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that will every way anſwer the purpoſe: Becauſe it is a prerogative abſolutely without a parallel. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps no figurative illuſtration can be deviſed, better adapted to render the idea clear and familiar, than that of the potter and clay. But this fails. For, Should, it be aſked, What right hath the potter to the clay? The anſwer muſt be. He hath not an original underiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> &amp; title to it. The potter doth not make the clay, he only faſhions the clay already made to his hand; and made by God, as alſo was the potter himſelf. Therefore the potter hath not a right to the clay, as he would have, were he the maker of it. God grants him liberty to uſe the clay himſelf hath formed. So that it is only in a ſecondary ſenſe, and by derivation the potter hath the leaſt right to make uſe of clay for his work. Whereas the divine right and propriety in all creatures and things is abſolutely original, and wholly underived. And it ought to be remembered, that men are at an infinitely greater diſtance from God than the clay is from the potter. And that he hath infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more important deſigns, to be accompliſhed in his diſpoſal of men and things; than the potter hath in forming different veſſels from the ſame lumps.</p>
            <p n="5">5. WE may therefore argue from the leſs to the greater. If the potter hath power over the clay, of the ſame lump to make one veſſel unto honor, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unto diſhonor: Much more doth it belong to God to determine the character, and diſpoſe of the eternal
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:024750_0030_0FC86526CE587858"/>
ſtate of men as he pleaſeth. It belongs to him in a much higher degree, and in the moſt abſolute ſenſe. And it appears, that God exerciſes condeſcention, when he compares his power and prerogative to that of the potter over the clay: Becauſe, although there is ſome likeneſs; yet it repreſents the caſe only in a very faint manner. However, as no one pretends to queſtion the right of the potter to make what veſſel he pleaſes, and appropriate them to his own purpoſes: much leſs ought any to diſpute God's right to beſtow his ſaving mercy on whom he pleaſes, and withhold it from whom he pleaſes.</p>
            <p>ARG. V. EVERY poſſible <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>otheſis reſpecting the determination of the character and diſpoſal of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſtate of men, except that which is reſolved into the wiſdom, and good pleaſure of the Deity, is weak and inſufficient if not impious and abſurd. Therefore it belongs to God—is his eſſential prerogative to have mercy on whom he will <hi>have, mercy,</hi> and to harden whom he <hi>will harden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To finiſh the ſeries of argumentation. Let us for once ſuppoſe, That God doth not claim it as his inalie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable prerogative to determine the character, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of the ſtate and circumſtances of creatures; and in particular the character, and eternal ſtate of the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals of the human race. And then aſk, Who doth or ſhall determine and order ſuch a variegated, infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly important ſcene of things? And conſider withal what the probable; yea certain conſequence muſt be. In doing this it may be expected. That they who attend without prejudice, and with becoming ſeriouſneſs and care, will be throughly convinced of the folly and abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of denying, or calling in queſtion, the divine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative to have mercy on whom he will, and to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den whom he will.</p>
            <p>I WOULD premiſe, That this ſuppoſition ought not to be admitted a ſingle moment, in any other view, than to manifeſt the falſhood, the vaſt abſurdity of that doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:024750_0031_0FC8652BA0E635F0"/>
which teaches, that it doth not belong to God to exerciſe a wiſe and holy ſovereignty in the ſalvation and damnation of ſinners. And this is to ſay, it doth not belong to God to exerciſe his juſtice and mercy as he pleaſes—as he ſees it to be neceſſary, and beſt they ſhould be exerciſed. Unleſs I miſtake the point en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely, it doth, appear by what hath been ſaid that there is no room to make the ſuppoſition, as though God might conſiſtently relinquiſh his claim to ſuch a prerog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ative. For, if the precedent reaſoning be just, it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely eſſential and inalienable. It ſo belongs to God, that he cannot relinquiſh it any more than he can deny himſelf; can diminiſh his perfection, which would be the ſame as to undeify himſelf.</p>
            <p>WITH this premiſed let us proceed. If it doth not belong to God to determine the character, and aſcertain the eternal ſtate of men, the queſtion will return. To whom doth it belong?</p>
            <p>IN the firſt place. "Is this to be determined and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by the ſkill and power of ſome created being, or by the united deliberations, the joint conſent of finite intelligencies?"</p>
            <p>IT is very weak indeed to imagine this great affair may be determined and ordered by any one created be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Gabriel alone is not ſufficient. And there is no room to ſuppoſe the united deliberations of finite intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligencies, not thoſe of the human kind; Becauſe they come into exiſtence by ſucceſſion, and only a few are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live on earth at once. And ſhould the ſuppoſition only comprehend thoſe who are alive on earth at once. It would be impracticable for them to meet together, and unitedly conſult and determine who ſhould, and who ſhould not be the objects of ſaving mercy. Moreover, if they could meet together, and the affair, in reſpect to each individual, might iſſue, according to the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination in which they ſhould be united; there is not the ſhadow of a probability they would unite. Their various ſelfiſh biaſes, and deſigus would neceſſarily,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:024750_0032_0FC8652D12F16938"/>
and effectually prevent an agreement.</p>
            <p>IN the next place, "Shall we ſuppoſe it is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of the angels to determine and order who of the human race ſhall be ſaved, and who ſhall be left to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh?" But what angels? The good? Or the bad? Or ſhall we ſay? That the good angels determine how many, and who of the human kind ſhall be the ſubjects of ſaving mercy. The evil angels how many, and who ſhall be hardened to their deſtruction."</p>
            <p>IN regard to the evil angels it may be obſerved. That they fain would have all without exception hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened and deſtroyed. And are unwearied in their attempts to accompliſh the eternal ruin of mankind. Are repreſented going about as roaring lions ſeeking whom they may devour. Not for the ſake of juſtice, the ſupport of government, and vindication of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine character; but to gratify their malice, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.</p>
            <p>As to the holy angels—They would find the affair ſo awful, ſo deeply involved, and attended with ſuch infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely important and eternal conſequences, as that they would not dare to attempt it, were it to be propoſed to them, and if they ſhould attempt, would find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves wholly unequal to it.</p>
            <p>IN the laſt place, "Shall we ſay this great affair is left to men themſelves? Each one is to determine and aſcertain his own character and eternal ſtate?" This indeed is not <hi>morely</hi> ſuppoſed; but aſſerted, and <hi>ſtren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly</hi> inſiſted upon by many. It is not as God wills and diſpoſes; but as men themſelves will and order. There are who ſay, "Men ſhall be bleſt as far as man permits; A nature Rational implies the power Of being bleſt or wretched as we pleaſe. Heaven wills our happineſs, allows our doom; Heaven but perſuades, Almighty man decrees; Man is the maker of immortal ſates."</p>
            <p>IF this ſuppoſition ſhould fail; I apprehend it will be
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:024750_0033_0FC8652E9629A908"/>
allowed that every other hypotheſis muſt be given up.</p>
            <p>CONCERNING what is now before us, it may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to mention ſeveral things, and proceed by ſteps. Here then.</p>
            <p n="1">1. IT may be granted, That it was referred to <hi>Adam</hi> (as far as any ſuch thing could be referred to a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) to determine his <hi>own,</hi> and the character and ſtate of his <hi>poſterity.</hi> It is certain, however, that Adam had not that liberty of indifference, that ſelf-determining power, that power of originating volitions, which is urged by many as being eſſential to moral agency; and neceſſary to render the volitions and actions of men worthy of praiſe, or blame. Becauſe ſuch power and liberty is no where to be found, in men, angels, or the Deity; the very notion being abſurd. Real perfect indifferency in ſuch a ſtate of mind as takes away the very idea of will or inclination. And to ſuppoſe a power to chooſe without motive, and <hi>even</hi> againſt the ſtrongeſt motive, or motives, is to ſuppoſe a power to do nothing. For without motive there can be no choice; becauſe motive is implied in chooſing. It is in reality to ſay, men have a power to chooſe without chooſing, without being able to chooſe any thing. And if a real indifferency might be ſuppoſed without abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity it would be evil—ſinful. For there ought to be no indifference, reſpecting holineſs, in the hearts of moral agents. To return,</p>
            <p>IT may be granted; that, in a low qualified ſenſe, it was referred to <hi>Adam</hi> to determine his <hi>own,</hi> and the character and ſtate of his <hi>poſterity.</hi> And we well know the iſſue of that trial was ſin and ruin. As the affair ſtood at the firſt fail of man: <hi>Adam,</hi> and all the <hi>human race</hi> would have been hardened, to <hi>his,</hi> and <hi>their</hi> eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal deſtruction, if not prevented by a ſpecial divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE work of redemption by Chriſt hath opened the way to prevent the eternal deſtruction of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man kind. But it is ever to be remembered, that the
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:024750_0034_0FC865315ACA5278"/>
work Chriſt finiſhed on the Croſs, in itſelf conſidered, doth make no alteration in the ſtate of mens minds. The bias of their minds, while unregenerate, is only in favor of ſin. Certainly it is not in favor of holineſs: For then there would be no need of being born again. And our Saviour did not prea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> and inculcate the truth when he ſaid, "Except a man be born again he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee the kingdom of God." Were the deciſion, therefore, to be left to men themſelves, as the caſe now ſtands, they would determine in favor of ſin, of perſevering oppoſition to God; would reject ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, unleſs they might be ſaved in their own way, and on their own terms. And truly, the very mercy—the ſalvation itſelf, holineſs being eſſential thereto and as it were the whole thereof, would be rejected on whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver terms it might be propoſed. And ſo the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence would be no ſalvation: but deſtruction to the whole race: notwithſtanding what Chriſt hath done, and ſuffered to procure redemption.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THE way of recovery and ſalvation by Chriſt being revealed, offers made, and calls given to men; Should it be conceded, that ſome may poſſibly be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon to accept the propoſals of the Goſpel, without any ſpecial ſupernatural influence to change their hearts, and captivate them to the obedience of Chriſt: Yet, it muſt be uncertain, whether any would comply. It might turn out ſo in event, that Chriſt ſhould not ſee his ſeed; not ſee of the travail of his ſoul, and be ſatisfied; and might have none finally to preſent to his Father. In a word, his death, as to its ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving effects, might be wholly fruſtrated.</p>
            <p n="4">4. THIS will lay us under a neceſſity of maintaining that God (with awe may it be ſpoken) hath projected a vague plan—a plan ſome of the moſt important parts of which are undetermined—a plan full of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty —the event of which himſelf could not know before hand; although it is ſaid, "Known unto God are all his works, from the beginning." For, if there is no
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:024750_0035_0FC86532593287F0"/>
certainty who ſhall, and who ſhall not be ſaved, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be known who ſhall ſhare the ſaving effects of divine mercy. Becauſe the previous certainty of an event is implied in the knowledge, or foreknowledge of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent. For, to know that an event ſhall take place when it is uncertain that it will take place, and may never take place, is a contradiction in terms. And it is no limitation of divine knowledge to ſay, God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not know that which is unknowable; any more than it is a limitation of divine power to ſay, God cannot do that which is impoſſible—that which implies an abſurd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity. For, as the latter is not the object of power; ſo neither is the former the object of knowledge.</p>
            <p n="5">5. FROM this view of things it appears to be no ways ſitting, that the determination of the character, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of the eternal ſtate of men ſhould be left to men themſelves; nor to any created beings. And if it were, the utmoſt uncertainty and confuſion would be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. And as God could not know what would be the event of things in the ſyſtem; he might be brought to vary and ſhift, to alter and amend; ſo as to accomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date himſelf to the fickle changing humors of creatures. The folly and abſurdity of which doth clearly evince, that it belongs to God to determine the character, and diſpoſe of the eternal ſtate of men according to his own wiſdom, and good pleaſure.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="38" facs="unknown:024750_0036_0FC8653584C4FE38"/>6. As without this ſuppoſition, the ſyſtem of things is a chaos, without any conſiſtent deſign: So when we admit the idea, He hath determined, and aſcertained the character, and eternal ſtate of men according to his wiſe and holy will; it appears at once, there is order, connection and effect. JEHOVAH takes, and fills the throne—acts in character of a glorious independent ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign —hath a plan of operation ſettled—knows what he is about to effect—can ſpeak of things that are even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, as if they were already in event—has the iſſue ſo determined as to be liable to no diſappointment—his counſel ſtands, and he doth all his pleaſure. Hence,</p>
            <p n="7">7. THIS dilemma is unavoidable. Either the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hath no will, no pleaſure reſpecting the ſalvation, and damnation of the individuals of the human race, or his counſel doth not ſtand; Unleſs it be true that he hath mercy on whom he will have mercy, and harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth whom he will; as fully and definitively as hath been mentioned.</p>
            <p>To ſay his counſel doth not ſtand, is not only to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the ſpirit, and expreſs letter of the ſcriptures by a daring contradiction. But is alſo to affirm in effect, that "the bleſſed and only Potentate" is liable to mutation; is ſubjected to caprice, multiplied beyond expreſſion; and expoſed to experience and leſs diſappointment.</p>
            <p>ON the other hand; to ſay he hath no will, no pleaſure reſpecting the character and eternal ſtate of men, is as much as to ſay, he is unconcerned in regard to what takes place in this part of the ſyſtem. And we may as well ſay he is unconcerned in regard to what takes place in another, and in every other part of the univerſal ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem. Or ſay he hath no ſyſtem, no plan of operation. And for any to urge, "That the divine will is conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal. There is nothing definitively fixed in the divine mind reſpecting the individuals that ſhall be ſaved, and that ſhall periſh: Only this in general: He is reſolved to have mercy on all who repent, and to harden and deſtroy all thoſe who remain impenitent. And this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſum of his will and counſel: he not only hath a will in the matter; but his counſel muſt ſtand, let it fall as it may with the individuals of the human race." I ſay, to urge this will afford no relief. Becauſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is implied in God's having mercy on any, in the ſenſe of the text; and impenitence continued to the laſt is implied in his hardening whom he will. To ſay God is determined to have mercy on whom he will, leſs or more, on ſuppoſition they repent; when, at the ſame time, his having mercy compriſes their repentance on whom he will have mercy. And to ſay God is doter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to harden whom he will, leſs or more, on ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:024750_0037_0FC86536C3859C80"/>
they remain impenitent; when impenitence is what is meant by being hardened, is plainly abſurd—is, abſolutely, ſaying nothing to the purpoſe. By this it may be ſeen, that there cannot be any conditional de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree or determination in the divine mind, reſpecting his having mercy on ſome, and hardening others.</p>
            <p n="8">8. THEREFORE on the whole. Since a denial that it belongs to God—is his eſſential prerogative to have mercy on whom he will <hi>have mercy,</hi> and to harden whom he will; is ſo full of weakneſs, and abſurdity. Since there are no other beings to whom it doth or can belong. And ſince the admiſſion of this ſets God upon the throne; ſubjecting the materials and the intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al world, to his authority and will. And in fine, leads us to ſee how his own, which are the wiſeſt and beſt ends, may be certainly and infallibly accompliſhed. We ought to be eſtabliſhed in a clear conviction, and full perſuaſion of this great truth: That it belongs to God—is his eſſential prerogative to determine the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and diſpoſe of the eternal ſtate of men; in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſalvation; or in ſin, and damnation, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his own good pleaſure.</p>
            <p>THE THIRD PART. Containing anſwers to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, and an improvement of the ſubject.</p>
            <p>I APPREHEND the following are the moſt conſiderable objections any can pretend to advance againſt what hath been ſtated and urged.</p>
            <p>OBJ. I. "THE preceeding repreſentation muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be contrary to truth, and is really chargeable with blaſphemy: For it makes God the author of ſin."</p>
            <p>ANS.1. IF, by author of ſin, is meant acting, loving ſin, or being a ſinner; to ſay God is the author of ſin would be full of blaſphemy. And any ſcheme any ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent fairly implying this, ought to be rejected with the greateſt abhorrence. What hath been ſaid upon the ſubject implies no ſuch thing. It is not aſſerted, that God is the creator of ſin. It is not ſaid, he wills ſin, as deſiring it to take place, for its own ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e. And
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:024750_0038_0FC865389B42F548"/>
the divine agency and diſpoſal are not concerned in the event, in any ſuch ſenſe, as to render the ſinning crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture leſs to blame than he would be, ſhould ſin take place, without any divine agency and diſpoſal reſpecting it.</p>
            <p>Now when all theſe ideas are removed, ſhould any inſiſt that God's hardening whom he will doth make him the author of ſin; he muſt be the author of it, without any thing criminal being implied, or any denial of his infinite holineſs, his abſolute perfection, And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, without any thing to be faulted, to be object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt with any really colourable pretext.</p>
            <p n="2">2. SINCE the phraſe, author of ſin, is odious, and calculated to excite the prejudices of mankind againſt any doctrine. It may not be uncharitable to ſuppoſe, there are who ſtrenuouſly inſiſt, that the taking place of ſin, and the damnation of sinners, in conſequence of any divine decree and diſpoſal; makes God the author of ſin, and the ruin of his creatures, on purpoſe to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice the minds of men, againſt admitting ſuch doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine. And in event, againſt what the ſcriptures plainly and unequivocally declare, and <hi>even</hi> urge, as being eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential in the plan of the divine counſels and works.</p>
            <p n="3">3. IF to have ſin, as an event, comprehended in the divine plan, and ſuch a diſpoſal of things in the ſyſtem that a certain number ſhall be hardened in wickedneſs, entirely by their own fault, to their eternal deſtruction, makes God the author of ſin: Then, that God is the author of ſin is implied in what hath been ſtated and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended. But, what is there in this to diſguſt an inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive, unprejudiced mind? In this caſe, it would be a harmleſs, miſapplied epithet—miſapplied; becauſe the word author is calculated to convey ſome other idea, and prejudice the mind againſt the doctrine—yet harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; becauſe, in reality, it would not imply the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of blame, or any thing wrong on God's part.</p>
            <p n="4">4. WILL, the objector inſiſt, "that ſin in event was not comprehended in the divine plan. And that God
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:024750_0039_0FC8654100702308"/>
meant every way as much as poſſible, to guard againſt and prevent ſuch an effect?"</p>
            <p>HE may as well ſay there was no plan, &amp; there is no divine diſpoſal; and deny there is any ſuch thing as moral evil in the ſyſtem. But the fact is clear and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſputable: Sin has taken place, and is conſtantly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king place in this world. And it is fact that ſin takes place under the divine government. God, therefore, hath not interpoſed ſo as to prevent ſin taking place.</p>
            <p>FROM this it follows. Either <hi>firſt.</hi> That God did not deſign effectually to prevent ſin taking place. Or <hi>ſecondly.</hi> That he was not able to accompliſh his own purpoſe. And certainly, it is too much for any to ſay he could not poſſibly have prevented it. But, if any will inſiſt that he did deſign to prevent it, and has fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in accompliſhing his purpoſe. Then it will follow <hi>thirdly.</hi> That he is diſappointed. Becauſe diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment conſiſts in this very thing, a rational being not reaching, not accompliſhing his intention and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Moreover, the diſappointment, in this caſe, muſt needs be great, vaſtly ineffably great. So that, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this doctrine the counſel of God, inſtead of ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, is broken and deſtroyed in inſtances and ways in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable.</p>
            <p n="5">5. IT will not avail any thing to ſay, "That, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſin was not comprehended in God's original plan; and it has taken place contrary to his intention and will in every view: Yet, upon the taking place of ſin, in his unſearchable wiſdom, he hath deviſed a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod to defeat the ſinner; to vindicate and eſtabliſh his character and government moſt fully and moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly; and in the end gain by diſappointment, of which ſin is the occaſion, in the fruſtration of his original plan and ſcheme of things." For this in effect would be a denial of his eternal exiſtence, and abſolute per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; a denial of his omniſcience, omnipotence, and immutability. For, if ſomething hath taken place which he did not comprehend before, he cannot be
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:024750_0040_0FC8654492820598"/>
"the high and loſty One that inhabiteth eternity." And if he has changed his original plan he muſt be a metable being; and not that father of lights—that fountain of knowledge, excellence, power and glory "with whom is no variableneſs, neither ſhadow of turning." This therefore, is a futile impious evaſion; full of atheiſm and blaſphemy.</p>
            <p n="6">6. IT is evident that the work of redemption is more glorious than any, than all the other works of God. In the contrivance and execution of which there is the clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and fulleſt exhibition of the divine character. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the diſplay of perfection therein to be made, and the good thereby to be produced, was the ultimate end of creation. Now to deny this was comprehended in the divine plan is to deny, that the moſt illuſtrious diſplay of perfection, and that in reference, and ſome ſort of ſubſervience to which all other divine works are done, was comprehended therein. Which is a weakneſs, and an abſurdity too groſs to be admitted a ſingle moment. But, if the work of redemption was comprehended in the divine plan ſin was comprehended therein: becauſe the work of redemption ſuppoſes, and neceſſarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies ſin. For without ſin there would have been no room, no need of atonement for ſin. If there had been no ſinners, loſt periſhing creatures, in the nature of the caſe, there could be no ſaviour of ſinners. If God had not been diſhonored his character could not be vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by the obedience, and death of Chriſt. There would have been no opportunity for the united, and contraſted diſplay of vindictive juſtice, and redeeming meray. Therefore, by excluding ſin in event from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <pb n="43" facs="unknown:024750_0041_0FC86547735E48A8"/>OBJ. II. ACCORDING to what hath been advanced "it is neceſſary that ſome ſhould be hardened to their deſtruction. If ſo, liberty is deſtroyed; men are <hi>mere</hi> machines; and there can be no reaſon to impute guilt and blame to them."</p>
            <p n="1">ANS. 1. I THROW ſeveral ideas and different ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions into this objection; becauſe they ſeem to be united, and will ſtand or fall together. For, if men are moved and acted like a wind mill, or a watch, there is no liberty—no moral agency. And if there is no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and moral agency doubtleſs men are not to blame; and there can be no reaſon to impute guilt when they commit, what are called, the groſſeſt crimes. And finally, the doctrine of a natural abſolute neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and fatality muſt be admitted. But none of theſe horrid conſequences do follow from this poſition, He hardeneth whom he will. Men are not machines, are not acted like machines when they are hardened in ſin: For they are voluntary, they move and act of choic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Whereas in a <hi>mere</hi> machine there is no volition, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> acted upon; but doth not act, doth not put forth any exertion. There is then, an eſſential difference. A <hi>mere</hi> machine cannot exercise liberty, cannot be to blame; becauſe it has no deſign, no volition. But God in hardening ſinners doth not influence them in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch manner, as to prevent ſin being their own act— or to prevent their actins of choice. And becauſe they act voluntarily, reſpecting that which is evil and make the evil their own, they are to blame, are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without excuſe. Sinners are not compelled to do wickedly. Whatever extrinſic influence there may be in the production of volition it is not of the nature of compulſion. For we mean by compulſion, that power which effects a thing againſt, or at leaſt, without our will and conſent. But there is nothing of this. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath it been maintained that God infuſeth hardneſs into men. There is no neceſſity, therefore, of mens' ſinning at all, and remaining under the power of luſt,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:024750_0042_0FC86548D2B2ED20"/>
of any ſuch kind as will exculpate them; as will exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate their ſin and guilt in the loweſt degree, by taking away their liberty.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE moſt hardened ſinners are, to all intents, moral agents and accountable; becauſe they act freely. And the more hardened they are the other criminal; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this is no more than voluntarily and freely acting wickedneſs to a higher degree.</p>
            <p n="3">3. ALTHOUGH there is, in ſome ſenſe, a neceſſity of being hardened when it is ſaid, "Whom he will he hardeneth" i. e. a neceſſity of a moral kind—a certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: yet this is no ſuch neceſſity as is oppoſed to liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The greateſt certainty or moral neceſſity may be conſiſtent with the higheſt liberty. It is neceſſary God ſhould act in a holy manner; yet he acts with the moſt perfect freedom. And there is a certainty that the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified ſaints will be holy and happy forever; by which their liberty, their moral agency will not be deſtroyed, or infringed; but confirmed, and exalted.</p>
            <p>OBJ. III. "THE ſentence, Whom he will he harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth as it hath been ſtated, implies a denial of the divine holineſs. For the moral law is a tranſcript of the divine perfections; diſcovers the heart—the will and pleaſure of the Deity. He <hi>there</hi> forbids ſin upon pain of his eternal diſpleaſure, and repreſents it to be that abominable thing which his ſoul abhors. But, if ſin was comprehended in his plan and diſpoſal of things it muſt be agreeable to his mind that ſin ſhould take place. And it is falſe to ſay, He is of purer eyes than to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold iniquity: for he muſt, according to this doctrine, behold it with complacency rather than abhorrence; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is hischoice &amp; the conſequence of his diſpoſals.</p>
            <p n="1">ANS. 1. IF the ſentiment which has been advanced doth really imply a denial, or any repugnancy to the holineſs of the Deity, it ought to be rejected. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly God is a holy being, infinitely holy. With the greateſt propriety do Seraphim, and Cherubim cry, "Holy, holy, holy <hi>is</hi> the LORD of hoſts." So that
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:024750_0043_0FC8654B96399B10"/>
no ſentiment that denies God's eſſential infinite purity is to be endured 2 moment. Alſo, ſin is diametrically oppoſite to holineſs—is what God muſt neceſſarily hate with perfect deteſtation. Evil doth not, cannot dwell with him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THERE is no denial of holineſs in ſaying, God wills the event; or wills not effectually to prevent ſin taking place, and diſpoſes things ſo as not effectually to prevent it. Indeed this is ſo far from implying a deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of holineſs, that his will and diſpoſal in reference to ſin is entirely holy—is done in the exerciſe of his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite purity. And his perfect hatred of ſin itſelf is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied therein. For,</p>
            <p n="3">3. A DISTINCTION is to be made between God's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive, and decretive providential will. The Bible teaches us to make ſuch a diſtinction. And it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to reconcile what otherwiſe might appear to be ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcileable. A diſtinction of this kind is evidently implied in what is ſaid, reſpecting the conduct of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s;eph's</hi> brethren, in ſelling him to the <hi>Iſhmaelites</hi>—In what is ſaid reſpecting the king of <hi>Aſſyria</hi>—and the part the <hi>Jews</hi> acted in the crucifixion of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Now were ſin in event as contrary to the decretive and providential, as ſin itſelf is to the preceptive will of God; we may be ſure it never would take place, on ſuppoſition there was no poſſibility of preventing it. And to ſay there was no poſſibility is to limit the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power. But God certainly could prevent it, if no other way, by withholding exiſtence. And this he no doubt would do rather than ſin ſhould take place, were ſin in event, as contrary to his providential, as it is to his preceptive will.</p>
            <p n="4">4. WHATSOEVER takes place through the ſyſtem from beginning to end, takes place in conſiſtence with the decretive and providential will of God; but ſin takes place in perfect <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>noſition to his preceptive will. From which it doth not follow, that the decree is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnance to the command—it doth not follow, that
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:024750_0044_0FC865522B42C4A0"/>
God's will in the former caſe oppoſes his holy will in the latter—it doth not follow that God hath two wills thwarting each other. Were there a real oppoſition inſiſting on the diſtinction would run us into the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichean hereſy, or what would be as groſs. And would even amount to a denial of divine exiſtence. For God is one and ever conſiſtent with himſelf in all he purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, faith and doth. Let me add,</p>
            <p n="5">5. THERE may be a clear ground for diſtinction where there is no oppoſition. Order and harmony im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply diſtinction; but no oppoſition, So that while the exerciſe of one and the ſame, will of the Deity is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, it is and may appear, <hi>even</hi> to our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, perfectly harmonious.</p>
            <p>HERE it may be urged. "Sin is in full oppoſition to the preceptive will of God. And it appears that his preceptive will is holy; becauſe it forbids, and by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding oppoſes ſin. But the providential will of God, as allowed above, is in favor of ſin taking place. Now if this doth not imply a contradiction, What doth or can? For, if that <hi>will</hi> which forbids ſin be <hi>holy,</hi> that <hi>will</hi> which decrees and gives it event muſt be <hi>unholy.</hi>"</p>
            <p>REPLY. THERE is no oppoſition. The will of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity in both is perfectly holy: For, although God deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined not to prevent the taking place of ſin, and doth diſpoſe things in the ſyſtem ſo as not effectually to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it; and the certain conſequence of his not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting it is, that ſin doth take place by the creatures fault: Yet his decretive providential will is not at all in favor of ſin itſelf; doth not imply a diſpoſition to be pleaſed with ſin or any the leaſt approbation of it; but the contrary. Sin is conſidered by God, in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree and providence relative to it, as being perfectly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and hateful. And as ſuch by him to be oppoſed. Perhaps the matter may be rendered more intelligible, and ſatisfactory to ſome, by expreſſing it <hi>thus.</hi> The will of Deity, in his decree and diſpoſal of things rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to ſin, doth not fix upon and cleave to ſin, as its
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:024750_0045_0FC865534D476DE8"/>
               <hi>object.</hi> Properly ſpeaking ſin is not the <hi>object</hi> in view; the <hi>object,</hi> ſtrictly ſpeaking, is that which the mind reſts upon—that which is <hi>ultimate.</hi> The divine mind doth not terminate on ſin; but his own <hi>glory,</hi> and the final eſtabliſhment and reign of <hi>holineſs</hi> to be accompliſhed, through his overruling wiſdom and providence, by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of ſin taking place. And as the advancement of holineſs, and the divine glory were ultimate in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeing ſin, and in all the diſpoſals of his providence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latively to it: So his decretive providential will, muſt be perfectly holy, and entirely concordant with his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive will.</p>
            <p>SHOULD any, hoping to evade, or greatly embarraſs this reply, aſk, "Why may not God command his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to ſin with a view to his own glory, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of holineſs; as well as decree ſin in event with ſuch a view? Alſo, Why may not creatures com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſin, they having the ſame thing in view, that God is ſaid to have in decreeing it—to give him occaſion by their oppoſition eventually to honor himſelf, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh holineſs? And in ſine, Why may not ſinners expreſs their good will in ſinning, as it is inſiſted God expreſſes his good will in permitting ſin to take place?"</p>
            <p>To all that can be urged in any ſuch line this will be a ſufficient rejoinder. That Paul has obviated and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled with indignation a ſimilar inſinuation, as if it were a juſt conſequence from the doctrine lie had advanced. See Rom. III. 7.8.</p>
            <p>MOREOVER, it is a plain abſurdity, a manifeſt contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. The caſe ſtated or ſuppoſed, in the above queries, deſtroys itſelf. For in ſinning the <hi>love</hi> of evil is implied: But none can love evil, which neceſſarily implies the <hi>hatred</hi> of good, an overlion to holineſs, with an ultimate view to that <hi>good</hi>—that <hi>holineſs</hi>— To ſay this is an evident contradiction: Whereas in God's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeing ſin, and his diſpoſal of things no <hi>love</hi> of evil is implied; but a perfect <hi>hatred</hi> thereof, &amp; a determination to counteract its bad tendency. &amp; bring good out of evil.
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:024750_0046_0FC86554C68C0A68"/>
Or thus. Creatures in ſinning ultimately regard <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi> This eſſentially belongs to the idea, the true deſcription of ſin. Now it is a contradiction to ſay creatures may ultimately regard <hi>themſelves,</hi> with an ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate view to the <hi>glory</hi> of God. And it is equally ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd to ſay, God may require creatures ultimately to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard <hi>themſelves,</hi> in a view to their ultimately regarding or glorifying <hi>himſelf,</hi> in that very regard they bear to <hi>themſelves.</hi>

            <p>OBJ. IV. "If God hath mercy on whom he will, and hardeneth whom he will, in the ſenſe which hath been ſtated, he is the moſt tyrannical being in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe: For it repreſents him as exerciſing an odious partiality in his treatment of his creatures—As making a multitude of rational beings on purpoſe to damn them.

            <p>ANS. SUCH kind of language, which many are free to uſe under the notion of diſcrediting God's ſovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in his decree and diſpoſal of things, is calculated to fire the imagination, and inflame the paſſions; but not to convince the reaſon and conſcience. The doctrine itſelf, rightly underſtood, is not calculated to excite ſuch ideas, or prompt men to uſe ſuch language, And it greatly behoves thoſe who do not admit the doctrine to take heed how they paſs their cenſures upon doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, too plainly revealed in the Scriptures to be queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned with propriety, much leſs to be denied and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culed; leſt they ſhould be found fighters againſt God. —If this may not be taken as ſufficient to refute the objection, which in what hath been ſaid, is viewed rath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er as a cavil than a ſerious objection.

With them, to act in a ſovereign manner is the ſame as to act without reaſon and propriety; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt reaſon and juſtice. And they may have been led to blend theſe together, by conſidering what commonly is exhibited in the character of thoſe who take the ſtile of earthly ſovereigns and potentates. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious tyranny and deſpotiſm, the greateſt injuſtice and cruelty being exerciſed by them, in ſporting with the fortunes and lives of men to gratify their pride and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition. But were it allowed, that there is no proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in calling any mortal advanced to a throne a ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign. And ſhould all who are ſo called prove tyrants, this would not make ſovereignty and tyranny the ſame: Becauſe the abuſe of ſovereignty doth not make ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty to be the ſame with tyranny. Therefore, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are uſed to blend theſe together, it is owing to their weakneſs or prejudice. God is an abſolute ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign. This is no other than to ſay, He has an origin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al inalienable right and propriety in all things to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of them as he pleaſes.

But God doth and there is perfect propriety he ſhould determine who ſhall be the objects of his favor, and who the ſubjects of his wrath according to his own wiſdom and pleaſure, without aſking counſel of any.

God will certainly inflict endleſs puniſhment upon finally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent ſinners: Yet he doth not delight in the death of ſnners. "He hath ſworn by his own life, that he delighteth not in the death of him that dieth." He is induced to puniſh them by conſiderations of wiſdom, propriety, juſtice and neceſſity.

The ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent advanced is not denied by ſaying, "In every nation he that feareth God, and worketh rightcouſneſs is accepted with him:" Becauſe it is true, that they in every nation on whom God hath mercy do, or will fear

            <p>WHEN a judge favors one and condemns another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the law, the rule by which characters, well and ill deſerving are to be decided, and ſentence to paſs; for inſtance when he paſſes ſentence from repoſſeſſion, or ſome wrong bias, as being nearly related, or having received a bribe, he is a reſpecter of perſons, is guilty of a mean odious partiality. So; if God ſhould beſtow his mercy on one <hi>merely</hi> becauſe he is a <hi>Jew,</hi> and refuſe it to another becauſe he is a <hi>Gentile,</hi> the <hi>Gentile</hi> having the ſame qualification with the <hi>Jew</hi> by complying with the condition required. And more evidently and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently ſtill, the <hi>Gentile</hi> complying, and the <hi>Jew</hi> refuſing a compliance. He would then be a reſpecter of perſons in a truly objectionable ſenſe.</p>
            <p>Now, although for a judge to act as hath been repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented would imply a criminal partiality: Yet the ſame perſon, or any other not a judge, having an eſtate and no natural heir, might ſelect one, or a few juſt as he ſhould pleaſe, on whom to confer his eſtate; and no one would have a right to tax him with being a reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of perſons, becauſe he did not bequeath it to all without diſcrimination. And if ſuch a prerogative is allowed to men, in reſpect to what they poſſeſs, and call their own, ſhall not God beſtow his ſpecial favors on whom he pleaſes, without the imputation of being an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious reſpecter of perſons?</p>

            <p n="1">ANS. 1. GOD is perfectly ſincere in the offers he makes and the invitations he gives to ſinners. He is as ſerious, ſincere and kind in making the offer of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to thoſe who do not and never will accept, as he is, in making it to thoſe who do accept. And his having mercy on whom he will, and hardening whom he will doth not militate againſt this in the leaſt. God doth not trifle with ſinners when he invites them to accept of ſalvation, any more than he doth when he commands men to be holy as he is holy. His calls and invitations are authoritative; they point out what is good, &amp; in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf deſirable. This implies, that he is as willing all ſhould comply with his calls, as he is, that all ſhould o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey him. God looks upon himſelf really and greatly ſlighted, diſhonored and undervalued by their refuſal. And that he has good reaſon to diſlike and puniſh the ill treatment of thoſe who ſcornfully, and obſtinately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject them. Therefore,</p>
            <p n="2">2. I SAY again, the ſentiment advanced doth not mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate againſt the divine ſincerity at all: Becauſe the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent has no concern with the calls and offers of the Goſpel, in the ſenſe put upon them by the objector.

               </gap>e kindneſs and ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as if God knew the offers would be moſt cordially accepted. And his having mercy on ſome, by diſpoſing them to accept, is a diſtinct thing, and ſuperadded to the calls and offers themſelves. Therefore, although it is readily conceded, that much greater kindneſs is exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by God towards thoſe on whom he hath mercy, by making them willing in the day of his power, than to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe who are not made willing: Yet this great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er mercy is not exerciſed in the calls that are given, the offers that are made; but in reſpect to the offers, and the arguments uſed to induce a compliance, there is preciſely the ſame kindneſs and ſincerity towards all.</p>
            <p n="2">2. GOD might be ſincere in making the offer to all on ſuppoſition none did, and not one ever ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it. <hi>Even</hi> as he is ſincere, ſerious and earneſt in requiring the ſubjection and obedience of all thoſe who are in a ſtate of unregeneracy; although none in that ſtate do yield any cordial ſubjection and obedience to his commands, and he knows perfectly well that they will not. Alſo, their not doing it is as much the reſult of the divine decree and diſpoſal, as hardening whom he will to their deſtruction is the reſult of his decree and diſpoſal. Therefore,</p>
            <p n="3">3. WE may as well ſay, God acts ſarcaſtically, and tantalizes his creatures when he requires their ſubjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

and obedience, they being and remaining indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to yield obedience, as that he doth ſo when he makes offers, they being indiſpoſed to accept them. Now this is as much as to ſay. The will, the inclination of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures is the meaſure of their obedience. If they have no inclination to obey, there is no reaſon they ſhould be required to obey. And this <hi>again</hi> is as much as to ſay.

            <p>OBJ. VI. "THIS is a gloomy uncomfortable doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine calculated to lead men; eſpecially awakened ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to deſpair: Or elſe to ſtifle their convictions. The natural tendency of it is to render means and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors vain and uſeleſs. For, if it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth: If the unregenerate may not lay any claim to ſaving mercy after all their moſt painful ſeekings and ſtrivings: If there is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain number on whom God will have mercy, and a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain number whom he will harden to their deſtruction— to what purpoſe can it be to ſeek and ſtrive? Each ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner may ſay. If I am to be ſaved, I ſhall be ſaved, and if I am to periſh I ſhall periſh, let my exertions be as they may. And ſince it is not left with men to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine their own character, and aſcertain their eternal ſtate; but it hangs on a decree and diſpoſal which they cannot fruſtrate; let them ſtand ſtill, and ſee what God means to do, whether to ſave or to damn; and give themſelves no exerciſe and concern about that which doth not belong to them; and which to ſay that it doth belong to them implies a denial of God's eſſential, ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>able prerogative."</p>
            <p n="1">ANS. 1. IT is true, that the doctrine is calculated
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:024750_0053_0FC8656DB35A58D8"/>
to lead men to deſpair of help from themſelves; and to ſee the vanity of priding themſelves in thoſe diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in which mankind are exceedingly diſpoſed to glory. To ſhut out all boaſting, and make men know that ſalvation is of God <hi>alone.</hi> It is true accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this doctrine, and many other things revealed in the Holy Book, that the unregenerate do not, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lay God under any obligation to ſave them, by their exertions. Nor will any of their exertions render their ſalvation certain. Their ſalvation, if they are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, will not be the proper fruit of their exertions; but <hi>wholly</hi> the effect of ſovereign mercy. So that, this doctrine being true, men muſt be brought to renounce dependence on themſelves <hi>altogether,</hi> and ſubmit to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ſovereignty.</p>
            <p n="2">2. ALL this notwithſtanding; the doctrine is ſo far from being gloomy, and calculated to drive men, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly awakened ſinners to deſpair, that it is their only proper ſource and ground of hope. It is the hinge, on which the door turns from deſpair to a ray of hope. For were it not ſo, that God hath mercy on whom he will have mercy there would be no hope at all. Or whatever expectations might be raiſed, would be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than deceiving preſumptions. It is moſt falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and prepoſterous for ſinners to think they can, by their doings, confer any obligation upon God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend themſelves as worthy of his regard. The unregenerate do not remove; nor leſſen their guilt by their exertions. Therefore, if God could, or would not exerciſe his ſaving mercy, unleſs by their ſtrivings unregenerate ſinners ſhould recommend themſelves to his favor; there abſolutely would be no ground of hope; their caſe would be remedileſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ly deſperate.</p>
            <p>BUT ſince the way is open for God to have mercy on whom he will have mercy; ſinners whoſe minds are exerciſed about their eternal concerns need not deſpair. They are in the hand of a holy and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="56" facs="unknown:024750_0054_0FC8657467AF60C8"/>
although they find that they have ſinned exceedingly; find themſelves ever ſo guilty, ill and hell-deſerving; yet God can, and it may be, he will have mercy upon and ſave them. Add to this,</p>
            <p n="3">3. IF any are awakened, and ſolicitouſly inquiring after God and ſalvation, it is more probable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And more probable; than that it is intended for others who are going on careleſſly and daringly in ways of impiety. Becauſe; before God viſits ſinners with ſaving mercy, he is wont to bring them into an exerciſing ſituation. And if any continue to give themſelves no concern about their ſouls, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ſalvation, it is a token of dereliction.</p>
            <p n="4">4. THERE is not the leaſt ground from the doctrine to ſay, If we are to be ſaved we ſhall be ſaved let us live as we may, and whether we take any pains or not. Becauſe repentance, faith, and obedience are implied in, or will certainly follow the exerciſe of ſaving mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, whenever it is beſtowed upon any. And it is pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pably abſurd to ſay, If God purpoſeth to have mercy on ſuch an one he will have mercy upon him, although he ſhould remain careleſs and impenitent, and continue to live in wickedneſs to the laſt; becauſe repentance is compriſed in God's having mercy. For this would be to aſſert, and at the ſame time deny his having mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, in the ſenſe intended.</p>

               <p>WHAT I intend by abſolute ſovereign, and what I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend has been generally meant is, that God hath an original right and propriety in all things, to diſpoſe of them as he pleaſes. And in regard to mankind to diſpoſe of them as he pleaſes. In <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ing a ſovereign and acting as an abſolute ſovereign, were there, implied a diſpoſition to act blindly, unwiſely, raſhly, and unjuſtly, it would be altogether improper to call God a ſovereign; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is contrary to infinite perfection that he ſhould act ſo, in any inſtance. But that God who is infinitely wiſe, holy juſt &amp; good, who is the creator of all things, and the high poſſeſſor of heaven and earth, ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of all creatures as he pleaſes, is perfectly fit and ſuitable. To act as an abſolute ſovereign is to act in character; and ſhould he act otherwiſe, he would, act beneath himſelf, and not like God over all. His ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty is neceſſary; and no more to be relinquiſhed than his God-head and Lordſhip. So that for any to deny this prerogative is, in effect, to deny the divinity.</p>
               <p>THEREFORE it is not a mere ceremony, an empty name and title. And it is by no means a matter of but ſmall moment, whether we allow him this character or not. But the queſtion with many will be, how far we are to conceive the ſovereignty of the divine being doth extend: And particularly whether it belongs to God, as an eſſential inalienable prerogative, to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the character, and diſpoſe of the eternal ſtate of men according to his own wiſdom and good pleaſure.
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:024750_0058_0FC8658409472710"/>
                  <hi>Here</hi> many will admit no ſuch thing as a divine deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination and diſpoſal, except it be merely conditional, inſiſting that it is left with men themſelves to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine their own character, and fix their own eternal ſtate. Now to deny God the exerciſe of ſovereignty, in regard to this, is to deny him the exerciſe of that glorious prerogative, in one of the moſt illuſtrious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plays of it. And it is certain, that he has aſſerted his ſovereignty in reſpect to this, as fully and unequivocal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as he hath in regard to any point whatſoever. He faith, "I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compaſſion on whom I will have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion. <hi>It is</hi> not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that ſheweth mercy. Therefore, hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, &amp; whom he will be hardeneth. Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the ſame lump to make one veſſel unto ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and another unto diſhonor! <hi>What</hi> if God willing to ſhew <hi>his</hi> wrath, and to make his power known, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured with much long ſuffering the veſſels of wrath fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to deſtruction; and that he might make known the riches of his glory on the veſſels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory? And not only the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures, but the dictates of unbiaſed reaſon alſo clearly evince the truth of this great doctrine. To e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh your minds in a conviction and perſuaſion of this truth has been one principal deſign of the foregoing diſcourſe. May I not with propriety, as a deduction therefrom, call for your aſſent? And urge that you do not perſiſt in making oppoſition to the doctrine? For certainly, it is a doctrine of great importance, and not to be oppoſed without extreme hazard. This is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative—a part of the divine glory, which God will not give to another.</p>
               <p>III. WE may learn the importance not only of aſſenting to the doctrine of divine ſovereignty, but alſo, of being cordially reconciled to it.</p>
               <p>IT is not ſufficient that we aſſent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> it as true; it is
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:024750_0059_0FC8658582704480"/>
alſo neceſſary that we conſent to it as right and good. A diſtinction is to be made between aſſent of mind, and conſent of heart. The reaſon and conſcience may be convinced, while the heart <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oth not approve. Although diſtaſte, diſappro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ation of heart hath a tendency to blind, and warp the reaſon and conſcience, (men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with difficulty made to believe, what they do not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ove ſhould be true:) Yet light and evidence may be ſo clear and cogent, as to engage an aſſent of the mind. Although they fain would, men may not be able, to gainſay ſome diſagreeable truths. The hearts of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are oppoſed to an acknowledgment of the juſtice of God, in that ſentence of his law which is annexed to tranſgreſſion: Yet conviction may be ſo powerful as to make it ſtand clear in their conſciences, that it would be juſt in God to execute the ſentence upon them. The wicked at the day of judgment will without doubt be fully convinced of the truth and juſtice of that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. "Then every <hi>objecting</hi> mouth <hi>ſhall</hi> be ſtopped, and all the world ſhall become guilty before God."</p>
               <p>Now as the doctrine is not only true, but alſo excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly important, wherein the divine character and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor are very nearly and deeply intereſted and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we ought both firmly to believe, and cordially to embrace it. None ought to view themſelves as being truly reconciled to God, unleſs they are reconciled to his holy ſovereignty. Or to what is really implied in his ſovereign authority and uncontrollable dominion. By the influence of inſenſible prejudice and miſtake ſome may poſſibly diſlike the term, and yet heartily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the thing intended. If any are in this predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I ſhould be diſpoſed to embrace them with cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality; looking upon them miſtaken, and not ſtubborn. But there is reaſon to apprehend that a great, if not the greater part of thoſe who object to the doctrine, do it from real diſtaſte and hatred. They cannot bear the Deity ſhould be repreſented as cloathed with ſuch ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign authority and power. They chooſe to take
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:024750_0060_0FC865870C8F7440"/>
the throne themſelves rather than bow and ſubmit to him who is, by natural and eſſential right, "King of kings and lord of lords." They reſent with acrimony the idea of God's determining the character, and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the eternal ſtate of men as he pleaſes. They who do thus are the enemies of God.</p>
               <p>SHOULD it be urged, "that by this ſtroke, many of the moſt amiable character and engaging behaviour are cut off, and in effect doomed to deſtruction. Many ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, ſerious perſons: and conſtant in their attendance on divine inſtitutions; in meditation and prayer, in reading and hearing the word."</p>
               <p>To this it may be anſwered; that for any to wiſh needleſſly to cut off, or diſturb perſons of ſuch a deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would argue a very baſe rancorous diſpoſition: but if the truth doth cut them off, they muſt be cut off. And it would be the greateſt kindneſs to make them ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that they muſt be finally cut off and ſent to hell, unleſs an eſſential alteration doth take place in the frame of their minds. It is ſadly true, that among the civil and externally well behaved, too many do diſrelish and reject ſuch doctrine. And it is alſo true, that morality, as it is commonly called, never did, and never will ſave any man. Let it be valued as highly, as in any conſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence with reaſon and Scripture it can be done; ſtill ſomething elſe, ſomething farther is abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Who more virtuous and well behaved, in the common acceptation of ſuch words, than the young ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler mentioned by the Evangeliſts? Yet he refuſed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the ſelf-denying propoſal made to him by our ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. All ſelf-righteous perſons are oppoſed to the ſovereignty of God; and many of them have a very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable exterior: But this doth not render their inſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion leſs criminal or leſs dangerous.</p>
               <p>SHOULD it be urged on the other hand, "That among the licentious and proſtigate there are to be found, not a few, who will patronize ſuch doctrine."</p>
               <p>IN regard to ſuch it may be replied; that although
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:024750_0061_0FC86589EE336480"/>
they abuſe, they do not prove the doctrine to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true; nor to be, in itſelf conſidered, of a bad tendency. All the doctrines, pertaining to the glorious grace of God in the ſalvation of men by Chriſt, are apt to be abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by ſinners; but let them turn the grace of God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to laſciviouſneſs, as they may, and many do, the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines ſtand firm, and unſhaken notwithſtanding.</p>
               <p>IT may and ought to be aſſerted, in reſpect to all, who through real hatred make attempts to evade, and all, who directly oppoſe the doctrine of divine ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty, that they are not reconciled to God; are not his true friends; are not in favor with him; but are, in very deed his enemies, and obnoxious to his wrath, how high ſoever their hopes may be raiſed; and how ſanguine ſoever their confidence of obtaining eternal life may be. Men are as far from faith in Chriſt, and obtaining ſalvation as they are from embracing the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of divine ſovereignty, in its juſt extent.</p>
               <p>IV. WE may infer, that want of ſubmiſſion to God's ſovereignty, and the objections <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> his uncontrollable dominion muſt be owing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> that is criminal, and very wrong.</p>
               <p>SOME pretend a high regard to Deity, and concern for the honor of the divine Majeſty; and may be ready to ſay, "by all the regard we owe a Deity, and moral governor ſuch doctrine ought to be rejected." And I am not about to deny their ſincerity. But that men do not embrace the doctrine muſt be owing to their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, their pride, their ſelfiſhneſs. Many are inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible what it is to be creatures; what it is to be ſinners. That ſpirit of ſelf dependence, ſelf importance, gods half ſelf-made ſo much cultivated by mankind is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace to human nature. God will, and ought to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted: Men are diſpoſed to exalt themſelves. And in this lies a main point of controverſy between God and men. Their high thoughts, and reaſoning imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons prevent a compliance with the propoſals made to them in the word of God. Theſe muſt be brought into
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:024750_0062_0FC8658E75DD7978"/>
ſweet captivity to the obedience of the Goſpel of Chriſt, elſe ſalvation cannot be obtained.</p>
               <p>V. WE may learn what is neceſſary to remove ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections from the hearts of men, and effect a real recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation to God.</p>
               <p>IT is not to be effected by making men perſuaded in the firſt place, that their ſins are forgiven; that Chriſt died for them in particular; that the divine mercy hath been, or will be directed towards them in diſtinction from others; that God hath the ſame partial fondneſs for them they have for themſelves. If is not to be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by their doing thoſe things, the doing of which they truſt, will recommend them to the divine accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and favor. Neither is it to be effected by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of arguments and motives, moſt appoſite and weighty, and by theſe working upon thoſe ſprings and principles in the unregenerate which are unconnected with real holineſs. Their ſelfiſhneſs remaining in its full ſtrength will forever prevent a reconciliation, men muſt become meek, humble, benevolent. With ſuch a diſpoſition they will be led to ſee and feel, that "it is every way proper and fit, the government and diſpoſal of all creatures and things ſhould be, and remain in the hands of infinite wiſdom, power and goodneſs." All this is to ſay, that to effect a real cordial reconciliation men "muſt be born again—born, not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, BUT OF GOD."</p>
               <p>VI. THE ſubject preſents a criterion by which men may try themſelves, and come to know what manner of ſpirit they are of, know their true character and ſtate.</p>
               <p>THE Scriptures draw the line which ſeparates friends from foes with ſufficient clearneſs and exactneſs. It is true many flatter themſelves that they are reconciled to God, who moſt certainly are not. But this ſeems to be principally owing to their drawing a wrong character of Deity in their minds, which they call God, and becauſe they are pleaſed with the character they have drawn, and falſely applied, they imagine they are reconciled to
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:024750_0063_0FC86591CF682EF0"/>
God, and accepted to favor with him. Were we to go through the world, and ſtate the claims of JEHOVAH; draw his titles properly, and aſſert his authority and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, in their fulneſs and extent; we ſhould not find very many doubting and halting. A great, if not the greater part would object and find fault. As we are in regard to reliſhing and approving the <hi>true</hi> character of God; ſo are we in <hi>reality</hi>; ſo are we in reſpect to our <hi>true</hi> character and ſtate.</p>
               <p>THEREFORE, let every of us apply the ſubject by a careful examination. Let each one put the queſtion to himſelf ſeriouſly and cloſely. Am I reconciled to the divine character? to the holy ſovereignty of God? Doth it ſeem proper, and fit that he ſhould have mercy on whom he will have mercy, and harden to their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal deſtruction whom he will? And do I find myſelf wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſubmit all to his arbitrament without any reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation?</p>
               <p>"SHOULD any aſk, what is intended by All?" I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, Our lives, our circumſtances on earth, and the vaſt concernments of eternity.</p>
               <p>AT this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>me may boggle and ſtart. "What ſubmit our eternal concerns to the divine deciſion. Perhaps he will not have mercy upon me, may one and another ſay, but pour his vengeance upon my devoted head. Submit to this! I will not. I cannot. It is the ſame as being willing to be damned, which none can, no one ought to be."</p>
               <p>IF being willing to ſuffer the damnation of hell is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in a true ſubmiſſion and reconciliation to God; ſuch willingneſs would certainly be right, fit and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. I have not ſaid it is implied; neither do I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that it is. To me it is a very uncouth phraſe. The damned will be the eternal enemies of God, as well as ſuffer great torment. Submiſſion to divine ſov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ereignty cannot imply a willingneſſ to be his eternal e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy; becauſe it is abſurd. Or thus, The damned do not, and never will cordially ſubmit to the ſovereignty
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:024750_0064_0FC865948DE94B68"/>
of God. So that inſubmiſſion—an eternal refuſal to ſubmit belongs to the character and state of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. But it is a contradiction to ſay, that ſubmiſſion im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies inſubmiſſion, or a willingneſs to be eternally oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to a ſubmiſſion. To return. It is neceſſary that men ſee, feel, and own, that God might juſtly caſt them off, and make them completely miſerable to all eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And be of a diſpoſition to ſay, Let all heaven for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever love, and adore the infinitely glorious Majeſty; although we ſhould receive our juſt deſerts, and periſh forever. Poſſibly, ſome may come on and ſay, "did we know that God had a deſign to exerciſe his ſaving mercy towards us in particular, we would ſubmit the deciſion to him." This, as I ſhould be ready to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them, would be no ſubmiſſion at all. And yet it is true, that God will exerciſe his ſaving mercy towards all who do cordially ſubmit, or rather, cordial ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and reconciliation implies the actual exerciſe of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving mercy. If men's uncircumciſed hearts are hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and they accept the puniſhment of their iniquities they need not fear a rejection. At the ſame time, it is evident that God's having mercy upon a particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon cannot be the idea—the ground on which he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits and becomes reconciled. Becauſe, that God hath or will have mercy upon any one in particular, cannot be known until a ſubmiſſion is actually made. To ſay that a ſubmiſſion is made upon this idea, that God hath or will have mercy, when this cannot be known until an actual ſubmiſſion hath taken place is a contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in terms. In true ſubmiſſion men reſolve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the will of God; and make a ſurrender to his diſpoſals with no more than this: It may be he will have mercy; and if he doth not he is perfectly juſt and divinely glorious.</p>
               <p>LET ſecure profane ſinners, and all ſelf-righteous perſons be rouſed from their lethargy, and renounce their vain hopes; be awakened to attention, to due conſideration, and unfeigned repentance; before it is
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:024750_0065_0FC86597730A3920"/>
too late. Know for certain that you are in an extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hazardous ſituation; "in the gall of bitterneſs, &amp; in the bond of iniquity." And may, for ought you know, be ſtruck dead and ſent to hell any day, hour, or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And that ſo long as you remain careleſs, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on your own exertions, there is not the leaſt proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect you will obtain mercy and ſalvation.</p>
               <p>LET awakened ſinners be cautioned againſt the innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable deluſions, to which they are expoſed; againſt miſtaking convictions of conſcience for ſpiritual illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and godly ſorrow; and a forced humiliation for cordial ſubmiſſion. And ſee that you do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent yourſelves with loving God from any ſelfiſh, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial conſiderations. Be reconciled to God, as God.</p>
               <p>AND let penitent believers in Chriſt upon whom it hath pleaſed God to have mercy, "ſhew forth the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of him who hath called <hi>them</hi> out of darkneſs into his marvellous light, by denying ungodlineſs and worldly luſts; by living ſoberly, righteouſly, and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in this preſent world."</p>
