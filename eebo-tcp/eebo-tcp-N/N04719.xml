         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <hi>Georgia,</hi> and one or two more having taken Orders, the Intereſt of METHODISM, as it was then and is now term'd, had vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly declined, and very few of this repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly mad Way were left at the Univerſity. This ſomewhat diſcouraged me at Times, but the Lord JESUS ſupported my Soul, and made me eaſy by giving me a ſtrong Convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that I was where He would have me to be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> My Degree I ſoon found was of Service to me, as it gave me acceſs to thoſe I could not be free with when in an inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or Station, and as Opportunity offer'd, I was enabled to converſe with them about the Things which belonged to the Kingdom of GOD.—The Subſcriptions for the poor Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners (which amounted to about <hi>Forty Pounds</hi> per Annum) were ſoon put into my Hands—Two or Three ſmall Charity Schools, maintained by the <hi>Methodiſts,</hi> were under my more immediate Inſpection, which, with the Time I ſpent in following my Studies, private Retirement, and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Converſe, ſweetly filled up the whole of my Day, and kept me from that unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable, but too common, Complaint of having any Time hang upon my Hands.

the poor Priſoners, and employing ſuch as could work, I found was of admirable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice:—For hereby they were kept from that worſt of Goal diſeaſes, Idleneſs; and were not only convinced that we bore a good Will towards them, but alſo laid as it were under an Obligation to hear the Inſtructions we gave them from time to time.—This practice was firſt taken up by the Meſſrs. <hi>Weſleys,</hi> and would to God all Ordinaries of Priſons would Copy after their good Example—They would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve well of the Common-wealth, and if actuated by the Love of God, would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a glorious Reward from him who hath ſaid, <hi>I was ſick and in Priſon, and ye came unto me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In a ſhort Time I began to be more than content in my preſent State of Life. God was pleaſed to be with me of a Truth,—My Strength was proportioned to my Day, and I had thoughts of abiding at the Univerſity, at leaſt for ſome Years, to finiſh my Studies, and do what good I could amongſt the poor deſpiſed Methodiſts.—But <hi>God's Thoughts are not as Man's Thoughts, neither are our Ways as his Ways.</hi>—By a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of unforeſeen, unexpected and unſought

for Providences, I was called in a ſhort Time from my beloved Retirement to take a Journey to the Metropolis of <hi>England.</hi>—Whilſt I was an under-Graduate, amongſt other religious Friends, I was very intimate with one Mr. <hi>B—n,</hi> a profeſſed <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodiſt,</hi> who had lately taken Orders, and was Curate at the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London.</hi>—With him, when abſent, I frequently correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and when preſent took ſweet Councel, and walked to the Houſe of God as Friends. He mention'd me to that late good and great Man Sir <hi>John Philips</hi>—And being called down for a while into <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> he wrote to me to be of good Courage, and in the Strength of GOD, bid me haſten to Town to officiate in his Abſence, and be refreſhed with the Sight and Converſation of many who loved me for CHRIST'S ſake, and had for a long Time deſired to ſee me—</p>
                  <p>On <hi>Wedneſday Auguſt</hi> 4th, (the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners being provided for by the coming of Mr. <hi>Harvy,</hi> another young worthy Methodiſt that had lately taken Deacon's Orders) with fear and trembling I obeyed the Summons, and went in the Stage Coach to <hi>London.</hi>—There being no other Paſſenger, I employed my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, a good Part of the Way, in earneſt Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:005886_0008_10275DD5E6BB67C0"/>
to the God of all Grace to be my Guide and my Comforter; at the ſame Time I could not help praiſing him for chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Heart and calling me to preach the Goſpel at a Place to which, not many Years ago, I would have given much Money, would my Circumſtances have permitted, to have went up and ſeen a Play. In the Evening I reach'd the Tower, and was kindly received by my dear Friend—The remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Week was ſpent in viſiting Sir <hi>John Philips,</hi> &amp;c. who were too glad to ſee me.—But God ſent me ſomething to ballaſt it.—For as I paſſed along the Streets many came out of their Shops, admiring to ſee ſo young a Perſon in a Gown and Caſſock. One I remember in particular cryed out, "<hi>There's a Boy Parſon.</hi>"—which, as it ſerv'd to mortify my Pride, put me alſo up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on turning that apoſtolical Exhortation into Prayer, "<hi>Let no Man deſpiſe thy Youth.</hi>"</p>
                  <p>On <hi>Sunday Auguſt</hi> 8th, in the Afternoon I preached at <hi>Biſhop-Gate</hi> Church, the large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of which, and the Congregation toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, at firſt a little daſhed me; but by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting to God, and conſidering in whoſe Name I was about to ſpeak, my Mind was calm'd and I was enabled to preach with
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:005886_0009_10275DD8C7EE6158"/>
Power.—The Effect was immediate and viſible to all; for as I went up the Stairs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all ſeem to ſneer at me on Account of my Youth; but they ſoon grew ſerious, and exceedingly attentive, and after I came down ſhewed me great tokens of Reſpect, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed me as I paſs'd along, and made great Enquiry who I was—The Queſtion no one could anſwer, for I was quite a Stranger.

                  <p>Here I continued for the Space of two Months, reading Prayers twice a Week, cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſing and preaching once, beſides viſiting the Soldiers in the Infirmary and Barracks, daily. I alſo read Prayers every evening at <hi>Wapping Chapel,</hi> and preached at <hi>Ludgate</hi> Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon every Tueſday—God was pleaſed to give me favour in the Eyes of the Inhabitants of the Tower—The Chapel was crowded on Lord's Days—Religious Friends from divers Parts of the Town attended the Word, and ſeveral young Men came on Lord's Day Morning, under ſerious Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, to hear me diſcourſe about the <hi>New-Birth, and the Neceſſity of renouncing all in Affection, in order to follow JESUS CHRIST.</hi>

After I had been about a Month in Town, Letters came from the Meſſrs. <hi>Weſleys,</hi> and the Rev'd Mr. <hi>Ingham</hi> their Fellow-La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer, <hi>an Iſraelite indeed,</hi> from <hi>Georgia.</hi> Their Accounts fired my Soul, and made me even long to go abroad for God too—But having no outward call, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as I then thought, too weak in Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ever to undertake a Voyage to Sea, I endeavour'd to lay aſide all Thoughts of going abroad,—But my Endeavours were all in vain—For I felt at Times ſuch a ſtrong Attraction in my Soul towards <hi>Georgia,</hi> that I thought it almoſt irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible.—I ſtrove againſt it with all my Power, begged again and again with many Cries and Tears, that the Lord would not ſuffer me to be deluded, and at length opened my Mind to ſeveral dear Friends—All agreed that Labourers were wanted at home, that I had as yet no viſible Call abroad, and that it was my Duty not to be raſh, but wait and ſee what Providence might point out to me—To this I conſented with my whole Heart, and having ſtayed in <hi>London</hi> till Mr. <hi>B—n</hi> came out of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, I returned to my little Charge at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and waited upon my Deaconſhip accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <p>But Oh what a delightful Life did I lead there! What Communion did I daily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy with God! And how ſweetly did my Hours in private glide away in reading and praying over Mr. <hi>Henry'</hi>s Comment upon the Scriptures! Whilſt I am muſing on and writing about it, the Fire I then felt again kindles in my Soul—Nor was I alone happy—For ſeveral dear Youths were quickened greatly, and met daily at my Room to build up each other in their moſt holy Faith—God raiſed up Friends for our temporal Support—The late Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable <hi>Betty Haſtings,</hi> that Elect Lady, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed ſome of them two or three ſmall Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions.—I alſo partook of her Ladyſhip's Bounty; and a Gentleman, whoſe Heart was in an eſpecial Manner knit to me when laſt at <hi>London,</hi> was ſtirred up, without being ſollicited, to ſend me not only Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for the Poor, but alſo a Sufficiency to diſcharge Debts I had contracted for Books before I took my Degree. Upon his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation, I was choſen a correſponding Member of the Society for promoting Chriſtian Knowledge, which I rejoiced in, as it gave me an Opportunity of procuring

And ſuppoſing the worſt, as I muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily return to take Prieſt's Orders, it would then be left to my Choice, whether I would fix in my Native Country, or go abroad any more—Theſe Things being thoroughly weighed, I at length reſolved within myſelf to embark for <hi>Georgia;</hi> and knowing that I ſhould never put my Reſolution into Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice

if I conferred with Fleſh and Blood, I wrote to my Relations to inform them of my Deſign, and withal told them, <q>if they would promiſe not to diſſuade me from my intended Voyage, I would come and take a perſonal leave of them; if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, knowing my own Weakneſs, I was determined to embark without viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them at all.</q> A few Days after Mr. <hi>Kinchin</hi> came to <hi>Dummer</hi> and introduced Mr.<hi>Harvy</hi> into the Cure—I appriſed them of my Intention—They gave me ſome friendly Council, and having ſpent the beginning of <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> ſweetly together, and taken an affectionate leave of the <hi>Dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>-People, I returned once more to <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> to bid adieu to my Friends, who were as dear to me as my own Soul—My Reſolution at firſt a little ſhocked them, but having reaſon to think, from my Relation of Circumſtances, that, I had a Call from Providence, moſt of them ſaid, "<hi>The Will of the Lord be done.</hi>"—</p>

God gave me Honour for a while, even in my own Country—I preached twice on the Sabbaths. Congregations were very large, and the Power of God attended the Word; and ſome I have reaſon to believe were truly converted, who will be my Joy and Crown of rejoicing in the Day of the Lord JESUS.—</p>
                  <p>In about three Weeks I went to <hi>Briſtol</hi> to take leave of ſome more of my Relations who lived there. As it was my conſtant Practice, go where I would, to attend on the daily publick Offices of the Church, I went, the <hi>Thurſday</hi> after my coming, to hear a Lecture Sermon at <hi>St. John'</hi>s Church. Whilſt the Pſalm was ſinging, after Prayers, the Miniſter came to my Seat, and asked
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:005886_0018_10275DF10E6B21B0"/>
me to give the Congregation a Sermon. Having my Notes about me, I complyed. The Hearers ſeem'd ſtartled, and after Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon enquiry was made, who I was? The next Day there was another Lecture at <hi>St. Stephens.</hi> Many crowded thither in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of hearing me again. The Lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turer asked me to preach as the other did the Day before. I again complyed, and the Alarm given here was ſo general, that on the following Lord's Day, many of all denominations were obliged to return from the Churches where I preach'd, for want of Room. Afterwards I was called by the Mayor to preach before him and the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration. And for ſome Time following, I preached all the Lectures on the Week Days, and twice on <hi>Sundays,</hi> beſides viſiting the Religious Societies. The Word, thro' the Mighty Power of God, was ſharper than a two edged Sword. The Doctrine of the <hi>New Birth</hi> and <hi>Juſtification</hi> by <hi>Faith in Jeſus Chriſt</hi> (tho' I was not ſo clear in it as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards) made its way like Lightning into the Hearers Conſciences. The <hi>Arrows</hi> of <hi>Conviction</hi> ſtuck faſt; and my whole Time between one Lecture and another, except what was ſpent in neceſſary Refreſhment,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:005886_0019_10275DF54EC710D8"/>
was wholly taken up in talking with poor Souls under concern. Large offers were made me if I would ſtay at <hi>Briſtol;</hi> and many I believe would have almoſt plucked out their own Eyes to have given me! All wondered that I would go to <hi>Georgia,</hi> who might be ſo well provided for at home! And ſome urged, if I had a Mind to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert <hi>Indians,</hi> I might go amongſt the <hi>King'</hi>s-<hi>Wood-Colliers,</hi> and find <hi>Indians</hi> enough. But none of theſe Things moved me. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put my Hand to the Plow, I was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined thro' divine Grace, not to look back. And therefore, at length, I took my leave, but with what mutual Affection and Concern cannot eaſily be expreſſed.</p>
                  <p>During my ſtay at <hi>Briſtol</hi> I made a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Elopement to <hi>Bath,</hi> where I was kindly received by a Dear Friend the Rev'd Mr. <hi>Chapman,</hi> and ſome Elect and honourable Women who befriended the <hi>Oxford</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodiſts. I preach'd at the Abbey Church twice.—The late Doctor <hi>Cockman</hi> was pleaſed to thank me for my Sermon; and Application was made to me by ſeveral to print both my Diſcourſes. But I ſcarce al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed ſuch a Thought to enter, much leſs to lodge within my Heart.</p>

It was now about the middle of <hi>February. Lent</hi> was at Hand, and I was obliged to be at <hi>Oxford</hi> to perform the Remainder of my College-Exerciſe, which they call <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining.</hi> I went through <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> as it lay in my Way, and abode there a Week, viſiting the Priſoners, and encouraging the awakened Souls. Having ſtaid about ten Days at the Univerſity, I took, as I thought, my laſt Farewell of my Dear Friends, and came up to <hi>London</hi> in the Beginning of <hi>March,</hi> in order to wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>James Oglethorp</hi> 
                     <abbr>Eſq;</abbr> and the Honourable <hi>Truſtees.</hi> I was kindly received by both. The former introduced me to his Grace the preſent <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury;</hi> and the Rev'd Mr. <hi>Arthur Bedford,</hi> at the Deſire of the latter, (with whom I dined at their publick Anniverſary) went with me to the preſent Lord Biſhop of <hi>London.</hi> Both approved of my going abroad, the former was pleaſed to ſay, <q>He would take particular Notice of ſuch as went to <hi>Georgia,</hi> if they did not go out of any <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter</hi> View.</q> This put me upon enquiry what were my Motives in going?

                  </p>
                  <p>I continued at <hi>London</hi> about three Weeks, waiting for Mr. <hi>Oglethorp,</hi> who expected to ſail every Day. In this Seaſon I preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more frequently than when there before. Many more came to hear me, and the laſt <hi>Sunday</hi> I was in Town, I read Prayers twice, and preached four Times.—But find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mr. <hi>Oglethorp</hi> was not likely to go for ſome time, and having lain under particular Obligations to the Rev'd Mr. <hi>Sampſon Harris,</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Stone Houſe,</hi> in <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter-ſhire,</hi> I went down thither, at his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, to ſupply his Place, whilſt he came up to diſpatch ſome Affairs in Town.</p>
                  <p>Hither I had reaſon to think God ſent me in Anſwer to Prayer: For there was a little ſweet Society of ſeeking Souls, who had heard me preach at an adjacent Town, and wreſtled with God, if it was his Will, to ſend me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them. They received me with all Joy, and moſt of the Pariſhioners were very civil when I came to viſit them from Houſe to Houſe. Upon Examination I found them
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:005886_0022_10275D152E516C00"/>
more knowing than I expected. Their Paſtor had uſed to catechiſe the little ones in the Summer Seaſon, and expound the four Leſſons every Lord's Day in the Church. I followed his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> good Example, and found great Freedom and Aſſiſtance given me both in my publick and private Adminiſtrations. Having the Uſe of the Parſonage Houſe, I expounded every Night. Many that were not Pariſhioners came to hear, and were edified. On <hi>Sundays,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides expounding the Leſſons, catechiſing and preaching, I repeated my Sermons to the Society. Neither Church or Houſe could contain the People that came. I found uncommon Manifeſtations granted me from above. Early in the Morning, at Noon Day, Evening, and Midnight, nay all the Day long, did the Bleſſed JESUS viſit and refreſh my Heart. Could the Trees of a certain Wood, near <hi>Stone-Houſe,</hi> ſpeak, they would tell what ſweet Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion I and ſome more dear Souls enjoyed with the ever Bleſſed God there. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times as I have been walking, my Soul would make ſuch Sallies as tho' it would go out of the Body. At other Times I would be ſo overpowered with a Senſe of

I had been expounding to many People, and ſome being afraid to go home, I thought it my Duty to accompany them, and improve the Occaſion, to ſtir them up to prepare for the coming of the Son of Man. But O what did my Soul feel! In my return to the Parſonage Houſe, whilſt others were riſing from their Beds and frightned almoſt to Death, to ſee the Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning run upon the Ground, and ſhine from one Part of the Heaven unto the other, I and another, a poor, but pious, Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, were in the field, praying <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

on <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> Day, when I took my Leave, the Concern they ſhewed at my Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was inexpreſſible. Their Sighs and Tears almoſt broke my Heart.

                  <p>The Incumbent being returned from <hi>London,</hi> and the People of <hi>Briſtol</hi> having given me repeated Invitations, nay having inſiſted upon my coming again, ſince the Time of my embarking was deferred, On <hi>May</hi> 23d.

I preached as uſual about five Times a Week; but the Congregations grew, if poſſible, larger and larger. It was wonderful to

Sometimes almoſt as many would go away for want of Room as came in, and it was with great Difficulty I got into the Deſk to read Prayers, or preach. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of all Denominations flocked to hear. Perſons of all Ranks, not only publickly attended my Miniſtry, but gave me private Invitations to their Houſes. A private So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety or two were erected.

                     <hi>June</hi> 21<hi>ſt</hi> I took my laſt Farewell at <hi>Briſtol.</hi> But when I came to tell them, It might be, that they would <hi>ſee my Face no more,</hi> high and low, young and old

burſt into ſuch a Flood of Tears as I had never ſeen before; Drops fell from their Eyes like Rain, or rather guſhed out like Water out of the Stony Rock. Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes after Sermon followed me home weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and the next Day I was empoyled from Seven in the Morning till Midnight in talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and giving ſpiritual Advice to awakned Souls.</p>
                  <p>About three the next Morning, having thrown myſelf on the Bed for an Hour or two, I ſet out for <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> becauſe I heard that a great Company on Horſeback and in Coaches intended to ſee me out of Town. Some finding themſelves diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, followed me thither, where I ſtaid a few Days and preached to a very crowded Auditory. Then I went on to <hi>Oxford,</hi> where we had, as it were, a general Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouz of the <hi>Methodiſts;</hi> and, finding their Intereſt flouriſhing, and being impatient to go abroad, I haſtened away, after taking a moſt affectionate Leave, and came to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> about the End of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> I hope, in ſome Degree, thankful for the great Things the Lord had done for me in the Country.</p>
                  <p>Every Hour now ſeem'd a Week, and every Week a Year till I was embarked.</p>
                  <p>

I knew there was no Miniſter at <hi>Frederica,</hi> for which Place I was then appointed, and I did not care to be abſent longer from my proper Charge. Mr. <hi>Oglethorp'</hi>s going was ſtill retarded, and I had thought it my Duty to go immediately without him, had not he and my other Friends urged, that the Soldiers would ſhortly embark, and that I had beſt go over with them. This ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what pacified me, and having now taken a final farewel of all Friends in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, I was reſolved to abide at <hi>London,</hi> and give myſelf wholly to Prayer, the Study of the Scriptures, and my own Heart, till the Soldiers ſhould embark.</p>
                  <p>The Houſe I lodged at, was good old Mr. <hi>Hutton'</hi>s in <hi>College-ſtreet, Weſtminſter,</hi> where I had the Pleaſure of ſeeing my Dear Friend Mr. <hi>Ingham,</hi> lately returned from <hi>Georgia;</hi> and perceiving him, as I thought, remarkably grown in Grace. I long'd ſtill more to be ſent to the ſame School, hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to catch ſome of that Holy Flame with which his Soul was fired. We freely and ſolemnly converſed together about my Call abroad. It ſeem'd to both quite clear, though we could have wiſh'd, had it been the Divine Will, to have
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:005886_0028_10275D442D9E3130"/>
lived and died together. Our Hearts were knit to each other, like the Hearts of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Jonathan.</hi> At midnight we would riſe to ſing Praiſes to God, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede for the whole State of CHRIST'S Church militant here on Earth.</p>
                  <p>With this my Dear Friend, I one Day paid a Viſit to a worthy Doctor of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity near <hi>London,</hi> who introduced us to ſome Honourable Ladies, who, as I had heard, delighted in doing good. It being my conſtant Practice to improve my Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the Rich for the Benefit of the Poor, I recommended two poor Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and another pious Perſon to their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. They ſaid little, but between them, unknown to each other, they gave, I think, <hi>Thirty Six Guineas.</hi> When we came to the Doctor's Houſe and ſaw the Ladies Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, he ſaid, <q>If you had not ſpoke for others, you would have had a good deal of that yourſelf.</q> God gave me to rejoice that I had nothing, and the Poor all. The next Day, upon my return to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> in the firſt Letter that I opened, was a Bank-note of Ten Pounds, ſent from an unexpected hand as a preſent for myſelf. This I took as a Hint from Providence to
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:005886_0029_10275E0FEB6E7438"/>
go on doing good to others, with a full Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance that the Lord would not let me want. Bleſſed be his Name I have had many ſuch Inſtances of his tender Concern for my temporal, as well as my eternal Wellfare.</p>
                  <p>About this Time, thro' the Importuity of Friends, and Aſperſions of Enemies, I was prevailed upon to print my Sermon <hi>On the Nature and Neceſſity of our Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or New-Birth in CHRIST JESUS,</hi> which under God began the awakening at <hi>London, Briſtol, Glouceſter,</hi> and <hi>Glouceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire.</hi> The Diſſenters I found were ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized to ſee a Sermon on ſuch a Subject from a Clergyman of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and finding the Author came from <hi>Oxford,</hi> were ready to ſay, (how juſtly I will not determine) <q>
                        <hi>Can any good come out of</hi> Nazareth?</q> This Sermon ſold well to Perſons of all Denominations, and was diſperſed very much in many Parts both at Home and Abroad. A ſecond Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion was ſoon called for; and finding another of my Sermons was printed without my leave, and in a very incorrect Manner, at <hi>Briſtol,</hi> I was obliged to publiſh in my own Defence, and afterwards thought I
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:005886_0030_10275E1173E4AEE8"/>
had a clear Call to print any other Diſcourſes, tho' in themſelves mean, that I found bleſſed to the good of Souls.</p>
                  <p>But to return to my publick Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations. Being determined to abide in <hi>London</hi> till the Time of my Departure, I followed my uſual Practice of reading and praying over the Word of God upon my Knees. Sweet was this Retirement to my Soul, but it was not of long Continuance—Invitations were given me to preach at ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Places—The Stewards and Members of the Religious Societies were very fond of hearing me,—I was invited to preach at <hi>Crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plegate,</hi> St. <hi>Ann'</hi>s, and <hi>Forſter-lane Churches,</hi> at Six on the Lord's Day Morning, and to aſſiſt in adminiſtring the Holy Sacrament—I embraced the Invitations, and ſo many came, that ſometimes we were obliged to conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate freſh Elements two or three Times, and the Stewards found it ſomewhat difficult to carry the Offerings to the Communion Table—I alſo preach'd at <hi>Wapping-Chappel,</hi> the <hi>Tower, Lud-gate, New-gate,</hi> and many of the Churches where weekly Lectures were kept up—The Congregations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually increaſed, and generally, of a Lord's Day, I uſed to preach four Times to

very large, and very affected Auditories, beſides reading Prayers twice or thrice, and walking, perhaps, twelve Miles in going backwards and forwards from one Church to the other—But God made my Feet like Hinds Feet, and filled me with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <p>About the latter End of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> finding there were many young Men belonging to the Societies that attended my Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I enter'd into one of their ſinging Societies, hoping thereby to ingratiate my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the more, and have greater Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of doing them good—It anſwer'd my Deſign—Our Lord gave me to ſpiritualize their ſinging—And after they had taught me the <hi>Gamut,</hi> they would gladly hear me teach them ſome of the Myſteries of the <hi>New-Birth,</hi> and the <hi>Neceſſity of living to God</hi>—Many ſweet Nights we ſpent toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this Way—And many of theſe Youths afterwards, to all Appearance, walk'd with God, and will, I truſt, join the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly

                  <p>About the Middle of <hi>September</hi> my Name was firſt put into the publick <hi>Newſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Papers,</hi> but upon what particular Occaſion I cannot now recollect—The <hi>Sunday</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, with great Reluctance, I was prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on to preach a Charity Sermon, at <hi>Wap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Chapel</hi>—The Congregation was very large, and more was collected than had been for many Years upon a like Occaſion. This got Air—My Friends improved the Occaſion, and entreated me to preach ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Charity Sermon at Sir <hi>George Wheeler'</hi>s <hi>Chapel</hi>—I abſolutely refuſed; but at length thro' the Importunity of Mr. <hi>Haberſham,</hi> ſince my faithful Aſſiſtant in the <hi>Orphan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Houſe,</hi> I agreed to do it—I diſcourſed upon the <hi>Widow'</hi>s <hi>giving her two Mites</hi>—God bowed the Hearts of the Hearers as the Heart of one Man—Almoſt all, as I was told, by the Collectors, offered moſt willingly—Scarce one appeared before the Lord empty—This ſtill drew on freſh Applications. The <hi>Sunday</hi> following I preached in the Evening at St. <hi>Swithens,</hi>

                     </q> This Advertiſement chagrined me very much—I immediately ſent to the Printer, deſiring he would put me in his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per no more—His Anſwer was, That <q>

perceiving what Effect my preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had upon the Populace, were continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally applying to me to preach for the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the Children—And as I was to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark ſhortly, they procured the Liberty of the Churches on the Week Days; a Thing never known before—I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times had more than a dozen Names of different Churches, at which I promiſed to preach, upon my Slate Book at once—And when I preached, Conſtables were obliged to be placed at the Door to keep the People in order—The Sight of the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons was very awful,—One might, as it were, walk upon the Peoples Heads, and Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands went away from the largeſt Churches for want of room. They were all Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion when the Word was delivered, and heard like People hearing for Eternity—I now preached generally nine Times a Week. The early Sacraments were exceeding aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. At <hi>Cripple Gate, St. Ann's,</hi> and <hi>Forſter Lane,</hi> how often have we ſeen JESUS CHRIST crucified, and evidently ſet forth before us! On <hi>Sunday</hi> Mornings, long before Day, you might ſee Streets filled with Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple going to Church, with their Lantherns in their Hands, and hear them converſing

about the Things of God.—Other Lecture Churches, near at hand, would be filled with Perſons that could not come where I was preaching: And thoſe that did come, were ſo deeply affected that they were like Perſons ſtruck with pointed Arrows, or mourning for a firſt born Child! People gave ſo liberally to the Charity Schools, that this Seaſon near a Thouſand Pounds Sterling was collected at the ſeveral Churches, beſides many private Contributions and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions ſent in afterwards—I always preached Gratis, and gave myſelf. The <hi>Blue-Coat</hi> Boys and Girls looked upon me as their great Benefactor; and I believe fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſent up their Infant Cries in my behalf. Worthy Mr. <hi>Seeward,</hi> afterwards my dear <hi>Fellow-Traveller,</hi> was their hearty Friend and Advocate.—He was concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in above Twenty Charity Schools; and, as I found ſome Months afterwards, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed the Paragraph that ſo chagrined me. The Tide of Popularity now began to run very high,—In a ſhort Time I could no longer walk on Foot as uſual; but was conſtrained to go in a Coach from Place to Place to avoid the <hi>Hoſannas</hi> of the Multitude.—They grew quite extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:005886_0036_10275E200C6AE4E0"/>
in their Applauſes, and had it not been for my compaſſionate High-Prieſt, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularity would have deſtroyed me: But he knew it was quite unthought of and unſought by me—I uſed therefore to plead with and intreat him, to take me by the Hand and lead me unhurt thro' this fiery Furnace!—He heard my Requeſt, gave me to ſee the Vanity of all Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations but his own, and, in ſome Meaſure, enabled me to give back all the Reſpect I received, to that Fountain from whence it had its Source.—</p>
                  <p>Not that all ſpoke well of me,—No, as my Popularity increaſed, Oppoſition in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed alſo—At firſt many of the Clergy were my Hearers and Admirers: But ſome ſoon grew Angry, and Complaints were made that the Churches were ſo crowded, that there was no room for the Pariſhioners, and that the Pews were ſpoiled—Some called me a ſpiritual Pick-Pocket, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers thought I made uſe of a kind of a Charm to get the People's Money—A Report was ſpread abroad, that the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> upon the Complaint of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, intended to Silence me.—I immediately waited upon his Lordſhip, and enquired,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:005886_0037_10275E244E1A4678"/>
whether any Complaint of this Nature had been lodged againſt me? He anſwered, "<hi>No.</hi>" I aſked h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        <hi>No: For he knew a Clergyman who had heard me preach a plain Scriptural Sermon.</hi>
                     </q> I aſked his Lordſhip, whether he would grant me a Licence? He ſaid, <q>I <hi>Needed none, ſince I was going to</hi> Georgia,</q> I replied, <q>Then your Lordſhip would not forbid me?</q> He gave me a ſatisfactory Anſwer, and I took my leave.—Soon after this, two Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gymen ſent for me, and told me, they would not let me preach in their Pulpits any more, unleſs I renounced that part of my Sermon on <hi>Regeneration,</hi> wherein I wiſhed, <q>

                     </q>—This I had no freedom to do, and ſo they continued my oppoſers—What I believe irritated ſome of my Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies the more, was my free Converſation with many of the ſerious Diſſenters, who invited me to their Houſes, and repeatedly told me, <q>
                        <hi>That if the Doctrine of the</hi> New-Birth <hi>and</hi> Juſtification by Faith, <hi>was preached powerfully in the Church, there would be
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:005886_0038_10275E272FF43EC0"/>
but few Diſſenters in</hi> England.</q>—My Practice in viſiting and aſſociating with them I thought was quite agreeable to the Word of God.—Their Converſation was ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury, and I thought the beſt Way to bring them over, was not by Bigotry and Railing, but Moderation and Love, and undiſſembled Holineſs of Life.—But theſe Reaſons were of no avail.—One Miniſter called me <hi>prag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Raſcal,</hi> and vehemently inveighed againſt the whole Body of Diſſenters.—This ſtirred up the Peoples Corruptions, and having an overweening Fondneſs for me, whenever they came to Church and found that I did not preach, ſome of them would go out again—This Spirit I always endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to quell, and made a Sermon on purpoſe, from thoſe Words, <hi>take heed how ye hear.</hi>—One time upon hearing that a Church-Warden intended to take eight Pounds a Year from his Pariſh Miniſter, becauſe he refuſed to let me preach his Lecture, I compoſed a Sermon upon thoſe Words, <hi>Love your Enemies;</hi> and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it where I knew the Church-Warden would be—It had its deſired Effect—He came after Sermon and told me, he was convinced by my Diſcourſe that he ſhould

not reſent the Injury the Doctor had done me, and then thanked me for my Care—Nor was I without Oppoſition from Friends, who were jealous over me with a Godly Jealouſy.—For I carried high ſail, Thouſands and Thouſands came to hear. My Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons were every where called for. News came from Time to Time of the ſpringing Up and increaſe of the Seed ſown in <hi>Briſtol, Glouceſter,</hi> and elſewhere. Large offers were made me if I would ſtay in <hi>England.</hi>—And all the Oppoſition I met with, join'd with the Conſciouſneſs of my private daily Infirmities, were but <hi>Ballaſt</hi> little enough to keep me from overſetting.</p>
                  <p>However, the Lord (Oh infinite Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion!) was pleaſed to be with and bleſs me Day by Day.—I had a ſweet knot of Religious Friends, with whom I firſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to pray extempore.—Some Time I think in <hi>October,</hi> we began to ſet apart an Hour every Evening to intercede with the Great Head of the Church for carrying on the Work begun, and for the Circle of our Acquaintance, according as we knew their Circumſtances required.—I was their Mouth unto God, and he only knows what Enlargement I felt in that Divine

Employ. Once we ſpent a whole Night in Prayer and Praiſe; and many a Time, at Midnight and at one in the Morning, after I have been wearied almoſt to Death in Preaching, Writing, and Converſation, and going from Place to Place, God imparted new Life to my Soul, and would enable me to intercede with him for an Hour and a Half and two Hours together.—The Sweetneſs of this Exerciſe made me com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe my Sermon upon <hi>Interceſſion;</hi> and I cannot think it Preſumption to give it as my Opinion, that partly, at leaſt, in Anſwer to Prayers, then put up by his dear Children, the Word for ſome Years paſt, has ran and been glorified, not only in <hi>England</hi> but in many other Parts of the World.</p>
                  <p>It was now, I think, that I was prevailed on to ſit for my Picture.—The Occaſion was this—Some ill minded Perſons had painted me leaning on a Cuſhion, with a Biſhop looking very enviouſly over my Shoulder.—At the Bottom were Six Lines, in one of which the Biſhops were ſtiled <hi>Mitred Drones.</hi>—The ſame Perſon publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Papers that I had ſat for it.—This I looked upon as the ſnare of the Devil to incenſe the Clergy againſt me. I conſulted
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:005886_0041_10275E0BAD544368"/>
Friends what to do. They told me I muſt ſit for my Picture in my own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.—At the ſame Time my aged Mother laid her Commands upon me to do ſo in a Letter, urging <q>
                        <hi>That if I would not let her have the Subſtance, I would leave her at leaſt the Shadow.</hi>
                     </q> She alſo mention'd the Painter, and meeting with him one Night very accidentally, I at length with great Reluctance complied, and endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whilſt the Painter was drawing my Face, to employ my Time, in beſeeching the great God by his Holy Spirit to paint his Bleſſed Image upon his and my Heart.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> now drew near.—Notice was given me that the Soldiers were almoſt ready to embark for <hi>Georgia,</hi> Mr. <hi>Oglethorp</hi> being yet detained, I was reſolved to throw myſelf into the Hands of God and go with the Soldiers. But the nearer the Time of my Departure approached, the more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate and eager the People grew.—There was no end of Perſons coming to me under Soul concern. I preached and God bleſſed me more and more, and ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me for ſome time with but very little Sleep.</p>
                  <p>At the Beginning of <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> Week I took my Leave: But Oh what Groans and
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:005886_0042_10275E14545F64A0"/>
Sighs were to be heard when I ſaid "Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, Brethren, Farewell!'. At great St. <hi>Helen'</hi>s, the Cry was amazing. I was near half an Hour going out to the Door. All Ranks gave vent to their Paſſions. Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands and Thouſands of Prayers were put up for me. They would run and ſtop me in the Allies, hugg me in their Arms, and follow me with wiſhful Looks. Once in the <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> before my Departure, with many others, I ſpent a Night in Prayer and Praiſe; and in the Morning helped to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter the Sacrament at St. <hi>Dunſtans,</hi> as I uſed to do on Saint's Days—But ſuch a Sacrament I never before ſaw.—The Tears of the Communicants mingled with the Cup, and had not JESUS given us ſome of his New Wine to drink to comfort our Hearts, our parting would have almoſt been inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable. At length <hi>December</hi> 28th I left <hi>London,</hi> and went in the Strength of God, as a Poor <hi>Pilgrim,</hi> on board the <hi>Whitaker,</hi> after having preached in a good Part of the <hi>London</hi> Churches, collected about a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pounds for the Charity Schools, and got upwards of three Hundred Pounds Sterling for the Poor of <hi>Georgia</hi> among my Friends, for which I have ſince publickly accompted.

At the ſame Time God raiſed me a Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency to ſupply my own temporal Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities; and gave me repeated Proofs, that <hi>if we ſeek firſt the Kingdom of God and his Righteouſneſs, all other Things</hi> (I mean Food and Raiment, which is all a Chriſtian ſhould deſire) <hi>ſhall be added unto us.</hi>—For which and all his other unmerited Mercies, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to praiſe him in Time, and magnify his holy Name, thro' the boundleſs Ages of Eternity.</p>
                  <p>Some particulars that befell me whilſt abroad, and how this Tide of Popularity roſe ſtill higher at my return home: How I came to commence a Field Preacher, and part with many Friends, who were as Dear to me as my own Soul: How they that would now have plucked out their Eyes and have given 'em unto me, afterwards accounted me their Enemy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I told them the Truth: By what Means the Seed now ſown ſprang up and grew into a great Tree, both in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Scotland</hi> and <hi>America:</hi> How Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons aroſe among God's People, and what were the Effects and Conſequences of them, All this I ſay muſt be reſerved for another Tract, if God ſhould continue my Life and

                  <p>IT being now ſome Months ſince I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived here, I think it high time, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my Promiſe, to ſend you as explicite an Account a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

For it was firſt propoſed to me by my dear Friend the Rev'd Mr. <hi>Charles Weſley,</hi> who with his Excellency General <hi>Oglethorp,</hi> had concerted a Scheme for carrying on ſuch a
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:005886_0048_10275E375EBB2830"/>
Deſign before I had any Thoughts of going abroad myſelf. It was natural to think, that as the Government intended this Province for the Refuge and Support of many of our poor Countrymen, that Numbers of ſuch Adventurers muſt neceſſarily be taken off, by being expoſed to the Hardſhips which unavoidably attend a new Settlement. I thought it therefore a noble Deſign in the General to erect a Houſe for fatherleſs Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. And believing ſuch a Proviſion for Orphans would be ſome Inducement with many to come over, I fell in with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, when mention'd to me by my Friend, and was reſolved, in they Strength of God, to proſecute it with all my might.—This was mention'd to the Honourable the Truſtees. They took it kindly at my Hands; and as I then began to be pretty popular at <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and elſe where, they wro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e to the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> for leave for me to preach a Charity Sermon on this Occaſion in the <hi>Abby Church.</hi> This was granted, and I accordingly began im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to compoſe a ſuitable Diſcourſe. But knowing my firſt ſtay at <hi>Georgia</hi> would neceſſarily be ſhort, on account of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning again to take Prieſt's Orders, I
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:005886_0049_10275E3BAA4F11E8"/>
thought it moſt prudent firſt to go and ſee for my ſelf, and defer proſecuting the Scheme till I came home; becauſe I could then be better able to judge, whether the Scheme was practicable, and conſequently could be able to recommend it with the greater Earneſtneſs.—When I came to <hi>Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia</hi> I found many poor Orphans, who, tho' taken Notice of by the Honourable Truſtees, yet thro' the Neglect of Perſons that acted under them, were in miſerable Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.—For want of a Houſe to breed them up in, the poor little Ones were tabled out here and there, and beſides the Hurt they received by bad Examples, forgot at home what they learnt at School.—Others were at hard Services, and likely to have no Education at all.—Upon ſeeing this, and finding that his Majeſty and Parliament had the Intereſt of this Colony much at Heart, I thought I could not better ſhew my regard to God and my Country, than by getting a Houſe and Land for theſe Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, where they might learn to labour, read and write, and at the ſame Time be brought up in the Nurture and Admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Lord.—Accordingly at my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>England,</hi> in the Year 1738, to take
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:005886_0050_10275E3E93B7DDE8"/>
Prieſts Orders, I applied to the Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Society for a grant of 500 Acres of Land, and laid myſelf under an Obligation to build a Houſe upon it, and to receive from Time to Time as many Orphans as the Land and Stock would maintain. As I had always acted like a Clergyman of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> having preached in a good Part of the <hi>London</hi> Churches, and but a few Months before collected near a Thouſand Pounds Sterling, for the Children belonging to the Charity Schools in <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> it was natural to think, that I might now have the Uſe at leaſt of ſome of theſe Churches to preach in for the Orphans hereafter more immediately to be committed to my Care.—But by that time I had taken Prieſts Orders, the Spirit of the Clergy began to be much imbittered.—Churches were gradually denied me—And I muſt let this good Deſign drop, and Thouſands (I might add ten Thouſands) go without hearing the Word of God, or preach in the Fields.—Indeed two Churches one in <hi>London, viz. Spittle-fields,</hi> and one in <hi>Briſtol, viz.</hi> St. <hi>Philips</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> were lent me upon this Occaſion; but thoſe were all.—However, God kept me from being
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:005886_0051_10275E401C3EB680"/>
diſcouraged.—I collected for the Orphan-Houſe in <hi>Moor-fields,</hi> Two and Fifty Pounds one Sabbath Day Morning; Twenty Two Pounds of which was in Copper. It would have rejoiced your Heart to ſee the People give.—They offered willingly, and took more pains to come through the crowd and put their Contributions into my Hatt, than ſome would to have got them.—Thouſands of Prayers were put up with the Alms that were given, and I truſt both went up as a Memorial before God. In the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon I collected again at <hi>Kennington Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> and continued to do ſo at moſt of the Places where I preached. Beſides this, two or three of the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and ſeveral Perſons of Diſtinction contributed, till at length, having gotten about a Thouſand and ten Pounds, I gave over collecting, and went with what I had to <hi>Georgia.</hi> At that time multitudes offered to accompany me; but I choſe to take over only a Surgeon and a few more of both Sexes, that I thought would be uſeful in carrying on my Deſign. Theſe chearfully embarked with me, deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing for their Pains, but Food and Raiment, My Dear Fellow-Traveller, <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Seward,</hi> 
                     <abbr>Eſq;</abbr> alſo joined with them,
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:005886_0052_10275E4300398690"/>
and was particularly uſeful to me on this Occaſion. Our firſt Voyage was to <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia,</hi> where I was w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>ing to go for the ſake of laying in Proviſion. Having a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of a Ship with me, who had been my ſpiritual Child, by his Advice, I laid out in <hi>London</hi> a good Part of the Thouſand Pounds for Goods; and by his Care and my other Fellow-Travellers, without any trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to myſelf, got as much by them at <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia</hi> as nearly defrayed the Family's Expence of coming over. Here God bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my Miniſtry daily, and begun that Work in <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> which, I am perſuaded, will be remembred thro' the Endleſs Ages of Eternity. <hi>January</hi> following 1739 I met my Family at <hi>Georgia,</hi> and being unwilling to loſe any time, I hired a large Houſe, and took in all the Orphans I could find in the Colony, A great many alſo of the Town's Children came to School gratis, and many poor People that could not maintain their Children, upon Application, had leave given them to ſend their little ones for a Month or two, or more, as they could ſpare them, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> at length my Family conſiſted of between 60 and 70. Moſt of the Orphans were in poor Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="57" facs="unknown:005886_0053_10275E44E96C2FE0"/>
eat up with Lice—I likewiſe erected an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmary,</hi> in which many ſick People were cured and taken care of Gratis. I have now by me a Liſt of upwards of a Hundred and Thirty Patients, which were under the Surgeon's Hands, excluſive of my own private Family. This Surgeon I furniſhed with all proper Druggs and Utenſils, which put me to no ſmall Expence: And this was ſtill increaſed by clearing Land, buying Stock, and building a large Dwelling Houſe Sixty by Forty, and Out Houſes, commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious for a large Family to live in. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times (Labourers and all) I have had a Hundred and Twenty to provide for daily<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> My Friends as well as myſelf, ſeem'd to have particular Courage and Faith given us for the Seaſon; and we went on chearfully, believing that he for whoſe ſake we began, would enable us to finiſh this good Work. About <hi>March</hi> I began the great Houſe, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only about One Hundred and Fifty Pounds in Caſh. I called it <hi>Betheſda,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I hoped it would be a Houſe of Mercy to many Souls. Bleſſed be God we have not been diſappointed of our Hope. It has proved a Houſe of Mercy indeed to many.
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:005886_0054_10275E4BCFE03580"/>
Several of our Labourers, as well as Viſitors, have (in a Judgment of Charity) been born of God here, and given evident Proofs of it, by bringing forth the Fruits of the Spirit. Many Boys have been put out to Trades, and many Girls put out to Service. I had the Pleaſure the other Day of ſeeing three Boys work at the Houſe in which they were bred, one of them out of his Time a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyman, and the others ſerving under their Maſters. One that I brought from <hi>New-England</hi> is handſomely ſettled in <hi>Carolina;</hi> and another from <hi>Philadelphia</hi> is married and lives very comfortably at <hi>Savannah.</hi> How ſo large a Family has been ſupported in ſuch a Colony, without any viſible Fund, is wonderful! I am ſurprized when I look back, and ſee how for theſe ſix Years laſt paſt, God has ſpread a Table in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs for ſo many Perſons. Were all the particular Providences that have attended this Work recorded, perhaps they would be found not inferior to thoſe mentioned by Profeſſor <hi>Frank,</hi> in his <hi>Pietas Ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>lenſis,</hi> whoſe Memory is very precious to me, and whoſe Example has a Thouſand Times been bleſſed to ſtrengthen and encourage me in the carrying on this Enterprize.

Hereafter perhaps when I have more Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, I may give you an Account of ſome of them—My being detained ſo long in <hi>England</hi> has been a little detrimental to me, my Friends not knowing ſo well how to act, becauſe they expected to ſee me daily. And I cannot yet ſay that I have ſurmount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the firſt Years Expence, which indeed was very great, and greater no doubt than it would be now, after my Friends have had ſo many Years Experience in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony.—However I doubt not but by the Bleſſing of God, in a ſhort Time to pay off my Arrears, and then the Family will be maintained at a ſmall Expence.—My ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Annual Charges, are now but trifling to what they have been; and my Friends have raiſed an annual Subſcription ſufficient for diſcharging it till the Family may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to provide for itſelf.—This, God willing, I hope will be, in a good Meaſure, ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly effected. We have lately begun to uſe the Plow; and next Year I hope to have many Acres of good Oats and Barley. We have near twenty Sheep and Lambs, Fifty Head of Cattle, and Seven Horſes. We hope to kill a Thouſand Weight of Pork this Seaſon. Our Garden which is
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:005886_0056_10275E4F176FE890"/>
very beautiful, furniſhes us with all Sorts of Greens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We have plenty of Milk, Eggs, Poultry, and make a good deal of Butter weekly. A good Quantity of Wool and Cotton has been given me, and we hope to have ſufficient ſpun and wove for the next Winter's Cloathing.—If the Vines hit, we may expect two or three Hogſheads of Wine out of the Vineyard. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily now conſiſts of Twenty Six Perſons. Two of the Orphan Boys are blind, one is little better than an Idiot.—But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they are uſeful in the Family, the one in the Field and the other in the Kitchen. I have two Women to take Care of the Houſhold Work, and three Men and two Boys employed about the Plantation and Cattle. A ſet of Dutch Servants has been lately ſent over: The Magiſtrates were pleaſed to give me two; and I took in a poor old Widow, aged near 70, whom no body elſe cared to have. A valuable young Man from <hi>New-England</hi> is my School-Maſter, and in my Abſence performs Duty in the Family. On Sabbaths the grown People attend on publick Worſhip at <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vannah,</hi> or at <hi>White-bluff,</hi> a Village near <hi>Betheſda,</hi> where a Dutch Miniſter offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates

My dear Friends who have hitherto been my Aſſiſtants, being married and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing each one or two Children, thought it beſt, as moſt ſuitable to the Inſtitution, to remove. God has mercifully provided for them, and they are comfortably ſettled, ſome at <hi>Savannah</hi> and ſome elſewhere. We frequently write to and hear from one another. I need not trouble you with the Order of our Family. It is pretty near the ſame as uſual, and I do not think to make any material Alteration for ſome time. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have applied to me to take in their Children as Boarders, and erect a publick School: But I have not yet determined. It is certain ſuch a School would be exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uſeful in this part of the World, if there ſhould be a Peace, not only for thoſe nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Parts of the Colony, but alſo for the more Southern Parts of <hi>Carolina, Puris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> and <hi>Frederica,</hi> where are many fine Youths. I have been prevailed on to take one from <hi>Frederica,</hi> and another from <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſburgh,</hi> and it may be ſhall admit more. For the preſent, conſidering the Situation of Affairs, I think it moſt prudent to go on in making what Improvements I can on the Plantation and bring a Tutor with me
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:005886_0058_10275E564864B650"/>
from the Northward in the Fall, to teach a few Youths the Languages, and enlarge the Family when Affairs are more ſettled. The Houſe is a noble commodious Building, and every Thing ſweetly adapted for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up Youth. Here is Land to employ them in to exerciſe their Bodies, and keep them from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>eneſs out of School Hours. Here are none of the Temptations to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch their tender Minds, which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to more populous Countries, or in Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where Children muſt neceſſarily be brought up with Negroes. What God intends to do with the Colony is not for me to enquire: Secret Things belong to him. It has hitherto been wonderfully preſerved, and the Orphan-Houſe, like the burning Buſh, has flouriſhed unconſumed. In fine, the Government has, no doubt, its Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare much at Heart: And, God willing, I intend to carry on my Deſign till I ſee the Colony ſink or ſwim. The Money that has been expended on the <hi>Orphan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Houſe,</hi> and Orphan-Houſe Family, has been of vaſt Service to this Northern Part of the Colony. And tho' it has been greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimental to my own private Intereſt, yet I do not repent of the Undertaking<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> No, I
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:005886_0059_10275E592BBA0010"/>
rejoice in it daily, and hope yet to ſee many more Souls born unto God here. I have had a very comfortable Winter. The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Savannah,</hi> having no Miniſter till lately, gladly accepted my Labours; and at <hi>Frederica,</hi> the Gentlemen and Soldiers of General <hi>Oglethorp'</hi>s Regiment, as well as the Inhabitants of the Town, received me very gladly. Major <hi>Horton</hi> ſeems to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have very well. He has a very fine grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Plantation—I ſaw Barley in the Ear the firſt of <hi>March. Georgia</hi> is very healthy—Not above one, and that a little Child, has died out of our Family, ſince it remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Betheſda.</hi> I think the Colony (were the Inhabitants ſufficiently numerous) is as capable of as good Improvement as any on the Continent.</p>
                  <p>For the Satisfaction of my Friends, and ſilencing, if poſſible, my Enemies, I have had my Accounts from the very Beginning to <hi>January</hi> laſt, publickly audited and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, Debittor and Creditor, Article by Article; and an Oath for Confirmation, being an End of all Strife, I have ſworn to them. A Copy of the Audit, with the particular Names of the Children, I have annexed hereunto. If it gives you or others
