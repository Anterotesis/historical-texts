            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

more knowing than I expected. Their Pa≈øtor had u≈øed to catechi≈øe the little ones in the Summer Sea≈øon, and expound the four Le≈ø≈øons every Lord's Day in the Church. I followed his<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> good Example, and found great Freedom and A≈ø≈øi≈øtance given me both in my publick and private Admini≈øtrations. Having the U≈øe of the Par≈øonage Hou≈øe, I expounded every Night. Many that were not Pari≈øhioners came to hear, and were edified.

Neither Church or Hou≈øe could contain the People that came. I found uncommon Manife≈øtations granted me from above.

                  <p>About three the next Morning, having thrown my≈øelf on the Bed for an Hour or two, I ≈øet out for <hi>Glouce≈øter,</hi> becau≈øe I heard that a great Company on Hor≈øeback and in Coaches intended to ≈øee me out of Town.

I knew there was no Mini≈øter at <hi>Frederica,</hi> for which Place I was then appointed, and I did not care to be ab≈øent longer from my proper Charge. Mr. <hi>Oglethorp'</hi>s going was ≈øtill retarded, and I had thought it my Duty to go immediately without him, had not he and my other Friends urged, that the Soldiers would ≈øhortly embark, and that I had be≈øt go over with them. This ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what pacified me, and having now taken a final farewel of all Friends in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, I was re≈øolved to abide at <hi>London,</hi> and give my≈øelf wholly to Prayer, the Study of the Scriptures, and my own Heart, till the Soldiers ≈øhould embark.</p>
                  <p>The Hou≈øe I lodged at, was good old Mr. <hi>Hutton'</hi>s in <hi>College-≈øtreet, We≈øtmin≈øter,</hi> where I had the Plea≈øure of ≈øeeing my Dear Friend Mr. <hi>Ingham,</hi> lately returned from <hi>Georgia;</hi> and perceiving him, as I thought, remarkably grown in Grace. I long'd ≈øtill more to be ≈øent to the ≈øame School, hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to catch ≈øome of that Holy Flame with which his Soul was fired.

lived and died together. Our Hearts were knit to each other, like the Hearts of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Jonathan.</hi> At midnight we would ri≈øe to ≈øing Prai≈øes to God, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede for the whole State of CHRIST'S Church militant here on Earth.</p>
                  <p>With this my Dear Friend, I one Day paid a Vi≈øit to a worthy Doctor of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity near <hi>London,</hi> who introduced us to ≈øome Honourable Ladies, who, as I had heard, delighted in doing good. It being my con≈øtant Practice to improve my Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the Rich for the Benefit of the Poor, I recommended two poor Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and another pious Per≈øon to their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. They ≈øaid little, but between them, unknown to each other, they gave, I think, <hi>Thirty Six Guineas.</hi> When we came to the Doctor's Hou≈øe and ≈øaw the Ladies Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, he ≈øaid, <q>If you had not ≈øpoke for others, you would have had a good deal of that your≈øelf.</q> God gave me to rejoice that I had nothing, and the Poor all. The next Day, upon my return to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> in the fir≈øt Letter that I opened, was a Bank-note of Ten Pounds, ≈øent from an unexpected hand as a pre≈øent for my≈øelf.

go on doing good to others, with a full A≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurance that the Lord would not let me want. Ble≈ø≈øed be his Name I have had many ≈øuch In≈øtances of his tender Concern for my temporal, as well as my eternal Wellfare.</p>
                  <p>About this Time, thro' the Importuity of Friends, and A≈øper≈øions of Enemies, I was prevailed upon to print my Sermon <hi>On the Nature and Nece≈ø≈øity of our Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or New-Birth in CHRIST JESUS,</hi> which under God began the awakening at <hi>London, Bri≈øtol, Glouce≈øter,</hi> and <hi>Glouce≈øter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhire.</hi> The Di≈ø≈øenters I found were ≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized to ≈øee a Sermon on ≈øuch a Subject from a Clergyman of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and finding the Author came from <hi>Oxford,</hi> were ready to ≈øay, (how ju≈øtly I will not determine) <q>

not re≈øent the Injury the Doctor had done me, and then thanked me for my Care‚ÄîNor was I without Oppo≈øition from Friends, who were jealous over me with a Godly Jealou≈øy.‚ÄîFor I carried high ≈øail, Thou≈øands and Thou≈øands came to hear. My Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons were every where called for. News came from Time to Time of the ≈øpringing Up and increa≈øe of the Seed ≈øown in <hi>Bri≈øtol, Glouce≈øter,</hi> and el≈øewhere.

                  <p>However, the Lord (Oh infinite Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcen≈øion!) was plea≈øed to be with and ble≈øs me Day by Day.‚ÄîI had a ≈øweet knot of Religious Friends, with whom I fir≈øt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to pray extempore.‚ÄîSome Time I think in <hi>October,</hi> we began to ≈øet apart an Hour every Evening to intercede with the Great Head of the Church for carrying on the Work begun, and for the Circle of our Acquaintance, according as we knew their Circum≈øtances required.‚ÄîI was their Mouth unto God, and he only knows what Enlargement I felt in that Divine

Employ. Once we ≈øpent a whole Night in Prayer and Prai≈øe; and many a Time, at Midnight and at one in the Morning, after I have been wearied almo≈øt to Death in Preaching, Writing, and Conver≈øation, and going from Place to Place, God imparted new Life to my Soul, and would enable me to intercede with him for an Hour and a Half and two Hours together.‚ÄîThe Sweetne≈øs of this Exerci≈øe made me com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe my Sermon upon <hi>Interce≈ø≈øion;</hi> and I cannot think it Pre≈øumption to give it as my Opinion, that partly, at lea≈øt, in An≈øwer to Prayers, then put up by his dear Children, the Word for ≈øome Years pa≈øt, has ran and been glorified, not only in <hi>England</hi> but in many other Parts of the World.</p>
                  <p>It was now, I think, that I was prevailed on to ≈øit for my Picture.‚ÄîThe Occa≈øion was this‚ÄîSome ill minded Per≈øons had painted me leaning on a Cu≈øhion, with a Bi≈øhop looking very enviou≈øly over my Shoulder.‚ÄîAt the Bottom were Six Lines, in one of which the Bi≈øhops were ≈øtiled <hi>Mitred Drones.</hi>‚ÄîThe ≈øame Per≈øon publi≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Papers that I had ≈øat for it.‚ÄîThis I looked upon as the ≈ønare of the Devil to incen≈øe the Clergy again≈øt me. I con≈øulted

Friends what to do. They told me I mu≈øt ≈øit for my Picture in my own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.‚ÄîAt the ≈øame Time my aged Mother laid her Commands upon me to do ≈øo in a Letter, urging <q>
                        <hi>That if I would not let her have the Sub≈øtance, I would leave her at lea≈øt the Shadow.</hi>
                     </q> She al≈øo mention'd the Painter, and meeting with him one Night very accidentally, I at length with great Reluctance complied, and endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whil≈øt the Painter was drawing my Face, to employ my Time, in be≈øeeching the great God by his Holy Spirit to paint his Ble≈ø≈øed Image upon his and my Heart.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Chri≈øtmas</hi> now drew near.‚ÄîNotice was given me that the Soldiers were almo≈øt ready to embark for <hi>Georgia,</hi> Mr. <hi>Oglethorp</hi> being yet detained, I was re≈øolved to throw my≈øelf into the Hands of God and go with the Soldiers. But the nearer the Time of my Departure approached, the more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate and eager the People grew.‚ÄîThere was no end of Per≈øons coming to me under Soul concern. I preached and God ble≈ø≈øed me more and more, and ≈øupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me for ≈øome time with but very little Sleep.</p>
                  <p>At the Beginning of <hi>Chri≈øtmas</hi> Week I took my Leave: But Oh what Groans and

Sighs were to be heard when I ≈øaid "Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, Brethren, Farewell!'. At great St. <hi>Helen'</hi>s, the Cry was amazing. I was near half an Hour going out to the Door. All Ranks gave vent to their Pa≈ø≈øions. Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øands and Thou≈øands of Prayers were put up for me. They would run and ≈øtop me in the Allies, hugg me in their Arms, and follow me with wi≈øhful Looks. Once in the <hi>Chri≈øtmas</hi> before my Departure, with many others, I ≈øpent a Night in Prayer and Prai≈øe; and in the Morning helped to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini≈øter the Sacrament at St. <hi>Dun≈øtans,</hi> as I u≈øed to do on Saint's Days‚ÄîBut ≈øuch a Sacrament I never before ≈øaw.‚ÄîThe Tears of the Communicants mingled with the Cup, and had not JESUS given us ≈øome of his New Wine to drink to comfort our Hearts, our parting would have almo≈øt been in≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable. At length <hi>December</hi> 28th I left <hi>London,</hi> and went in the Strength of God, as a Poor <hi>Pilgrim,</hi> on board the <hi>Whitaker,</hi> after having preached in a good Part of the <hi>London</hi> Churches, collected about a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øand Pounds for the Charity Schools, and got upwards of three Hundred Pounds Sterling for the Poor of <hi>Georgia</hi> among my Friends, for which I have ≈øince publickly accompted.

At the ≈øame Time God rai≈øed me a Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency to ≈øupply my own temporal Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øities; and gave me repeated Proofs, that <hi>if we ≈øeek fir≈øt the Kingdom of God and his Righteou≈øne≈øs, all other Things</hi> (I mean Food and Raiment, which is all a Chri≈øtian ≈øhould de≈øire) <hi>≈øhall be added unto us.</hi>‚ÄîFor which and all his other unmerited Mercies, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øire to prai≈øe him in Time, and magnify his holy Name, thro' the boundle≈øs Ages of Eternity.</p>
                  <p>Some particulars that befell me whil≈øt abroad, and how this Tide of Popularity ro≈øe ≈øtill higher at my return home: How I came to commence a Field Preacher, and part with many Friends, who were as Dear to me as my own Soul: How they that would now have plucked out their Eyes and have given 'em unto me, afterwards accounted me their Enemy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe I told them the Truth: By what Means the Seed now ≈øown ≈øprang up and grew into a great Tree, both in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Scotland</hi> and <hi>America:</hi> How Divi≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons aro≈øe among God's People, and what were the Effects and Con≈øequences of them, All this I ≈øay mu≈øt be re≈øerved for another Tract, if God ≈øhould continue my Life and

                  <p>In the mean while, let me exhort thee, O Reader, if ≈øerious and a Child of God, to ble≈øs him for what he has done for my Soul: Or if thou art yet in the Gall of Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne≈øs, and, thro' Prejudice, thinke≈øt that I have either not told Truth, or wrote out of a vain glorious View, let me only intreat thee to ≈øu≈øpend thy Judgment for a little while, and JESUS ≈øhall decide the Que≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

thought it mo≈øt prudent fir≈øt to go and ≈øee for my ≈øelf, and defer pro≈øecuting the Scheme till I came home; becau≈øe I could then be better able to judge, whether the Scheme was practicable, and con≈øequently could be able to recommend it with the greater Earne≈øtne≈øs.‚ÄîWhen I came to <hi>Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia</hi> I found many poor Orphans, who, tho' taken Notice of by the Honourable Tru≈øtees, yet thro' the Neglect of Per≈øons that acted under them, were in mi≈øerable Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtances.‚ÄîFor want of a Hou≈øe to breed them up in, the poor little Ones were tabled out here and there, and be≈øides the Hurt they received by bad Examples, forgot at home what they learnt at School.‚ÄîOthers were at hard Services, and likely to have no Education at all.‚ÄîUpon ≈øeeing this, and finding that his Maje≈øty and Parliament had the Intere≈øt of this Colony much at Heart, I thought I could not better ≈øhew my regard to God and my Country, than by getting a Hou≈øe and Land for the≈øe Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, where they might learn to labour, read and write, and at the ≈øame Time be brought up in the Nurture and Admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Lord.‚ÄîAccordingly at my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>England,</hi> in the Year 1738, to take
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:005886_0050_10275E3E93B7DDE8"/>
Prie≈øts Orders, I applied to the Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Society for a grant of 500 Acres of Land, and laid my≈øelf under an Obligation to build a Hou≈øe upon it, and to receive from Time to Time as many Orphans as the Land and Stock would maintain. As I had always acted like a Clergyman of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> having preached in a good Part of the <hi>London</hi> Churches, and but a few Months before collected near a Thou≈øand Pounds Sterling, for the Children belonging to the Charity Schools in <hi>London</hi> and <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter;</hi> it was natural to think, that I might now have the U≈øe at lea≈øt of ≈øome of the≈øe Churches to preach in for the Orphans hereafter more immediately to be committed to my Care.‚ÄîBut by that time I had taken Prie≈øts Orders, the Spirit of the Clergy began to be much imbittered.‚ÄîChurches were gradually denied me‚ÄîAnd I mu≈øt let this good De≈øign drop, and Thou≈øands (I might add ten Thou≈øands) go without hearing the Word of God, or preach in the Fields.‚ÄîIndeed two Churches one in <hi>London, viz. Spittle-fields,</hi> and one in <hi>Bri≈øtol, viz.</hi> St. <hi>Philips</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> were lent me upon this Occa≈øion; but tho≈øe were all.‚ÄîHowever, God kept me from being
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:005886_0051_10275E401C3EB680"/>
di≈øcouraged.‚ÄîI collected for the Orphan-Hou≈øe in <hi>Moor-fields,</hi> Two and Fifty Pounds one Sabbath Day Morning; Twenty Two Pounds of which was in Copper. It would have rejoiced your Heart to ≈øee the People give.‚ÄîThey offered willingly, and took more pains to come through the crowd and put their Contributions into my Hatt, than ≈øome would to have got them.‚ÄîThou≈øands of Prayers were put up with the Alms that were given, and I tru≈øt both went up as a Memorial before God. In the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon I collected again at <hi>Kennington Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> and continued to do ≈øo at mo≈øt of the Places where I preached. Be≈øides this, two or three of the <hi>Bi≈øhops,</hi> and ≈øeveral Per≈øons of Di≈øtinction contributed, till at length, having gotten about a Thou≈øand and ten Pounds, I gave over collecting, and went with what I had to <hi>Georgia.</hi> At that time multitudes offered to accompany me; but I cho≈øe to take over only a Surgeon and a few more of both Sexes, that I thought would be u≈øeful in carrying on my De≈øign. The≈øe chearfully embarked with me, de≈øir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing for their Pains, but Food and Raiment, My Dear Fellow-Traveller, <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Seward,</hi>

Having a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of a Ship with me, who had been my ≈øpiritual Child, by his Advice, I laid out in <hi>London</hi> a good Part of the Thou≈øand Pounds for Goods; and by his Care and my other Fellow-Travellers, without any trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to my≈øelf, got as much by them at <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia</hi> as nearly defrayed the Family's Expence of coming over.

I have now by me a Li≈øt of upwards of a Hundred and Thirty Patients, which were under the Surgeon's Hands, exclu≈øive of my own private Family. This Surgeon I furni≈øhed with all proper Druggs and Uten≈øils, which put me to no ≈ømall Expence: And this was ≈øtill increa≈øed by clearing Land, buying Stock, and building a large Dwelling Hou≈øe Sixty by Forty, and Out Hou≈øes, commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious for a large Family to live in.

Several of our Labourers, as well as Vi≈øitors, have (in a Judgment of Charity) been born of God here, and given evident Proofs of it, by bringing forth the Fruits of the Spirit. Many Boys have been put out to Trades, and many Girls put out to Service. I had the Plea≈øure the other Day of ≈øeeing three Boys work at the Hou≈øe in which they were bred, one of them out of his Time a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyman, and the others ≈øerving under their Ma≈øters.

Hereafter perhaps when I have more Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure, I may give you an Account of ≈øome of them‚ÄîMy being detained ≈øo long in <hi>England</hi> has been a little detrimental to me, my Friends not knowing ≈øo well how to act, becau≈øe they expected to ≈øee me daily. And I cannot yet ≈øay that I have ≈øurmount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the fir≈øt Years Expence, which indeed was very great, and greater no doubt than it would be now, after my Friends have had ≈øo many Years Experience in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony.‚ÄîHowever I doubt not but by the Ble≈ø≈øing of God, in a ≈øhort Time to pay off my Arrears, and then the Family will be maintained at a ≈ømall Expence.‚ÄîMy ≈øtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Annual Charges, are now but trifling to what they have been; and my Friends have rai≈øed an annual Sub≈øcription ≈øufficient for di≈øcharging it till the Family may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to provide for it≈øelf.‚ÄîThis, God willing, I hope will be, in a good Mea≈øure, ≈øpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly effected. We have lately begun to u≈øe the Plow; and next Year I hope to have many Acres of good Oats and Barley. We have near twenty Sheep and Lambs, Fifty Head of Cattle, and Seven Hor≈øes.

My dear Friends who have hitherto been my A≈ø≈øi≈øtants, being married and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing each one or two Children, thought it be≈øt, as mo≈øt ≈øuitable to the In≈øtitution, to remove. God has mercifully provided for them, and they are comfortably ≈øettled, ≈øome at <hi>Savannah</hi> and ≈øome el≈øewhere. We frequently write to and hear from one another. I need not trouble you with the Order of our Family. It is pretty near the ≈øame as u≈øual, and I do not think to make any material Alteration for ≈øome time. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have applied to me to take in their Children as Boarders, and erect a publick School: But I have not yet determined. It is certain ≈øuch a School would be exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing u≈øeful in this part of the World, if there ≈øhould be a Peace, not only for tho≈øe nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Parts of the Colony, but al≈øo for the more Southern Parts of <hi>Carolina, Puris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> and <hi>Frederica,</hi> where are many fine Youths.
