            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE ſpecial Occaſion that turn'd my Thoughts to this ſingular Text, muſt be obvious to every one, acquainted with the preſent Situation of Affairs in this Flock: And to ſuch, it's preſum'd, I need make no Apology for being on ſo peculiar a Subject to day.</p>
            <p>The Conſideration of this hiſtorical Paſſage might be introduc'd by ſome Remarks on the Context and
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:002871_0004_0FE67E8B16D34AD0"/>
Story it belongs to. But all I ſhall obſerve, is only this; That there being a Vacancy in the College of the Apoſtles, and ſeveral Candidates (called the one <hi>Joſeph,</hi> or <hi>Barſabas</hi>; the other <hi>Matthias</hi>) being ſingled out by the Church and nominated for that important Poſt, they refer'd it to the Determination of Heaven, by the ſacred method of a Lot, which of them ſhould be the Man to fill up that ſuperior Station. An Expoſitor on the place obſerves, <note n="‡" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Henry.</note> 
               <q>They were both ſuch worthy Men, and ſo well qualify'd, that none cou'd tell which of them was fitteſt, but all agreed it muſt be one of them: Yet they did not propoſe themſelves, nor <hi>ſtrive</hi> for the place, but humbly ſat ſtill, and were appointed to it.</q> The Church having choſen out and ſet up theſe as Candidates, they carry'd the matter to the Throne of Grace, ſpreading the Caſe before the Lord in Prayer, and then unanimouſly appealing to Him by a Lot for Determination. The Sum of the Prayer upon this great Occaſion, we have on Record in the Text, — <hi>They prayed and ſaid, Thou Lord who knoweſt the hearts of all Men, ſhew whether of thoſe two thou haſt choſen; that he may take part of this Miniſtry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall diſcourſe to the Words, under theſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When ſome one is needed to fill up a Vacan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in the Miniſtry, it ſhou'd be the Care &amp; Deſire of all concerned, That the LORD JESUS CHRIST wou'd <hi>ſhew whom He hath choſen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Application ſhou'd be made to Him by <hi>earneſt Prayer</hi> in this important Caſe.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:002871_0005_0FE67E8C6A0B3AB8"/>3. CHRIST is to be conſider'd by us at all times and in all matters, but eſpecially in the preſent Caſe, <hi>as the Lord, who knows the Hearts of all Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, I might obſerve, from the Intereſt the Eleven <hi>Apoſtles</hi> had in the Appointment of one to fill up their Number, &amp; the Pattern they have left of a juſt Concern and Forwardneſs before, and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction after the Choice; That it is a very deſirable thing to a faithful Miniſter to have an agreeable <hi>Colleague,</hi> to be <hi>a Partner</hi> and <hi>Fellow-helper</hi> with him in his Charge: And that he will be diſpos'd glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>receive</hi> ſuch an one as a Brother, whom <hi>the Lord ſheweth he has choſen.</hi> — But I ſhall diſmiſs this laſt Remark with barely mentioning it, and only inſiſt on the three former.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>DOCT. I.</hi> When ſome one is needed to be put into the Miniſtry, and fill up a Vacancy in this Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Order, it ſhou'd be the Care and Deſire of all concern'd, <hi>That the LORD JESUS CHRIST wou'd ſhew whom HE hath choſen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>THOU Lord, ſhew whether of theſe thou haſt choſen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Perſon</hi> immediately addreſſed to was moſt probably the LORD JESUS CHRIST, who is Lord of all, and Head of the Church; whoſe Prerogative it was to make Apoſtles, and who had before his Aſcenſion perſonally choſen and appointed the Eleven.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Miniſtry</hi> intended in our Text, was more eſpecially the Apoſtleſhip; which is therefore added in the Text, — <hi>This Miniſtry and Apoſtleſhip.</hi> — It hints to us this juſt and uſeful Thought, (which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed might have been mention'd firſt as a diſtinct Doctrine) That <hi>every Office in the Church of CHRIST is a Miniſtry</hi>; the Apoſtleſhip it ſelf was ſo. Even CHRIST the Son of GOD, came to miniſter: And
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002871_0006_0FE67E8C912F5A60"/>
ſhall the Servant be above his Lord? The Apoſtle ſays to Chriſtians, We preach JESUS CHRIST the LORD, and <hi>our ſelves your Servants</hi> for JESUS ſake. And if the Apoſtles, who were extraordinary Men of God, ſtiled their Work a Miniſtry; much more may the Paſtoral Office be ſo called, which is in its Nature ordinary, and in dignity inferior to the Apoſtolate.</p>
            <p>The Miniſtry is a common Name, which takes in all Offices in the Church, ordinary and extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, higher or lower. It is particularly very often apply'd to ordinary <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Teachers</hi>; and is grown by Cuſtom very much their ſpecial Character and Denomination. They are ſet in the Church for the work of the Miniſtry: They are called to miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter about holy things; are ſeparated to the Miniſtry of the Word; appointed to miniſter the Goſpel of Salvation. Their Office indeed, as it is a Miniſtry, relates more directly and properly to CHRIST, their only Lord and Maſter. However, in a Senſe, they are Servants of the Church; as Magiſtrates are Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the Commonwealth, or as Angels are called miniſtring Spirits, ſent forth to miniſter unto the Heirs of Salvation. Yet ſuffer me to obſerve, they are not ſo the Church's Servants, as to be oblig'd only to obey their Orders, and execute their Votes and Decrees. But are call'd <hi>Guides</hi> and <hi>Overſeers</hi> of the Flock, and ſaid to have <hi>the Rule</hi> over them. Not that they have Dominion <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> your Faith, or Power to tyranniſe over Conſcience, by human Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, as Lords over God's Heritage; but are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to be Enſamples to the Flock, and Helpers of your Joy, by aſſiſting your Walk in the Faith and Order of the Goſpel: and ſhou'd deſire only by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of the Truth, and humble Exerciſes of the Power which CHRIST has given them for Edification,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002871_0007_0FE67E92E62F15E0"/>
and not for Deſtruction, to commend themſelves to every Man's Conſcience in the ſight of GOD.</p>
            <p>IT is only a <hi>Miniſterial</hi> and Stewardly Power, that is veſted in them; to be regulated in all its Operations, by the ſacred Rules and Inſtructions given in the Word of CHRIST. <note n="‡" place="bottom">
                  <hi>N. B.</hi> The greateſt part of what is premis'd here, was for brevity omitted in the Pulpit; tho' its thought fit to inſert it in the Print.</note> From hence they muſt learn how they ought to behave themſelves in the houſe of GOD, and to govern their reſpective Charges; expecting no other Subjection and Obedience, from their People, than what it is the Will of CHRIST his Churches ſhou'd render to ſuch as have the Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of them. Altho' they ſhou'd take Care not to betray the Authority of the Elderſhip; but be juſt to their Commiſſion, true to their Maſter, and ſpeak boldly in his name, according to his Word, teaching and warning every man, and as there is occaſion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buking ſome ſharply: Yet they muſt take heed on the other hand, they don't make unjuſt Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on the Privileges of the Fraternity, but allow them their full Power of Conſent and Liberty of Judgment, in Church-Adminiſtrations; in things proper taking their Concurrence, and ever uſing the utmoſt Care to give no offence in any thing, that the Miniſtry be not blamed. In particular they ſhou'd beware of an uncondeſcending Spirit, an unhappy Stiffneſs of Opinion, and reſolute Oppoſition to the Brethren, in Caſes of leſſer Importance, where (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is pretended) Humour will ſeem to govern them, more than Conſcience. It's true that by the Conſtitution of theſe Churches a conſiderable Power is lodg'd in the Elders, inſomuch that it ſeems they can put a <hi>Negative</hi> (for weighty Reaſons) upon any Vote of the Fraternity, whether concerning Admiſſions,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002871_0008_0FE67E93097EB9A0"/>
Diſmiſſions, Cenſures, or the like. For ſo runs the laſt Paragraph in the tenth Chapter of our <hi>Platform</hi> of Church-Diſcipline; <q>The ordinary Power of Government belonging only to the Elders, and the Power of Privilege remaining with the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood, — It followeth, that in an organick Church, <note n="‖" place="bottom">
                     <hi>By</hi> an organick Church, <hi>is meant (as our Synod in 62 have defin'd it, under Queſt. II.)</hi> A particular Congregation of viſible Saints in Goſpel-Order, furniſhed with a Presbytery, at leaſt with a teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Elder, and walking together in Truth and Peace.</note> and right Adminiſtration, all Church-Acts proceed after the manner of a mixt Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, ſo as NO Church-Act CAN be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummated or perfected without the Conſent of <hi>Both.</hi>
               </q> — By which it appears, that as according to our Principles, the Elders are not to exerciſe Church-Power, but by the Conſent of the Brethren; So neither is there any Church-Act in ordinary caſes valid without the Sanction of the Elderſhip: And indeed the <hi>Platform</hi> ſays, in ſo many words, <q>That what the Churches are to act and do in theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, they <hi>are</hi> to do in a way of Obedience — to the Direction — of the Elders. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. <hi>Obey them that have the Rule over you, and ſubmit your ſelves</hi> &amp;c.</q> Further, the eighth Paragraph is expreſs, <q>Nor may they oppoſe and contradict the Judgment or Sentence of the Elders, without ſufficient and weighty Cauſe; becauſe ſuch Practices are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly contrary unto Order and Government, and Inlets of Diſturbances, and tend to Confuſion.</q> And, as our famous Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> (one of the Fathers of <hi>New-England,</hi> and firſt Teacher of this Church) has expounded our Platform in his celebrated Book of the <hi>Keys</hi>; the Power and Influence of the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, both in the Church and in Synods or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, ſeems to me carry'd up to a greater Height con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably,

than is either uſually practiſed by Elders, or in fact allowed by the Brethren. However, it behoves them, as Miniſters of the meek and lowly JESUS, as much as poſſible, to deny themſelves; to deny their own Opinions, and Wills, and Rights, and ſtoop to the Infirmities of Men, and ſubmit to Things difficult enough to be borne, in many caſes; upon the excellent Principles and Views that acted the firſt Miniſters of CHRIST, (2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.9.) <hi>Not becauſe we have not Power, but to make our ſelves an Enſample unto you to follow us.</hi> — So 1 Cor. 9.12. <hi>We have not uſed this Power, but ſuffer all things, leſt we ſhould hinder the Goſpel of Chriſt.</hi> And 2 Cor. 6. <hi>In all things approving our ſelves as the Miniſters of GOD, in much Patience, in Afflictions, in Neceſſities, in Tumults, under Honour and Diſhonour, evil Report and good Report</hi> &amp;c. — They are not indeed to be the Servants of <hi>Men,</hi> ſo as tamely and ſervilely to proſtitute their Authority to popular Humours, or Traditions of Fathers: Yet they muſt let their Moderation be known to all Men, while they faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully execute the Commiſſion they have receiv'd from CHRIST; and labour to be Examples of Meekneſs, Prudence and Condeſcention; becoming all things to all Men; pleaſing them for their Good to Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; not ſeeking their own Profit, but the Profit of Many, that they may be ſaved; watching for Souls, as thoſe that muſt give an Account, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider they are Stewards of the Myſteries of GOD.</p>
            <p>But I proceed to obſerve as a further Preliminary. This Miniſterial Truſt is peculiar to a <hi>diſtinct Order</hi> of Men, inſtituted by CHRIST and of ſtanding Uſe and Obligation.</p>
            <p>The Miniſtry was originally <hi>appointed</hi> by CHRIST; and deſign'd, not for the Apoſtolick Age only, but to continue in the Church throughout all Ages; as
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:002871_0010_0FE67E9633ABD050"/>
might be argu'd, in that the Reaſons of the Inſtitution are of a moral nature, and perpetual continuance; and alſo from thoſe Scriptures, which tell us, That CHRIST has ſet Paſtors and Teachers in his Church for the Work of the Miniſtry, till we all come to a perfect Man; — That in the Lord's-Supper (the Adminiſtration of which is their peculiar Province) CHRIST's Death muſt ſhewed forth until He come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; — And that He has left a Promiſe to <hi>be with</hi> his Miniſters (teaching and baptiſing in his name) to the End of the World &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And it is an Office peculiar to a <hi>diſtinct Order</hi> of Men. 'Tis a ſacred Incloſure, &amp; do's not lie in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, for every one that pleaſes, to invade and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupy. All publick and ſpecial Offices in the State are limited to particular Subjects: So is the Miniſtry of the Goſpel. This Honour no Man taketh to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but he that is called of GOD. A liberty of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying, as held by ſome, appears to me but an unlawful Licence, and tends to unhappy Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The LORD is a GOD of Order, and not the Author of Confuſion, but of Peace: and wou'd have all things done decently and in order, in all the Churches of the Saints. 'Tis ſaid indeed, <hi>Covet to propheſy, and forbid not to ſpeak with Tongues:</hi> If a Man be inſpir'd with miraculous Gifts, let him ſpeak. But otherwiſe let him be orderly call'd and ſeparated to the Work. In ordinary Caſes, a regular Election and ſolemn Inveſtiture into the Office are requir'd to the Exerciſe of it: So that without theſe Praerequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites, even the preaching of the Word in a public and ſtated manner (without deſign or deſire of engaging in the Miniſtry, when call'd to Office) and much more the Adminiſtration of Sacraments, muſt be look'd upon as no ſmall Irregularities. Not that the Power (ſtrictly ſpeaking) comes by Election, or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:002871_0011_0FE67EA016BA86F8"/>
of Men, but by a Charter or Commiſſion from CHRIST open'd in the Goſpel: Yet thoſe human Actions are generally neceſſary to the <hi>orderly exerciſe</hi> of Miniſterial Authority. A Power, and the Right to <hi>exerciſe</hi> that Power, are two things very diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhable: The former uſually deriv'd by Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from ſome ſuperior Authority; but the latter by a ſolemn Inveſtiture, done in many caſes by Equals or Inferiors. 'Tis the Charter of a City or Laws of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, that appoints all Offices, and their ſeveral Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Buſineſſes: Yet that alone do's not intitle any individual Perſon to this or that Office, one more than another. But there is ſomething further requir'd to put any into Place, and authoriſe their aſſuming and exerciſing public Truſts. Thus, in ſome caſes, there muſt be a particular Commiſſion from the Government, and in others Election by the People: And in all caſes there's uſually a ſolemn Oath admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter'd to the Party choſen or appointed, which is a neceſſary introductive to the authentic performance of his Office. A Counſellour elect, tho' approv'd by the Chair, ſits not at the Board, till he has accepted the Place, and taken the Oath of Fidelity. A Juſtice, or other civil Officer, can't uſe his Power, till he's ſworn in ſolemn Form. The Commiſſion or Election indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitates the Perſons to whom the Law or Charter gives this or that Power: But it's his taking the Oath appointed, that properly inveſts him in his Office, or introduces him into the public Exerciſe of it.</p>
            <p>Even ſo, in the preſent caſe, The Power of a Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Miniſter originates and is founded intirely in the <hi>Inſtitution</hi> of ſuch an Order of Perſons, which our Lord was pleas'd to make, and has reveal'd in the Goſpel: Where He ſtates their Duty, limits their Authority, and fixes their proper Character; which it is not left to the uncertain Humours of Men to vary
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:002871_0012_0FE67EA0357618A0"/>
from, add to, or diminiſh. So that to inſtitute new Offices in the Church, or alter Offices divinely inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, by increaſing or leſſening their proper Powers, Qualifications, and Employments, is nothing ſhort of a bold Uſurpation of CHRIST's Prerogative, and a rude Reflection upon his governing Wiſdom, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Fidelity.</p>
            <p>Yet the Inſtitution requires ſome things preparato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the <hi>Exerciſe</hi> of the Office: And in ordinary caſes (whatever may be allow'd for caſes of Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, which ſeem to carry a ſufficient Warrant in themſelves) it muſt be held contrary to Goſpel-Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for any to exerciſe the Paſtoral Power (or any branch of the Miniſterial Office, except as Candidates or Probationers, occaſionally) until ſolemnly inveſted with that Authority, and ſeparated to that Work: Which is partly done by Election of the Church, and Laying on of the Hands of the Presbytery, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by a voluntary devout Self-conſecration.</p>
            <p>Now (to come to the Buſineſs before us) when the Appointment and Inveſtiture of ſome one into the miniſterial Office is propos'd by a People, it ſhou'd be the Care and Deſire of all concern'd, That the LORD JESUS CHRIST would <hi>ſhew whom HE hath choſen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſpeaking to this point, ſeveral Things may be briefly attempted. As (1.) to conſider <hi>who</hi> is intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Perſon whom CHRIST has <hi>choſen.</hi> (2.) To inquire <hi>how</hi> or in what <hi>ways</hi> He doth <hi>ſhew</hi> whom he has choſen. (3.) To give the <hi>Reaſons</hi> why it ſhou'd be the <hi>Care</hi> and <hi>Deſire</hi> of a People, that CHRIST would ſhew whom He hath choſen.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>I am to conſider</hi> Who <hi>is meant by the Perſon whom CHIRST has</hi> choſen.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:002871_0013_0FE67EA15DAEA200"/>And here,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It means in general one whom He <hi>approves</hi> as ſutably qualify'd for the Miniſtry, and in particular the Perſon whom He judges <hi>fitteſt</hi> for this place and people, and will <hi>own</hi> and <hi>bleſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When we read of the <hi>Faſt,</hi> which GOD hath <hi>cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen,</hi> it means ſuch an one as He deſires, approves of, and takes pleaſure in. When we read of the <hi>choſen</hi> Men of Iſrael, it means the <hi>Choiceſt</hi> of their Tribes, the mightieſt and beſt Men they had. So a <hi>choſen</hi> Generation, means an excellent Generation, the Lord's peculiar Treaſure, a Generation of his Praiſe. — <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> his <hi>Choſen,</hi> is <hi>Moſes</hi> his Beloved, in whom is an excellent Spirit, and in whom is his Delight. When we read <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.14. Many are called, <hi>but few are choſen</hi>; it may be expounded by <hi>ver.</hi> 8. <hi>They which were bidden, were not worthy.</hi> So 1 Pet. 2.6. <hi>Behold, I lay in Zion a chief Corner-ſtone, Elect, Precious</hi>:—(ver. 5.) Diſallowed indeed of Men, but <hi>Choſen of GOD,</hi> and <hi>precious.</hi> — A Man <hi>approved</hi> of GOD among you, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.22. — The Apoſtle means the ſame thing by thoſe different phraſes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.10 &amp; 13. Apelles <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved</hi> in CHRIST; — Rufus <hi>choſen</hi> in the Lord.</p>
            <p>So in our Text, by him whom CHRIST has <hi>choſen,</hi> we are to underſtand One that he approves of, as qualify'd for the Miniſtry, and has in ſpecial fitted for this Place and Station, and will accept, own, and bleſs therein. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.4. We were <hi>allowed of GOD,</hi> to be put in truſt with the Goſpel. <hi>Acts</hi> 9.15. He is a <hi>choſen Veſſel unto me, to bear my name</hi> before the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, and Kings, and the Children of Iſrael. <hi>John</hi> 13.18. <hi>I ſpeak not of you all; I know whom I have choſen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) It means the particular Perſon whom the Lord has <hi>decreed</hi> and <hi>appointed</hi> to this Poſt and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:002871_0014_0FE67EA184716BB0"/>There are many Perſons ſutably accompliſh'd for the Miniſtry, that Chriſt never deſigns to employ in this Work: And among the Candidates for a particular Station in the Miniſtry, there may be a Number ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently fitted, and almoſt equally agreeable to a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; yet One only is deſign'd for it by our Lord, and his Counſel ſhall ſtand.</p>
            <p>Shew whether of theſe <hi>Thou haſt choſen,</hi> means in part, Shew which Thou haſt appointed and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, in thy ſecret Counſels, unto this Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>The Word of the LORD aſſures us, that Men are predeſtinated according to the Purpoſe of Him, who worketh all things after the counſel of his own Will. And as He hath choſen us before the foundation of the World, unto the Adoption of Children, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the good pleaſure of his Will: So He has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated ſome of us unto ſpecial Offices in his Church, and in particular unto the Miniſtry of his Goſpel, to the praiſe of the glory of his Grace. Hence that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Who ſeparated me, from my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Womb.</hi> — Which may be explain'd by that to the Prophet, <hi>Jer.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Before</hi> I formed thee in the Belly, I knew thee; and before thou cameſt forth out of the Womb, <hi>I ſanctified thee</hi> (or ſeparated thee to an holy uſe) <hi>and I ordained thee a Prophet unto the Nations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is from the beginning predetermined <hi>Who</hi> ſhall ſerve the Lord CHRIST in the work of the Goſpel, and <hi>where</hi> he will employ them, in this or that part of his Vineyard. <hi>He hath determined the Times before appointed, and the bounds of their Habitation.</hi> If the Goſpel of the Circumciſion be committed unto <hi>Peter,</hi> and the Goſpel of the Uncircumciſion unto <hi>Paul,</hi> it's the Lord's doing; and herein <hi>he doth but perform the thing that was appointed for them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:002871_0015_0FE67EAA224E8438"/>I paſs now in the next place,</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>To conſider</hi> How <hi>or by what Means the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt doth</hi> ſhew <hi>whom He has choſen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here it may be obſerved; He ſhews this ſometimes in extraordinary ways, and ſometimes by more ordinary means.</p>
            <p n="1">I. He has ſometimes ſhewn it in an <hi>extraordinary</hi> manner, by an <hi>immediate</hi> Call.</p>
            <p>Thus, <hi>Aaron</hi> was made a Prieſt by the expreſs Deſignation of GOD himſelf. <hi>Samuel</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets in old time, were call'd in uncommon ways, by heavenly Viſions and Inſpirations. — So the Apoſtles under the Goſpel-Diſpenſation. Our LORD in the days of his fleſh, perſonally nominated his firſt Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and orally ſhew'd whom he had choſen. See <hi>Mark</hi> 3.13, 14. — Again, When he roſe from the Dead, he renew'd his Commiſſion to the Apoſtles, and after his Aſcenſion confirm'd their Call in an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary manner, when they <hi>receiv'd Power from on high,</hi> as we read <hi>Acts</hi> 3. — So He appear'd to <hi>Saul</hi> in a miraculous Viſion, to make him a Miniſter, and call'd him by a Voice from the excellent glory; as in <hi>Acts</hi> 26.13 —</p>
            <p>And beſides the Apoſtles, many in the Apoſtolic Age, receiv'd immediate Calls to the Miniſtry; among whom were inſpired Prophets and Evangeliſts. And perhaps oftentimes the Humane Call and the Divine Call, both met in one. It ſhou'd ſeem, <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were Inſtances of this. See <hi>Acts</hi> 13.2. and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14.</p>
            <p>But we are not now-a-days to look for extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Calls: beſure not ſuch as are <hi>neither of Men, nor by Men.</hi> If any pretend to an immediate Miſſion from Heaven, let them confirm their Pretences, by evident Miracles and Prophecies; or we can't think they come with ſufficient Credentials.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:002871_0016_0FE67EAA469A98F8"/>2. The LORD uſually ſhews whom He hath choſen in more <hi>ordinary</hi> ways, by a <hi>mediate</hi> Call.</p>
            <p>He ſhews it by the voice of his Providence and Spirit, in more common methods of diſcovery.</p>
            <p>Under the old Teſtament, Men were inſtated in the Prieſthood by <hi>a Law of carnal Generation.</hi> GOD appointed the Poſterity of <hi>Aaron</hi> to this Office, and the Succeſſion went by natural Birth.</p>
            <p>But now under the Goſpel we have nothing to do with a Lineal Succeſſion. This Method is aboliſh'd, and the Church of GOD left at their Liberty to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the Perſons that ſhall be in Office among them. They are not confin'd to one particular Tribe or Family; but may <hi>chuſe out of all the People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here I ſhall ſay diſtinctly, (1.) The Matter is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to be referr'd to a voluntary Election by <hi>Vote,</hi> or Human Agreement. Yet (2.) in ſome caſes, it may be determin'd by the ſpecial medium of a Divine <hi>Lot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The Matter is uſually refer'd to voluntary <hi>Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and Determination by VOTE: And when ſo, there muſt be ſuch a Concurrence of Circumſtances, as to render the Call plain and clear, if we would know <hi>whom CHRIST has choſen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might premiſe here, It is a principle profeſſed among us, that the Churches of CHRIST have in the preſent caſe a power of Election; the Liberty to vote for their own Officers. In defence of which it's urg'd that the very Apoſtles wou'd not appoint ſo much <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Deacons, to ſerve Tables, without the expreſs Suffrage of the People. (See <hi>Acts</hi> 6. <hi>begin.)</hi> And it's argu'd, from <hi>Acts</hi> 14.23. Where we are told, <hi>They ordained them Elders in every Church</hi>; That the Diſciples were allow'd the ſame Liberty and Privilege in the Choice of their Paſtors: The original word for <hi>ordained,</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying in its firſt political uſe, to deſign or conſtitute any Perſon an Officer by common Conſent, which was uſually expreſs'd by lifting up the hand. <q>The
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002871_0017_0FE67EAE1BF5C2B8"/>
word is but once more uſed in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.19. where it plainly ſignifies Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to an Employment.</q> — Speaking of ſome very worthy and famous Miniſter, the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>Who was</hi> choſen <hi>of the Churches to travel with us.</hi> But not to dwell upon this Argument; it is undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, that even in the Choice of an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> to fill up the Twelve, the Diſciples (being in number about 120 met together in one Body) were allow'd to come ſo near as to <hi>appoint</hi> the Candidates; any <hi>two</hi> from among themſelves, whom they judg'd meeteſt for the place; and then they (together with the Apoſtles preſent) having firſt pray'd, <hi>gave forth their Lots</hi> for the particular Perſon. And the Lot falling on <hi>Matthias,</hi> he was <hi>numbred</hi> with the Eleven Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, i. e. according to the Etymology of the greek word, was reckon'd among them by common Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage, receiv'd as an Apoſtle with univerſal Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation. — Theſe things laid together are, I think, Authority ſufficient, for the practice of the Churches, in chuſing their own Officers: Which Eccleſiaſtical Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty has been defended by ſome of our Divines, alſo from acknowledg'd Principles of natural Reaſon and common Equity, from the undoubted Rights and Cuſtoms of all free Societies, from the Nature of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted Churches, and the Ends of Order and Office-Power, as well as from primitive Practice<note n="‡" place="bottom">See Dr. <hi>I. Mather</hi>'s, Order of the Goſpel, <hi>page</hi> 69. And Dr. <hi>Owen</hi>'s True Nature of a Goſpel-Church, <hi>page</hi> 62, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note>. But We have no Leiſure at preſent to recite what is ſaid on theſe ſeveral heads.</p>
            <p>All I have further to do here, is to limit and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify the method in common uſe among us: And wou'd ſay, In order to a diſcovery of the Mind of CHRIST, or knowing whom the LORD has choſen, a People muſt ſee to it that their <hi>Election he regulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002871_0018_0FE67EAE4879C4F0"/>
according to his revealed Will, and the Call plain and clear, fair and orderly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to this End,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Some things are requir'd on the part of the <hi>Electing</hi> Body or Fraternity.</p>
            <p>For Inſtance, This muſt be rightly <hi>conſtituted</hi>; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of Perſons duly qualify'd to act in the affair. They that chuſe muſt be rightful <hi>Members</hi> of the Church of CHRIST. This is made neceſſary, by <hi>our</hi> Scheme of Church-Order, to qualify Perſons to vote in chuſing a Miniſter: And for it, we have the Countenance of Scripture, particularly in the famous Example before us. They that <hi>appointed the Two,</hi> as Candidates for the Choice in our Text, were all <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi>: By which Name the Body of Believers in that day were commonly call'd, in diſtinction from the Twelve. The <hi>Two</hi> were choſen, as the <hi>Seven</hi> are ſaid to be, by <hi>the multitude of the Diſciples.</hi> And we are told how many were preſent at the Choice of <hi>Matthias:— The number of the Names were about an hundred and twenty:</hi> who are deſcrib'd as <hi>Men which had aſſociated with the Apoſtles, all the time that the Lord</hi> JESUS <hi>went in and out among them.</hi> They were open and known Diſciples of CHRIST, who had confeſſed Him before the World, and communicated in the ſpecial Ordinances of his Kingdom. They are repreſented afterwards (together with others ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to them) as <hi>continuing in the Apoſtles Doctrine and Fellowſhip, and in breaking of Bread</hi>—. It ſeems they were all in full Communion, and approv'd Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians: Not any Perſons among them, of a ſcandalous Character, or an incomplete Profeſſion.</p>
            <p>Now, from this leading Example, it's thought, we may learn who are proper Subjects of the Liberty and Power of Election in the Cafe before us; Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the avow'd Members of a Goſpel-Church, ſtated<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſociating therewith in all public Worſhip and
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:002871_0019_0FE67EB8228C0268"/>
Ordinances. — And indeed it's judg'd ſcarce ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, that any ſhou'd be admitted to vote in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, or confederate Body, of which they are not orderly and confeſſed Members. Hence if there be any ſuch diſtinct Society as a congregational Church, inſtituted in Scripture, it's thought a Principle found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Reaſon and the Nature of things, That none but approv'd Members of this particular Body, have a juſt Right to vote in their Eccleſiaſtical Affairs, eſpecially in a caſe of ſuch peculiar Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern and Importance to the Peace, Purity, and Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the Church, as that of chuſing a Paſtor to watch over their Souls, and break the Bread of Life to them. It's pleaded by our Divines, that if we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Privilege beyond thoſe Limits, we ſhall not eaſily know where to ſtop: Whether in reſpect of the Perſons who muſt be admitted to this Privilege, or of other Privileges that ſuch Perſons may as reaſonably lay Claim to. And it is obſerved, That ſome of the main Arguments for ſtretching this Liberty further (and in particular, that of contributing to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter's Maintenance) will if purſu'd in their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Conſequences, carry the thing to a Length, that few, even of them who diſlike the Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation among us, will care to have it brought to. Now it's a known Maxim, That Argument that proves too much, proves e'en nothing to the purpoſe.</p>
            <p>To proceed,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Another</hi> thing is, The Church muſt ſee to it, that there be a due <hi>Examination</hi> and <hi>Trial</hi> had of the Candidates for Office among them. It is expreſly requir'd in the caſe of a Deacon, that the Perſon be <hi>firſt proved</hi> (try'd and approbated) <hi>then let him uſe the Office.</hi> (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.10.) Now ſurely it's of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Conſequence, that Elders and Teachers paſs under a proper Trial: &amp; this not only with regard to their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Qualifications for the Miniſtry, but eſpecially as
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:002871_0020_0FE67EB845B326F8"/>
to their Fitneſs and Accommodation unto this Church and Place in particular. It ſeems reaſonable that Chriſtians ſhou'd judge for themſelves, in this caſe. And who ordinarily are like to paſs a better Judgment than the Church concern'd? They that were able in the Apoſtles day to <hi>look out</hi> among themſelves, for the Deacons Office, Men of <hi>honeſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, full of the holy Ghoſt, and of Wiſdom,</hi> ſeem to me ſufficiently capable of judging upon the Meetneſs of Perſons for the Paſtoral Care alſo. And are they not in many Places of Scripture expreſly directed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to <hi>try the Spirits,</hi> whether they are of GOD; to <hi>beware of falſe Prophets,</hi> that come to them in Sheeps clothing, but inwardly are ravening Wolves, whom they ſhou'd know by their fruits; and if any Man preach <hi>any other Goſpel</hi> unto them, than they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, to hold him <hi>accurſed.</hi> If there come any unto you, and bring not <hi>this Doctrine</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) receive him not into your houſe, neither bid him <hi>GOD ſpeed.</hi> It's obſervable, the <hi>Bereans</hi> are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for trying of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi>'s Doctrine by the Scriptures. And the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for <hi>trying them which ſaid they were Apoſtles.</hi> Theſe Scriptures (together with the Reaſon of the thing) appear to me a ſufficient foundation for the common Cuſtom among us of a popular Trial of Candidates. And if beſides the uſual Probation by public Preaching (which is more ſubject to Miſtakes) there were alſo private inquiries, eſpecially by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Conference, it might be of great Uſe and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit: Though this kind of Exploration ſeems to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long more particularly to the Presbytery of the Church, if there be any ſuch before inſtated. Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably the <hi>New-England</hi> Platform aſſigns it to the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, as their ſpecial Province, ſaying <note n="‖" place="bottom">Chap. <hi>X.</hi> Sect. <hi>9.</hi>

For as the Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>Can two walk together, except they be agreed?</hi> — It is obſervable, the Vote and Lot in the Deſignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Matthias</hi> were manag'd in the Preſence and under the Conduct of the Apoſtles. And ſo was the Election of the Deacons: as you may ſee in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. From whence ſome infer, that there is a Power of Inſpection and Guidance in the Choice of Officers (as well as in the Admiſſion of Members) which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the Elders; if there be any praeexiſting in the Church. But whether this be a ſtanding Right of the Elderſhip, or whether they have no more than the Liberty of common Suffrage, I liſt not to diſpute.

withal, and their Help made uſe of in the Trial of Church-Officers, in order to their Choice.</q> Upon which <hi>One</hi> 
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">See the late Rev. Mr. <hi>Symmer's</hi> Life, page 63.</note> has well obſerved to this Purpoſe; "The Communion of Churches and Intereſt of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion depend very much (humanely ſpeaking) on the Unity and good Agreement of the Elders in the Vicinity. If they love one another, and agree well together, they will ſtrengthen one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their Work: But if they diſagree, this will tend to weaken their Hands, and diſcourage their Hearts more than a little. "Churches therefore ought, what in them lies, to ſuit their Neighbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miniſters and Churches, in the Choice of a Miniſter: Remembring they are not only to chuſe an Officer for themſelves, but a Neighbour for Them.</p>
            <p>And certainly then it is adviſeable that the <hi>Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi> (as we diſtinguiſh) or Body of Noncommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants (being baptis'd Profeſſors, aſſociating con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly in the Word and Prayer, with the Church concern'd) ſhou'd have ſome Regard ſhewn to them in this Affair; ſurely at leaſt, as much as is due to any Chriſtian Neighbours. And a great deal of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is generally neceſſary here, to conſult their Peace and Satisfaction, while the Church's Right of Election (or Precedence in the Choice) is aſſerted and exerciſed.</p>
            <p>But however theſe things be, ſurely a <hi>Trial</hi> ought to be made, by one means or other, ſufficient for the Church more immediately concern'd, to form a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Judgment upon; that there may be no place for <hi>Jude</hi>'s Complaint, <hi>There are certain Men</hi> (falſe Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers) <hi>crept in unawares.</hi> It behoves them to <hi>take Counſel together,</hi> for imparting Light to one another, in a way free from all Party-Deſigns and Artifices;
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:002871_0023_0FE67EC0EADBF838"/>
to proceed with a juſt Deliberation, and in the whole Affair to act with Caution, Prudence and Impartiality. They muſt eſpecially <hi>ask Counſel</hi> at the Throne of Grace, by devout and fervent <hi>Prayer</hi>; as we have an Example in our Text.</p>
            <p>And the Reſult muſt be a <hi>general</hi> Union of Hearts in a <hi>free</hi> and <hi>voluntary</hi> Choice, made without any Colluſion or Conſtraint; without all deceitful or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Meaſures, to flatter or force on a Vote for any<note n="‡" place="bottom">Hiſtories inform (as one obſerves) That in ancient Times the Chooſers of Overſeers (or Paſtors) gave with their Voice ſolemn Aſſeveration or Oath, that their Choice was wholly free, and not the fruit of undue Influence.</note>. A willing Concurrence of the Majority of the Church is neceſſary, by all the Rules of Society, to a deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining Vote: And the more of Unanimity, the clearer Diſcovery is made of CHRIST's Mind and Will; eſpecially when Perſons of Eminence and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction (for their Gifts and Graces, rather than worldly Abilities) are concurring in the Choice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> There are ſome things requir'd on the part of the <hi>Candidates</hi> in view, to make them capable Subjects of an Election. There are certain Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, indiſpenſably neceſſary to this End, to be reſpected by the Chuſers.</p>
            <p>Thus, the <hi>Sex</hi> muſt be regarded; according to thoſe Apoſtolic Canons, which we have in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.34, 35. And 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.11, 12.</p>
            <p>Again, The <hi>Age</hi> muſt have ſome Regard paid to it. Under the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law, they were allow'd to perform Service in the Tabernacle, only from <hi>thirty</hi> years and upwards, until <hi>fifty</hi> years old: Though in <hi>David</hi>'s time Perſons were admitted Probationers at <hi>twenty,</hi> and as it ſhou'd ſeem ſtood ſo for <hi>ten</hi> years. However, this is no Rule now under the Goſpel, and
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:002871_0024_0FE67EC10DE05A58"/>
I know of no Reaſon for Perſons waiting now till they are <hi>thirty</hi> years old, before they enter upon the Miniſtry, any more than that they ſhou'd be diſcharg'd at <hi>fifty,</hi> as in Jewiſh days. Yet that ancient Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution ſeems to carry ſo much of Morality and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with it, that it appears highly proper, decent and expedient, that atleaſt Perſons be <hi>come to years,</hi> to Men's Eſtate, before they be choſen into the Miniſtry.—But I ſhall not enlarge here; having already given my Sentiments on this head in a Sermon <note n="†" place="bottom">Serm. at Mr. <hi>Lowel</hi>'s Ordination, <hi>page 30</hi> &amp;c.</note> which ſome of you have in your hands.</p>
            <p>And then a Man's <hi>moral</hi> Character, and <hi>intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> Furniture, as well as <hi>Orthodoxy</hi> muſt be reſpected. He muſt be a Perſon of known Integrity, Capacity, and Fitneſs. Not only a Man of ſufficient Learning, but one <hi>apt to teach,</hi> and <hi>holding faſt the faithful Word</hi>; One of unblemiſh'd Morals and exemplary Piety; One of a meek, humble, and Self-denying Spirit, and indu'd with a good degree of Prudence and Diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to <hi>take Care of the Church of GOD,</hi> and ſecure its Peace and Purity, while he contends earneſtly for the Faith, and diligently attends the practical Concerns of Government, Order and Diſcipline. According to that Apoſtolical Directory, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. And <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. Which Chapters I commend to ſerious Conſideration at your leiſure.</p>
            <p>In a word, He ought to be a Perſon, not only of good Life, and good Abilities, but of a <hi>Miniſterial Genius</hi>; regularly inclin'd; diſpos'd to the Work, upon proper Motives, <hi>Deſiring the Office of a Biſhop,</hi> as the Apoſtle hints, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.1. Indeed a Man may covet the Office, and not be at all qualify'd (as they, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.7.) In which caſe, an Election to Office is <hi>ipſo facto</hi> null and void; being the choice of an incapable Subject. <q>By previous Qualifications for
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:002871_0025_0FE67EC26CF17A58"/>
the Miniſtry, a general Deſignation of the Perſons to be called to it, is made by CHRIST himſelf: But where this is <hi>wholly</hi> wanting (ſays One <note n="‖" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Dr.</hi> Owen.</note>) it is not in the Power of any Church under Heaven, by virtue of any outward Order or Act, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate Paſtoral or Miniſterial Power unto any Perſon whatever.</q> So on the other hand, Perſons may have a competent portion of Miniſterial Gifts; and yet being habitually averſe to the Work, and reſolutely engag'd for ſome other Employment, or diſpos'd to this only for worldly Ends, if theſe things be known, it can't be proper to chuſe any ſuch: And in either caſe the Call is not clear. Something like the Spirit of the old Prophets, to whom <hi>the Word of the</hi> LORD, <hi>came</hi> and was in their Hearts <hi>as a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fire,</hi> begetting an ardent Thirſt after the Glory of GOD, and good of Souls, is one conſiderable ſtep towards a Divine Call. Some inward Senſe of this ſeems neceſſary to make a Man's Call clear to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: And a rational Apprehenſion of it in the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſeems neceſſary to legitimate their Election. For as the LORD looketh on the <hi>Heart</hi>: So muſt we, as far as it is diſcoverable; though ſtill we muſt beware of uncharitable evil Surmiſings. But if a Man plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcovers a ſtrong Bent to any civil or ſecular Employment, it is unadviſed to make Choice of ſuch an one for the Miniſtry. Or if he viſibly diſcovers the prevailing grounds of his Inclination to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, to be groſsly carnal and worldly (as <hi>Eli</hi>'s Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.36.) can a People ſafely, or even lawfully, chuſe ſuch an one? I may add, if one in general ſincerely inclin'd, is invited to this or that particular Station in the Miniſtry, and cannot find a Heart (even after ſerious Inquiry and humble Prayer) to comply, I ſee not that the Call of any
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:002871_0026_0FE67EC2930B4A38"/>
People is of ſuch force and obligation, as that he muſt ſin in refuſing of it. We find, in a caſe of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what the like nature, even Apoſtolical Invitations and Intreaties, were in vain with <hi>Apollos</hi>: See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.12. It is requiſite then that a Man have a well-principl'd Diſpoſedneſs to the Miniſtry, and to the particular Place where he's invited.</p>
            <p>And when there is thus a Sufficiency of Gifts and Qualifications, and a ſutable Inclination in the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didate, concurring with an unanimous or general Agreement of a Chriſtian People (both Fraternity and Presbytery) in the Election and Approbation of him; eſpecially if alſo there be the Concurrence of Neighbour-Elders &amp; Churches; here's ſuch an aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blage or conjunction of happy Circumſtances, as ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the Call ſtrong and valid, and ſeems clearly to point out the Perſon <hi>whom CHRIST has choſen.</hi> In ordinary caſes, the regular Vote of a Church (en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forc'd by ſuch a general Deſire and Agreement on all ſides) is look'd upon as the Voice of GOD, by which He calls Men forth to Service in his Church. The good Shepherd ſo called, may well be ſaid to <hi>enter in by the Door.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But yet,</p>
            <p n="2">2. In ſome <hi>ſpecial</hi> Caſes, it ſhou'd ſeem proper to refer the Matter to a LOT, for Determination; and if this be done in a regular and ſolemn manner, the Iſſue may juſtly be look'd upon as a manifeſtation of the Will and Mind of CHRIST.</p>
            <p>I ſhall a little particularly inſiſt on this too, becauſe I am ſo naturally led to it by the <hi>Context,</hi> which tells us that this was the Method in which CHRIST ſhew'd He had choſen and appointed <hi>Matthias</hi> to be an Apoſtle.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Nature</hi> of a Lot, I ſhall only ſay, The Word may be ſometimes uſed in a lax, and leſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:002871_0027_0FE67EC92A4A08D8"/>
Senſe, for any kind of <hi>Reference</hi> made to GOD, though in a way that implies the Contrivance and Activity of Men, and requires only a Divine Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to direct their Thoughts and Powers, in order to the Event. In which ſenſe the <hi>Vote</hi> of any Body of Men, may be call'd a Lot. But yet ſtrictly ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Lot is an awful Appeal to Heaven, in ſuch a way and manner as ſhuts out human Counſel and Influence, and depends on a ſpecial Agency of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence, for the actual determining of an Event. <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.33. <hi>The Lot is caſt into the Lap; but the whole Diſpoſing thereof is of the</hi> LORD. The Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's the LORD's. "The Event, though caſual to Men, is directed and determin'd by GOD's Counſel and Providence", which controuls and governs in all Caſes.</p>
            <p>The Lot was an Ordinance of GOD much in Uſe under the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Diſpenſation, for Deciſion of Right in uncertain caſes, and putting an Iſſue to weighty Matters depending, which were not with facility de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminable in any other way. Thus the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> was divided to the ſeveral Tribes by Lot. (<hi>Numb.</hi> 26.55, 56.) The Scape-goat was choſen by Lot. <hi>(Lev.</hi> 16.7.) The Lot was made uſe of, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting of ſecret Criminals: as in the caſe of <hi>Achan</hi> (<hi>Joſh.</hi> 7.16.) And of <hi>Jonah</hi> (<hi>Jon.</hi> 1.7.) And of <hi>Jonathan</hi> (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.42.) The Method of a Lot was taken to determine the Time, when each Family ſhould bring in their <hi>Quota</hi> of Wood for the Service of the Temple, after the <hi>Jews</hi> Return from their Captivity: And who of the People ſhou'd go up out of the Villages and Cities of <hi>Judah,</hi> to dwell at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> where the Rulers reſided, and the Houſe of GOD was in building, and where they wou'd be moſt expos'd to the Malice and Envy of their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries: It's ſaid, <hi>The People caſt Lots, to bring one of Ten, to dwell there. (Neh.</hi> 10.34. <hi>&amp;</hi> 11.1.)</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:002871_0028_0FE67EC94D7177A0"/>In a word, this Method was us'd in the Election of Perſons to Office; as in the caſe of <hi>Saul</hi> choſen King of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.19 —) So of the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Leontes,</hi> whom King <hi>David</hi> diſtributed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to many diſtinct Companies or Courſes (as well as the <hi>Militia</hi> of the Kingdom.) <hi>They caſt Lots</hi> for every Poſt and Service, as well the ſmall as the great, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the houſe of their Fathers; as you have the Account at large in 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24<hi>th</hi> Chapter and onwards. —</p>
            <p>And it's remarkable, the firſt Election of any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon into Office in the Chriſtian Church (wherein there was any thing of the ordinary Acting or Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Men) <hi>viz.</hi> that which our Text relates to, was conſummated or perfected by a Lot. Indeed there was a previous Nomination of Two, by Suffrage or Vote of the whole Multitude: But the Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the particular Perſon <hi>(whether of theſe two)</hi> they for very good Reaſons put upon a different Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, and appealed to Heaven by a ſolemn Lot.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Manner</hi> of this Lot, we are left at an uncertainty: Though ſome tell us <note n="†" place="bottom">Vid. <hi>Whirby</hi> in loc.</note> "They put two Lots into two Urns, or Ballot-boxes; the one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the two Names of <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Matthias,</hi> the other the Name of an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> and a Blank or void Lot; and then drawing forth the Name of <hi>Joſeph</hi> out of one Urn, and the void Lot out of t' her, they knew that the Lot remaining with the Name of an <hi>Apoſtle</hi> upon it, belong'd to <hi>Matthias.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Reaſons</hi> or ſpecial Grounds of their caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lot in this caſe, neither are we particularly inform'd of them. Whether there was any thing in the Nature of the Office, the Perſon was to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to; as ſome are of Opinion, who ſay, the ultimate Determination of the individual Perſon, and
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:002871_0029_0FE67ECBD327CF00"/>
immediate Diſpoſition of him into his Office, by GOD, was neceſſary to give him Apoſtolical Authority: or whether it was done upon no other than the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon moral Reaſons, which influenced in the caſes above-mention'd, in old Teſtament-times; I ſhall not enter into any Debate.</p>
            <p>The late excellent Mr. <hi>Henry</hi> 
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Vid. <hi>Expoſ.</hi> 1 Chro. 24.</note> ſeems to have been of the Judgment, that the Lot in theſe caſes was <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidential.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So the memorable Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> whoſe Words up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the place <note n="‡" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Vid.</hi> Paraphr.</note> are; <q>I know no Reaſon why the— Paſtors of the Church (at leaſt in caſes of doubt) ſhou'd not now be <hi>ſo</hi> choſen,</q> i. e. by Lot.</p>
            <p>What the Judgment and Practice of Antiquity was, I have not had Leiſure particularly to inform my ſelf. Only I'll give you a Paſſage out of <hi>The Order of the Goſpel</hi> (by the late venerable Dr. <hi>Mather</hi>) where he has the following words: <q>Nothing is more evident than that in the firſt Ages of the Church, Paſtors were choſen by all and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their Flocks: In chuſing a Miniſter, they did <hi>Clerozein,</hi> that is, Chuſe him by <hi>Lot</hi>; from whence it was that Miniſters had the Name of <hi>Clergy</hi> given to them<note n="†" place="bottom">Page 69.</note>.</q>
            </p>
            <p>All I would ſay upon the Lot in the preſent Caſe, give me Leave to offer in the following Hints. And allow me the freedom of young <hi>Elihu,</hi> in ſaying <hi>Hearken to me, I alſo will ſhew my Opinion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Lawfulneſs</hi> of a Lot, for determining in this Caſe, if under a juſt Regulation, I preſume no one will diſpute it, that doth allow of the practice in civil Caſes. "And it is hardly imaginable that GOD ſhou'd not have left that lawful, which is ſo evidently neceſſary to the Peace and Security of Mankind, and which
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:002871_0030_0FE67ECC01A1FBE8"/>
the unavoidable Condition of human Affairs makes of ſuch great and eminent Uſe to the World."</p>
            <p>And now for the <hi>Expediency</hi> of it in Caſes ſacred, particularly in the preſent Caſe, under ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Circumſtances, which frequently happen, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe much might be eaſily ſaid, and ſtrongly argu'd.</p>
            <p>In general, it is a Caſe of no little <hi>Importance;</hi> ſuch as will bear us out in applying ſo awful a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod for Determination. The Lot is a thing <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>reverend</hi>: and to uſe it in a ludicrous or wanton manner, about Trifles, and Matters of ſmall moment, is a Folly in Iſrael, judg'd to be no leſs than <hi>taking the Name of the</hi> LORD <hi>in vain.</hi> But the caſe before us is of vaſt weight and ſolemn conſideration: ſuch as calls for the moſt ſerious Treatment from Men; and wherein, if in any matter at all (the Honour of CHRIST being ſo nearly concern'd in it) we may hope that the Lord will own and accept the Appeal made to Him, and give an anſwer of Peace.</p>
            <p>Moreover, It's often a <hi>doubtful</hi> Caſe, and attended with no ſmall degree of Uncertainty. Many times the caſe is like that in the Story of our Text: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Candidates preſent, who are very worthy and deſirable for their Accompliſhments, and ſo recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend themſelves by their public Performances, as well as private Converſation, that a People are will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſhou'd be either of them, and agree it ſhall be one, or at leaſt ſuppoſe it will, and yet ſcarce know where (many of them) to pitch their ultimate Choice. Now in doubtful caſes, what more proper method for Determination than a religious Lot? Indeed in things already determin'd by a clear Revelation of the Mind of CHRIST in holy Scripture, or very appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to human Reaſon, and capable of being eaſily determin'd by a little ſerious and impartial Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; here there's no occaſion for ſuch an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary

method: And if there be no occaſion, it will be judg'd but profane trifling with the Name of CHRIST, to appeal to him by a Lot.—But where there is real Uncertainty, and ſober Doubt, or a Variety of Apprehenſions among the Parties concern'd in an important Caſe (important whether in regard of its Nature, or its Conſequences) and there be little Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of a peaceable Iſſue by any other means; then caſt the Lot, for a Reſolution of the Doubt.</p>
            <p>In fine, the caſe before us is many times attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a great deal of <hi>Difficulty</hi>; and the divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sentiments among a People do too often, for want of ſome happy means of Accommodation, at laſt throw them into great Contentions and Diſorders.</p>
            <p>Among a number of Candidates, there's generally ſeen a Diverſity of Gifts and Talents: And hence, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong a People, as there is a variety of Taſtes and Judgments, ſo in conſequence hereof, there's uſually a difference of Choice and Inclination; one being determin'd for this, and another for that —. And now as Men are commonly very much diſpos'd to be fond of their own Opinion or Fancy; ſo this by a natural efficacy makes them the more wedded in their Affections, and reſolv'd in their Choice; that they can't tell how to brook a Diſappointment. Hence they are too often put upon ſiniſter Methods to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their Ends: or if balk'd of their Expectations, are carry'd into inordinate Reſentments and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Meaſures. Such is the remaining Infirmity in the beſt and wiſeſt of Men, and ſuch the Subtilty and Power of our grand Adverſary the Devil (who goes about, as a roaring Lion, to devour and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb) That through the juſt Judgment and Permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Providence, the Peace of the Churches is oft-times miſerably broken, in purſuit of unreaſonable Prejudices on the one hand, or of a fond Opinion and extravagant Affection on the other; while <hi>they
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:002871_0032_0FE67ED31A9B0130"/>
have Men's Perſons in Admiration,</hi> ſo as to be <hi>puffed up for one againſt another.</hi> And in no caſe hardly are a People more apt to fall into carnal Contention, than in that before us. <q>Scarce any thing makes ſo much Noiſe, and occaſions (for the time) ſo much ſinful Anger and Evil-ſpeaking<note n="‖" place="bottom">Symmos<hi>'s Life p.</hi> 57.</note>.</q> Even <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> thoſe eminent Saints and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of CHRIST, differ'd about a <hi>Companion</hi> and Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-labourer in the Miniſtry: And the ſacred Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian tells us <note n="†" place="bottom">Act. 15.39.</note> 
               <hi>The Contention was ſo ſharp between them,</hi> that they parted one from the other, and each took his Colleague. So of the Church at <hi>Corinth,</hi> we have the Apoſtle giving that doleful Account, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.11 — <hi>It hath been declared unto me of you, my Brethren, that there are Contentions among you. Now this I ſay, that every one of you ſaith, I am of</hi> Paul, <hi>and I of</hi> Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo, <hi>and I of</hi> Cephas <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Again, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.3, 4. <hi>For whereas there is among you Envying, and Strife, and Diviſions; are ye not carnal, and walk according to Men? For while one ſaith, I am of</hi> Paul, <hi>and another, I am of</hi> Apollo, <hi>are ye not carnal?</hi> — And in our Days, O! how much is there of this Carnality to be ſeen among Profeſſors; this ſpirit of party and facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>the leven of malice and wickedneſs</hi>! How often have Churches been almoſt rent to pieces by ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Quarrels about the Settlement of a Miniſter; to the great Diſhonour of Religion, to the Reproach of our Profeſſion, and to the Gratification of them that malign our Eccleſiaſtical Conſtitution, and envy us our happy Rights and Privileges! For want of a wiſe Conduct, popular Votes and Choices are too often attended with ungodly Strifes and Emulations. Now as the Apoſtle obſerves, Where <hi>Envying and Strife</hi> prevail, there is <hi>Confuſion</hi> and <hi>every evil work.</hi> And then ſuch Diviſions are difficult to be heal'd.
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:002871_0033_0FE67ED465CC6FF8"/>
We may apply here that of <hi>Solomon, — A Brother offended, is harder to be won than a ſirong City, and their Contentions are like the Bars of a Caſtle.</hi> Hence then in this critical caſe it greatly behoves a People to <hi>ſtudy</hi> for Quietneſs, to <hi>follow</hi> the Things that make for <hi>Peace</hi>; and if it be poſſible, manage ſo as to ſecure this. <hi>The beginning of Strife, is as when one letteth out Water</hi>: When it has got ſome little Vent, it will it ſelf widen the Breach, and in a little time grow irreſiſtible, if ſpeedy care be not taken to put a ſtop to it. <hi>Therefore</hi> ſays the wiſe Man, <hi>leave off Contention before it be meddled with.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, what more effectual Method to this End, (that is, to leave off Contention <hi>before</hi> it be meddled with) can be us'd, in the preſent caſe, than that of a religious <hi>Lot?</hi> The Lot, every one that has any thing in him ſerious, looks upon as ſacred and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. The very Pagans yous find in the caſe of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah,</hi> paying a profound Reverence to the Lot, as carrying in it ſomething peculiarly Divine. Here GOD is beheld as ſitting in Judgment: And the Awe of this will have the ſtrongeſt Influence, of any Reflection in the World, to reſtrain Men's turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Paſſions, and ſuppreſs thoſe fretful Reſentments that ſo frequently break out upon a Diſappointment, when we eye only the hand of Men in it. The leſs there is of Man, and the more of GOD is ſeen, in any affair, the greater Content ſhall we take in the Iſſue. — <hi>What was I that I ſhou'd withſtand GOD! — Leſt haply ye be found even to fight againſt GOD!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Apoſtle obſerves, <hi>An Oath</hi> for Confirmation, is to Men an <hi>End of all Strife.</hi> And agreeable is that Remark of <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 18.18. <hi>The</hi> Lot <hi>cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Contentions to ceaſe,</hi> and <hi>parteth between the mighty.</hi> Here the Wiſe Man hints the <hi>right</hi> application of the Lot, <hi>viz.</hi> In difficult and doubtful Caſes, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent or end Contentions. <q>By telling us what <hi>is</hi>
                  <pb n="32" facs="unknown:002871_0034_0FE67ED48D27B4D0"/>
done, he tells us what <hi>ought</hi> to be done, in ſuch Caſes. Then a Lot is lawfully us'd, when it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther preſerveth or procureth Peace and Equity<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Dod</hi> &amp; Cl. in loc.</note>.</q> And as to the <hi>Efficacy</hi> of this Method, you have not only the Wiſe Man's Teſtimony, but the concurrent Suffrage of common Reaſon, and univerſal Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.</p>
            <p>Hence, upon ſuch Views and Conſiderations as theſe, it ſeems a high Propriety (at leaſt in ſome Caſes) to take the Method of a Lot, in the Choice of a Miniſter: Which will make it more emphatically a Divine Choice, and have a happy Tendency to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle the Minds of Men, and adjuſt all Diſputes where there are contending Parties.</p>
            <p>But then in this Method there are ſeveral Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoes &amp; Limitations to be carefully obſerv'd. Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It ſeems neceſſary that ſome <hi>certain Candidates</hi> be ſingled out, and nominated, by general Conſent in a voluntary Vote: (For this you have the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the Church who <hi>appointed Two,</hi> in order to the Lot for an Apoſtle) Which will effectually ſecure the privilege and liberty of the Body Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtic, to all good Intents and Purpoſes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is neceſſary that the Perſons in view, be <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably qualify'd</hi>: — I do not ſay <hi>equally</hi> in all reſpects, but each of them in ſome agreeable meaſure. — For It muſt be a lawful and juſtifiable Caſe, in which the Lot is us'd. And therefore it muſt not be caſt for any that are apparently incapable Subjects of Election: Becauſe there is no uncertainty here. If either of the Perſons propos'd are known to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualify'd by any eſſential Defects, whether in point of Knowledge, Faith, or Morals; it is but a profane mocking and tempting of CHRIST, to draw the Lot:
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:002871_0035_0FE67EDC81607290"/>
and therefore unlawful to put the Matter to ſuch an Iſſue. It is but as <hi>Haman</hi>'s Lot for the chuſing ſome lucky day to accompliſh a wicked Deſign: Or as the <hi>Soldiers</hi> impious Lot for our SAVIOUR's ſeamleſs Coat (ſo fam'd for its miraculous Virtue) which cou'd give none of them a juſt Propriety.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Lot muſt be employ'd in a <hi>ſolemn</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious</hi> manner.</p>
            <p>Being a practical Appeal to Heaven, it's but fit the Matter ſhou'd be tranſacted in a ſerious frame, <hi>after a godly ſort.</hi> The Lot is too awful a thing to be dally'd with. It muſt not be us'd raſhly, and in a light and luſory way; but with Deliberation, Seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and Solemnity. And 'tis highly fitting this ſacred Tranſaction ſhou'd be accompany'd with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout <hi>Prayer</hi>; at leaſt Ejaculatory, and in ſuch Caſes of Importance as that before us, with more ſolemn Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications. At the Diviſion of the Land among the Children of Iſrael, it's obſerv'd, <hi>Joſhua</hi> caſt Lots for them in <hi>Shiloh, before the Lord</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Joſh. 18.10.</note>.</p>
            <p>And now if the Lot be thus regulated, the Succeſs may (I think) in Faith be committed to Divine Providence: And the Event may well be look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as an inconteſtible Diſcovery of the Mind of CHRIST; <hi>ſhewing</hi> hereby <hi>whether of theſe He hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen.</hi> I cou'd never yet ſee why in ſuch a Caſe we mayn't now-a-days, as they did in old time, expect the ſpecial Interpoſition of Heaven, to <hi>give a perfect Lot</hi>: As King <hi>Saul</hi> pray'd to the LORD GOD of Iſrael, in the Caſe depending between Him and his Son on one ſide, and the People on the other<note n="‡" place="bottom">1 Sam. 14.41.</note>.</p>
            <p>Indeed the Religious Lot is grown much out of Cuſtom; though the Civil be retain'd and in fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Uſe: yet the Diviſory Lot, more than the
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:002871_0036_0FE67EDCA0097638"/>
Elective. But why the Lot is ſo diſus'd in matters ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and eccleſiaſtical, I can at preſent think of no better or truer Reaſon than the common Abuſes and Profanations of it in other caſes. It is generally own'd, The Lot may lawfully be us'd about <hi>civil</hi> Concerns, where weighty Conſequences are in proſpect, and where unhappy Differences can't well be prevented or iſſu'd any other way. Yet even here, whatſoever is more than this, <hi>comes of Evil.</hi> The Lot is a virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Calling upon GOD the LORD, to direct and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine us: And therefore to employ this religious Rite, in caſes that are plain and clear, beyond all rational Diſpute, or in frivolous, much more in ſportive Matters, is by Divines judg'd unlawful, as making too bold with Providence. And the cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary unhallow'd uſe of it in trivial Plays and Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times (with the too unſerious, and perhaps often un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary Application of it in many Affairs of Life) appears to me the moſt obvious Reaſon why it is fallen into Diſuſe in ſacred Things. 'Tis owing to the Subtilty and Influence of an Helliſh Tempter, that the Lot is ſo deſecrated and perverted, in a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual ſportful World. As one obſerves; <q>GOD hath his Ordinances: the Devil has his. GOD hath Sacraments for his People: the Devil has his. Is the <hi>Oath</hi> GOD's Ordinance? In Affront to this, the Devil ſet up profane Swearing, to leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen the Authority and Veneration of a ſacred Oath. So is the <hi>Lot</hi> GOD's Ordinance? Herein alſo the Enemy ſows his Tares: and to affront GOD in this Ordinance of his, he has his gaming and ſportive Lotteries. That there may be no Religion in the uſe of Lots [and that the Lot mayn't be apply'd to the Service of Religion] the Devil has turn'd them all into Play</q> and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, or a method of Gain and Profit, or into Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, Bible-Lottery (as it is call'd) and Sorcery
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:002871_0037_0FE67EDE0D0F9508"/>
or Divination. However, the frequent <hi>Abuſe</hi> and Miſapplication of a thing, capable of being directed to ſo excellent purpoſes, as the Lot is, doth not at all forbid the <hi>regular</hi> Improvement of it: And I can't ſee why it mayn't be as ſafely and profitably em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in ſacred Caſes (where it ſeems indeed the moſt proper and needful) now as ever. Nor can I ſee why the <hi>Lot</hi> ſhou'd be laid aſide, on the Account of vulgar Abuſes, any more than the <hi>Oath</hi>; which though as much proſtituted and as often violated, is notwithſtanding made uſe of ſtill, without any Scruple, and with good Succeſs, as <hi>an End of Strife.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You may obſerve, I go very much on rational Grounds; and build not upon Scripture only: Tho' if this directs to a Lot, in any Caſe, I think it is ſufficient Authority, were there no ſuch evident Grounds in Reaſon for it. But I have enlarg'd here, on a too uncultivated Subject, much further than was at firſt intended. I ſhut up this head with that free Addreſs of <hi>Elihu</hi> to his worthy Fathers, the three Friends of <hi>Job</hi>; — <hi>Hear, O ye wiſe Men, and give Ear, ye that have Knowledge. For the Ear trieth Words, as the Mouth taſteth Meat. Let us chuſe to us Judgment: let us know among our ſelves what is good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I haſten now to the laſt thing under the Doctrine, which is —</p>
            <p n="3">III. To ſay <hi>Why</hi> it ought to be the <hi>Care</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire</hi> of a People, in the Caſe before us, that CHRIST wou'd <hi>ſhew</hi> whom He hath choſen.</p>
            <p>And here I ſhall only hint,</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, It's but <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>reaſonable,</hi> that He ſhou'd have the Chuſing of his own Servants; and is <hi>deſirable</hi> that Such ſhou'd be put into the Miniſtry, whom <hi>he approves,</hi> and will own and bleſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="unknown:002871_0038_0FE67EDE2F5C92A0"/>He is the Fountain of all Power: and may lodge it in whoſe hands he pleaſeth. He has inſtituted the ſeveral Offices in the Church: And 'tis his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, as Head and Lord, to fill them with his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; whom, and in what way he pleaſeth.</p>
            <p>
               <q>As the <hi>Ordinances</hi> muſt be only ſuch as are of <hi>his</hi> Inſtitution: So the <hi>Diſpenſers</hi> of them muſt be ſuch as are of his Deſignation; elſe they can't expect his Preſence to be with them. The LORD once complain'd of ſome Prophets, That <hi>they ran,</hi> and <hi>He did not ſend them:</hi> Of whom He declares (which is threatning enough) That therefore <hi>they ſhould not profit the People at all,</hi> Jer. 23.21, 32.</q> It is a dreadful thing to ſit under the Preaching and Adminiſtrations of a Man, whom we can't ſee CHRIST bearing Teſtimony to, by a ſpecial Bleſſing on his Labours, or any viſible Tokens of his ſpiritual Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with him.</p>
            <p>Hence it's a very reaſonable Care, when a People are concern'd and deſirous, that CHRIST wou'd ſhew whom He has choſen. It's fit his Will ſhou'd be done, his Counſel take place; and to be deſir'd that his good Pleaſure may be known.</p>
            <p>Again, Conſider, CHRIST is infinitely <hi>Wiſe,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to make the <hi>beſt</hi> Choice for a People. We may imagine him looking upon them, and ſaying (as in <hi>Jer.</hi> 49.19.) <hi>Who is a choſen Man that I may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point over</hi> them? <hi>For who is like Me?</hi> — Who's like Me, for chuſing the fitteſt Inſtruments, and ſpiriting them for their Work? — We may allude to <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.14. <hi>He is LORD of Lords; and they that are with Him, are called, and choſen, and faithful.</hi> As He will accept none but ſuch as are of his own Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment: So He perfectly foreknows whom He will own and bleſs. <hi>Job.</hi> 13.18. <hi>I know whom I have choſen.</hi> Hence He ſaid to <hi>Ananias</hi> concerning <hi>Saul,</hi> againſt whom that Diſciple had entertained very
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:002871_0039_0FE67EE4E62797E8"/>
great (and once juſt) Prejudices, as you read, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.13 &amp;c. <hi>Ananias</hi> objected, <hi>Lord, I have heard by many of this Man, how much Evil he hath done</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But the Lord ſaid unto him, Go thy way; for he is a choſen Veſſel unto me to bear my Name before the</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles. We may be apt to throw aſide this or t'other, as a <hi>deſpiſed Lamp</hi>; when to the LORD he may be a <hi>Choſen Veſſel.</hi> We ſhou'd gladly therefore refer it to his Wiſdom, to determine for us; and be ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous that he wou'd ſhew whom He has choſen. Thus we ſhall put Honour on his wiſe and ſovereign Providence.</p>
            <p>In a word, Thus we ſhall conſult <hi>our own Intereſt and Peace.</hi> For a People will be more diſpos'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Such in the Lord with all gladneſs, and hold them in Reputation, whom they ſee CHRIST ſhewing He hath choſen. Whatever Objections <hi>Ananias</hi> had againſt <hi>Saul</hi>; yet when he heard thoſe Words, <hi>He is a choſen Veſſel unto me,</hi> the good Man inſtantly embrac'd him as a <hi>Brother,</hi> with great Affection. And this will have a natural and (by the Divine Bleſſing) a powerful Tendency to a People's profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the Miniſtry of ſuch an one. — And then this will afford no ſmall Conſolation to the People of GOD, as it is to them an evident Token of Salvation; a happy ſign of the Lord's Preſence with them; that his Spirit remains among them, and that his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſhall be ſtill upheld in the midſt of them. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.29, 30. <hi>I will raiſe up for them a Plant of Renown. Thus ſhall they know, that I the</hi> LORD <hi>their GOD am with them; and that they, even the houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>are my People, ſaith the</hi> LORD <hi>GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For theſe and other Reaſons, it ſhou'd be the Care and Concern of a People, who have before them the Choice of a Miniſter; That the LORD wou'd <hi>ſhew whom He hath choſen,</hi> whom he hath appointed, and will approve. This was the Sollicitude and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire

of the Church and the Apoſtles, in the Caſe our Text refers to; and this Record was made of it for the Admonition of all Poſterity. For whatſoever things were written aforetime, were written for our <hi>learning</hi> and <hi>ensample.</hi>

               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:002871_0041_0FE67EE68CBA1E20"/>So in our Text, <hi>They prayed and ſaid</hi> —</p>
            <p>Prayer is a devout offering up of our regular Deſires to the Throne of Grace. It ſhou'd not only be our <hi>Hearts Deſire,</hi> but our <hi>Prayer</hi> alſo, That CHRIST wou'd ſhew us whom He hath choſen.</p>
            <p>Here we might obſerve,</p>
            <p>The LORD JESUS CHRIST (the Son of GOD) is together with the FATHER and HOLY GHOST, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Object of religious Worſhip. He has all thoſe Divine Perfections, and ſuſtains all thoſe Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, Titles and Characters, which proclaim him the worthy Object of our Faith, Love, Prayer and Praiſe, in their moſt exalted Senſe, and higheſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes.

            <p>There are ſome ſpecial Caſes, wherein it ſeems pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly proper and congruous, diſtinctly to invocate the LORD JESUS CHRIST. Thus, particularly in the Adminiſtration of the LORD's <hi>Supper,</hi> which is of his Inſtitution, and bears his Name, and the primary De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign whereof is to do honour to his Memory, by a grateful Celebration of his redeeming Love.

to ſerve CHRIST in the Miniſtry, it ſeems equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proper, that the Name of the LORD JESUS ſhou'd be expreſly and immediately call'd upon.</p>
            <p>Now, if you ask <hi>What</hi> is to be requeſted of Him, in ſuch a Caſe; I anſwer in general, as in our Text, <hi>That He would ſhew whom He hath choſen:</hi> — (Imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) That he wou'd chuſe for us in great Mercy, and that he wou'd diſcover his Mind and Will to us, in thoſe ways in which it may be expected: That he wou'd preſide and govern in the Choice propos'd by us; influence our Views and Reſolutions, and cauſe a Coincidence of all things to the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his own Counſel), and bringing the Affair to a happy Reſult: That all matters of Controverſy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Him and us may be remov'd, and no Obſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions lie in the way to hinder a Bleſſing from being beſtow'd upon us: That when the Lot is caſt into the Lap, there may be a gracious Diſpoſal thereof, by his Power and Wiſdom; that the Lot may fall upon One, who ſhall be a Paſtor <hi>according to his Heart</hi>; One whom He hath <hi>called by his Grace,</hi> and will delight to bleſs and proſper. — This may be the Tenour and Scope of our Prayers on ſuch an Occaſion.</p>
            <p>And if you ask <hi>Why</hi> we ſhou'd thus employ Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the Caſe? I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Our LORD himſelf has <hi>directed</hi> us to this Method. Beſides that Prayer is the appointed way for obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the Benefits we deſire. It's particularly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd in the Caſe before us; 'Tis imply'd in that direction to the Diſciples, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.38. <hi>Pray ye the Lord of the Harveſt, that He will ſend forth Labourers into his Harveſt.</hi> — It is obſervable, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> frequently and pathetically deſir'd the Prayers of this and the other Church whom he purpos'd to viſit;
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:002871_0043_0FE67EEB1645C840"/>
               <hi>That he might come to them with Joy by the Will of GOD</hi> &amp;c. (See <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.30 — 32. So <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.18, 19.) Which Directions will very well take in the preſent Caſe, by parity of Reaſon. Now this is Argument enough, in any Caſe: 'Tis the Wil of GOD in CHRIST JESUS concerning you.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Example</hi> in our Text ſhou'd have it's influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon us. They had their Eyes to the LORD for a Deciſion from his ſpecial Providence, and they lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up a Frayer: wherein they have left a good Copy for future Ages to imitate. The Apoſtle ſaid (<hi>Phil.</hi> 3.17.) <hi>Ye have us for an Enſample.</hi> So (2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.7.) <hi>Your ſelves know how ye ought to follow us.</hi> And doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the ſacred Hiſtorian put the Prayer in our Text on Record, to make the Apoſtles and primitive Church an Enſample unto us to follow them. As the bad Actions of Men are related in Scripture-Story, for our Admonition and Warning: So the good and laudable Actions of the Saints are ſtory'd, not only for their Commendation, but for our Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Learning. Hence we are exhorted to be <hi>Followers of them who through faith and patience inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the Promiſes.</hi> Heb. 6.12.</p>
            <p n="3">3. 'Tis a Caſe wherein we have ſpecial <hi>Declarations and Promiſes</hi> of CHRIST, to plead, and to animate our Faith, in Prayer on this Occaſion.</p>
            <p>'Tis a virtual Promiſe we have in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.18. <hi>Thou haſt aſcended on high; — Thou haſt received Gifts for Men; yea for the Rebellious alſo, that the Lord GOD might dwell among them.</hi> Which Gifts (as the Apoſtle expounds the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11.) par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly mean ſutable Inſtruments for the Work of the Miniſtry. Such Gifts CHRIST has receiv'd, to be beſtow'd on his Church and People, as the viſible Signs and Means of his gracious Preſence in the midſt of them. This affords one advantageous Plea. And we may put in ſuit that precious Promiſe, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 20.30.
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:002871_0044_0FE67EEB392A5E70"/>
               <hi>Though the Lord give you the bread of Adverſity — Yet thine Eyes ſhall ſee thy Teachers</hi> &amp;c. Alſo that, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.14, 15. <hi>Turn, O backſliding Children; for I am mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to you; — And I will give you Paſtors according to mine heart, which ſhall feed you with knowledge and underſtanding.</hi> GOD expects that we in faith convert theſe Promiſes into Petitions and Pleas at the Throne of Grace. As you may learn from <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.37. Where, after various Promiſes made, it is added, <hi>Thus ſaith the</hi> LORD; <hi>yet for this will I be enquired by the houſe of Iſrael to do it for them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The Gift we receive in <hi>anſwer to Prayer,</hi> we may hope will prove a <hi>Bleſſing indeed,</hi> in which we ſhall rejoyce.</p>
            <p>Uſually, the Benefits we receive by Prayer, are doubly ſweet and pleaſant. 'Twas a moſt comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Reflection to pious <hi>Hannah, For this Child I prayed.</hi> So when it may be reflected, For this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter I pray'd, how great the Conſolation! —When the LORD, by any ſatisfying Evidences, ſheweth whom He has choſen, as it will afford peculiar En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to the Perſon to accept the Call: ſo it will by a natural efficacy help us to attend on the Miniſtry of ſuch an one with a greater Faith and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velier Hope for a ſpecial Benediction of Heaven up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Adminiſtrations and Labours among us. Such a Miniſter may humbly triumph, with the Apoſtle, as in <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.29. <hi>I am ſure, that when I come unto you, I ſhall come in the fulneſs of the bleſſing of the Goſpel of CHRIST.</hi> And a People ſo highly favoured, may make that the Song of their grateful Souls; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.14. <hi>Praiſe waiteth for Thee, O GOD, in Sion: — Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is the Man whom thou chuſeſt, — we ſhall be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd with the Goodneſs of thy Houſe.</hi> So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118.21, 26. I will praiſe the Lord, <hi>for thou haſt heard me. — Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is he that cometh in the Name of the Lord: We have bleſſed you out of the Houſe of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="unknown:002871_0045_0FE67EEE1A3B4560"/>I ſhall only add, by way of Argument,</p>
            <p n="5">5. 'Tis a very <hi>concerning</hi> Caſe; in which it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly behoves a People to chuſe well, and is very awful to commit an Error. — It's but fit all Buſineſs of any moment ſhou'd be carry'd on with Prayer. How much more the very important Buſi-of Calling a Miniſter! It's a great Affair of CHRIST's Kingdom, and important Concern of his Glory. — It is of vaſt Moment to our Souls, and has a near Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect on the beſt Intereſts of our dear Poſterity. An Error here will be of dangerous Tendency, and extenſive Influence. — And then 'tis a very critical Caſe; in which without CHRIST's ſpecial Direction and Leading, we ſhall certainly commit egregious Miſtakes, and run into Confuſions: ſhall be in danger of laying on Hands <hi>ſuddenly,</hi> and ſo of being <hi>partak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of other Men's Sins.</hi> For (as one obſerves) <q>Whoever have a ſinful hand in the Choice of an unskilful and unfaithful Paſtor, are ſo far guilty of all the Hurt he doth, and ſhall anſwer to GOD for the Blood of the Souls, which periſh through his Miſmanagement. Their Sin in this Caſe, maketh way for the <hi>Hireling</hi>; and ſo hath Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon all the Harm he doth.</q> There ſhou'd be a holy Sollicitude then, leſt we take any falſe Steps, or fall upon any wrong Meaſures, or come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any unhappy Reſolves: but that all be done to the Glory of GOD, and with the Security of the common Good.</p>
            <p>Hence, it will be our Wiſdom to put the Affair under our LORD's Conduct; and not lean to our own Underſtandings, nor truſt in our own Hearts. <hi>Commit thy Works to the Lord: So ſhall thy thoughts be eſtabliſhed.</hi> Make thy Prayer unto Him, and He will hear thee: Thou ſhalt alſo decree a thing, and it ſhall be eſtabliſh'd unto thee; and the <hi>light ſhall ſhine upon thy ways.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="unknown:002871_0046_0FE67EEE403B6AF0"/>Theſe Reflections afford very ſtrong and moving Arguments for Prayer on the ſolemn Occaſion before us.</p>
            <p>But then, if we expect an Anſwer of Peace, we muſt ſee to it, that we offer the <hi>Prayer of Faith,</hi> and lift up holy Hands; without Wrath and Doubting. In many Caſes, it may be ſaid, <hi>Ye ask, and receive not, becauſe ye ask amiſs.</hi> Let us every one think with the Pſalmiſt, If I regard Iniquity in my Heart, the Lord will not hear me. — Verily let not that Man, who is of a double heart, imagine that he ſhall receive any thing of the LORD. We muſt ask <hi>in Faith</hi>; embracing the Promiſes, and realizing CHRIST's Sufficiency and Faithfulneſs to perform them. — Yet we muſt ask <hi>humbly</hi>; ſenſible of our utter unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; confeſſing our Sins, and putting all our Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities from us. — In a word, we muſt pray <hi>fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently,</hi> and with a holy Importunity, as thoſe that know the Worth and Moment of the Gift we are asking of our aſcended LORD. — Every one concern'd, ſhou'd wreſtle for it in fervent Prayer by himſelf in ſecret. And every Family apart. And the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of the LORD; making Mention of it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in their common Prayers, &amp; uniting in ſolemn ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Supplications (as they in our Text) on ſo weighty an Occaſion.</p>
            <p>It has been the laudable practice of theſe Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, to have their Days of Faſting and public Prayer, when meditating the Choice of a Miniſter: Which Days, I wou'd obſerve, ſhou'd be kept ſeaſonably (in general, the earlier the better) before the Thoughts and Reſolves of a People are particularly fix'd and terminated.</p>
            <p>Now, let us every one <hi>reflect</hi> a little on <hi>our</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in this Matter. Have we been thus employing Faith and Prayer, with regard to the Choice before us. 'Tis true, when we had our Church-<hi>Faſt</hi> upon
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:002871_0047_0FE67EF50ED89920"/>
upon Occaſion of the Removal of our late worthy <hi>Paſtor</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <p>The Rev. Mr. <hi>BENJAMIN WADSWORTH;</hi> who being choſen Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of <hi>Harvard-College,</hi> and Application thereupon made by the Hon. and Rev. the Overſeers, for the Church's Conſent to part with him for that Service; the Church after humble Prayer, with ſerious Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and previous Inquiry into his Mind upon this weighty Affair, voted a conditional Compliance; Reſolving, <q>That if he judg'd it his Duty to accept of the Call given him, We would humbly ſubmit, and ſay, THE WILL OF THE LORD BE DONE!</q> Which Vote was paſſ'd <hi>June 16. 1725.</hi> With a conſiderable degree of Unanimity, as it pleaſed the <hi>LORD</hi> then to diſpoſe our Hearts; and with no ſmall Appearances of a very ſolemn Awe upon every one's Spirit: together with the ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble workings of a juſt and great Affection to our faithful Paſtor, and the viſible Tokens of a ſpecial Divine Conduct and Influence; the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of which, as it gave a general Satisfaction, ſo it was my Relief under the Anxieties of that critical Juncture; and in the Days of doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Expectation which have ſince rolled over us, that Reflection has oft refreſhed the Bowels of many; particularly by furniſhing us with an Argument or Plea in Prayer, and encouraging our Hopes, That the <hi>LORD</hi> who had called his Servant from us, and who hath the Reſidue of the Spirit, wou'd lead and influence in the Choice of a Succeſſor; to preſerve Peace and Truth, and provide graciouſly for us —.</p>
                  <p>Not long after the Preſident's Inſtalment, and actual going from us, the Church at an occaſional Meeting, ſaw fit (among other things) unanimouſly to agree upon keeping a Day of Prayer, with a ſpecial View to the remarkable Change of Circumſtances we were now come under. Upon this great Occaſion <q>Judging our ſelves called to extraordinary Prayer, It was therefore reſolved (GOD willing) that we would ſpeedily keep a day of Faſting together, to beg of GOD a ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Uſe of ſo important a Diſpenſation; and that He wou'd teach us the way wherein we ought to go, and in his good Time provide for us another Paſtor according to his own Heart.</q> — The ſaid Faſt was on <hi>Aug. 17.</hi> following.</p>
                  <p>I have thought it not amiſs, to gratify the Publick, by this particular Account of that Affair, and our proceedings upon it.</p>
               </note> from us unto another important Poſt, We did unitedly ſpread our Caſe before the LORD; and have at our occaſional Meetings, as well as upon the LORD's day, from time to time been humbly moving our bleſſed SAVIOUR and Head to look upon in our preſent State and ſupply our Wants: But have we all likewiſe in our private Requeſts been conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:002871_0048_0FE67EF52E35AA88"/>
making mention of our Caſe, and begging Divine Appearances for us, with a ſuitable Concern and Fervour of Soul! Can our Cloſets and our Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies teſtify on our behalf, that we have been giving our ſelves to Prayer; beſeiging the Throne of Grace day and night with our ardent Cries, and believing Intreaties, that the LORD wou'd <hi>ſhew us</hi> (among all the Candidates we have heard) <hi>whether of theſe He hath choſen?</hi> Or have we been contenting our ſelves with a few prayerleſs Thoughts and Endeavours? Have we not been cold and indifferent, and too un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking? Or elſe all our Care and Zeal too inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout, irreligious, and not accompany'd with a ſpirit of prayer and reſignation to GOD?</p>
            <p>Surely it is fit we examine into our Temper &amp; Conduct here. This becomes us, as Men and as Chriſtians. And then this is neceſſary for the better ordering our Expectations and Hopes. For if we have ſought the LORD humbly and earneſtly, we may look He will be found of us. Since he hath aſſur'd us, as in <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.19. <hi>Again I ſay unto you, that if two of you ſhall agree on earth as touching any thing that they ſhall ask, it ſhall be done for them of my Father which is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> But if we have been caſting off Fear and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining Prayer, while we have purſu'd our ſeveral Aims and Deſires; we may juſtly expect He will hide his Face from us, and cover our Paths with Darkneſs.</p>
            <p>Hence then (whatever our perſonal Managements and Diſpoſitions have been) let us <hi>now</hi> ſtir up our ſelves to ſeek the Lord by importunate Prayer. Ye that make mention of his Name, call upon him in the Day-time, and in the Night, keep not Silence before Him. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat his Favour with your whole Heart, and give Him no reſt, until he ſhew whom He has choſen; until He reſtore the Smiles of his Face on his Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, which is ſo far deſolate, and ſet up a burning

Let the Prophet's Reſolution be ours, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 62.1. <hi>For Zion's ſake will I not hold my peace, and for Jeruſalem's ſake I will not reſt until the Righteouſneſs thereof go forth as Brightneſs, and her Salvation as a Lamp that burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi> — Thus we ſhall be prepar'd to receive the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from the LORD, and to give Him the Glory and the Praiſe.</p>

III.</hi> CHRIST is at all times and in all Affairs, eſpecially in the preſent important Caſe, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered by us as <hi>the LORD, who knoweth the hearts of all Men. — So in the Text,</hi> Thou LORD, which knoweſt the Hearts of all Men, ſhew whether of theſe Thou haſt choſen.</p>
            <p>Here I might (not unprofitably) go into the <hi>Proof</hi> of CHRIST's Dominion and Omniſcience, that he <hi>is</hi> LORD, and that he doth know the hearts of all Men; and doctrinally treat upon the exalted Title and relative Perfection here aſcrib'd to our bleſſed SAVIOUR; which indeed are none other than the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable Prerogatives of JEHOVAH; the high Glories and appropriate Characters of the Supreme and Infinite Mind<note n="†" place="bottom">

            <p>But it is the <hi>practical Improvement,</hi> to be made of theſe Reflections, which I mainly aim at. And they are very applicable, to regulate our Views, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern our Tempers and Deportments; as in all other Affairs, ſo particularly in the preſent Caſe. — Hence the Church in our Text, prayed, ſaying, <hi>Thou Lord, which knoweſt the hearts of all Men</hi> —.

And it may be of no ſmall benefit to a People in the like Caſe, to make uſe of and apply theſe affecting Idea's of CHRIST.</p>
            <p n="1">I. A due conſideration of CHRIST as the LORD, may be of very profitable Conſequence, in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of the Affair before us.</p>
            <p>To give a few hints here diſtinctly.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This will teach us, from a <hi>Reverence to the Office</hi> of the Miniſtry, as the Inſtitution of CHRIST our Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious LORD, to treat the Affair of chuſing and calling a Perſon to that Office, with a becoming <hi>Seriouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Solemnity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is CHRIST the LORD? We ſhould then fear before him, and make Him our Dread. His Name is holy and reverend: And all that wears the ſtamp of his Authority, ſhould appear venerable to us. The LORD's Day, the LORD's Supper, his Word, his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſhould be call'd <hi>the Holy of the LORD, Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</hi> So the LORD's Miniſters ſhould be highly eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed in Love, and their Office held in Reputation by all ſuch as wou'd honour JESUS CHRIST our LORD, both theirs and ours. For he has ſaid to his Miniſters, <hi>He that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth Me.</hi> — A reverent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Inſtitution of CHRIST, ſhou'd teach us to treat all Affairs relating to the Miniſtry, and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular to behave our ſelves in the important Work before us, with the greateſt Gravity, with ſolemn Thought, a deep Awe, and religious Concern.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſerious Conſideration of CHRIST as LORD, will help to <hi>regulate</hi> our <hi>Aims,</hi> and <hi>guide</hi> our <hi>Choice.</hi>

It will tend to make this our governing Aim; and tranſport us above the corrupt Influence of carnal or ſiniſter Regards, the unhappy Reſults of a vicious Self-Love.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It will point us to the <hi>Word</hi> of CHRIST, as our <hi>Rule,</hi> in fixing our Judgment, and conducting the whole Buſineſs before us.</p>

            <p>A firm belief and due thought of CHRIST's Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, as Head of the Church, will tend to lay a Reſtraint upon our impatient Fears, in a Day of Clouds and Darkneſs; to enliven and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorate our Hopes, in Caſes of Difficulty, and in times of doubtful Expectation. If CHRIST ſits at the Helm; if He be the ſupreme Moderator of all Events; we are ſure then, Nothing ſhall come to paſs but by his Permiſſion, and with the Security of his own Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and Glory. There are many Devices in the heart of Man: but the Counſel of the Lord, that ſhall ſtand. He ſits upon the Floods, and rules the Waves of the Sea, and ſtilleth the Tumult of the People. He ſcattereth the Proud in the Imagination of their Hearts; but his Thoughts are very deep, and his Deſigns cannot be defeated. He is Head over all things to the Church: And if He love the Church, which is his Body, we may truſt He will protect and keep it; will nouriſh and cheriſh, and make all

needful proviſion for it. We may be ſure that all things ſhall be overrul'd for the promoting of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi>'s Peace and Welfair. Hence then in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Caſe, we ſhou'd eſtabliſh our Thoughts, and confirm our Faith and Hope, by meditating on CHRIST's Power and Dominion. A realiſing View of this will help our Unbelief, ſtrengthen our Hearts to wait upon the LORD; who is a GOD of Judgment, and bleſſed are all they that wait for him. Be patient therefore, Brethren, unto the appearing of the Lord: Behold, the Husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the Earth, and hath long Patience for it. Be ye alſo patient; ſtabliſh your hearts: Be not faithleſs but believing. <hi>Believe in the LORD your GOD, ſo ſhall ye proſper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. It will be of happy uſe, to promote in us a due <hi>Reſignedneſs</hi> and <hi>Submiſſion</hi> to his holy Will and Diſpoſe.</p>
            <p>Knowing that when the Lot is caſt into Lap, <hi>the whole diſpoſing thereof is of the Lord</hi>; This will teach us a willing Subjection to his Counſel and Pleaſure. The Diſciples having pray'd, as in our Text, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to caſt the Lot; and it falling on <hi>Matthias,</hi> 'tis obſerv'd, <hi>He was numbred with the Eleven Apoſtles</hi>; doubtleſs with great Peace and Harmony. And ſo much ſeems intimated in this Remark of the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian; the original word for <hi>numbered,</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Calculis allectus. <hi>Beza.</hi>
               </note> importing (as hinted before) his being counted among them by the <hi>united</hi> approbatory Suffrages of all concern'd. <hi>Barſabas</hi> and his Friends doubtleſs readily yielded to the Choice, and all unanimouſly receiv'd <hi>Matthias</hi> (though not the firſt in Nomination) as the Man whom CHRIST had choſen and prefer'd. We hear of no Murmurings or Exceptions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="unknown:002871_0054_0FE67EFF0ED65318"/>Now a ſerious Conſideration of CHRIST as LORD, will tend to aſſiſt us unto the like excellent frame and carriage, in the Affair before us.</p>
            <p>Antecedent to the ſolemn Tranſaction, there ſhou'd be a humble referring the Concluſion to a Divine Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; in that primitive Language, <hi>Acts</hi> 21.14. <hi>The Will of the LORD be done!</hi> The Conſideration of CHRIST as LORD will promote this happy Reſignation of Soul; and will help to ſave us from that ungodly Peremptorineſs and Preſumption in our Deſigns and Reſolves, and that vain boaſting in Creatures, which it ſhould be our Care to avoid. According to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>James</hi> 4.15, 16. <hi>For that ye ought to ſay, If the Lord will, We ſhall — do this or that. But now ye rejoyce in your Boaſtings: all ſuch rejoycing is evil.</hi> — 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.21, 22. <hi>Let no man glory in Men: for all things are yours, whether</hi> Paul, <hi>or</hi> Apollo, <hi>or</hi> Cephas.</p>
            <p>And ſo, when the Work is brought to a fair and orderly Iſſue, it is then our Duty to acquieſce in the Choice, and be ſatisfy'd wherever the Lot falls. <hi>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let us tempt CHRIST, nor murmur ye.</hi> Our Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage muſt be like that, of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> 2 Kin. 20.19. <hi>Good is the Word of the Lord. Is it not good, if Peace and Truth be in my days?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sutable Views of CHRIST's Dominion will tend to produce in us a Patient Submiſſion to <hi>his Providence,</hi> if croſs'd in our Deſires, and diſappointed of our Hopes: will make us willing to part with our deareſt Enjoyments; to give up our fondeſt Expectations, at his bidding, and not purſue our Deſigns againſt the manifeſt Checks of Providence, as if we meant to ſtep into the Throne of CHRIST, and correct the Meaſures of the moſt High.</p>
            <p>It will diſpoſe us to a chearful Reception and Chriſtian Treatment of Him, as <hi>our Brother and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of GOD,</hi> whom we behold approved in CHRIST;
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:002871_0055_0FE67F063153F1E8"/>
choſen in the LORD. Hence we read, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.9. <hi>When</hi> James, Cephas <hi>and</hi> John <hi>who ſeemed to be pillars, perceived the Grace that was given unto</hi> Paul, <hi>they gave to him the right hands of Fellowſhip.</hi> And hence that Exhortation to the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.10, 11. <hi>Now if Timothy come, ſee that he may be with you without fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I alſo do. Let no man therefore deſpiſe him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then it will by natural Conſequence make us patient towards our Neighbours and Brethren, will reſtrain us from paſſionate Reſentments and dividing Meaſures, under a Fruſtration of our Hopes, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite us to do all things without Murmurings, Diſputings or unreaſonable Oppoſitions. Hence the Apoſtle makes uſe of the Name of the LORD JESUS, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuading the Church at <hi>Corinth</hi> unto Peace and Union, when carnally contending, and divided into Parties, one ſaying, I am of <hi>Paul,</hi> and another I am of <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo</hi>: As in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Now I beſeech you, Brethren,</hi> BY THE NAME OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST, <hi>that ye all ſpeak the ſame thing, and that there be no Diviſions among you: but that ye be perfectly joined together in the ſame Mind and in the ſame Judgment.</hi> The Name of the LORD JESUS carries a ſacred Charm with it, that tends to ſtill all Contention, Clamour, and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute among his Diſciples (particularly in the preſent Caſe) and excite the greateſt Care of Peace, Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Unity, as that which makes very much for the Honour of CHRIST, and the Intereſt of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Hence thoſe pathetical Expoſtulations &amp; Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of the Apoſtle, in <hi>Rom</hi> 14. <hi>Who art thou that judgeſt another Man's Servant? Or why doſt thou ſet at nought thy Brother? — For he that in theſe things ſerveth CHRIST, is acceptable to GOD, and approved of Men. Let us therefore follow after the things which make for Peace, and things where with one may edify another.</hi>

               <pb n="54" facs="unknown:002871_0056_0FE67F06556CBDC0"/>But I paſs now to ſay,</p>
            <p n="2">II. The Conſideration of CHRIST, as <hi>knowing the Hearts of all Men,</hi> is another very uſeful Reflection, and may be of great Service in the preſent Affair.</p>
            <p>This gives a very awful, and yet an equally joyful Idea of our Lord; and what He wou'd have ſolemnly conſider'd by his People. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.23. <hi>All the Churches ſhall know, that I am He which ſearcheth the Reins and Hearts.</hi> How elſe indeed ſhou'd He judge the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of Men, and give to every one according to his Works; as He certainly will do! The Eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding the Evil and the Good<note n="†" place="bottom">Pro. 15.2, 11.</note>. Hell and Deſtruction are before the Lord: how much more then the Hearts of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Men? Verily to his piercing Eye every Boſom is tranſparent, and all things there appear in the moſt open Light to Him, which are beyond the Reach of all human Diſcovery. And this Thought is capable of an application to very good Purpoſes, both by way of Direction and Incentive; as in the common Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of the Chriſtian Life, ſo particularly in the extraordinary Affair before us.</p>
            <p>To illuſtrate this, let me ſuggeſt a few particulars.</p>
            <p>For Inſtance,</p>
            <p n="1">I. The Conſideration of CHRIST's knowing the Hearts of all Men, as in our Text apply'd to the preſent Affair, may be uſeful to <hi>direct</hi> us in our Choice, what to <hi>aim at,</hi> and what regards to be influenced by.</p>
            <p>It was a Reproof the Apoſtle gave to ſome in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> who indulg'd ſuch a ſpirit of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation about their Teachers (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.7.) <hi>Do ye look on things after the outward appearance?</hi> This is a common Rule of judging: but a falſe Rule, at leaſt a very imperfect and inſufficient One. It ſhou'd
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:002871_0057_0FE67F09C5E2C278"/>
ſeem, that ſome boaſted mighty things of themſelves, and affected to make a fair Shew in the fleſh, but they boaſted of things without meaſure, and by fair Speeches deceived the Hearts of the Simple. We often ſuffer our Views only to glide upon the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies of Men and Things, and take no pains to enter into their Realities and true Characters. We are either eaſily impos'd upon by deceiving Appearances, and draw up a haſty Judgment. Or elſe we are led away with Miſtakes about the Nature of Things, and conſider not where true Excellency lies. Agreeably, things of comparatively leſs Significancy, often have the preference with us: the things of the Body, to the things of the Soul: So again the things of the Mind, to the things of the Heart; intellectual Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments, to ſpiritual Graces and moral Virtues: Which is the moſt perverſe Judgment in the World. And to act under the Influence of ſuch a falſe View of things in the Affair before us, muſt needs be of dangerous Tendency.</p>
            <p>But here our <hi>Text</hi> may ſet us right; which intimates that the Diſciples looked chiefly at the <hi>Heart,</hi> in the Choice before them; and that CHRIST looketh at the Hearts of Men, in chuſing Paſtors for his Church. We are apt to look chiefly at the Head, and external Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, an happy Utterance, bright Gifts, the Powers of Reaſon, the Beauties of Language, or the like: but verily the Lord looketh at the Heart. The Lord weigheth the Spirits; and he eſtimates us by our inner Man. To be renew'd in the ſpirit of our Minds, after the Image of Him that created us in Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs, this is our high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Glory; and is the moſt exalted Character of a Miniſter of the Goſpel: Whoſe Adorning, let it not be that outward Adorning of Eloquence, Beauty, or worldly Pomp: but let it be the hidden Man of the Heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:002871_0058_0FE67F09E7BEDDA0"/>
of Humility and Sanctity, which is of great price in the ſight of GOD. The Righteous is more excellent than his Neighbour. In a Miniſter, it's the Chriſtian, we are to look at, more than the Scholar, or the Oratour. He ſhou'd indeed be apt to teach; able alſo to convince Gainſayers. And a People ſhou'd Covet earneſtly the beſt Gifts: Yet ſhew I unto you <hi>a more excellent way: Seek a Proof of CHRIST ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in him,</hi> and being with him. For though one ſpeak with the Tongues of Men and Angels, and have not Charity (a Principle of Divine Love reigning in his Soul, the Love of CHRIST conſtraining him) he is as a ſounding Braſs, or a tinkling Cymbal: And tho' he have the Gift of Prophecy, and underſtand all Myſteries, and be fill'd with all Knowledge; yet if he have not a true Love to CHRIST, and Love to Souls, prevailing in him, verily <hi>he is Nothing</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">1 Cor. 12.31. &amp; 13.1, 2.</note>. That's a Divine Rule, for proportioning our Eſteem of others, as well as of our ſelves; <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.3. <hi>To think ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly, according as GOD hath dealt to every man the meaſure of FAITH</hi>; in judging of which, a rational Charity muſt be our Guide and ſet the Limits.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Conſideration of CHRIST as <hi>knowing the Hearts of all Men</hi> may ſerve further <hi>to animate and encourage the Hope and Faith</hi> of his People in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Caſe.</p>
            <p>It may ſerve to encourage Prayer on this occaſion, and the Hope of a gracious Anſwer. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſeems to have had it in View<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when he pray'd, as in <hi>Numb.</hi> 27.16. <hi>Let the Lord, the GOD of the Spirits of all Fleſh ſet a Man over the Congregation.</hi>—He formeth the Spirit of Man within him, and he pondereth the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Men.

exactneſs. He knows the Hearts of <hi>all Men</hi>; the Hearts of Miniſters and People; of Candidates and Electors. —CHRIST knows the Wants of his People, and knows their Hearts Deſire and Prayer; and as our Advocate with the Father, repreſents the ſame unto Him; which may aſſure us of obtaining our Requeſts, if agreeable to his Will. See <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.19, 20. So 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 5.14, 15.</p>
            <p>He knows what is <hi>the Mind of the Spirit</hi>: whom the holy Ghoſt will make Overſeers of the Flock; and ſo how to order his Mediatorial Interceſſion, in the preſent Caſe, <hi>according to the Will of GOD.</hi> (Rom. 8.27.)</p>
            <p>He that ſearcheth the Hearts, knoweth who are the fitteſt to be choſen; who will be the moſt holy, humble, skilful, faithful, active Inſtruments of his Glory. <hi>Solomon</hi> obſerves, <hi>The fining pot is for Silver, and the furnace for Gold: but the Lord trieth the Hearts</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Pro. 17.3.</note>. He has a clear proſpect into the ſecret Receſſes of the Soul, and knoweth whoſe Heart is upright toward him, and who is moſt formed for his Praiſe. As to Men, they themſelves ſcarce <hi>know what ſpirit they are of.</hi> Hence <hi>not he that commendeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, is approved; but whom the Lord commendeth</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">2 Cor. 10.18.</note>. And as for popular Applauſe, this is often founded in falſe Notion of Worth, or ignorance of Men's true Characters. Hence that of our LORD to the <hi>Phariſees</hi> in his day, who were ſo much had in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour among the People; (<hi>Luk.</hi> 16.15.) <hi>He ſaid unto them, Ye are they which juſtify your ſelves before Men; but GOD knoweth your Hearts: for that which is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſteemed amongſt Men, is Abomination in the ſight of GOD.</hi>

But then He has ſome wiſe and holy Deſigns of his Kingdom to ſerve by it: and it's ſometimes done in Judgment to a People, that have provoked him to Anger. But when he has Intentions of Favour to a People, in whom he delighteth, he gives them a faithful Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. See 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. <hi>And I thank CHRIST JESUS our LORD, who hath enabled me; for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the Miniſtry.</hi>

            <p>His Knowledge of the Hearts of Men qualifies him to judge infallibly of Men, and to make a moſt wiſe and juſt Choice. <hi>The righteous Lord trieth the Hearts and Reins.</hi> (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 7.9.) Since He knows the Hearts of all Men, He cannot be deceived: but is able to make the moſt righteous Judgment, and give a perfect Lot. His Eyes are upon the righteous; He

            <p>His Knowledge of the Hearts of Men argues his Ability to prepare and diſpoſe Men's Hearts aright: And if he does not find them at preſent fit for his purpoſe (as in the Caſe of <hi>Saul,</hi> who from a Blaſphemer and Perſecutor, was chang'd into a Preacher and Apoſtle of JESUS CHRIST) he has power to <hi>enable them</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">1 Tim. 1.12.</note>, to furniſh and ſpirit them to their Work. He can give <hi>them another Heart,</hi> as in the caſe of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>Saul,</hi> the famous Son of <hi>Kiſh</hi>

               <note n="{inverted †}" place="bottom">Pro. 20.1.</note>. — <hi>The Preparations of the heart in Man, and the anſwer of the Tongue, are from the Lord</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Ch. 16.1.</note>. He has all Hearts in his Hand, as well as under his Eye. He faſhioneth Men's Hearts, and worketh in them to will and to do of his good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.

The LORD is able to make all Grace abound towards him; to give him largeneſs of Heart, and Wiſdom exceeding much. — Hence then, ſuppoſing in the caſe before us, the Lot ſhould fall upon a Perſon, whom ſome may apprehend leſs

            <p>In a word, Conſider, He who ſearcheth the Reins, can govern <hi>your</hi> Hearts, as he pleaſeth, and can unite you in your Judgments and Inclinations, <hi>The hand of GOD may be to give you one Heart.</hi> So that you ſhall be perfectly joined together in the ſame Mind, and with one Mouth glorify GOD, in the unanimous Choice of ſome meet and worthy Perſon. Or if he ſhou'd permit you to be ſomewhat divided in your Apprehenſions, He can prevent the Diſagreement from paſſing over to the Affections, and ſtill keep your Hearts knit together in Love. Or if any (which GOD prevent) ſhou'd be irregularly diſpos'd after the Matter is reduc'd to a fair Iſſue, He that ſitteth in the Heavens, and that knows the Thoughts of the Wiſe, can reſtrain and over-rule, to his own Glory.</p>
            <p>All which Reflections tend to ſtrengthen Faith and Hope. Wherefore let not your Heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid. Truſt in the Lord at all times, O ye People, pour out your Deſires before Him; and in the way of Duty leave the Affair and all Events with Him.

We cannot but be convinced, that this is very reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to leave the management of things to Him, <hi>whoſe Underſtanding is infinite,</hi> and therefore knows beſt how to order them. The Government of the World is a very curious and complicated thing, and not to be tamper'd with by every unskilful hand: and therefore as an unskilful Man, after he has tamper'd a great while with a <hi>Watch,</hi> thinking to bring it into better Order, and is at laſt convinced that he can do no good upon it, carries it to him that made it, to mend and put it in Order; ſo muſt we do, after all our Care and Anxiety about our own private Concernments, or the publick State of Things: we muſt give over governing the World, as a Buſineſs paſt our Skill, as a Province too hard, and a <hi>Knowledge too won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful for us,</hi> and leave it to him who made the World, to govern it and take Care of it.

            <p>Moreover, If we are under the power of this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, that his Eye is upon us, by whom Actions are weigh'd, and who underſtandeth our Thoughts afar off; it will excite a Care of Uprightneſs in our <hi>Choice</hi> and whole Management. That is propos'd as a Motive to Sincerity and Care to pleaſe the Lord: <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.2. <hi>Every way of a Man is right in his own Eyes: but the Lord pondereth the Hearts.</hi> Hence
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:002871_0065_0FE67F1A5626DA48"/>
               <hi>David</hi> ſtrongly recommends it to his Son 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 28.9. <hi>Serve him with a perfect heart, and with a willing mind; for the Lord ſearcheth all hearts, and underſtandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts.</hi> This Reflection had an excellent Influence on holy <hi>David</hi> himſelf, 1 Chro. 29.17. <hi>I know, my GOD, that thou trieſt the heart, and haſt pleaſure in Uprightneſs. As for me</hi> (therefore) <hi>in the Uprightneſs of my heart I have willingly offer'd all theſe things.</hi> The Senſe of this will be a powerful Excitement to do what we do, <hi>heartily, as to the Lord, and not to Men</hi>; to act with an upright View to his Glory, as our ultimate Aim, and to propoſe no other Ends but what as ſubordinate to this, He will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of. The Senſe of his Heart-ſearching Eye upon us will make us abhor vain Thoughts and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Purpoſes, as an Abomination to the Lord; and put us upon purifying our Aims from all baſe alloy of Prejudice, Intereſt, or any other impure tincture. It will antidote and fortify us againſt all manner of Temptations to Evil, by the Principles of Shame and Fear. The People of GOD found it a happy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint to them: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.18 — 21. <hi>Our Heart is not turned back, neither have our ſteps declined from thy way. — If we have forgotten the Name of our GOD; ſhall not GOD ſearch this out? For He knoweth the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of the Heart.</hi> — This is improveable as a ſtrong Caution againſt all criminal Partiality. Hence the Apoſtle exhorting <hi>Timothy</hi> to be impartial and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in his Conduct, addreſſes him after that ſolemn Manner, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.21, 22. <hi>I charge thee before GOD, and the Lord JESUS CHRIST, and the elect Angels, that thou obſerve theſe things, without preferring one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore another</hi> [or without <hi>Prejudice,</hi> as the Original properly ſignifies, and the vulgar <hi>Latin</hi> tranſlates it] <hi>doing nothing by partiality: Lay hands ſuddenly on no Man, neither be partakers of othea Men's Sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus a Senſe of the Eye of CHRIST upon us tends to
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:002871_0066_0FE67F1A78A18348"/>
make us beware of Partiality and Hypocriſy: and that Conſideration receives additional force from the proſpect of a future <hi>Judgment.</hi> For this Knowlege and critical Obſervation of Men's Hearts and Ways, is in order to a day of reckoning. <hi>(Jer.</hi> 17.10. and <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.12.) And the ſerious Conſideration of our being all to appear before the Judgment Seat of CHRIST, tends to make us <hi>labour, that we may be accepted of Him.</hi> Such Influence it had on the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.9, 10. Hence our LORD ſaid to his Diſciples, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.1, 2. <hi>Beware ye of the leaven of the Phariſees, which is Hypocriſy. For there is nothing covered, that ſhall not be revealed; neither hid, that ſhall not be known.</hi> A due Senſe of our Accountableneſs to the LORD JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST will awe and reſtrain us from Sin, and excite us unto Duty: will make us ponder our Ways, and look well to our Goings, that we may be in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour as becometh Holineſs; doing nothing in any Affair, but what will bear the Light; and ſo may have this for our Rejoycing, the teſtimony of our Conſcience —. Then ſhall we have Confidence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward GOD: Whereas if our Heart condemn us, the Lord is greater than our Heart and knoweth all things. He will bring every Work into Judgment, with every ſecret thing. Then the Thoughts of Men's Hearts ſhall be reveal'd: Whatſoever ye have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in Darkneſs, ſhall be heard in the Light; and that which you have ſpoken in the Ear in Cloſets, ſhall be proclaimed upon the Houſe-tops. The good Works of ſome are manifeſt before-hand, and they that are otherwiſe, cannot be hid. And hence the Conſcience of Integrity will give us a proſpect of our having boldneſs in the Day of Judgment, and Confidence before the Son of Man at his appearing.</p>
            <p>A Senſe of Sincerity will give us a holy boldneſs now, and Acceſs with Confidence unto the Lord in Prayer: will embolden us to wreſtle with Him for the
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:002871_0067_0FE67F20B8C52460"/>
Bleſſing, unto whom we may with the utmoſt Security commit every good Cauſe. <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.2, 3. <hi>The Lord weigheth the Spirits: Commit thy Works to the Lord, and thy Thoughts ſhall be eſtabliſhed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it will miniſter to our Conſolation under any Diſappointment we may meet with, if we can appeal to the Searcher of Hearts, as witneſs to our Sincerity. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 142.2. <hi>When my ſpirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou kneweſt my Path.</hi> Yea, if the Lot of any be involuntarily caſt under an unfaithful Miniſtry, and they have born due Teſtimony againſt the ſame, it may be conſolatory to them to think that CHRIST <hi>knows their Works and their Patience, and how they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear them which are evil, and have tried them which ſay they are Apoſtles and are not.</hi> (See <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.2.)</p>
            <p>So under invidious Characters, hard Speeches and Reproaches of Men, who may tax us with Partiality, carnal Policy, ſecret Intreagues and fraudulent Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices, or with ſiniſter Reſpects, and unjuſt Prejudices, or the like; here a View to the future Account, and the Thought of CHRIST's all-ſeeing Eye, may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and comfort us, if we are really conſcious to our Integrity and Innocence. We may appeal to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and ſay as the Prophet (<hi>Jer.</hi> 20.12.) <hi>O Lord of Hoſts, that trieſt the Righteous, and ſeeſt the Reins and Heart, — unto Thee have I opened my Cauſe.</hi> We may humbly hope that <hi>GOD which knoweth the Hearts, will bear us Witneſs.</hi> (<hi>Acts</hi> 15.8.) And may learn to deſpiſe the uncharitable Cenſures of Men, when they ſpeak Evil of the things which they know not. Hence that of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. — <hi>It is required in Stewards, that a Man be found faithful. But with me it is a</hi> VERY SMALL <hi>thing that I ſhould be judged of you, or of Man's Judgment. But he that judgeth is the Lord. Therefore judge nothing before the Time, until the Lord come, who will bring to Light the hidden things of Darkneſs, and will make manifeſt
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:002871_0068_0FE67F20DBBE62F0"/>
the Counſels of the Heart: And then ſhall every man have Praiſe of GOD</hi>; every Man who has walked in his Uprightneſs.</p>
            <p>In a word, The thought of CHRIST's Inſpection of us, and our Accountableneſs to Him, will tend to prevent all unchriſtian Heats and Animoſities; to allay and huſh Men's Paſſions, ſo apt to be unquiet and impetuous, when croſs'd in their particular Views. It will teach us all to watch againſt uncharitable Thoughts, and <hi>evil Surmiſings,</hi> contrary to the Love which ſhou'd be among Brethren: and will teach us to take heed to our Ways, that we offend not with our Tongues: will teach us to forbear all Clamour, and Wrath, and Evil-ſpeaking, Impatience, unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Humour, and Self-willedneſs: And on the contrary will teach us to deny our ſelves, to be kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affectioned one to another with brotherly Love, in honour preferring one another, being ſwift to hear, ſlow to ſpeak: Not to mind high things, but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend unto Men of low Eſtate, and every one pleaſe his Neighbour for his Good, to Edification: To be of a yielding Temper, <hi>ſtudying</hi> to be quiet; and <hi>if it be poſſible,</hi> as much as lieth in us, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to live peaceably. To this End is that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, <hi>Col.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Let your Speech be alway with grace, ſeaſoned with Salt, that ye may know how ye ought to anſwer every Man.</hi> And hence thoſe Intreaties, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.1, 2, 5. <hi>Therefore my Brethren, dearly beloved, and longed for, my Joy and Crown, ſo ſtand faſt my dearly beloved. I beſeech</hi> Euodias, <hi>and beſeech</hi> Syntiche, <hi>that they be of the ſame Mind in the LORD. — Let your Moderation be known to all Men.</hi> THE LORD IS AT HAND. And agreeable are thoſe Counſels of the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi>: My Brethren have not the Faith of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, the LORD of Glory, with Reſpect of Perſons. — So ſpeak ye, and ſo do, <hi>as they that ſhall be judged</hi> by the Law of Liberty. — My Brethren <hi>be
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:002871_0069_0FE67F23A931C2D8"/>
not many Maſters</hi>; knowing that ye ſhall receive the greater Condemnation. — Do ye think that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith in vain. <hi>The Spirit that dwelleth in us luſteth to Envy?</hi> But ſubmit your ſelves to GOD: Reſiſt the Devil; and grudge not one againſt another, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, leſt ye be condemned: <hi>Behold, the Judge ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth before the Door.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I conclude with thoſe Apoſtical Benedictions and Apologies, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.</p>
            <p>Now the GOD of Patience and Conſolation grant that you be <hi>like-minded</hi> one towards another, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to CHRIST JESUS. That ye may with <hi>one Mind</hi> and <hi>one Mouth</hi> glorify GOD. — The GOD of Hope fill you with all Joy and Peace in believing, that ye may abound in Hope through the power of the HOLY GHOST. And I my ſelf am perſuaded of you, my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that ye are full of Goodneſs, filled with all Knowledge, able alſo to admoniſh one another. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, Brethren, I have written the more boldly unto you, in ſome ſort, as putting you in Mind; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Grace that is given me of GOD, that I ſhould be the Miniſter of JESUS CHRIST <hi>unto you.</hi> Now therefore I beſeech you, Brethren, for the LORD JESUS CHRIST's ſake, &amp; for the Love of the Spirit, that ye ſtrive together with me in Prayers to GOD for me, that I may with you be refreſhed. And now the GOD of Peace be with you all. Amen.</p>
