            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE INTRODUCTORY PREFACE.</head>
            <p>WILL the Supreme Judge of the world, in the laſt day, ſentence us to everlaſting life or puniſhment accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our characters formed in this ſtate? So Chriſt hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly taught us; and it is of moſt intereſting importance to every one, to know and realize it. This was the faith of the Jewiſh and Chriſtian church in the days of inſpiration. This hath been the common faith of the Chriſtian church ever ſince. This was the faith of our pious forefathers in this land; and hath been the undiſputed faith of their poſterity, until the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent age. And conſidering the powerful, ſalutary tendency and influence of this doctrine, for the good of men in this world and world to come, is it not to be lamented, that this important article of the Chriſtian faith, ſhould be drawn into queſtion? But ſo it is. The contrary doctrine, "that all men ſhall be ſaved," is now exhibited to public examination. —A clear ſtage—fair dealing and argumentation—we aſk no more.—Great is the power of truth, and it will prevail.— Chriſt hath furniſhed his ſervants with ſufficient ability and faithfulneſs, from age to age, to vindicate the faith once deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the ſaints; and to unmaſk and expoſe error, however diſguiſed by art and ſophiſty; nor need we queſtion it in the preſent or any future day.</p>
            <p>When I read the pamphlet, intitled, "Salvation for all Men," printed in Boſton, 1782, I viewed it as an opening wedge of controverſy; and thought it duty to turn my tho'ts upon the beſt method of defending the doctrine of the future pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, as commonly received in the Chriſtian world; which
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:019737_0003_0FACA2D9A6B3DA28"/>
to me appeared, might as well be ſupported as any doctrine of like importance, in divine revelation. The plan now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, appeared well adapted to the purpoſe; and I had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to write upon it before I knew of any anſwers to that pamphlet. Several anſwers have ſince appeared, which, in my judgment, are well executed upon their reſpective plans: And more is ſaid than enough to anſwer that piece; the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon faith is ſubſtantially ſupported in them: But the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy doth not reſt. A much more laboured treatiſe, in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of that impladed tenet, is imported among us, printed in London, 1784. It requires an anſwer—none hath yet appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; —and as the plan now exhibited, is very different from that of thoſe who have gone before me, and on that account may give the reader an advantage to ſee truth repreſented and error expoſed in various points of view; it is thought this publication may be needful and uſeful.</p>
            <p>The two firſt parts of it, have lain by me more than a year. Indeed, the ſecond part was delivered in public diſcourſes, in the fall 1783, in a time of uncommon general ſickneſs in this place, which is the occaſion of its appearance in the preſent form. Having turned my attention to the ſubject, and not knowing that I ſhould live to publiſh any thing upon it, I thought it duty to endeavour to eſtabliſh my hearers in a point of ſo great importance. The public were notified in 1783, an ingenious work would be publiſhed, "wherein the ſubject is exhauſted;" which I waited to ſee till October, 1784. The third part, is chiefly taken up in a reply to this, which I ſuppoſe to be the anonymous treatiſe forementioned, intitled, "The myſtery hid from ages and generations, made manifeſt by goſpel revelation: or, the ſalvation of all men the grand thing aimed at in the ſcheme of God, as opened in the New-Teſtament writings, and entruſted with Jeſus Chriſt to bring into effect:" Printed in London, 1784. It contains 406 pages, excluſive of the preface. It is wrote with ingenuity and much labour, with a diſplay of learning and critical geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, with an appearance of much candour and benevolence; but with a ſufficient degree of contempt of the whole Chriſtian
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:019737_0004_0FACA2DA64BFDA28"/>
world, papal and proteſtant, common annotators and Chriſtian writers, who differ from the author; accompanied with a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of inſinuating arguments of addreſs, plauſible argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and pretenſions of good in the doctrine. Wherefore, if the author is miſtaken, and it is fitted only to eſtabliſh a ruinous error, the more plauſibly it is wrote, it becomes the more enſnaring and dangerous to the reader.</p>
            <p>It may not be amiſs, to give a ſketch of the general ſcheme of doctrine in it; which I take to be this.—In reſpect to the doctrine of the Trinity, it is Arianiſm;—reſpecting that of imputation, Socianiſm;—in reſpect to the doctrines of grace as commonly called, Pelagianiſm;—in reſpect to the intermedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate ſtate between death and the reſurrection, ſo far as I can col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the ſentiment, it better agrees with the Muggletonians than the common chriſtian doctrine;—in reſpect to the future judgment, it is ſingular; it will be final, and there will be no other public judgment; and yet it will not be deciſive by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterably fixing the ſtates of good or bad men; the ſentences will never be reverſed by any future judgment; and yet will be temporary, and not of perpetual and everlaſting force;— in reſpect to the future ſtate after the laſt judgment, his tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation ſtates better agrees with the notion of ſome of the old heathens than with the chriſtian ſyſtem, it being wholly unknown in the revelations of God.—And in his doctrine of purgatory, he ſurpaſſes the popes, clergy, and church of Rome itſelf; for his begins after the laſt judgment, when theirs is ended.</p>
            <p>Whether theſe are the author's true ſentiments, or only an adopted ſcheme to ſupport the doctrine of Univerſal Salvation, is not ſo material to me or the reader; nor is it my deſign to combat theſe principles any farther than the ſubject in debate is concerned; or the ſettling the conſtruction of ſome diſputed texts may require. But it is thus ſtated with a view to theſe two remarks: One is, thoſe who are ſettled in the firm belief of the contrary articles of the chriſtian faith, are in no great danger of becoming univerſaliſts, on this plan; they would be great looſers by ſuch a change: they muſt ſacrifice doctrines of far greater importance than this ſilly error can be ſuppoſed
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:019737_0005_0FACA2DB292FF5E8"/>
to be. The other, and principal remark, is this: If this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaded tenet cannot be ſupported upon this plan, it is in vain to hope for it upon any other whatever. The ingenuity and ability of this writer is inconteſtible; and he hath ſpared no labor and pains in the cauſe. He had all the world of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines of truth and error to chooſe out of; and he hath taken his ſtand of ſupport and defence upon this foundation; and if he now fails of ſupporting it, when enforced with all the aid of thoſe learned men, Mr. Whiſton, Scot, Hartly, Hallet, &amp;c. and is re-enforced again with Gog and Magog, under the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the devil, introduced to bring up the rear of ſupport to one important part of the ſcheme, it is in vain to hope it can ever be ſupported upon any plan of doctrine whatever. In this ſenſe, "the ſubject is truly exhauſted." This being by far the moſt plauſibly wrote, in which their ſtrength is col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, and "the ſubject exhauſted;" ſhould it fail of ſupport, the univerſaliſts, if wiſe, for their own ſake, will not attempt to mend it, for the parts do now hang badly together, and ſhould they joſtle and alter the poſts and pillars of it, the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtructure certainly falls to ruin with its own weight. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be now ſupported, or is ſupportable by any means whatever; the reader who carefully attends to the following work in all the parts of it, may be under ſome advantage to judge. One thing, perhaps, ſhould not be wholly paſſed over, and may be noticed here, inaſmuch as it did not naturally fall in any where in the laſt part. We are told, in order to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of this ſcheme, "ſome generally received doctrines muſt be given up, and that it is high time they ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced and others embraced in their room, more honourable to the father of mercies, and comfortable to the creatures whom his hands have formed." Page 14. What are the articles to be embraced in the room of thoſe of the chriſtian and proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant faith, which are to be renounced? Why, it ſeems, we are to receive it as a firſt principle, that the end of the creation of the moral world was the happineſs of the creature; and that if God foreknew any of them (ſay the devil and his angels and the finally wicked of mankind) would, by the abuſe of their
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:019737_0006_0FACA2DBE7908270"/>
moral powers, render themſelves finally miſerable, that them he ſhould have withheld from them "the gift of exiſtence." Page 1ſt and 3d. Is it poſſible to reconcile theſe notions with God's ſending his Son into the world to teach us the everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fire and puniſhment prepared for the devil and his angels, to which he will ſentence both them and the finally wicked, in the laſt day? Will it not follow from this notion, compared with this doctrine Chriſt taught, that God ſent his Son to teach the world, he would make theſe creatures miſerable, contrary to the end for which he made them, and when he ſhould have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held their exiſtence? Is not this deſtruction to the character of the Father and the Son? Theſe new world makers, and tranſmutation ſtates makers, are, it ſeems, vaſt projectors. They can project ſuch an eſſential change in the nature of things, as to transfer the obligations of the creature to the creator; and of the ſinner to the Saviour: ſo that if the rebellious creature periſheth in his iniquity, the reflection of diſhonor ſhall be caſt upon the Creator and Saviour. Suppoſe infinite wiſdom, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and goodneſs doth not exert itſelf in new created worlds, tranſmutation ſtates, and effectual meaſures of human inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the reduction and ſalvation of all the rebellious, ſhall the Creator and Lord of the world be reflected on as defective in benevolence? as not deſiring the ſalvation of his creatures? and as doing what ought not to be done, in giving them exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? Or, if the Saviour doth not ſave all who will not come unto him for life, ſhall diſhonor be reflected on him as not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting his truſt, becauſe they periſh for their faults? Is there any foundation in the ſcripture doctrine as commonly receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for ſuch abſurd concluſions and baſe reflections? Is not eternal life God's gift? Are not his gifts his own? May he not do what he will with his own? Doth not rebellion forfeit this gift? May not the wiſe, juſt, and good Governor of the World puniſh the rebellious according to deſert? Theſe ſelf-evident truths, are ſufficient to ſettle this point. I can ſee no ſervice done to God or man, by ſuch "falſe philoſophy and vain deceit." What honor or ſervice can it be to the Moſt High? We are too late by almoſt ſix thouſand years to be
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:019737_0007_0FACA2DCA75B5140"/>
of counſel to the infinitely wiſe God, to teach him for what end to create the world, whom to create, and from whom to withhold exiſtence; and what new worlds and tranſmutation ſtates to make for the recovery of the rebellious, &amp;c. The divine plan of creation is ſettled by the infinitely wiſe God, according to the council of his own will, and carried into exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. And he hath taught us the grand end deſigned, viz. m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>al government in its infinitely important connections, as hereafter ſtated and illuſtrated. And this plan of moral go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, in which the righteous will be rewarded and the wicked puniſhed, in final iſſue, hath already exiſted in opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion almoſt ſix thouſand years, is now carrying into execution, will remain forever, and be compleated in higheſt perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and glory. Neither can theſe notions be any more ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for the real good, comfort and happineſs of mankind: they cannot inforce the important requiſitions of duty in the law and goſpel of God, wherein is found the true good, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and happineſs of mankind; for the great commandments of love and duty in the law, and of faith, repentance,&amp;c. in the goſpel, all proceed upon this ſuppoſition and ground—that God hath an abſolute right to govern and give law to the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation—that the creature is ſervant to the creator, and not the creator to the creature—and that duty and obligation lies wholly on the creature, and if he rebels and makes himſelf mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, the fault and blame is in the creature and not in the creator; in the unbelieving and diſobedient ſinner, and not in the Saviour. And it is ſtrange, that ſuch vain ſpeculations and baſe reflections, are not long ago ſilenced and baniſhed the chriſtian world, by theſe clear dictates of reaſon, by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated appeals of God to it; "are not my ways equal and yours unequal;" by the perpetual doctrine of revelation, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where expreſsly laying the fault upon the creature: "The wicked that is warned but continues in his wickedneſs, ſhall die in his iniquity, and his blood ſhall be upon him:" "If thou be wiſe, thou ſhalt be wiſe for thyſelf; but if thou ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou alone ſhalt bear it." "Thou alone," and not the Creator and Saviour, ſhalt bear the blame and reproach with

               </gap> Lord's words be true: "It had been good for that man if he had not been born." God foreknew this: Will any ſay to God, he ſhould have withheld the gift of exiſtence to him?

Did God ſend his ſon into the world to teach a doctrine falſe and incredible, as they make this to be, and thereby to deſtroy the character of the Father and the Son? Can ſuch teaching be for the good of mankind? Doth it tend to inforce their obedience, and promote their comfort and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs?

ſhew, that theſe men run with their maxims and reaſonings "of falſe philoſophy and vain deceit," before they are ſent. And it is very likely, if the prophet Ezekiel was now alive, he would give us a new edition of that ſolemn meſſage from God, he addreſſed to ſome of the prophets in his day: "With lies ye have made the heart of the righteous ſad, whom I have not made ſad; and ſtrengthened the hands of the wicked that he ſhould not turn from his wicked way, by promiſing him life." Ezek. 13.22. Will any one ſay, in the face of this declaration from God, "that the promiſing him life doth not ſtrengthen the bands of wickedneſs, and harden the wicked in it, that he ſhould not return from his wicked way?" Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, if the happineſs of the creature be the ultimate end of creation, every man may make his own pleaſure and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs his ultimate end; and what wicked work this would make in this ſinful world, notwithſtanding all the grave cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and councils given againſt it, any man of diſcernment and reflection may eaſily ſee. The reader may, I think, find this notion well expoſed and confuted in Biſhop Butler's Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy. I ſpeak this from memory, not having the book by me, and it is, perhaps, twenty years ſince I read it.</p>
            <p>Again,—Theſe projectors give us a very different, myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious plan of Salvation, which we are to embrace "in the room" of our former faith. And it is ſaid no man is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent judge of it "who has not often read over the New-Teſtament in the language in which it was wrote, and ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Paul's epiſtles for a conſiderable time, &amp;c."<note n="*" place="bottom">See the Preface, p. 8, 9.</note> This looks ſuſpicious. It muſt be a very different plan from "that ſtrait and narrow way of life," and thoſe terms of "life and death" taught by our Saviour and his apoſtles, which are very plain. This highway of ſalvation is made ſo plain, that it is written "wayfaring men, though fools, ſhall not err therein." The character of the two plans, the one given by inſpiration, and the other by themſelves, ſhew they cannot be the ſame; and we are not prepared to "renounce" the old and true goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel for any other. This projected plan, is to ſave the finally rebellious, in ſome future new-created worlds and tranſmuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:019737_0010_0FACA2E0206C0C80"/>
ſtates, and by more effectual means than the goſpel affords. At firſt ſight, Is this goſpel, or infidelity? It is liable to ſtrong objections, and we ſhall hereafter ſhew it, ſelf-confuted. It is ſufficient here to ſay, theſe projectors have not creating wiſdom and power, and cannot bring theſe new worlds, ſtates and effectual meaſures into exiſtence and effect, and give them reality: and it is clear from revelation the Almighty will not. Again, this plan is, as abſolutely unknown and excluded divine revelation; as, "the invented tales of fairy land" and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as chriſtians whoſe faith is founded on and abſolutely bounded by ſcripture, we have nothing to do with it, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it as vain and deluſive. Further, let no one put any truſt in it, for if the goſpel conſtitution be confirmed in the day of judgment; which is as certain as there is truth in the word of God: there is not the leaſt chance of ſecurity to them on this plan, which is directly oppoſite to that conſtitution: the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming the one, is the everlaſting overthrow of the other.</p>
            <p>Moreover, their piety and benevolence ſeems to need great correction. True piety teaches us a hearty acquieſcence in the all wiſe, perfect government of God, exhibited in ſcripture—as founded in perfect wiſdom, immutable truth, righteouſneſs and goodneſs; and conducted by wiſe laws, conſtitutions and terms of mercy; and enforced by moſt wiſe promiſes and threatnings; and to be ſettled in the day of judgment in a ſtate of final re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution. True piety and benevolence, influences the ſubjects of it to pious endeavours to ſupport the authority and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, the requiſitions of the law and goſpel, and the promiſes and threatnings of God in all their force; and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour the repentance of ſinful men, and their reconciliation to God, upon the merciful terms of his divine conſtitution only. But where do we find piety and benevolence exerciſed in taking up the cauſe of his enemies againſt God? In ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting the preſumptuous hopes of the wicked againſt the force of his threatnings? In taking up, arguing and ſupporting their objections, and thereby ſtrengthening their miſapprehenſions, hard thoughts and prejudices againſt the character of God as illuſtrated, and the government of God as it will be ſettled in
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:019737_0011_0FACA2E066CA82F0"/>
the day of judgment? By teaching them, if they are final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſerable in their rebellion, and "deſtruction be their end," as the ſcripture conſtantly teacheth, that God ſhould have withheld their exiſtence? And let them be ever ſo vile and abominable in their treatment of their Creator and Saviour, if, after their obſtinate rejection of life and ſalvation in this world, he doth not create new worlds and tranſmutation ſtates, and uſe effectual meaſures for the recovery of all the rebellious, that diſhonours will be reflected upon the adorable Creator and Saviour? Certainly we find no ſuch doctrines taught, no ſuch inſinuations given out, nor any ſuch "piety and benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence" exemplified by Moſes and the prophets, by our Saviour and his apoſtles, or any ſaint of God, on ſcripture record, which are our ſtandard to judge by. Doth it not ſavour more of the ſpirit of Cain, of the murmuring Iſraelites, and of the wicked of the earth, than of the true ſaints of God? And can ſuch pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety and benevolence be genuine in its direction, operation and fruit? Such zeal is prepoſterouſly abſurd. And that rebuke, immediately from God, merits our attention, and ſhould put and keep us upon guard: "ſhall he that contendeth with the Almighty inſtruct him? he that reproveth God, let him anſwer it." Job 40.2. This was effectual with holy Job. In a word, let it be noted, it is not here and there a detached arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the chriſtian faith that muſt be renounced, but we muſt give up the doctrine of the croſs—the conſtitution of nature— and the revealed conſtitution of God, to embrace this new creed; as will hereafter appear. Surely no good chriſtians, who love not their lives to the death for the word of God and teſtimony of Jeſus, can do this. The people of this land, in this enlightened age, are certainly better inſtructed than to do it; unleſs heads of families and goſpel miniſters are far more to blame than I believe them to be, in not duly educating and teaching them. It is plain therefore, we cannot poſſibly go over to them. What ſhall be done to compromiſe the matter, to ſettle the controverſy, and bring us to unity in the faith?</p>
            <p>In the room of their propoſed reform, I would propoſe a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute, which may be agreed upon by all, without ſacrificing

Let us renounce the following rules of ſophiſtry and falſe argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, viz. all attempt to correct the doctrine of revelation, by our prejudicate or invented notions of reaſon: for the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is given to correct theſe, and not to be corrected by them. "The world by wiſdom knew not God." God himſelf hath taught us in his word the true knowledge of his perfections, councils and works: in this inſtruction let us reſt and abide. Let us lay aſide all attempt to correct the faith of inſpired wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, by affixing a more "glorious meaning to their declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons" than they underſtood and intended.

rules of ſophiſtry and falſe argumentation were univerſally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced; although the ſupport of the doctrine we implead, wholly depends upon them. Theſe falſe rules, duly noticed, will give the reader an opportunity of judging upon the merits of this diſpute, and of the force of what is here written and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his judgment. I am clear in it, when theſe falſe maxims and modes of arguing are once diſcarded, it will ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſede the pretended need of a reform; and the articles in diſpute between us, may ſtand, with all reaſon and ſafety, as they were embraced in the days of inſpiration, and have been, by the chriſtian church, ever ſince.</p>
            <p>I am no enemy to the univerſaliſts, although they may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count me one, becauſe, with all freedom, I tell them the truth.

Mr. Whiſton ſuggeſts; that only weak enthuſiaſts and divines, bigoted to topi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal orthodoxy, and deficient in real ſagacity and true judgment, could freely preach the common doctrine. Mr. White, in his charity, ſtiles them "miſtical Jews." Mr. Reily, in his civility, ſtiles his opponents "barking ears." Another inferior author, ſpeaks of them as having the vail on their hearts, and blinded by the God of this world. A more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite writer, who reveres the piety of our forefathers, yet exhibits them as a ſet of idolatars, portraying the God they worſhip "deſtitute of truth and ſincerity," which cannot be the true God. And the humble, "pious" Dr. Hartly affects a ſuperiority over "the ſacred writers themſelves," to give us a more full meaning of "their glorious declarations" than their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted minds underſtood. And this benevolent writer, in his candour, judges that the chriſtian world, proteſtant as well as papal, that differ from him in theſe points, receive, for ſcripture truths, as groſs abſurdities and palpably wrong and diſhonourable ideas of God, as infidels in the dark ages and places of paganiſm. p. 362, 3.

Biſhop Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock, Dr. Clark, and Dr. Tayler, are applauded by this author; and ſcores and hundreds might be added to the liſt. Theſe writers are merciful, perhaps, without deſign, amidſt their ſeverity: for they have left us, join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in one faith, in the beſt of company, with the patriarchs and prophets, our Saviour and his apoſtles, and all the ſaints of God, jewiſh and chriſtian, in the days of inſpiration; it being conceded, in their note p. 253, "that the inſpired writers did not underſtand the full meaning of their glorious declarations:" that is, they did not underſtand the doctrine and ſcheme of theſe men. This is in effect giving up the point in diſpute. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt is plainly between the inſpired teachers and writers, and theſe men; and no conſiſtent revelationiſt can doubt in ſuch a conteſt, whoſe plan and doctrine will be approved and whoſe will be condemned in the great day.</p>
                  <p>That all wiſdom and goodneſs is not the prerogative peculiar of theſe men, one may infer from the character they give of their body.

One would imagine theſe political ones, who for their bread paſs through the world under a maſked faith, are no better than they ſhould be;—that ſuch evil ſuggeſtions thrown out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the chriſtian miniſtry, is rather unfriendly to the ſacred order;—and their magnifying their little band, by ſuch numbers of hidden diſciples, can add no great ſtrength or glory to their cauſe. A prophet of their own, announces, "that modern prudence is the falſe wiſdom condemned by our Saviour; and that the vulgar arts of concealment are equally unworthy the ſcholar, the divine, and the chriſtian."

or ſuch palpable errors and abſurdities, as now paſs in the world, could not be endured. It ſeems requiſite to touch and wind up theſe ſprings to their proper tone of ſenſibility, that truth and error may be quickly diſcerned, and in ſuch force as the one may be readily received and the other rejected. Add to this, it is very pernicious to the credit and uſe of divine reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, to render the language of ſcripture "ſceptical and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain." It directly tends to ſcepticiſm, and to deteat the practical deſign of revelation. For ſhould we eſcape the dreadful gulph of ſcepticiſm, yet, if your principles hang looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the wavering mind, as the cloaths upon the body, they cannot be ſo realizingly believed as to effect the grand practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal intention. Wherefore, I have endeavoured to give the ſenſe of ſcripture upon ſuch plain principles of reaſon and ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as that truth ſhould carrry it's own evidence with it to faſten it: and to exhibit truth and error in ſuch plainneſs and force, as ſeems fitted to induce a belief of the truth and impreſs the influence of it. Might I happily ſucceed, to fix any that are ſceptical, ſettle the wavering, confirm the believer, ſuccour the endangered, and throw out any thoughts that any of our opponents may improve upon for their conviction and recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry from what I am fully perſuaded to be very dangerous error, I ſhould account it among the choiceſt bleſſings of my life.</p>
            <p>It is common for erroriſts, and our opponents in particular, to deal much in the moſt difficult parts of ſcripture: here are their ſtrong holds—the current doctrine of revelation is direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt them. But in theſe, and all others conſidered, I am ſatisfied I have given the genuine ſenſe intended in the ſacred texts. If it prove ſatisfactory, it will give me pleaſure: if it
<pb n="xv" facs="unknown:019737_0016_0FACA2E429B477C8"/>
fails, we fail where wiſer and greater men have failed before us. It avails but little to produce the ſentiments of eminent divines and other great and good writers who have gone before us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, thoſe we have to deal with look down upon the reſt of the chriſtian world. However, it may not be amiſs to make ſome trial of it. And I know of no celebrated American author whoſe known ability and candour, would more recommend him to their attentive notice, than the Rev. Dr. Charles Chauncy of Boſton. I have accordingly ſelected a number of things out of his writings, in ſupport of the common conſtruction and faith. As one or two paſſages out of his ſermons "breaking of bread in remembrance of the dying love of Chriſt, a goſpel inſtitution;" printed in Boſton 1772. Several paſſages out of his "ſeaſonable thoughts;" printed in Boſton 1743. But the paſſages are chiefly collected out of his ſermons upon juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation —the nature of faith, &amp;c. printed in Boſton 1765. In theſe ſermons, in my opinion, there is more ſound divinity and concluſive reaſonings, than in all the writings of the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaliſts I have ever ſeen, and as I believe were ever wrote. If they hear him not, it is in vain to hope their conviction from any other. As to the plan of reaſoning and illuſtrating the points in controverſy, purſued in the following work, if executed by one who was maſter of the ſubject, and had leiſure for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, I am fully ſatisfied, it would bring forth the truth with the force of moral demonſtration, according to the nature of the ſubject. I have often wiſhed, for the truth's ſake, it had been in the hand of one of greater ability and more leiſure; that full juſtice might have been done to the ſubject, and the world have had the benefit of ſuch a demonſtration. I preſume not to ſay, it is now ſo executed; it was next to impoſſible, amidſt my avocations and embarraſſments, by the uncommon general ſickneſs that hath prevailed here for the two laſt years, and continual ſickneſs in my own family. This may have ſome weight with the candid reader, to excuſe the inaccuracies and imperfections he may diſcern in this work.</p>
            <p>Had I ſeen the treatiſe remarked upon in the third part, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I wrote the others, it would have produced ſome alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

                   rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſo as to have prevented ſome repetitions that become now unavoidable, without detriment to the ſubject. Other altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I am ſenſible, might be made for the better. The argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in ſome places, might be enforced; and in others, new arguments, perhaps as forcible with the reader, might be added. But in my ſituation, I cannot take the trouble of tranſcribing and altering: the world muſt have it as it is, or not at all in proper ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>I have endeavoured to take up the ſcheme and ſentiments of the author truly, and to reply to his arguments in their force; and to conſider every text and argument which appeared ſo weighty as materially to effect the controverſy; not troubling myſelf or the reader with others. If any are omitted the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may judge weighty, they either eſcaped my notice, or were thought to be immaterial, or not difficult to a reader of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good judgment.</p>
            <p>I read this treatiſe with candour, in this ſenſe, viz. without any diſpoſition to find needleſs fault, or in matters of little conſequence; but I confeſs I had no expectation of being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by his arguments. A rule of judging of doctrines founded in reaſon and revelation, which I have long uſed, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids ſuch an expectation. The rule is this: "A doctrine that in the very face of it carries deſtruction to the moral character and government of God, or to natural and revealed religion, or to the character of our Saviour, cannot be from God." This rule is grounded on this evident reaſon: we have ſtronger evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in ſupport of theſe, than we have of a contrary doctrine. And the ſpirit and force of this rule, whereby to judge of and reject ſuch manifeſt error without heſitation, is given by Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Deut. 13th chapter. Let a doctrine that hath this cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter written in the face of it, come recommended to us with ever ſo much plauſibility of learning, criticiſm, philoſophy, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphyſicks, pretenſions of good, ſeeming force of argument, or pretenſions of miracles itſelf, we are inſtantly to reject it without heſitation; whether we can ſee through the ſophiſtry and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy of it's ſupport or not. This author ſays true, "it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that ſhould come from God which is unworthy
<pb n="xvii" facs="unknown:019737_0018_0FACA2E5AE05B148"/>
of him:" although he wrongly applies it. p. 361. Now, this impleaded doctrine, carries this character of falſhood in the very face of it; and in the conſtruction given to ſacred texts to ſupport it. "That the wicked ſhould be as happy as the righteous in final iſſue, in a ſtate of final retribution, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to the moral character and government of God." Every trace of wiſdom, holineſs, juſtice, truth and goodneſs in character and government, is deſtroyed in ſuch a doctrine. There is no government—it is abſolute confuſion where good and bad fare alike in final iſſue. And the ſcripture is in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more plain and deciſive, than that, in final iſſue, "it ſhall go well with the righteous, and ill with the wicked." Again, it is deſtruction to natural and revealed religion, by deſtroying the principles and motives whereby only it can be ſupported, viz. rewards and puniſhments, rendered in final iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, according to characters formed in a ſtate of trial. Take away this inforcement, and aſſign one end to the whole human race, (whatever their characters be,) whether univerſal, annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, or univerſal happineſs, all idea of rational government, and all rational ſupport of religion, natural and revealed, are no more. If you teach men, that God will not finally deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine their ſtate by "the terms of life and death" he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to them in this world, what is there left to inforce obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience? Further, our Saviour hath given us a copy of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence he will pronounce upon the righteous and wicked in the laſt day, to fix our faith, and form our hearts and lives by it. Now, to ſuppoſe he hath given it in ſuch ambiguity, that we can never be certain of the true meaning of it, and what we are to believe;—in ſuch ambiguity as is moſt likely to be miſtaken, ſo that, perhaps, ninety-nine of a hundred, in all ages, have in fact miſtaken it;—in ſuch ambiguity, that the true meaning, viz. "an age of happineſs and puniſhment," hath never been hit upon for more than ſeventeen hundred years after it was delivered to the world:—I ſay, to ſuppoſe this, is abſolute deſtruction to the character of Chriſt, as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet and judge. For no wiſe teacher would attempt to fix the faith of his hearers; and no wiſe judge would deliver a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital
<pb n="xviii" facs="unknown:019737_0019_0FACA2E66E458138"/>
ſentence with ſuch amazing ambiguity, as that it might be ſeventeen hundred years before any one would underſtand and be able to fix the ſenſe of it. It is infinitely unworthy of the great prophet, light and judge of the world to do it. We know, therefore, previous to critical examination, that all their learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed labour to render this ſentence ſceptical and ambiguous, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with their conſtruction itſelf, muſt be abſolutely wrong; whether we can diſcover the error and ſophiſtry of it or not. We know, from the nature of the ſubject, the ſentence is given without ambiguity, in ſuch deciſive words and manner, as was eaſy and certain to be underſtood in that day. And it would have remained without ambiguity to this day, but for the ill-judged and ill-concerted labours of ſome learned men. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, I can no more believe in a conſtruction which deſtroys the character of our Saviour, as a prophet and judge, than I can in infidelity or atheiſm itſelf. This is a rule of judging of doctrines that is ſelf-evidently right. And it ought to be the ſtrong hold of common chriſtians, who are unable to ſee thro' ſubtle, ſophiſtical reaſonings in ſupport of doctrines obviouſly deſtructive of the character of God, and of our Saviour, and of the divine government, and ſubverſive of "the faith once deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the ſaints." But it is the buſineſs of thoſe "who are ſet for the defence of the goſpel" to endeavour to detect the error of their criticiſms, and of their rules of conſtruction, with the falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of their reaſonings: and bring to view ſuch plain deciſive rules of true conſtruction, as to fix and ſettle us firmly "in the faith once delivered to the ſaints." This is attempted in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing work, with what ſucceſs is left with the reader to judge.</p>
            <p>In fine, I have nothing more at heart, than that both readers and writers may be thoroughly led into the truth as it is in Chriſt; and may, by the grace of God, be formed to a preſent choice of that good part in Chriſt which will never be taken away: that we periſh not in the perdition of the ungodly in the great day; but may then, with the redeemed and ſanctified of this world, inherit that kingdom prepared for them before the foundation of the world.</p>

The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of this part is to conſider and refute the moſt plauſible upon this ſubject.</p>
               <p>The firſt ſoothing, inſinuating argument to induce credit to the doctrine of the ſalvation of ALL MEN, is the antiquity of it. It is ſaid to be no novel doctrine, but was received by two men of note, Origen and Clemens, of Alexandria, in the latter end of the ſecond century.<note n="*" place="bottom">See preface to the pamphlet, Salvation for all Men.</note> Not to controvert the truth of the fact, which however is diſputed, I obſerve upon this ſtating, it hath clearly no claim to our belief as a ſcripture doctrine taught and received by the church of God from the apoſtles; becauſe it is a century too late; after the apoſtles were all dead. In this ſtating, it is conceded, the prophets and Jewiſh church, the apoſtles and the chriſtian church, knew nothing of this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine as of God; it made its firſt appearance in the world under that pretence with theſe two men; which is the truth of fact: wherefore, it ought to be rejected by us as a ſpurious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:019737_0021_0FACA2E7EE0616D8"/>
and corruption, brought forth in a degenerate age like ours. This argument, inſtead of force to induce our belief, carries a refutation and condemnation of the doctrine in it. In our turn, we give one ſtating of the antiquity of it more deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive. We aver it the firſt and moſt ruinous error ever broach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the world, and reſt the proof on Gen. 3. 1 to the 6. "And the ſerpent ſaid unto the woman, ye ſhall not ſurely die; for God doth know, that in the day that ye eat thereof, then your eyes ſhall be opened; and ye ſhall be as Gods knowing good and evil." v. 4 and 5. The doctrine is obviouſly the ſame in both parts of it, viz. a full denial that mankind ſhould ſuffer the death in the threatning—the full wages of ſin— "ye ſhall not ſurely die"—with as full a promiſe and aſſuring declaration (diſobedience notwithſtanding) they ſhould be tranſcendently happy, "as Gods, knowing good and evil." The ſame ſubtil inſinuation of incredibility, as well as full de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of the truth and threatning of God, is uſed to introduce both ſchemes into the world. The old ſerpent well knew the firm belief of the threatning muſt firſt be ſubverted before he could bring on ſeduction and diſobedience. He firſt addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the ſtrong inſinuation of incredibility, to unhinge the mind and ſhake the foundation of faith; then follows it with a full audacious denial to overthrow it: "And he ſaid unto the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, yea, hath God ſaid, ye ſhall not eat of every tree of the garden?" v. 1. A ſtartling queſtion. Can ſuch a prohibition come from a God all goodneſs? and inforced too with ſuch an awful penalty as death, an eternal excluſion from life and bleſſedneſs? It exceeds all belief. Inſinuation having done its work, gained attention: he follows it with a full denial; "Ye ſhall not ſurely die." In this we have the ſtrength of the whole cauſe, in both ſchemes. For this inſinuation and argument of incredibility, may alike be inforced with the very ſame arguments and way of arguing, in both ſchemes. The ſame objections of incredibility are as full againſt the firſt threatning as the reſt, in the book of God. It may be ſaid and argued, that ſuch a tremendous threatning as death ſhould ever be executed "exceeds all belief;" becauſe man, a finite crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, cannot commit a ſin of ſuch infinite ill demerit, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:019737_0022_0FACA2E8A4C48578"/>
an eternal excluſion from life and bleſſedneſs. That the tranſgreſſion of a moment cannot amount to ſuch an eternal forfeiture and puniſhment. That one tranſgreſſion, "in eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the forbidden fruit," ſhould incur death upon the firſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and ſubject millions of millions of his offspring to ſin, and to calamity and death, to reign for ages and to the end of the world, exceeds comprehenſion and belief. It may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to be inconſiſtent with divine benevolence—a God all goodneſs—with the end of creation—the happineſs of the creature: and it may be as ſtrongly urged on the one ſcheme as the other, that God's plan is an univerſal plan; uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal good, univerſal happineſs, and the rich abounding pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion in creation for man and beaſt, might be adduced as proof of it. Moreover, the argument for the everlaſting happineſs of all men, in their way of arguing, is alike forcible from "the tree of life" as from the mediator and atonement. God made proviſion of eternal life for man, of which he gave an aſſuring pledge "in the tree of life;" and none can doubt it all-ſufficient. The proviſion is made for man, (i. e.) as they argue, for "all men:" all that come under the denomination of men, ſtand in the ſame near and tender relation, and have intereſt in God as their common father; ſo that all are under an equally gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious council and deſign of eternal life. It is then a pledge of eternal life, for man, i.e. all men, the whole world, and will admit of no clippings, diſtinctions, or exceptions of elect or non-elect, Jew or Gentile, innocent or diſobedient, ſaint or ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and the concluſion is clear, if the proviſion and pledge be for all, all ſhall eventually enjoy eternal life: for if he hath made ſuch proviſion, he is deſirous of their everlaſting felicity; and it muſt follow that they ſhall attain it. What ſhould hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it? Our wiſhes may be fruſtrated, but God cannot be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed. It is annihilating his omnipotence to ſay he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not effect it, if he deſires it. It is inconceivable that any ſhould periſh everlaſtingly. "His infinite wiſdom, power and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs forbid ſuch a diſhonourable ſuppoſition." If he deſires it, he wills it; and his will is "efficacious, uncontroulable, and irriſiſtable." Yea, his will and work is one;<note n="*" place="bottom">Salvation for all men, p. 6, 7, ibid p. 6. and Divine Glory in the Salvation of all men, p. 7, 8, 9.</note> it is as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:019737_0023_0FACA2E9664466E8"/>
done; and we may anticipate the great event, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate all mankind upon their future proſpect—univerſal, everlaſting happineſs. The argument runs alike eaſy, ſmooth, and forcible upon both ſchemes. And it is of importance to remark, the ſame foundation error doth attend both ſchemes, and ruins all their arguments in ſupport of them, viz. That this promiſe and aſſurance of life, is held out in both, not only in diſconnection with, but in direct oppoſition to the terms of life appointed of God to men in this life. The appointed terms of life in this world are excluded and ſet aſide in both ſchemes; whereas, in the conſtitution of innocency, our firſt parents could have no hope of this eternal life provided and pledged in the tree of life, but upon their forbearance to eat of the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den fruit and finiſhed obedience: conſequently, upon tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, they were (this proviſion and pledge notwithſtanding) forever cut off from all hope of eternal life by that conſtitution; and were accordingly drove out of the garden of Eden, and a fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ſword placed to guard againſt all acceſs to the tree of life. So the conſtitution of grace gives no hope to periſhing ſinners, but in compliance with the goſpel terms of life in this world: and thoſe who neglect the great ſalvation, live and die in ſin and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency, are as effectually cut off all hope of ſalvation, by this conſtitution (the all-ſufficiency of the mediation and atonement of Chriſt notwithſtanding) as our firſt parents were by tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on under that conſtitution. They cannot be ſaved by this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of grace or any other, becauſe to them "there remains no more ſacrifice for ſins." To ſay the condemned in the day of judgment, as workers of iniquity, are yet within the plan of mercy, and ſhall finally be ſaved, is to ſet up an abſurd oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between the plan of mercy and the revealed conſtitution of mercy, in the neceſſary and eſſential terms of it, as publiſhed to the world by our Saviour and his apoſtles. Which leads to another remark: The ſame objections lie againſt both ſchemes, with this difference only; they are greater, ſtronger, and ſome more againſt that of the univerſaliſts. The impoſſibility of ſalvation to the finally diſobedient by goſpel conſtitution— from the truth and immutability of God—the eſtabliſhed terms of life in it—the infallibility of the promiſes and threatnings—
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:019737_0024_0FACA2EA298614C8"/>
and from the character and government of God, &amp;c. is alike clear, as that after tranſgreſſion our firſt parents could never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain eternal life by the conſtitution of innocency. Surely the ſtatutes and declarations that exclude them the kingdom of God and eternal life, and conſign them to everlaſting deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are in as clear, ſtrong, and preremtory terms as the firſt threatning, and often repeated, and with this obſervable differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; there was nothing in that conſtitution to render it incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent or impoſſible, but that mankind (although forever cut off by that) might yet have eternal life through a mediator and atonement, by another, the conſtitution of grace now eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But this door of hope is ſhut to the finally impenitent; inaſmuch as "Chriſt will profit them nothing", "and to them there is no more ſacrifice for ſin." And we have the ſtrongeſt aſſurance we can have, that the word of this conſtitution will not give place to another, but "abide in full force forever." Again, the ſame deluding artifice "a pretence of greater good and advantage" attends both ſchemes, they diſplay their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages in ſtrong aſſertions and colourings, <note n="*" place="bottom">Salvation for all men, p. 2.</note> but with all their art and oratory, they cannot diſplay them beyond that "ye ſhall be as Gods, knowing good and evil," tranſcendently knowing and immortally happy. No doubt, the indulgence of preſent appetite, with the proſpect of ſo great an advance of happineſs, had great force "as the greater good" upon the deluded ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of the woman, "when ſhe ſaw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleaſant to the eyes, and a tree to be deſired to make one wiſe, and took of the fruit thereof and did eat, &amp;c." <note n="†" place="bottom">Gen. 3.6.</note> and to a deluded imagination error is wont to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear more ſpecious and taking than the truth of God. But to paſs this artifice without running the parallel of the two ſchemes in it further, I proceed to a more important remark, viz. both doctrines have the ſame ruinous, moſt fatal tendency. They tend to confound the nature of things—the great and eſſential difference between virtue and vice, holineſs and ſin; to annul the diſtinction of character between the righteous and the wicked, or render it ſmall and unimportant in this world; to miſrepreſent the character of God, and exclude all juſt ideas of his moral government; and particularly of the great doctrine
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:019737_0025_0FACA426AC4D27F0"/>
of future rewards and puniſhments as taught by reaſon and the revelation of God. They tend entirely to defeat the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of his threatnings in this world, to reſtrain from wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or to engage men to repentance and life. For if they ſhall never be executed ſo as to exclude them everlaſting life, where is the terror of them? where the energy of them in the hearts of men to ſupport the law, authority and government of God over them? The doctrine in its direct tendency operates diſregard to the divine authority and laws—to the goſpel terms of life—and to all obedience in this preſent life; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is all unneceſſary to their enjoyment of eternal life: This is as ſure to them, upon a foundation that cannot fail, be they ever ſo wicked, as though ever ſo holy and good; though not ſo ſoon.<note n="*" place="bottom">In ſcripture it is preremptorily declared, "he that believeth not ſhall not ſee life, but the wrath of God abideth on him;" "that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous, &amp;c. ſhall not inherit the kingdom of God:" now to ſay theſe unbelieving, unrighteous ones ſhall ſee life and inherit the kingdom of God—that they are brought into the world expectants of a bleſſed immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality upon a foundation that will not diſappoint them, <note n="§" place="bottom">See Salvation for all men, p. 26.</note> is clearly to ſet up a doctrine directly oppoſite to that of ſcripture, in import, nature, tendency and operation. This promiſſary one, defeats the influence and effects of the threatning; it revives and ſupports the hope to the diſobedient the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is deſigned to cut off: it encourages and imboldens to that unbelief and diſobedience the threatning is moſt wiſely deſigned and fitted to prevent. e. g. ſuppoſe a parent indeavouring to reclaim a profligate ſon, threatens him he will abſolutely diſinherit him, and puniſh him with utmoſt ſeverity, if he doth not amend and become obedient in a limited time, ſay one year; but, while under this threat, in the courſe of this diſcipline, let him know the inheritance was finally ſure to him, whether reclaimed or not, and let him be ever ſo profligate during the whole term—he ſhould indeed be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with great ſeverity if he did not amend—but as to the inheritance, in all the riches, honours and pleaſures of it, it was ſure to him "upon a foundation which would not diſappoint him,"—what muſt be the effect? The threatning of diſheriſon, eſpecially, would have no force: He would diſpiſe him for his weakneſs and inconſiſtency: and, if conſcience and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſenſe was in exerciſe, would abhor him for an attempt to rule and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him by impoſition and deceit. And ſhall men impute ſuch a ſcheme of folly and abomination to the infinitely wiſe and holy God? That be far from us. Let them criticiſe and turn as they will, we are ſure no ſuch ſelf-repugnant, inconſiſtent, ſelf-deſtroying doctrine can be found in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine revelation. The goſpel doctrine is a doctrine of godlineſs; this of ungodlineſs in nature, tendency and operation.</note> Therefore, as ſurely as the threatnings of God
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:019737_0026_0FACA4276DDB5970"/>
will be executed, ſo ſurely does it operate deſtruction to thoſe who follow the natural dictates and tendency of it. To ſay this doctrine is capable of being perverted and abuſed to ſin as every other doctrine may, is to evade and diſguiſe the truth. It is the natural tendency and opperation of it, as is evident in the ſeduction and diſobedience of our firſt parents, involving the world of mankind in ſin and condemnation: for how was that ſeduction effected, but by a denial of the threatning, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with an aſſuring declaration, "they ſhould be as Gods," tranſcendently and immortally happy, their diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in this ſtate notwithſtanding. Was their ſeduction then the abuſe of the devil's doctrine, or the natural effect of it, to which it was fitted, and which he deſigned? And if it was ſo fatal to innocent minds, will it be leſs ſo in minds that are dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate? if the force of preſumption be ſo great already, that (without grounds, and againſt the deſign of it) corrupt men will encourage themſelves in ſin from the delay of puniſhment: "ſo that becauſe ſentence againſt their evil works is not exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted ſpeedily, therefore the hearts of the ſons of men are fully ſet in them to do evil," how much more will they be embol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened and hardened in it when taught it never will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted to their final excluſion from eternal life. To aver their doctrine gives no encouragement to licentiouſneſs, becauſe "they inſiſt a man will be miſerable while he is wicked, and that he muſt be virtuous in order to be happy," <note n="*" place="bottom">Divine Glory in the Salvation of all Men, p. 15.</note> avails not, while they maintain with it that let them live and die ever ſo wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, yet they ſhall all ſurely turn from their wickedneſs, become virtuous, and enjoy everlaſting life in ſome future period. In this connexion it operates no effectual reſtraint, no good to men in this world, but lulls them in ſecurity in ſin. It operates no hurt to the ſcheme and kingdom of the wicked one: it is of no conſequence to him how much the doctrine in this connex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion is taught and believed, only as it ſerves the more to delude and harden men; for if he can but hold them in ſin and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency to death and the day of judgment, his malicious deſign is accompliſhed. Let this aſſertion be placed in its connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with this life, where it ought to ſtand—that men muſt ceaſe
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:019737_0027_0FACA4282F29FD68"/>
to be wicked, turn to God, and be holy in this world, or they cannot be ſaved and be happy," it is the truth of God, and it will have weight and influence in proportion to the firmneſs with which it is realizingly believed. But take away this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of it in this life, remove it to the inviſible world; and connect with it this aſſurance "all the wicked of the earth will become virtuous and inherit eternal life," it is an encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to licentiouſneſs with a witneſs, nor is there a more ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous error in the world. In one circumſtance the ſchemes dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer. They tell us they take their doctrine from the revelation of God. The devil it ſeems had not the audacity to do that, but he makes a ſolemn appeal to the divine omniſcience for the truth of it, in theſe words; "For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes ſhall be opened, and ye ſhall be as Gods knowing good and evil;" which hath like force to induce belief.</p>
               <p>On the whole, we ſee an evident agreement in the two doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, in the eſſential, ſubſtantial parts of them—in the inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of incredibility againſt the truth of God—in the ſame arguments and way of arguing, whereby both are alike ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported and inforced—in the fundamental error of them, which diſcloſeth their ſandy foundation, viz. both alike excluding the eſſential terms of life appointed of God to men in this world, and ſetting them aſide as unneceſſary to be complied with in this life to their attainment of eternal life. Both are liable to the ſame objections and refutation by the declarations and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed conſtitution of God, and both have the ſame deluding artifice of greater good, and the ſame ruinous and fatal tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. Now, ſince the two ſchemes have ſuch an evident cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence and exact agreement in the ſubſtantial parts, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal lineaments and characters of them, what may and muſt we infer, but that they are ſubſtantially the ſame, and have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly one father—the father of lies; who our Lord tells us "is a liar from the beginning and the father of it."

Therefore the doctrine which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth and iſſues in it, ought to be rejected with the utmoſt abhorrence. That "it ſhould be as well with the wicked as the righteous" in the final iſſue of things, is, at firſt ſight, a moſt obnoxious, unaccountable, and incredible doctrine. Is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, when the ſcripture is ſo full, clear, abundant, and deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive in point, that yet no regard ſhould be had to virtue or vice —to characters formed by the one and the other, in this world, in final retribution for eternity?

                  <pb n="10" facs="unknown:019737_0029_0FACA429DBDEBC30"/>Another inſinuating argument is, that the tender feelings of humanity, of ſocial, benevolent and parental affections teach their doctrine credible, and the commonly received doctrine, incredible. It is boldly aſſerted, "a man muſt be loſt to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity that doth not readily cry out "of their doctrine" this is good news if true."<note n="‖" place="bottom">Salv. p. 2, 3.</note> To inforce their concluſion, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon queſtions are addreſſed to us. Would you not wiſh all men to be ſaved? ſometimes, Would a tender mother throw her child into the fire or water, to be deſtroyed? if not, are not the tender feelings of humanity, and bowels of parental affection as nothing, but as a drop to the ocean, to the infinite mercies of God the father of the ſpirits of all fleſh? granted. Thence they infer, that it is incredible "that he ſhould puniſh the wicked with the everlaſting fire and puniſhment prepared for the devil and his angels" and that all men ſhall be ſaved. We reply, there is an infinite diſparity in the two caſes, and their conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion doth not, cannot follow. As Creator, God is the father of the ſpirits of all fleſh; but he is alſo their moral Governor and righteous Judge. In this character he reveals himſelf to us: and it was one of the firſt inſtructions he gave to man, in innocency; by appointing to him an inſtance of the trial of his obedience, and inforced it with the awful penalty of death. "In the day that thou eat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Beſides, God is now conducting a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of moſt marvelous mercy to men in this world. Here there is ſuch a parity, that to exalt our apprehenſions of the fullneſs and freeneſs of this mercy, and to incourage our duty in ſeeking it, there is the greateſt propriety and force in our Saviour's addreſs to theſe tender feelings. "If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children; how much more ſhall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that aſk him? <note n="§" place="bottom">Luke 11.13.</note> But we cannot in the leaſt infer, from all the infinite riches of his grace exhibited in this diſpenſation, that
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:019737_0030_0FACA42AD6476E20"/>
he will ſhew any favor "to the veſſels of wrath fitted for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction" when he ſits on the throne of judgment, to render righteous retribution to them; for he hath told us expreſsly "if his hand take hold on judgment, he will render vengeance to his enemies, and reward them that hate him" and repeatedly, "that his eye ſhall not ſpare, nor will he have pity." Mercy is ſet aſide and precluded exerciſe to them, and juſtice will have its courſe. Humane, ſocial affections are implanted in us, to ſtimulate us to ſocial duties, and for the good of ſociety in this world. Parental affections are to ſtimulate us to parental duty, to preſerve, cheriſh, feed, cloath, provide for and bring up our children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. But the power of their life and death are not put into our hands. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to deſtroy them without cauſe, without right as propoſed in the queſtion: againſt the command of God, the force of conſcience, and all the indearing ties of parental and ſocial affections, and the grand intention of them, would be moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normous wickedneſs. No wonder, at the putting of the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the heart recoils againſt it, with all it's force. But this concludes nothing, what God as moral governour and righteous judge may and will do, in final judgment. For it is to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, theſe ſocial and parental affections are not implanted in us as a rule and ſtandard, by which to meaſure out the juſtice of God or man. So far from it, that in judging of righteouſneſs between man and man, theſe paſſions muſt be ſet aſide—and the biaſing exerciſes of them, are expreſsly precluded and forbidden by the ſtatutes of God. "Thou ſhalt not countenance a poor man in his cauſe."<note n="‖" place="bottom">Exod. 23.3.</note> "Thou ſhalt not reſpect the perſon of the poor, nor honour the perſon of the mighty; but in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhalt thou judge thy neighbour."<note n="*" place="bottom">Lev. 19.15.</note> And Levi muſt know neither father nor mother nor the deareſt connections in life, when purſuing and executing righteous judgment. And it is well known, in all well-regulated governments in this world, intereſted judges are excluded judging, in caſes where intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Now, can it be right to ſet up theſe paſſions (ſo excluded as a rule in matters of juſtice by the laws of God and man) to be the rule, meaſure and ſtandard whereby to judge of, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive or reject the infinitely wiſe maxims and rules of everlaſting

righteouſneſs, by which God now governs the world, and will finally ſettle the ſtates of all men? If this doth not fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince and ſatisfy, apply this rule to inſtances on ſacred record, and ſee the reſult. If Adam, the parent of mankind had lived to the time of Noah, and ſeen the wickedneſs of his nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous poſterity, and had it in his power; would he uncommiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned of God, have overwhelmed all the millions of his poſterity then exiſting in a flood, except Noah and his family? Surely, he would not. Righteous Lot was vexed with the filthy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of the wicked Sodomites; if in his power, would he unauthoriſed by God, have burnt up the cities of Sodom and Ghomorrha and all the numerous inhabitants in them, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his diſobedient wife into a pillar of ſalt? By no means. Would Abraham, who plead with ſuch inimitable interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for them, have executed ſuch deſtruction on them? In no wiſe. What is the concluſion by this rule? why, againſt the force of divine record, that the old world never was drowned by a flood, nor Sodom and Ghomorrha conſumed by fire from heaven, as is reported to us. It exceeds all belief, as it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruous with the tender paſſions and feelings of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is ſet up as the rule of judging of the divine diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, of what may or may not be done. God's mercies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely exceed that of theſe good men, and therefore it muſt be incredible that he ſhould execute ſuch deſtruction, as they would not. So pernicious is this rule of judging; which is condemned and reprobated by millions of inſtances in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine diſpenſations in this world. And ſuch an application to the paſſions is injudicious, and pernicious; it is condemned by the word and providence of God—by the reaſon of man, and the good policy of this world: and it ſeems can ſerve no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but to blind the mind and pervert the judgment in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the greateſt moment, and in the end, to promote the cauſe of infidelity.</p>
               <p>It is objected, that the doctrine of eternal puniſhment is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible, as being inconſiſtent with the end of the creation, which is the happineſs of the creature—inconſiſtent with infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite benevolence and goodneſs, and infinitely good govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Upon examination, we do not find any thing in ſcripture or
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:019737_0032_0FACA42BEA8A6180"/>
reaſon—in the end of creation—the nature of things—the conſtitution of moral ſubjects—nor in the character and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of God, againſt this ſcripture doctrine; but much, very much to confirm the credibility of it. Scripture ſaith. Thou haſt created all things; and for thy pleaſure they are, and were created. Rev. 4.11. For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory forever, amen. Rom. 11.36. The Lord hath made all things for himſelf: yea, even the wicked for the day of evil. Prov. 16.4. Which ſpeak not indiſcriminate happineſs to all men, but the contrary.</p>
               <p>It is obvious to reaſon, that the work of creation in all the wiſdom and glory of it, is a ſubordinate means to the moral government of God, as a higher end; and the natural and providential government of God, is alſo ſubordinate and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to his moral government: and this ſubſervient to the brighteſt diſplay of the moral perfections and glory of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity; and the higheſt ſecurity and happineſs of all his obedient, moral ſubjects, in an inſeparable connection, as the ultimate end of the whole. This directly militates againſt and ſubverts their notion, that the happineſs of the creature in their ſenſe, is the ultimate end of creation. And from this view we infer, this ſupreme and eternal government is, and will be ſupported by the higheſt ſanctions in nature, thoſe which are eternal. Theſe being apparently the moſt wiſe and ſuitable; and theſe only adequate, to the infinite importance of it.</p>
               <p>It is perfectly conſiſtent with the goodneſs of God, and his deſign in creation, that his moral ſubjects ſhould be placed in a ſtate of dangerous trial; previous and preparatory to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of the unutterable rewards of his eternal kingdom: and that they ſhould be dealt with, rewarded or puniſhed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their obedience or diſobedience, in ſuch ſtate of trial. The conſtitution of angels, as we learn from the apoſtacy and puniſhment of the fallen angels: the conſtitution of mankind in innocency: and the conſtitution of grace, ſubſequent to the ſin of our firſt parents—as facts, are inconteſtible proofs of it. But this, is totally inconſiſtent with their doctrine that the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the creature univerſally, and without diſtinction of character, is the ultimate end of creation and the divine govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as is likewiſe the death denounced in the firſt threatning
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:019737_0033_0FACA42CA6083C90"/>
—the calamities, death and deſtruction, which hath come upon millions of mankind in their generations, and the future puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which they allow awaits the wicked in the inviſible world. Theſe inconteſtible facts do moſt ſtrongly witneſs and evince, that the happineſs of the creature without diſtinction of chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter, is not the grand object purſued: for if it was, why ſuch dangerous trial, and ſuch tremendous puniſhment of ſin, in this world and the future?—why ſuch pointed diſpenſations of deſtruction to the wicked for ages of ages, directly oppoſing and fruſtrating the grand intention purſued, if the happineſs of the creature univerſally, was the main object of creation and divine government? yea, why any ſtate of trial appointed? why are not all on their creation immediately formed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in a ſtate of immutable and everlaſting happineſs, and in this way the grand object be ſecured, if this be the ultimate end of creation? for what is the deſign of a ſtate of trial? or where is the wiſdom, fitneſs and goodneſs of it, but for the forming of characters—diſcloſing the diſtinction of them, and thereby preparing moral ſubjects for a ſtate of retribution: and to illuſtrate the divine character and government in the higheſt poſſible glory—both in the conducting the divine diſpenſations to them in a ſtate of trial, and in the meet recompences which will be rendered to them, according to the good or evil of them, in an eternal ſtate. But if indiſcriminate, univerſal happineſs to all, in a final ſtate of retribution, (whatever be their conduct and characters formed in a ſtate of trial) be the grand object, it is all rendered vain; which is impoſſible. Wherefore, theſe divine conſtitutions of trial, in their nature and grand intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the ſubſequent diſpenſations of God, purſuant to them, in the recompences we know he hath rendered to the obedient and diſobedient, are as facts, inconteſtible proofs, that the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the indiſcriminate, univerſal happineſs of all, is not the object and end of creation, and the divine diſpenſations: but the moral government of God in it's infinitely important con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexions fore-mentioned.</p>
               <p>Moreover, it is certainly conſiſtent with infinite benevolence and good government, that ſin and miſery ſhould exiſt in the dominions of God for ages of ages: for it is an indiſputable fact, that ſin and miſery hath already exiſted in ſubjects paſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numeration
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:019737_0034_0FACA42D6C5C9528"/>
earth and hell, for a very long period, almoſt ſix thouſand years; and that it will continue to the day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and as they allow, in the finally diſobedient, for ages of ages after that day, God only knows how long: And yet they will not, cannot deny God is infinitely benevolent, and his government abſolutely perfect. Therefore, their doctrine of indiſcriminate happineſs to all, as the end of creation and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine government, ſtands condemned by facts open to all the world, to all the univerſe, in theſe atteſtations from God, "that verily there is a reward for the righteous, but a ſtrange puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the workers of iniquity." And from the ſame facts it is very evident, that in the nature of things, it is not incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with infinite benevolence and perfect government, that in the finally diſobedient, ſin and miſery ſhould remain and be perpetuated to all eternity. For God may righteouſly puniſh ſin with ſin in them: the ſin of obſtinacy with a final derelicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and giving up to hardneſs and utter deſtruction, as he hath ſometimes done to ſinners in this world; of which Pharoah and others are inſtances. And for what they or we know, the wiſe ends of his government may render it in the higheſt degree ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and important. And that ideal goodneſs which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes it inconſiſtent, is evinced, by plain facts, to be unſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and falſe. There is no diſputing againſt facts which ſpeak in a language unequivocal and deciſive. And to attempt to ſupport their viſionary theory, againſt ſuch plain, immoveable, inconteſtible facts, by arguments a priori or any others, is utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vain and as abſurd as it would be for a man to attempt to demoliſh a brazen wall of a thouſand feet thickneſs with the breath of his mouth or the throw of a feather againſt it. The objection ſeems fully overthrown by what hath been adduced, and might be more ſo, by ſhewing the abſurd and pernicious conſequences which would follow, which I wave as needleſs. But to evince the credibility of the ſcripture doctrine we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for, many arguments may be added.</p>
               <p>Doth the Moſt High God ſet up his moral government and kingdom to be the end and glory of creation, and all his works to be a monument of praiſe to him throughout the univerſe and to eternity? Reaſon dictates the motives and ſanctions to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it; and to ſecure the ſubjection, obedience and happineſs
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:019737_0035_0FACA42E36892E80"/>
of his ſubjects, will be ſuitable to his immenſe wiſdom and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty —to his infinite authority—and to ſo great and eternal a deſign. Conſequently, the good of obedience will infinitely ſurpaſs what with truth and reaſon can be ſuggeſted to induce a revolt: And the evil and terror of diſobedience, be ſuch as his creatures cannot avoid; and ſhall infinitely exceed what the power of creatures can inflict or threaten with, to turn them aſide. So that unerring truth and reaſon ſhould dictate "the rule of our duty and happineſs, under this infinitely good government, is one and the ſame;" having infinitely more to hope or fear from God, as obedient or diſobedient, than all creation, and all that creatures can do. Now ſuch, preciſely, are the motives and ſanctions, promiſes and threatnings, rewards and puniſhments held forth in the revelations of God. And our duty urged upon this ground; "it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God."<note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. 10, 31.</note> The terror and evil of it infinitely exceeds that of all which creatures can do. So in that addreſs of the infinitely benevolent Saviour, to ſecure the fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of chriſtians in the moſt fiery trials and terrible perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, "and I ſay unto you, my friends, be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do." Here is the utmoſt of creature power; but our Saviour arms us with a fear infinitely beyond it; adding, "but I will forewarn you whom you ſhall fear; fear him, which, after he hath killed, hath power to caſt into hell." <note n="§" place="bottom">Luke, 12.4, 5.</note> As Matthew ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes it, "is able to deſtroy both ſoul and body in hell." "I ſay unto you, fear him." Which words aſcertain the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of apoſtates, ſoul and body, in hell; or our Lord would not have threatened it: he was infinitely above dealing in vain, ſuperſtitious terrors. If we conſult the nature of things, we find virtue and vice, holineſs and ſin, are eſſentially and eternally different: the one, the object of divine compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and rewarding goodneſs; the other an object of infinite abhorrence to the holineſs and juſtice of God, and of his vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictive wrath. And why may not the one as well as the other, be eternally illuſtrated accordingly, in the final retribution of an infinitely good and righteous God? Yea, why is it not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in a government abſolutely perfect? Further, rewards
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:019737_0036_0FACA42EF1CBFC60"/>
and puniſhments have their reaſon and foundation in this eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential and eternal difference in the nature of things, and in the nature, wiſdom and end of government. On the ſame foundation, characters formed by virtue or vice, holineſs or ſin, intitle to rewards, or ſubject to puniſhment. And it is eſſential to a righteous, perfect government, that all the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of it be dealt with according to their character and works. Now, if vicious crimes and characters doth ſubject to puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it muſt be according to the demerit of crimes and exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of ſuch character which doth ſubject to it. Conſequently ſuppoſe the righteous and the wicked to exiſt with unchanged characters to eternity, the wickedneſs of the wicked unatoned, the offered atonement rejected, and they remain impenitent; then it ſeems the rewards of the one and puniſhment of the other, rendered on the ground of character and demerit, muſt both be eternal: in their own words "they muſt remain miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable as long as they remain ſinful; not only becauſe "they are incapable of reliſhing rational happineſs," as they alledge, but alſo on higher grounds, from the nature of things they remain perpetually the ſame objects of indignation to the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and juſtice of God; and by the force of a righteous ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, inforced by the eternal operation of an infinitely wiſe, holy, righteous and good government, in way of retribution. This evinces there is no incredibility in our doctrine, in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things, or which attends the nature of the ſubject. For if they may juſtly remain miſerable, and muſt do ſo as long as they remain ſinful, as they admit, God's grace is his own and he may deny it to them forever; and then, (by their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion) they may righteouſly ſuffer to eternity.</p>
               <p>When we advert to the conſtitution of the moral ſubjects of God's kingdom, the ſcripture doctrine of eternal retributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſtands manifeſt to reaſon. Our great Creator and ſupreme Governor, has framed us to be governed by moral laws and rational motives. This will not be denied. He hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in our nature an inextinguiſhable and immortal deſire of life and good: <note n="*" place="bottom">The ſpirit of inſpiration addreſſes to this paſſion, Pſalm 34, 12.</note> the main-ſpring by which motives have their operation and influence. He hath implanted in us the paſſions of hope and fear, which are among the moſt powerful ſprings in rational minds; and are chiefly deſigned to ſubſerve
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:019737_0037_0FACA42FABAEC128"/>
the great deſigns of his everlaſting kingdom. Surely it is highly rational to ſuppoſe, that in a ſtate of trial, he would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to theſe paſſions, the higheſt and ſtrongeſt motives in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (eternal life and eternal death) to wind up and inforce theſe ſprings of action, with ſtrongeſt energy. Theſe motives appear the moſt wiſe, ſuitable and energetic for the ſupport and glory of his government, and to ſecure the everlaſting holineſs and happineſs of his ſubjects. On the other hand, it is very irrational to ſuppoſe, an addreſs of motives to theſe paſſions, ſo very unequal as to have no proportion the one to the other, that our hopes be animated with the proſpect and reward of eternal life to the obedient, and our fears awakened only by a temporary puniſhment to the moſt rebellious and profligate; and then huſhed and lulled with aſſurance (after this puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) of the enjoyment of eternal life. There is not the leaſt appearance of wiſdom in ſuch an application. It is alike, but more abſurd than it would be in an army to indulge a centinel to drowſe on guard, when occupying a moſt important poſt, and in his failure, an army, a kingdom may be loſt. Again, By nature and conſtitution our ſouls are immortal, capable of never-ending happineſs or miſery: and revelation teaches us, that at the reſurrection, our bodies will be raiſed and fitted to a ſtate of immortality. It ſeems very rational, that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and ſanctions of the divine government, ſhould correſpond to the immortal nature given us, and proſpect before us: that they ſhould be of ſuch weight, moment and duration, as to be infinitely intereſting to us, and determine our happineſs or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery throughout our endleſs exiſtence, as regarded or diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded by us. If ſuch be our natures, and we are to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by motives, why are not the higheſt and ſtrongeſt in nature, thoſe which are eternal and moſt deeply intereſting to us throughout our immortal exiſtence, the wiſeſt and the beſt? Are not the high and awful ſanctions of eternal rewards and puniſhments, in the nature of things, beſt fitted to ſupport the authority and government of God—to ſecure the innocence, obedience, and happineſs of his ſubjects in the firſt inſtance, and under a diſpenſation of mercy to inforce and induce com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the terms of life? It ſeems too plain to admit diſpute. Why then ſhould the doctrine be thought incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:019737_0038_0FACA43068C6DBA8"/>
It is boldly aſſerted, it exceeds all belief—but of this we find no proof. On this ground it is alſo maintained, it cannot be believed; and ſo will have leſs practical influence than their doctrine. But ſtate the queſtion truly and fairly— That the doctrine of eternal puniſhment be received upon the authority of God, and be firmly and realizingly believed; it muſt have the greateſt influence, unleſs we admit, that in the nature of things, weak motives will have more influence than ſtronger ones; or the practical influence of motives decreaſe in proportion to their weight and importance; that a copper will have more influence upon men than a thouſand or mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of pounds; the abſurdity of which "exceeds all belief."</p>
               <p>Can it be unfit and incredible, that the Supreme Governor of the univerſe ſhould uſe means, motives and ſanctions, the moſt wiſe and ſuitable to his immenſe wiſdom and majeſty, and which in the nature of things are beſt adapted to the ſupport and glory of his government, and good of his ſubjects, meerly becauſe ſome of his ſubjects may and will rebel againſt them, and periſh forever? Who dare avow it? It is aſſerted, the doctrine is inconſiſtent with the infinite benevolence and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God; but without grounds; for the mercy of God is not a weak paſſion, that can turn aſide right and juſtice; it is an infinite perfection, the exerciſe of which can never interfere with divine wiſdom, truth and juſtice. Divine juſtice is a perfection as eſſential in the divine nature and character as goodneſs itſelf; and the exerciſe and operation of it in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alike neceſſary. The Dr. is expreſs, "God is as juſt as he is good."<note n="*" place="bottom">See his note in his ſermons, p. 41.</note> We thence infer, in the nature of things, an eternal reign and full diſplay of retributive juſtice on the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of juſtice, "veſſels of wrath fitted for deſtruction," may be as wiſe, conſiſtent and neceſſary in the divine government, as the eternal reign and full diſplay of grace and mercy on the objects of mercy, "veſſels of mercy," afore prepared unto glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Why not? Theſe adorable perfections, certainly exiſt in perfect harmony and higheſt glory in the divine mind; they are both alike neceſſary to perfect government: their objects are totally and eſſentially different, ſo that there can be no claſhing, no interference in their exerciſe towards their reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive objects. The objects of final retributive juſtice, "veſſels

of wrath, &amp;c." are no more the objects of mercy in a ſtate of retribution, than the objects of mercy, "veſſels of mercy," are, at the ſame time, objects of punitive juſtice. There is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, no incredibility in the ſcripture doctrine of the future pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, in the nature of things, or deducible from the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and perfections of God. That ideal goodneſs, which ſuppoſes a difficulty and interference, is falſe, imaginary, irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and unſcriptural, and belongs not, in truth, to God. The ſame revelation which teacheth us "he is the rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him," aſſures us as peremptorily, "that to him vengeance belongeth, and that he will repay it to the diſobedient."</p>
               <p>This ſcripture doctrine, coincides and agrees intirely with our beſt conceptions of a wiſe, good and perfect government. In the 13th chapter to the Romans, Paul ſuggeſts to us the true idea of good government, as "ordained for good, to be a terror to evil doers, and a praiſe to them who do well:" not to give equal and undiſtinguiſhed happineſs to all, good and bad; which is directly contrary to the idea of good government ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted by him. Can we conceive a government infinitely good upon this apoſtolick plan, without infinite ſecurity and protection, accompanied with eternal rewards to them who do well? and eternal terror and puniſhment to the irreconcilable enemies of it? The goodneſs of government (conſtitutionally conſidered) very much conſiſts in the wiſdom, goodneſs and excellency of its laws and inſtitutions, in an inſeparable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection with the wiſdom and weight of its ſanctions. In the ſupreme government of God, in all other reſpects infinite in goodneſs, we rationally look for the moſt weighty and ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſanctions in nature, as beſt adapted for the greateſt good of government and the ſubjects of it. In proportion to the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and weight of the ſanctions, is the goodneſs of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Wherefore eternal ſanctions are ſo far from militating againſt the goodneſs of the divine government, that they are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to render it perfect in goodneſs, and are clear illuſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of infinite wiſdom and goodneſs.</p>
               <p>Laws are eſſential to government, and ſanctions eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to laws; without which they are not cloathed with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor veſted with the energy of laws; but ſink down into

ſimple rules of right and wrong. And reaſon dictates that the ſanctions ſhould be proportionate to the wiſdom, goodneſs and importance of the laws and government. Conſequently, in the government of the Moſt High, infinitely perfect and eternally important, where the honour of the Great King Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and the higheſt intereſts of innumerable millions of ſubjects to eternity are concerned and to be ſecured, the ſanctions muſt be the higheſt and moſt energetick in nature: "eternal life and eternal death." This doctrine is ſo intereſting, that we can have no conception of a government infinitely good and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, without it. We can have no idea of ſuch a government without retribution; nor without a full, final diſplay of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Neither can we have conception of ſuch a government, where the higheſt and ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt motives and ſanctions in nature are not employed in it. It is in theſe we ſee and read the infinite wiſdom, care and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence of God to his ſubjects, employing the ſtrongeſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives in nature to effect and ſecure their ſubjection, obedience and life, while he addreſſeth us with eternal life and eternal death, and that with an amazing Pathos—"turn and live; turn ye, turn ye, why will you die?" But where could we ſee his wiſdom and care for the honour of his immenſe majeſty and authority, the dignity of his government, and glory of his everlaſting kingdom, if unſupported with ſanctions, the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, ſtrongeſt and moſt energetick in nature i.e. eternal? Nor is ſuch a perfect government conceivable, where proviſion is not made in the conſtitution of it, for the eternal excluſion and exciſion of all the incurable and implacable enemies and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verters of it. That government muſt be very weak in wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ſecurity and energy, where no ſuch proviſion and power is found. To attribute it to the ſupreme government of the univerſe, is highly diſhonourable; it is to degrade and ſink it in wiſdom, dignity and power below the little ſtates and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of this world, where ſuch proviſion and power is found, and is eſſentially neceſſary to their ſecurity and welfare. And
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:019737_0041_0FACA432AAD4EF70"/>
if there be no ſanctions, threatnings and ſtatutes in the divine government, by the force of which all the wicked, implacable enemies of it will be forever cut off and conſigned to ſuch an everlaſting puniſhment, as to lay them under a diſability and impoſſibility of ever injuring or diſturbing the kingdom of God and the good ſubjects of it; then, it ſeems, in the nature of things, as they are by nature immortal, they may continue eternally the diſturbers of it, and there is no remedy of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt ſuch everlaſting evils. Can this be conſiſtent with any man's idea of a perfect government? St. Paul ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſts, that in the puniſhment of the wicked, "their everlaſting deſtruction," "they can trouble no more:" and ſuggeſts it as one thing which illuſtrates the righteouſneſs of it. 2 Theſ. 1. 6, 7, 8, 9 ver. in their connection.</p>
               <p>Further, ſuppoſe this neceſſary proviſion actually made in the conſtitution of God's government, and announced to the world, to the univerſe, by moſt peremptory ſtatutes and threatnings, which cut off the finally wicked from the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God and ſociety of the bleſſed, and conſign all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in the day of judgment to an everlaſting puniſhment; yet if it will be never executed in all it's terrors, or if both the promiſes and threatnings be not punctually fulfiled and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſo as clearly to illuſtrate the truth, grace, righteouſneſs, immutability and oath of God by which they are confirmed, it deſtroys the idea of righteous, perfect government. For in that way, the very rule of judgment, that every man ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive according to the deeds done in the body, is deſtroyed— the award to the wicked is not according to their deſerts, as held forth in the ſtatutes and threatnings—the fulfilment doth not correſpond with the declarations—and the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cannot anſwer the great ends of government deſigned. Suppoſe the capital ſtatutes in any of the governments of this world againſt traitors, robbers, murtherers, &amp;c. were, under the notion of lenity and benevolence, ſo to be ſuperceded in the execution, as that in no inſtance they ſhould be punctually executed in all their terrors; the laws and authority are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinged in their foundation, and all ſecurity to government and ſubjects deſtroyed.</p>

and ſtrongly confirmed by God in the exhibition he gives us of his own divine government. He hath declared this provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the conſtitution of it, for the final exciſion of all the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate enemies of it. He hath announced the ſtatutes by which they ſhall not enter and inherit his eternal kingdom; and his threatnings which conſign them to the everlaſting fire and puniſhment prepared for the devil and his angels. And he hath aſſured us, that this dreadful puniſhment ſhall be fully executed upon them in all it's terrors—"that the ungodly ſhall not ſtand in his judgment"—"that the wicked ſhall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, ſhall be deſtroyed forever"—"that their end is deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion" —"their end is to be burned"—"that they ſhall go away into everlaſting puniſhment, everlaſting deſtruction from his preſence—ſhall ſink as a millſtone into the ſea to riſe no more, and ſhall be tormented day and night forever and ever." He hath taught us clearly, that he will not ſettle the ſtates of his ſubjects for eternity in the way of abſolute ſovereignty, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by an act of univerſal grace, aſſigning all to happineſs, or by an arbitrary puniſhing any of his ſubjects, right or wrong, or beyond their deſerts; but the puniſhment will be accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the demerit and wages of ſin: and as righteous moral governor he will ſettle the ſtates of all his ſubjects by the laws and rules of his kingdom, in the way of retribution of rewards and puniſhments. He exhibits the preparations already made which doth inſure the full execution of this great deſign of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal retribution to all men, according to their character and works in this life. For the great day of judgment is appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſettle the great affairs of God's kingdom, and the States of all his moral ſubjects, in a governmental, judicial way, for eternity. The rule of everlaſting righteouſneſs, whereby the ſtates of mankind are to be finally determined, is expreſsly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us; "he that believeth ſhall be ſaved, he that believeth not ſhall be damned." "Every one ſhall receive (in ſentence and actual execution) according to the deeds done in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy," &amp;c. The Great Judge, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, and it is notified through the dominions of God. He is veſted with all-ſufficient powers for the great work: with all power in heaven and earth to govern the world and ſave his people—and with abſolute dominion over the world to come,

the inviſible and eternal world, to ſettle the ſtates of all in this and that world finally and for eternity: it is put in ſubjection to him for the great purpoſe of compleating the ſalvation of all his people, and the effectual ſubdual of his and their enemies. And in the execution of this great truſt, all enemies will in fact be moſt effectually put down under his feet, by an everlaſting ſentence, judgment and execution. And of this we are now notified to inforce the admonition, to take heed to the goſpel in this preſent life as our only ſeaſon of ſalvation, and warn us there is no poſſible eſcape to the neglectors of ſo great ſalvation. Heb. 2.1 to the 9th. He proceeds in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing verſes to ſhew we now ſee him accompliſhing his firſt work as a Saviour; by the grace of God opening a door of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to all men upon the ſame terms, by taſting death for every man, and by ſacrifice taking an effectual method to bring many ſons unto glory, even all who believe and obey him: and when he hath compleated his work as a Saviour, he will as ſurely compleat his work as a judge, in the final deſtruction of his enemies. This laſt point, is a point of ſuch great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to the kingdom of God, and to illuſtrate the power and glory of Chriſt in higheſt glory, and for the good of mankind, &amp;c. that it is brought up to view again and again on different occaſions: "For we ſhall all (friends and enemies) ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the judgment ſeat of Chriſt: for it is written, as I live, ſaith the Lord, every knee ſhall bow to me, and every tongue ſhall confeſs to God: ſo then every one of us ſhall give account of himſelf to God."<note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. 14. 10, 11, 12.</note> Again, "Wherefore God alſo hath high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name; that at or in the name (authority and power) of Jeſus every knee ſhould bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth, and that every tongue ſhould confeſs that Jeſus Chriſt is Lord (as rightful lawgiver, who hath given the righteous rule of judgment to the world, and righteous judge who renders in ſentence and execution righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous retribution to all) to the glory of the Father" who hath ordained him to this infinitely important office and truſt.
<note n="§" place="bottom">Univerſaliſts underſtand this ſubdual and ſubjection of all enemies to be in them "pious and voluntary;" and that Chriſt will deſtroy both firſt and ſecond death: conſequently the final "putting them all down under foot," muſt be (contrary to the natural ſtrong import of the phraſe) the ſaving and exalting them all to favour and happineſs. Their reaſons for this conſtruction we are yet to ſeek. Surely it cannot be from the uſe and force of the original word, ſubject; for it is uſed for all and every kind of regular, orderly, governmental ſubjection, whether pious or not, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint or willingly. It is uſed for the orderly ſubjection of inferiors to ſuperiors, in the whole circle of this relative duty, in this world; as of ſubjects to kings, governors and civil rulers—of wives to huſbands—of hearers to the miniſters of Chriſt—children to parents, and ſervants to maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; as may be ſeen by conſulting the original texts. No one will avow this ſubjection is always pious. True, they are bound to be obedient in the Lord, with a pious regard to God: but whether thus obedient or not, they are bound to this orderly ſubjection; and God has appointed puniſhments in this world to the rebellious. The civil magiſtrate doth not wear the ſword in vain, nor have parents and maſters their authority in vain, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to chaſtiſe the diſobedient. And beyond doubt the verb is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times uſed for a moſt unwilling and conſtrained ſubjection; as when the devils are ſaid to be ſubject to Chriſt and his diſciples. The ſeventy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from their miſſion and make report with joy, "Lord, even the devils are ſubject to us through thy name." Luke 10.17. Can any one imagine the devils were then converted into good beings, and this was a pious cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial ſubjection? If ſo, why doth our Lord tell them, v. 20, "Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in this rejoice not, that the ſpirits are ſubject unto you, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that your names are written in heaven." In the regulation of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the word ſubject is put for an authoritative, ordained, appointed ſubjection; and the execution, which is the legal effect and reſult of ſuch ſubjection, effected upon ſubjects, is their ſubdual and ſubjection, whether voluntary or by conſtraint. Thus all criminals are by authorative ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, put in ſubjection to the conſtituted judge or judges of every government: and when traitors and enemies are arrained, convicted, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and executed by the authority of ſuch judges, theſe criminals are then ſubdued, ſubjected to him who ſubjected them. They are effectually ſubjected and put down under foot to the authority of law and government. And this appears the plain meaning of the text. Chriſt is ſupreme Lord of all things, and the ordained judge of all the moral ſubjects of Jehovah, through all his dominions; and by a divine ordination and appointment now made, all the irreconcilable enemies of this great kingdom are put under him, his deciſion and diſpoſal, to be ſubdued, ſubjected and put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his feet—(of which the world are now notified by the predictions he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction given in this and the forcited texts is, that the authority, laws, and government of God, will finally be moſt compleatly eſtabliſhed over all: all muſt bow in a willing ſubjection to it in their ſtate of trial, or bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> in a ſubjection and ſubdual to and under it in a ſtate of righteous puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Nor can they infer their ſenſe of ſubjection, becauſe "the ſon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf will then be ſubject unto him that put all things under him." This ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection will no doubt be in the higheſt degree "voluntary:" but it is not the thing here intended: For in this ſenſe he was alway ſubject to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, always doing the will "and things that pleaſed him." The apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle points us to a ſubjection of a different kind, then new, which never before exiſted, but would remain to eternity, when God, the adorable trinity, would be "all in all." Neceſſity obliges us to underſtand this ſubjection to be by way of external regulation, order and arrangement, in reſpect to the adminiſtration of the great kingdom of Jehovah: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of weakening, it greatly ſtrengthens the ſenſe of ſubjection before no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the enemies. And our conſtruction ſeems confirmed beyond doubt, when it is conſidered that the whole paragraph relates intirely to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal regulation and arrangement in the divine adminiſtration, and not to any new acts of grace to be given or works to be done, for bringing in ſubjects into the kingdom of God. The characters of friends, that they are Chriſt's by pious ſubjection in this world, and characters of enemies are fixed for judgment. In that day, they that are Chriſt's ſhall have a glorious reſurrection to an immortal, everlaſting life; this is the main ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. Then, (at that grand period) ſays Paul, cometh the end—of what? of this world and the preſent adminiſtration of the kingdom of God—it will give place to an entire new regulation and arrangement; for Chriſt "ſhall deliver up the kingdom to God, even the Father." But miſtake not, it will not be, till he hath compleated his awful work upon his and his people's enemies: for they are already, by divine ordination and appointment, put in ſubjection to him; ſome, to be totally deſtroyed, and the reſt to be put under his feet. All inimical rule, authority and power ſhall be put down and deſtroyed, and the laſt enemy of his people, which ſhall totally be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, is natural death. The reſt, the moral enemies, ſhall be ſubdued, ſubjected and put under his feet, by righteous ſentence and execution, in a ſtate of deſerved puniſhment. This our opponants allow will be done in the day of judgment; and we read of but this one ſubdual and putting down all enemies under his feet; none other is intimated in the text or in the revelations of God. Then, When "he hath ſubdued them unto him," having compleated his work as Judge, and turned the key of the inviſible world, he hath in his hand, upon them: he will deliver it and the kingdom to God the Father—which will be followed with two new and grand <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments —the Son himſelf ſubject—and God all in ALL—in adminiſtration, to eternity. Their conſtruction of the word, "to internal pious diſpoſition of the enemies" being plainly againſt the whole ſcope of the paragraph, and the uſe of the word in every other part of it, can by no means be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. And this paragraph doth in the moſt deciſive manner deſtroy their ſcheme, by evincing the impoſſibility that their reſtoration ſhould ever take place after the day of judgment: becauſe the Saviour will then put off his character of Saviour and Judge, and give up the kingdom. To ſuppoſe, the ſecond death is one of the enemies of mankind he is appointed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy, and if he doth not do it, before the delivering up of the kingdom, he hath not compleated his work; appears one of the moſt wild imaginations that ever troubled the head of any man. The ſecond death is the righteous puniſhment, which God hath prepared and appointed for the enemies of mankind and his kingdom. He hath ordained Chriſt as his Judge to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign them to it. In this, conſiſts Chriſt'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

By inflicting this, all his enemies are eternally put under his feet: not by arbitrary, diſpotic power, but by moſt impartial juſtice and righteouſneſs, in way of retribution, in which truth and righteouſneſs, the authority and kingdom of God, will ſhine forth in eternal glory. Wherefore, to ſuppoſe Chriſt will not inflict this puniſhment, before he puts off the character of Judge, is in truth to ſuppoſe he puts off the character, before he hath done his work: or, to ſuppoſe him to deſtroy it, after it is inflicted, is to ſuppoſe him to give up his own victory and triumph to his enemies, than which what more extravagant? and the epithets poor and low, given to the common conſtruction, recoils back in full force, upon their own.</note>

And in a ſet diſcourſe, to ſhew forth the happy and glorious reſurrection of the righteous, this apoſtle brings it up to view again in a more clear and pointed manner, 1 Cor. 15.23, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8; "But every man in his own order; Chriſt the firſt fruits, afterward they that are Chriſt's at his coming. Then cometh the end, when he ſhall have delivered up the kingdom to God even the Father; when he ſhall have put down all rule, and all authority, and power. For he muſt reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet. The laſt enemy is death. For he hath put all enemies under his feet. But when he ſaith all things are put under him, it is manifeſt that he is excepted which did put all things under him.

What can be more evident at firſt view, than that "the coming of Chriſt to judgment," "the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection," "the end," "the delivering up the kingdom," "the ſubjection, ſubdual, and putting all the final enemies at his feet," "the Son himſelf being ſubject," "and God all in all," are all coeval, cotemporary events; all to take place in one and the ſame moſt memorable and infinitely important pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod?

Now that he will in fact put them down under his feet by righteous ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and execution in puniſhment in the day of judgment, they cannot deny: and it is expreſs in the laſt verſe, when they ſhall be ſubdued unto him (which will then have been effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) then the Son (delivering up the kingdom, putting off the character of Saviour and Judge) will be ſubject, and God be all in all, in adminiſtration to eternity.

Acts 3.21.<note n="‡" place="bottom">"Whom the heavens muſt receive, until the time of the reſtitution of all things, which God hath ſpoken by the mouth of all his prophets, ſince the world began." By reſtitution, here we underſtand Regulation, as the original word muſt be underſtood as applied to the miniſtry and work of John the Baptiſt, Mat. 17.11, 12. and Mark 9.12, 13. This text, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends Chriſt's perſonal appearance and coming; and the time of it is here aſcertained; it will not be, till the final regulation of all things. And it is fully implied, this is the deſign of his Coming and the work he will perfect. All things ſpoken of by the Prophets as preceeding this time, being accompliſhed, he will then make a full and final regulation, not only of ſome, but of All things at and in his Coming. Now, we know he will perſonally come a ſecond time at the end of the world, in the Great day of the reſurrection and final judgment. We have it from our Saviour, 25 Mat. and other places—from Paul and John and all the apoſtles. He will actually then, regulate all things in the great moral kingdom in way of retribution—deciding and ſettling the ſtates of all, good and bad—by puniſhing the wicked and rewarding the righteous.

to eternal reſt, ſecurity, happineſs and glory—Chriſt admired and glorified in the innumerable miriads of them who have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, now ſo compleatly redeemed and exalted in his ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion— the word of the Lord magnified above all his name— all the divine promiſes and threatnings perfectly fulfilled, and the oath of God confirming them, cleared—the character of God's government, the character and perfections of God and of Chriſt, as God-man, Saviour and Judge, illuſtrated in the higheſt poſſible glory—the everlaſting kingdom of God ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled and eſtabliſhed in eternal ſecurity, dignity and higheſt glory—God all in all—the kingdom, the power, and the glory is the Lord's—and glory to God in the higheſt is the grand reſult of the whole. This grand arrangement for eternity, gives us the cleareſt poſſible conceptions of an infinitely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect government, in final iſſue. And the preparations alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy made and revealed of God, enſure us the perfect accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of the whole.

In a word; that the righteous ſhould be as the wicked, and vice verſa, the friends and enemies of government ſhould fare alike, and be alike happy or miſerable, in a ſtate of final retribution, is moſt abhorrent and contrary to righteous and good government; and much more to one infinitely perfect. It is fundamentally ſubverſive of natural and revealed religion, and of all good go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of God or man; by a total deſtruction of the great principles and motives of piety and obedience. It is the very thing reprobated in the patriarch's plea, in a diſpenſation of divine retribution in this world, as incompatible with the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the righteous judge of the world. Gen. 18.25. "That be far from thee to do after this manner, to ſlay the righteous with the wicked; and that the righteous ſhould be as the wicked, that be far from thee: ſhall not the judge of all the earth do right?" In the common courſe of Providence, where characters are forming for judgment and retribution, it is very conſiſtent "that one event ſhould happen to the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and wicked;" but in this inſtance, God was about to ſettle accounts with the inhabitants of Sodom and Ghomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rha, finally for this world, and execution immediately to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the judgment in way of retribution, according to their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and works. On this turns the propriety and force of this plea: and on this ground father Abraham urges, "that the righteous ſhould be as the wicked," is incompatible with the character of the righteous judge of the world, and righteous judgment. The plea is good, the ſentiment altogether juſt and true. God anſwers the prayer, and confirms it to be ſo, in the retribution given. The guilty inhabitants of Sodom and Ghomorrha are forthwith deſtroyed, but righteous Lot and family are ſaved, And hereby God deſignedly gives clear inſtruction, and moſt forcible warning to the world, by way of example,<note n="†" place="bottom">Jude 7th.</note> that in the final retribution he will aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make an open, viſible, everlaſting diſtinction and difference between "the righteous and the wicked," "him that ſerveth
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:019737_0050_0FACA43A2D814EA8"/>
him, and him that ſerveth him not." Who ſhall avow it is incredible?</p>
               <p>God's kingdom is everlaſting; will ſtand and endure forever and ever: Surely the motives and ſanctions, to induce the ſubjects whoſe exiſtence will be commenſurate to the duration of it, to ſubjection and compliance with the terms of life, muſt likewiſe be eternal. Temporary rewards, or temporary pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments only, however great, are evidently altogether incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous in nature—unequal in dignity and importance, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adequate in energy to ſuch a kingdom and vaſt deſign. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon dictates they are no more adequate to the ſupport of ſuch a kingdom, than family diſcipline is to the ſupport of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt empires of this world. If they be not eternal, where is the energy of his adorable government to be found? where his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite wiſdom and goodneſs to be ſeen, in adapting and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning the means to the end? Sin, beyond doubt, is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt evil in the univerſe, and that alone which introduceth all the diſorder, calamity and miſery that ever was, now is, and ever will be found in it. It is highly rational to believe, that the infinitely wiſe God and Governor, in conducting an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely good and perfect government, will give his ſubjects clear and deciſive inſtructions of the danger, ill deſert, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal conſequences of ſin, to warn and guard them againſt it; and to ſecure their ſubjection and life. And this dictate of reaſon is fully confirmed by fact: For this was one of the firſt and cleareſt inſtructions given to man in innocency: "In the day thou eareſt thereof thou ſhalt ſurely die:" clearly teaching the ill demerit and penalty of tranſgreſſion to be an "eternal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion from life and bleſſedneſs. And what inſtructions of the evil of ſin can be more clear and deciſive than thoſe given in revelation? where the wages of ſin are denounced to be "death," contraſted with eternal life—where the puniſhment of it is ſet forth in ſtrongeſt language, in way of threatning, and by deſcription, literal and figurative, and by exemplifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to be eternal. How unreaſonable it is then to ſay, the doctrine is incredible, when clear and deciſive inſtruction and admonition of the evil and fatal conſequences of it, is the very thing which reaſon dictates us to look for and expect in a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation from God.</p>

In its nature it is a ſubverſion of the divine law and government, a contempt of infinite majeſty and authority; robs God of his glory, Chriſt of his purchaſe, and immortal ſouls of eternal life: and in the finally diſobedient, operates an eternal reproach to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, which cannot be removed but in their ſuffering a puniſhment fully adequate to the evil of it. Can a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary puniſhment be adequate? Who will avow it? We are ſinful and partial, finite and incompetent judges in a matter ſo much above us: we cannot comprehend the immenſity of the Divine Majeſty, the infinity of his authority and of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures obligations, the worth of eternal life in his favour, of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming blood and the great ſalvation contemned, the dignity of his government, the importance and glory of his everlaſting kingdom in all the arrangements, connexions and deſigns of it, nor any one principle of a deciſive judgment, whereupon we can poſſibly determine, by reaſon, that a temporary puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can be adequate to the evil of ſin: But to our beſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions the contrary is apparent. Wherefore, when God, the great Governor and Judge, who has perfect knowledge of it, denounces the wages of ſin is eternal death, it is perfectly credible; it is ſealed with infallibility. I wave the diſcuſſion of the ſubject of the infinite evil and ill demerit of ſin, becauſe it appears needleſs: it hath been maintained, by many writers, with arguments which have never been anſwered, and which, to me, appear unanſwerable.

This is eaſily ſaid: But where is the proof of it? It is not ſelf-evident, and we demand the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of it; they cannot prove it. The finite capacity of the creature is no proof; but the infinite inferiority and obligations of the finite creature, is one thing that renders the contempt of infinite Majeſty, and diſobedience to the infinite authority of our adorable Creator and ſupreme Lord, ſo infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely vile and heinous. Is not all ſin infinitely offenſive to God? the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination which his ſoul hateth? Who can deny it? If ſo, is it not becauſe there is an infinite evil and offence in it? Do not the finally impenitent and diſobedient practically ſtand in the juſtification of their iniquities? And may not the Supreme Judge of the world, juſtly bear an eternal teſtimony of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation againſt ſuch offences and hateful characters? Men, finite as their capacities are, may commit ſuch crimes againſt the ſtate as treaſon, robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, murther, &amp;c. for which they may juſtly be forever cut off (by capital execution) from the kingdoms and ſtates of this world: why then may they not commit ſuch crimes againſt God and his government, for which they may as righteouſly be eternally cut off and excluded the kingdom of God and the ſociety of the bleſſed, in a ſtate of puniſhment? For if the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of God, the dignity, neceſſity and excellence of his government, and the glory and importance of his kingdom, as far exceeds that of the ſtates and kingdoms of this world, as ſuch an eternal puniſhment exceeds their capital executions, which none can deny; then ſuch a puniſhment may be as wiſe, righteous and neceſſary in the divine government, as all allow thoſe to be which are executed by men: And the character of finite in the objection hath no weight in it. It is alſo objected, the tranſgreſſion of a moment, and of this ſhort life in this world, cannot deſerve an eternal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. The force of the objection lies in the ſhortneſs of the time which the criminal hath lived, and in which the crime was committed. But this circumſtance is comparatively of no weight in judging of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit of crimes. A young murtherer of twenty years old, muſt as certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuffer death, by the laws of God and man, as one of ſixty or eighty years old, although he hath not lived half the time: And one who kills inſtantly, as another who is a longer time in perpetrating murther. It is the malignity of crimes in their nature and tendency which doth deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine their ill demerit, and not the circumſtance of time. A robber com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits murther—he doeth it in an inſtant, by a blow, the thruſt of a ſword, or a ball from a piſtol through the head or heart: A treſpaſſer goes into his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour's orchard, robs his pear-tree of ſix or eight buſhels of excellent pears, it takes him ſome hours to ſhake off, gather up and carry away the pears, and compleat his treſpaſs—Can any one doubt which of theſe crimes is greateſt and deſerves the greater puniſhment? According to the objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the criminality and ill deſert of the treſpaſs exceeds that of the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by ſome hundreds of degrees, in proportion to the length of time in the perpetration of it: whereas by the common ſenſe and ſuffrage of all men, the murther is far the greater crime and deſerves a much ſeverer puniſhment; and their judgment is founded in the malignity of it, and in the nature and tendency of it. The circumſtance of time in the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of tranſgreſſion having but little weight with them. This well ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed judgment of men is weighty, but we might appeal to an infinitely greater authority to ſettle this point. No one ſuppoſes our firſt parents had lived long, or were long in the commiſſion of the great tranſgreſſion; "in eating the forbidden fruit:" and yet for this one tranſgreſſion, ſo circumſtanced in reſpect to time, ſin and miſery hath entered the world, a curſe is denounced upon the earth, and death intailed upon our firſt parents and their numerous poſterity in all ages to the end of the world. A convincing evidence as fact, that we can make no judgment of the malignity of ſin and puniſhment which a righteous God will inflict upon the finally diſobedient, "from this circumſtance of time," and the objection hath no ſolid weight in it, however it may ſerve to amuſe, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, and delude ſuperficial minds. If ſin hath not ſuch infinite evil and ill demerit in it, as to incur an eternal forfeiture of the favour of God and bleſſings of his kingdom, where is the neceſſity of the great propitiation and eternal redemption of Chriſt? And if it doth incur ſuch a forfeiture, the wicked may righteouſly be forever excluded the kingdom of God: and is not ſuch a puniſhment eternal? To purſue the tenet we oppoſe with one conſequence more. If in deſerves but a temporary puniſhment, then, it ſeems, when this puniſhment is endured, law and juſtice are ſatisfied, the priſon doors muſt be opened, the everlaſting chains knocked off, the priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſet at liberty under the protection of divine government. Whether they bow to the authority of it or not, upon this principle, they cannot be any longer holden; they muſt be ſet at liberty (altho' they have all their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity and implacability about them) to roam in the dominions of God, neither bleſſed nor curſed, belonging neither to heaven or hell, or any known place in the univerſe. Is this poſſible? what more contrary to reaſon, and the whole tenor of the revelation of God? the abſurdity of it, muſt be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt to all men. In what ever way we trace this tenet, the conſequential abſurdities of it meet us and ſtare us in the face.</note> we may reſt in it as decided. I ſhall only ſuggeſt two things more to evince the credibility of the infinite ill demerit of ſin, and the everlaſting puniſhment of it in the finally diſobedient. One is, that a temporary puniſhment is inadequate, inſufficient, and cannot
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:019737_0052_0FACA43BA869EE98"/>
anſwer the purpoſe of a final, capital puniſhment in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God. It hath been already noted, "that temporary ſanctions and motives are altogether incongruous in nature, unequal in dignity and importance, and inadequate in energy, to the nature and ſupport of an everlaſting kingdom, and to the deſign of illuſtrating an infinitely perfect government. We add, a temporary, finite puniſhment only, of the finally diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:019737_0053_0FACA43C72D64840"/>
cannot illuſtrate the character of God and his perfect government, in higheſt glory. For ſuch a puniſhment cannot illuſtrate his immenſe Majeſty, his infinite authority, the infinite dignity and importance of his government, together with his infinite holineſs, juſtice and hatred of ſin: nor finally, can it ſupport and eſtabliſh the ſecurity, peace, dignity, honour and authority of his government, as fully and effectually as though their crimes had never been committed; "the important end of all final, capital puniſhment." This might be illuſtrated ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ways—one inſtance is ſufficient to evince it. If ſin de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves only a temporary puniſhment, and no more juſtly can, or ever will be inflicted, then it ſeems the everlaſting kingdom of the Moſt High, can never be ſettled and eſtabliſhed in a ſtate of eternal tranquility, ſecurity and peace, in infinite dignity and glory, by any puniſhment that can be inflicted on the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:019737_0054_0FACA43D2BFC0668"/>
of it. For no temporary puniſhment, however extreme and of long continuance, can change the hearts and nature of the wicked, into good ſubjects; and after the devil and his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and the finally impenitent from this world, have endured their temporary puniſhment, and all that (upon this principle) can be inflicted, they may remain the inveterate enemies and diſturbers of it, throughout their immortal exiſtence. The end of final capital puniſhment is totally defeated. And is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that ſuch neceſſity ſhould ariſe from the nature of things, or the conſtitution of the divine government, that the Moſt High muſt (in an ungovernmental manner, againſt the plain language of his revealed conſtitution) either convert his implacable ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies into good beings, or annihilate them, or never ſettle his great kingdom in eternal peace, ſecurity, dignity and glory? This whole reſult and concluſion, is ſo abhorrent and repugnant to the ſupreme, ſovereign, uncontroulable and infinitely perfect dominion of God, dictated to us by reaſon and the revelation of God, as ſhews the principle that inferrs it, to be abſurd and impoſſible to be true. Whereas that puniſhment which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite in the nature of things to anſwer not only thoſe ends forementioned, but all the wiſe ends of the divine go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and to the final eſtabliſhment of it in eternal ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, peace, dignity and glory, muſt be wiſe, holy, juſt and good; and the execution of it, upon the implacable enemies of it, muſt be highly neceſſary and important. A temporary puniſhment we have ſeen, is wholly inadequate and inſufficient—that alone which is eternal, can and will do it; and therefore is credible. Which leads to the other particular to evince the credibility of this doctrine, viz. God hath deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly taught us "the infinite ill demerit of ſin in the everlaſting puniſhment, which he hath denounced againſt the diſobedient. Capital ſtatutes and ſanctions (in the reaſon &amp; nature of things) ought to be clear and determinate, both in reſpect to thoſe who are made liable to the penalty—and in the proportioning the penalty to the demerit of crimes. In this is diſplayed the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, righteouſneſs and goodneſs of government. Thoſe from heaven are perfect and without ambiguity: theſe ſtatutes, ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and threatnings are deſigned to teach men the evil, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity and ill deſert of the crimes; as well as the certainty of
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:019737_0055_0FACA43DEA272EF8"/>
the puniſhment annexed, upon tranſgreſſion and conviction. They do not ſpeak in ſuch ambiguous language, they ſhall endure ſuch puniſhment whether right or wrong, whether pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned to or beyond the demerit of the crimes, which would be to eſtabliſh iniquity by law. But in the declaration of the puniſhment, we have deſignedly ſet forth the ill demerit of the crimes which ſubject to it, to warn and guard againſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of them. And when executed, it is, among other ends of government, that others ſeeing the great wickedneſs and great puniſhment of them "may hear and fear and do no more ſo wickedly." Men may err in affixing puniſhment to crimes, but the Judge of all the earth cannot. Wherefore when he denounceth, the wages of ſin is eternal death, and that he will puniſh the diſobedient with everlaſting deſtruction—he doth deſignedly teach us, that in his unerring judgment, ſuch is the evil, malignity and ill demerit of ſin, that it doth as righteouſly deſerve eternal death—as wages is due to the labourer; and that he to whom vengeance belongeth, will ſurely repay it to the finally diſobedient. And theſe truths in connection, he teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us in a way moſt ſuitable to his immenſe wiſdom, majeſty and authority, and to the wiſe and great ends of his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. When, acting in character, as ſupreme law-giver and judge of the world, he denounceth this tremendous puniſhment as the juſt wages of ſin, to the workers of iniquity. And theſe inſtructions and admonitions coming from ſuch infallible, infinite authority, are deſigned to convey the conviction and belief both of this ill demerit and puniſhment of ſin, with deep ſenſibility and energy to the hearts and conſciences of men; to reſtrain from wickedneſs and awaken them to repentance and life. Surely, theſe inſtructions ſo given, are moſt highly credible, upon the ground of ſuch authority only, if the ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing objections to our feeble reaſon and underſtanding were thouſand times ſtronger, than they, are made to appear. For no truth is more ſelf-evident, than "that the declarations of the God of truth, muſt be true." In the reaſon of the thing, this muſt conclude us, it ſuperſedes and precludes all cavils and objections. To judge a priori, or any other ways, and ſtand upon our own reaſon againſt the authority of the univerſe—to ſay it is incredible, exceeds all belief—what is it? but to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:019737_0056_0FACA43EA7D4F5E0"/>
our underſtanding, reaſon and erroneous judgment, to the ſupreme wiſdom, unerring, infallible judgment of God, deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively given upon the ſame matter, in his authorative declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And what purpoſe can it ſerve? but to prevent the efficacy and defeat the wiſe, great and ſalutary deſigns, for which they are given to men in this world. Is this rational, reſpectful, dutiful? will it ſtand before the bar of reaſon or the tribunal of God? is not this, to make ourſelves judges of the law, rather than the obediential receivers and improvers of it, as is deſigned? The ſum of the whole is, there doth not appear a circumſtance of incredibility attending the great chriſtian doctrine of everlaſting rewards and puniſhments, when viewed and conſidered in its true connection. And I am full in the ſentiment, that divine revelation is far eaſier and more ſtrongly to be defended with this doctrine, than without it. The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime end of creation and moral government as taught us, by revelation—the rational and immortal nature wherewith we are endowed—the nature of things in a variety of views—the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and perfections of God and of his government, infinitely wiſe, holy, juſt, good and perfect—the property of his kingdom as everlaſting—the ill-demerit of ſin—the neceſſity and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of ſuch a puniſhment to his enemies, to illuſtrate the character of God, of Chriſt, and of the divine government, and the doctrine of redemption in higheſt glory—and to eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the authority and ſettle the everlaſting kingdom of God, in eternal ſecurity and peace, in higheſt dignity, perfection and glory, accompanied with the higheſt poſſible ſecurity and happineſs to all his holy, faithful ſubjects—and the cleareſt exhibition of the kingdom, power, and glory as the Lord's. Theſe in connection do indicate the doctrine highly credible, worthy of all acceptation and our firmeſt belief. Whereas, a revelation from God containing matters of ſuch infinite mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and eternal importance to the kingdom of God and his ſubjects, as the chriſtian revelation doeth; if the credit, laws and authority of it were unſupported; and the terms of life addreſſed to us in it, were uninforced, with the higheſt ſanctions in nature, in the univerſe—eternal life and eternal death, it would be very incredible. The ſanctions being unſuitable to his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe wiſdom, majeſty and authority; to the dignity of his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:019737_0057_0FACA43F699ED8A0"/>
and importance of his everlaſting kingdom—and as means, inadequate to the all-important deſign of ſuch a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. Wherefore, never a doctrine came from the eternal fountain of light and truth, more credible or important to us, than that we have from the higheſt authority in heaven and earth—the Saviour himſelf—he that believeth ſhall be ſaved,— but he who believeth not ſhall be damned." The chriſtian, it ſeems, needeth not to have any uneaſy apprehenſions; from all the arguments and inſinuations of Deiſt, ſocinians and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaliſts which can be brought out of the dark cell of ſcepticiſm and infidelity, againſt the credibility, of the chriſtian doctrine, of the everlaſting deſtruction of the finally diſobedient."</p>

               <p>There are two particulars of this future puniſhment clearly held forth in the text, which lead directly to our main ſubject, viz.—"it will be continual and endleſs"—"it is the ſame puniſhment prepared for the devil and his angels, and to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured by the wicked throughout the ſame duration with theirs, which we know to be eternal." A puniſhment not only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme in degree, and as hopeleſs of reſtitution and deliverance as the being caſt into a lake of fire and brimſtone, but alſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſing, perpetual and eternal. For what words can expreſs it ſtronger than the text; "and ſhall be tormented day and night forever and ever." Theſe are among the higheſt and ſtrongeſt expreſſions of eternity to be found in the book of God. And it is to be noted, that the phraſe "forever and ever," is never once applied to deſtruction but to denote it to be perpetual— as excluſive of all idea and hope of reſtoration. So it is appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the prophet to denote a perpetual deſtruction. Iſai. 34.10. "It ſhall not be quenched night nor day, the ſmoke there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſhall go up forever: from generation to generation it ſhall lie waſte; none ſhall paſs through it forever and ever." And ſo it is applied to the deſtruction of the enemies of the chriſtian church. Rev. 19.3. "And her ſmoke rofe up forever and ever." And that perſonal ſufferings are deſigned, ſeems evident from the parallel diſcription, chap. 14.11.
<q>and the ſmoke of their torment aſcendeth forever and ever.</q>
Wherefore, to thoſe who ſuffer the future puniſhment, there will be no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation and ceſſation of exiſtence—no deliverence—no ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation nor end to their torment and miſery. This muſt be the meaning, the doctrine deſignedly taught by the ſpirit of truth in our text, when, in a literal diſcription of it, he aſſures us "they ſhall be tormented day and night forever and ever."</p>
               <p>But in direct oppoſition to it, the Univerſaliſts maintain; ſome, that there will be no future puniſhment to the wicked; others, that there will be an end and a reſtitution of all the wicked to the heavenly happineſs, in ſome future period; after long and dreadful ſufferings in hell.</p>

               <p n="3">3dly. It is further confirmed by the conſtitution of nature, which connects ſin and miſery together, and will make the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally wicked neceſſarily miſerable, as long as they have exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, unleſs this conſtitution be annulled or ſuperſeded by the grace of God, the author of it; which, by many declarations, he aſſures us ſhall never be.</p>
               <p n="4">4thly. It is abundantly confirmed by and throughout the whole conſtitution of the goſpel.</p>
               <p n="5">5thly. The doctrine of the future puniſhment we maintain, in oppoſition to theirs, was fully believed by the Jewiſh and Chriſtian church, and by their inſpired teachers.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, The doctrine of the laſt, the eternal judgment, ſet forth in the word of God, and particularly by our Saviour and his apoſtles, is deciſive of this controverſy: "That the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and puniſhment of the wicked will be eternal."</p>
               <p>In the firſt place—When we attend to the manner in which this doctine is revealed, we ſee "the tenor of all the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and all deſcriptions of the future puniſhment of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtrongly import it hopeleſs of reſtitution, unlimited and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs as their exiſtence."</p>
               <p>The firſt threatning in the book of God, denouncing the puniſhment of ſin in theſe words, "in the day that thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt ſurely die,"<note n="*" place="bottom">Gen. 2.17. Heb. dying thou ſhalt die.</note> imports an eternal excluſion from life and bleſſedneſs in miſery as laſting as their exiſtence. Death being directly oppoſed to life and happineſs, this muſt be the imported puniſhment upon every conſtruction of it. This puniſhment is ſurely the juſt wages of ſin, and certainly to be executed upon the diſobedient in a ſtate of retribution,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:019737_0060_0FACA441AF609DC8"/>
or it would not have been threatned by a God of truth and juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. This is the awful ſanction to ſupport the law, authority and government of God, over all the moral world, and in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conſtitution of his government. We rationally conclude it of the conſtitution of angels, becauſe this is the puniſhment to which the apoſtate angels are conſigned in a ſtate of retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution. We ſee it was the awful ſanction of the conſtitution of man in innocency; and we ſhall ſoon ſee it to be the ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the divine government to mankind under a diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mercy. If this puniſhment is the juſt demerit of ſin, and a wiſe and neceſſary ſanction of the moral government of God, it is a diſhonourable reflection on the wiſdom, holineſs, truth and juſtice of God to ſuppoſe a leſs puniſhment will ever be denounced or executed upon the wicked in a ſtate of retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution. And if this ſanction was wiſe and neceſſary to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in a ſtate of rectitude, ſurely, it cannot be leſs wiſe and neceſſary to them in a ſtate of degeneracy and corruption: but "as the law was made for the lawleſs, and added becauſe of tranſgreſſions," ſo we rationally conclude, that this puniſhment to the wicked in a ſtate of retribution, will be held up to a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing world in clear, full, deciſive language, of the ſame aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful import with the firſt threatning; "hopeleſs of eternal life and bleſſedneſs, and their miſery as laſting as their exiſtence." And the revelations of God do abundantly confirm this dictate of reaſon; aſſuring us this eternal death as contraſted with eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, is "the wages of ſin," <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. 6. ult.</note> as juſtly the demerit of ſin, as the wages due to a labourer, and ſurely "to be repayed" in a ſtate of retribution. <note n="†" place="bottom">Deut. 7.10.</note> It is to be noted, this future puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is conſtantly repreſented as "without limitation or end." It is ſaid of the wicked, "they ſhall be accurſed and ſeparated to evil" <note n="‡" place="bottom">Deut. 29.20, 21.</note> or miſery—"are appointed to wrath"—"ſhall be turned into hell." <note n="‖" place="bottom">Pſal. 9.17.</note> Repeatedly, "that they ſhall be caſt out into outer darkneſs, where is weeping, wailing and gnaſhing of teeth"—ſhall be "caſt into the lake of fire which is the ſecond death"—conſigned to this ſtate of puniſhment without any li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation or end put to it. And it is to be further obſerved, that this puniſhment is commonly repreſented in terms directly oppoſite and excluſive of life and bleſſedneſs; as death, the
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:019737_0061_0FACA4426E40ED58"/>
ſecond death, deſtruction, perdition, damnation, &amp;c. The deſtruction and death of the wicked is directly oppoſed to their life and bleſſedneſs—the perdition, utter ruin of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly is hopeleſs of a reſtoration or reſtitution to life and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs —the damnation of hell is directly and fully contraſted with the goſpel ſalvation and enjoyment of eternal life—and this puniſhment, in every form of repreſentation, announced by the ſpirit of truth without any limitation, period or end. If there be any period to it, if any limitation or termination of it, let them who aſſume it for truth ſhew it; it belongs to them who aſſert it to ſhew it. It is impoſſible—they give up the cauſe, by telling us "their pain will be unutterable and for a long duration—(God only knows how long.")<note n="*" place="bottom">See Salvation for all men, p. 24.</note> This is a plain, full conceſſion, that God, who only can bound it, has declared no limitation, puts no period to it. How preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous then, for man to ſay there will be an end to it? For what is the plain import of a puniſhment without limitation, in the conſtruction of reaſon and common ſenſe? If a criminal among men is ſentenced to impriſonment for one or ſix months, for three or ſeven years, he and we know the period: or if it be during pleaſure, there is a hope of relief, and means for it may be uſed: but if the conſignment be unlimited, without day, it is deciſively for life or during his exiſtence in this world, in the common acceptation of all mankind. By this rule then, as the future puniſhment of the wicked is conſtantly and uniformly (in every form and deſcription of it) repreſented to us without limitation, period or end, it ſtrongly and deciſively imports it to be as durable and laſting as their exiſtence and immortality. And this conſtruction is confirmed "by the key of doctrine St. Paul gives us, for a ſure and deciſive interpretation of the things of the future and inviſible world." It is in thoſe words 2 Cor. 4.18. "For the things which are ſeen are temporal, (are tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary and will have an end) but the things which are not ſeen (in the future world of which he is ſpeaking) are eternal;" without a ſingle exception, and will have no end. Paul was bred a Phariſee, early imbibed the doctrine of the Phariſees and of the Jewiſh church, who (except the Sadducees who were a ſort of infidels) uniformly believed the doctrine of the
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:019737_0062_0FACA443293A5628"/>
exiſtence of angels and devils—of the ſpirits of mankind both good and bad in a future ſtate—and that they were all immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, their exiſtence without end. They believed God to be the rewarder of them who diligently ſeek him, and the aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the wicked: and in connexion herewith, they believed the future inviſible world to be a ſtate of rewards and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments —they believed a heaven and hell—that the rewards of the righteous in heaven would be eternal, and the puniſhment of the wicked in hell would likewiſe be eternal. And this was the reaſon why the Phariſees with all their carping diſpoſition, never once objected to the doctrine of our Saviour, when he ſo clearly, plainly and repeatedly taught the doctrine of the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting puniſhment of the wicked, and in a manner ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly galling to them. They could not do it, becauſe it was their own profeſſed faith, and that of the Jewiſh church. Nor doth Paul, when converted to the faith of Chriſt, alter a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle article in this creed; for in theſe great doctrines of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the faith of the Jewiſh and Chriſtian church is one. Paul, a chriſtian and an inſpired apoſtle, teaches the church and world, "that the things of the future and inviſible world, are all (without diſtinction or a ſingle exception) eternal." Then heaven and hell are ſo—then the character, ſtate and bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the righteous in that world is fixed and eternal— and likewiſe the character, ſtate and puniſhment of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that world is fixed and eternal. And this key of inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ought to be deciſive with chriſtians of all generations. Eſpecially, as there is not a ſingle inſtance in all revelation of a period put to any of the things of the inviſible ſtate, which the apoſtle announces to the world, are all "eternal." How unſcriptural and abſurd their notion of a next ſtate, as tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary, when it is directly excluded and conſuted by this rule of inſpiration. Is this puniſhment commonly repreſented in terms, which of their own force imply an eternal excluſion from life and bleſſedneſs in miſery, as laſting as their exiſtence? and always ſet forth without limitation or end? doth reaſon teach us that ſuch a repreſentation of it, imports it to be as durable and laſting as their exiſtence? and is it aſcertained by the rule of inſpiration before us, that it will be eternal? this ought to conclude our belief of it, as the truth of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="unknown:019737_0063_0FACA443EC8D0780"/>We add, this conſtruction ſeems further confirmed, by the doctrine of reſtitution as taught us by inſpiration. For where reſtitution from threatned deſtruction is deſigned, the hope of it is uſually ſet forth and accompanies, or is annexed to the repreſentation of the judgment and deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and is taught with clearneſs according to its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, by the ſpirit of inſpiration. There is a perfection in all God's works: a wiſdom and perfection in the manner as well as matter of divine revelation. We therefore rationally expect, a ſimilarity in the repreſentation of the ſame kind of ſubjects. "Where deſtruction is denounced but reſtitution is deſigned, we find the hope of it, uſually accompanies it." And the wiſdom and importance of this mode of inſtruction, is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious: "that the Lord may be enquired of, to do it for them," &amp;c. Thus, deſtruction is denounced againſt Moab, but with a hope God would not make an end. And the deſcription of the judgment cloſes,—"yet will I bring again the captivity of Moab in the latter days, ſaith the Lord," Jer. 43.47. When deſtruction is denounced but reſtitution is deſigned, frequently the preciſe period of the deſtruction and of the commencement of the reſtitution is fixed: and ſometimes the inſtrument, means and circumſtances of it, are deſcribed. Seventy years, Tyre ſhall be deſolate and forgotten: and at the end of ſeventy years her viſitation and reſtitution is announced by the prophet, Iſa. 23.15, 16, 17, 18. Every one knows, the period of the jewiſh deſtruction and captivity in Babylon was fixed, at ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years: with repeated declarations, God would not make a full end, would correct them in meaſure; and accompanied with many and ſtrong aſſurances of their reſtitution: the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument and means of it deſcribed by the hand and procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Cyrus.</p>
               <p>In the judgment and deſolation denounced upon Egypt, the period of it is fixed at forty years. The circumſtances of its reſtitution are deſcribed, with its diſtinguiſhing character (a baſe, low, the baſeſt of all kingdoms) fixed for ages. Ezek. 29.13, 14, 15, 16. The prediction of the deſtruction of this once great kingdom, and reſtitution of this low, baſe kingdom, was of importance to "remind and ſhame Iſrael for their folly and wickedneſs in withdrawing their truſt from God, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing

But this and the other reſtitutions which have been mentioned, are comparitively of no moment to the great reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of all the damned in hell they tell of: therefore, if this laſt be a doctrine of inſpiration, we rationally expect at leaſt as clear, particular, deciſive and circumſtantial a deſcription of it. Surely the high importance of it beſpeaks it. Can we find it? In the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ited inſtances, the people concerned and others, have not to go "to prophetic, figurative deſcriptions and univerſal terms belonging entirely to other ſubjects, and not to the doctrine of their deſtruction, to find their hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution: No, they and we find their hope of reſtitution at hand, as accompanying the deſcription of their puniſhment, or annexed to it. Here then, by the rule and method of inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, we expect to find their doctrine of future reſtitution, if any where. Do any of the inſpired writers ſet a period to the future puniſhment? Do they annex a hope of reſtitution to any one of their deſcriptions of it? Do they tell us the author, the means, or a ſingle ſyllable of a circumſtance about it? no, there is a perfect ſilence reigns through the ſcripture as to this doctrine: and all the deſcriptions of that puniſhment are deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively without limitation, period or end. Their doctrine of reſtitution, is then an unſcriptural, groundleſs, hopeleſs deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The inſpired writers put no period to the future puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: they annex no hope of reſtitution to them who periſh in it. We infer, they had no commiſſion from heaven to do it, or certainly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>th ever had or now hath commiſſion from God to teach ſuch a doctrine: they prophecy the deceit of their own hearts, or the inſtigation of the wicked one. To proceed, we find the true doctrine of reſtitution taught with great clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and oft repetitions according to the importance of it. Thus the reſtitution of the Jews from their captivity in Babylon, is taught with great clearneſs and oft repetitions, by the prophets Iſaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel. Almoſt whole chapters are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up by the prophet Jeremiah in the moſt ſtrong, literal and figurative deſcriptions and aſſurances of it; as 24th and others.
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:019737_0065_0FACA4456A9978C8"/>
And that great reſtoration to take place before the end of the world, in the final, general call of the Jews and Gentile nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons into the kingdom of God, is a grand ſubject of revelation, taught by Moſes and the prophets, our Saviour and his apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles: it is very often repeated by the prophets, taught by our Saviour in his parables: and it is obſervable he gives to the Jews their hope of the reſtoration of their nation and the time of it, in his denunciation of their deſtruction and that of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem. Luke 21.24. As Paul doth likewiſe in the 11th to the Rom. 25, making the call of the Jews and Gentiles coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, cotemporary events.</p>
               <p>Moreover, when theſe moſt illuſtrious works of divine grace ſhall be wrought in our world, illuſtrating the grace of God and the honour of the Saviour in great glory, and in which the happineſs of millions and millions and all the nations of the earth are concerned, in the ingathering of the fullneſs of Jews and of Gentiles in the millenium ſtate; we find this reſtitution deſcribed and exhibited according to the importance of it, in the moſt lively, bold, ſtrong, literal and figurative deſcriptions humane language is capable of—"by the binding of ſatan" —"the reigning of Chriſt a thouſand years"—"by a new hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and a new earth" &amp;c. &amp;c. and heaven and earth called to rejoice in it. It is a divine reality, and will be accompanied with very great rejoicings in heaven and earth.</p>
               <p>Now<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if the doctrine of the reſtitution of all the damned in hell, was a divine reality, and a doctrine of ſuch glory as is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, "the very glory of the goſpel;" we rationally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude we ſhould have had it as clearly ſtate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as oft repeated, and ſet forth with equal ſolemnity, pomp and energy of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; that heaven, earth and hell would ring with the tidings: and hell indeed would be no more hell, that place of weeping, wailing and torment it is conſtantly repreſented to be, but a place of the greateſt mercy and joy. Do we find it ſo? Not a ſingle ſyllable of any deliverance out of it, and nothing of a deſcription anſwerable to the great importance of it, if there was any truth in it. Contrary wiſe, hell is conſtantly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as a place or ſtate of wrath without mercy—of torment without joy—and where the conſigned to it, "ſhall be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented day and night forever and ever." And can there be a
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:019737_0066_0FACA44629FC69C0"/>
more manifeſt, barefaced deluſion than their doctrine is? One inſtance more upon the doctrine of reſtitution. Natural death is a great deſtruction—it is univerſal to mankind; but reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is deſigned. It is included in the firſt promiſe after the apoſtacy, before the ſentence was paſſed. And the doctrine of the reſurrection runs through the revelations of God. We know the period of death's reign and of the commencement of the reſurrection is fixed. When the laſt trumpet ſhall found, the great day of the reſurrection ſhall commence. We know the moſt important circumſtances of the reſurrection, both of the juſt and unjuſt. The bodies of the righteous ſhall ariſe ſpiritual, powerful, glorious, immortal in an everlaſting life: but the wicked ſhall ariſe to everlaſting ſhame, contempt and damnation. Theſe are inſtances and illuſtrations of the true ſcripture doctrine of reſtitution. Is their's like it? In no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, in no one important circumſtance. It is no more like it than the deluſions of ſatan commonly are to the truths of God. If therefore we make the ſcripture doctrine of reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our rule in judging upon the ſubject, (and we have none other, their doctrine being oppoſite to the method in which the true doctrine is conſtantly revealed, there being no hope of ſuch reſtitution accompanying or annexed to any one deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the future puniſhment, and not a ſingle deſcription of it, much leſs with a clearneſs, repetition, ſolemnity and energy an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to its importance) we muſt judge it an incredible and moſt pernicious deluſion. And we ſhall ſee it every way ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, confuted, and reprobated in ſcripture before we have done with the ſubject.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, in as much as the future puniſhment is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſented in terms oppoſite and excluſive of life and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs, and in every deſcription of it without limitation or end, by the conſtruction of reaſon—the expreſs rule of the apoſtle, and the ſcripture doctrine of reſtitution itſelf; it is ſtrongly imported, to be without end, without hope and eternal.</p>
               <p>It is to be remembered, that this puniſhment is not only thus ſtrongly imported, in every deſcription, but it is alſo purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, expreſsly, repeatedly, literally taught and aſſerted to be eternal; in terms, words and phraſes emphatically expreſſive of eternity. Thus we are taught, that the wicked "ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed

In theſe and parallel texts we are deſignedly taught the duration of their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment in a literal deſcription of it. It is "forever," "ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting," "and forever and ever;" and this laſt phraſe "fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and ever" is emphatically expreſſive of eternity as appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to God, to denote and deſcribe the eternity of his exiſtence, of his attributes, of his throne and kingdom, &amp;c. and as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptive of his ſaints everlaſting happineſs: and no leſs em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatical as deſcriptive of the endleſs puniſhment of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: it being never applied to deſtruction but to denote it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual, as excluſive of all idea and hope of deliverance or reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as before noted. Can there be a more certain rule to fix the meaning of a phraſe, than the perpetual, unvaried uſe of it throughout inſpiration? If this will not do it, it ſeems impoſſible to be done. And it is obſervable, that the very fame words and phraſeology is uſed to expreſs the perpetual, unceaſing and eternal duration of the glory and happineſs of the righteous and of the puniſhment of the wicked: as in the ſentence of the laſt judgment, and the phraſeology in the text "day and night forever and ever." <note n="§" place="bottom">See Mat. 25. Rev. 7.15, 16, 17. and Rev. 22.5.</note> This is the higheſt, ſtrongeſt, and moſt emphatic, literal deſcription given us of the eternity of the one, and the other, and of both alike. And can this be without deſign? Now when the duration of this future puniſhment, is thus expreſsly, deſignedly and literally taught us and aſſerted to be eternal, in words, terms and phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes emphatically expreſſive of eternity, to ſay the duration of it is not determinately and deciſively fixed, appears preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and impious.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the figurative deſcriptions of this puniſhment are equally ſtrong, emphatical and deciſive of it as hopeleſs of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution and of endleſs duration. What figurative deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons can exhibit a ſtate hopeleſs of reſtitution with ſtronger force and beyond that of putrid bad fiſh, caſt away for putrefaction; is there any hope of their recovery for uſe? or that of a criminal,
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:019737_0068_0FACA447BA3F0A90"/>
mercileſs debtor, who owes ten thouſand talents, and has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to pay; caſt into priſon, and his impriſonment to continue until he hath paid the laſt farthing, the laſt mite? or that of a man not having on the wedding garment, bound hand and foot and caſt out of the kingdom of God, into outer darkneſs? muſt not his caſe be abſolutely deſperate thus deprived of all means, "caſt out of the kingdom and bound hand and foot too?" Theſe are figurative deſcriptions of their hopeleſs ſtate, given by our Lord himſelf. Alike ſtrong are thoſe others given by inſpiration, of their being conſigned to the blackneſs of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs forever—of their being caſt by the juſtice and power of God for puniſhment, into a lake of fire and brimſtone. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deſcription moſt pointedly ſhewing it, hopeleſs of deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and reſtitution; becauſe infinitely above and beyond the reach of means and power in all the creation. And the figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative deſcriptions are equally emphatical and deciſive of the endleſs duration of it. It is ſet forth by devouring fire, that ſhall devour the adverſaries—by eternal fire—everlaſting burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; emphatically the everlaſting fire prepared for the devil and his angels. And if poſſible yet more ſtrongly, by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable fire, that in the principle of it cannot be quenched; "a fire that ſhall never be quenched"—"a worm that dieth not, and a fire that is not quenched." Our Lord has taught us in the 25th of Matthew, what he means by this fire, the fire of hell. In the 41ſt verſe he tells us, the wicked ſhall depart into everlaſting fire prepared for the devil and his angels. And in the laſt verſe he tells us his meaning without a figure, literal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, "they ſhall go away into everlaſting puniſhment." By this key therefore, by unquenchable fire he muſt mean literal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly "endleſs puniſhment"—"by the worm that dieth not, and a fire that is not quenched, a fire that ſhall never be quenched," he muſt mean a puniſhment that hath not and never ſhall have an end. It is ſet forth by fire, to denote the extremity of it; and by unquenchable, that is not quenched, ſhall never be quenched, moſt ſtrongly to denote the eternity of it. The fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurative terms in which it is expreſſed, will admit of no other conſiſtent, literal conſtruction, according to the key which he hath given us. And it is obſervable, that our Lord teacheth this endleſs puniſhment with great ſolemnity, over and over
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:019737_0069_0FACA4487264B9F0"/>
again, as contraſted with the enjoyment of eternal life and the inheriting the kingdom of God (in theſe figurative deſcriptions of it) as of very great importance to be moſt firmly believed and realized; in Mark 9.43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48. In each de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription the being caſt into hell—into hell fire, is contraſted with the entering into life or the kingdom of God: and the impoſſibility of the latter, is ſtrongly held forth in the endleſs duration of this puniſhment: denoted by unquenchable fire, a fire that ſhall never be quenched, a worm that dieth not and a fire that is not quenched; <note n="§" place="bottom">To ſay this declaration of Chriſt, ſo oft and ſolemnly repeated, can prove no more "than that the torments of the wicked ſhall laſt as long as their next ſtate of exiſtence laſteth, without determining how long that ſhall be," is to evade and gloſs away the very ſpirit of the text, and avails not; becauſe the Jews and diſciples knew and believed in no other next ſtate, but that which is eternal; and the words are moſt forcibly deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of an eternal puniſhment: and therefore in no other ſenſe could it be taken by them, or deſigned by our Lord. Neither doth it any more avail to ſay, "that the words are taken from the prophecy of Iſaiah," and allude to the puniſhment of burning dead bodies, or permitting them to lie above ground to be deſtroyed of worms—and "that the fire and worm" can in no other ſenſe be ſaid "not to be quenched, and not to die;" but as they would continue till the carcaſes were conſumed."<note n="*" place="bottom">Salv. for all men, p. 23.</note> For the idea of reſtitution, deliverance or removal of the bodies from this ſtate of puniſhment, is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally excluded and reprobated in their own conſtruction. They ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be removed from the power of the fire and worm, till utter deſtruction be compleated. And what are the characters of this puniſhment ſo deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed? It is final for this world—it is unchangeable, there is no deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance out of it—and it is as laſting as the ſubjects of the puniſhment; the carcaſes to which it is applied. So when it is applied to the future world, the ſame characters go along with the deſcription of it. It is final for the world to come—it is unchangeable, and there is no deliverance out of it— and it is as laſting as the immortality of the ſubjects of it. So that the genuine proper force of their own conſtruction, is perdition to their own ſcheme, and a confirmation of the truth. And this is not only the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary conſtruction, and the terms ſuch as will admit of no other, but it is evidently deſigned by our Lord. For if he had deſigned only to teach them, that the wicked ſhould endure the future torments, without deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the duration of them, it was ſufficient to tell them they ſhould be caſt into hell fire, for this is deſcriptive of the future puniſhment, and never once uſed but to expreſs it. On this ſuppoſition there needed no more; and the additional deſcription ſo oft repeated, as inculcating and impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſomething of very great importance, is rendered entirely needleſs, nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory and vain. We are therefore conſtrained to conclude, that our Lord doth deſignedly give us a deſcription of the perpetuity as well as extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of that puniſhment. And he doth in fact repreſent the unceaſing, end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs duration of it figuratively, "by the fire that is not quenched, and ſhall never be quenched, and a worm that dieth not," with as ſtrong force as can be literally done by endleſs, eternal, or any words that can be uſed. So that there is no evading the force of this text by any cavil or criticiſm whatever. It mocks and defies the vain and profane attempt.</note> and ſo often repeated. If the metaphorical worm conſcience dieth not, i.e. will never ceaſe to accuſe and torment them, it is naturally impoſſible but that their puniſhment ſhould be as laſting as their exiſtence: "the ſmoke of their torment (is ſaid) to aſcend forever and ever." If their torments be not eternal, the figure of it "the ſmoke of it aſcending forever and ever," could be neither true nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. On the whole, the figurative diſcriptions of this puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are the moſt ſtrong and emphatical in nature; all of the ſame import with the literal and deciſive of it; hopeleſs of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:019737_0070_0FACA4496A476CE0"/>
and of endleſs duration. Furthermore the ſcripture examples of this puniſhment, are equally deciſive of it, hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of reſtitution and eternal. Inſpiration ſets forth three re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable enſamples of it—the deſtruction of the old world in the flood—of Sodom and Ghomorrah conſumed by fire from heaven—and of the unbelieving Iſraelites who periſhed in the wilderneſs, excluded God's reſt, both by the oath and conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wrath of God. Now, in each of theſe enſamples, there is an open, viſible, and eternal ſeparation between the righteons and the wicked—never to be re-united in this world. In each example, the wicked are deſtroyed in a diſpenſation of wrath only, without mercy; in ſupport of the authority and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God and for the good of others, but no benefit to themſelves: and in each the deſtruction is hopeleſs of reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the reſtitution barred by an impoſſibility, natural, moral or both, as will be ſhewn in another place. So that it ſeems, no examples of the future puniſhment could be preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the eye of man in this ſtate, more in point and more abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely deciſive of it "as hopeleſs and endleſs," than theſe which inſpiration gives us. We add one thing more to aſcertain this point, viz. The future puniſhment of the wicked will be the ſame—in the ſame place of torment, and as laſting, the ſame in duration with the devil and his angels; which we know to be hopeleſs of reſtitution and eternal. Our Saviour and Judge
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:019737_0071_0FACA44AD7E23A30"/>
aſſures us, that in the laſt judgment he will ſay to the wicked, "depart from me ye curſed, into everlaſting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:" conſigning them to the ſame puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and of the ſame duration. And in our text they are deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed as caſt and tormented together "in the lake of fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone forever and ever:" determinately repreſenting the ſame pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment with the ſame duration. But we know the devils are bound and reſerved in everlaſting <note n="*" place="bottom">Jude 6. The word aidios, here rendered everlaſting, is uſed but once beſides this place, and it is there uſed to deſcribe eternal power and dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Rom. 1.20.</note> chains, and will never be ſaved. This was the doctrine of the jewiſh church, and receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the inſpired apoſtles and chriſtian church, in the firſt and pureſt age of it. For it is a principle with them, not only of inſtruction, admonition, and warning, as uſed in ſeveral of the ſacred epiſtles, but of ſtrict reaſoning and argumentation. So it is improved by St. James in the 2d chap. of his epiſtle, in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing againſt a falſe, dead faith, without works, that it cannot ſave no more than that of the devil's. Now, if it was not a truth that the devils ſhould never be ſaved, an inſpired apoſtle would not have aſſumed it as true, and as a principle of argumentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And if it was not a truth, his deſigned concluſion would not follow, viz. that the ſubjects of a falſe faith, living and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo, could not be ſaved. Again, if it was not an univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledged truth in the church of God, the argument could not carry univerſal conviction in it, as it is manifeſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to do. The concluſion therefore is, that it is a certain truth that the devils ſhall never be ſaved. Their puniſhment will be eternal, and that of the wicked equally durable, hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of reſtitution and everlaſting. Now let it be noted, that this doctrine of the future puniſhment runs through the revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God, from the firſt threatning in paradiſe, to the 15th verſe of the laſt chapter of revelations. And that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the whole repreſentation to be deſcribed and delivered to the world with alike clearneſs, conſiſtency, preciſion and perfection as other great doctrines (ſuch as relate to the Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah, to the everlaſting happineſs of the righteous, &amp;c.&amp;c.) which run through the revelations of God. And can there in this view of it, be a doubt whether this puniſhment be revealed to
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:019737_0072_0FACA44B6D89B700"/>
us to be temporary or eternal? The one or the other it muſt be, and is deſigned to be aſcertained. Is it revealed as temporary and as what will have an end, when there is no period put to it expreſsly, by intimation or implication in any one deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it whatſoever? By no means. Is it not determinately and deciſively revealed of God to be eternal, taking the ſeveral deſcriptions and whole exhibitions of the doctrine together? Clearly: for thus it ſtands in the book of God. The firſt threatning imports this puniſhment for ſin, to be an eternal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion from life and bleſſedneſs in miſery as laſting as their exiſtence. It is frequently deſcribed by the ſame word, and in words and terms of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>me import, and conſtantly without a ſingle variation, without period, end or limitation. It is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the old teſtament and new, literally taught and aſſerted to be eternal, in words and phraſes the moſt ſtrong and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatical, expreſſive of eternity, that are uſed in the book of God. All the figurative deſcriptions of it are equally deciſive of it, as hopeleſs of reſtitution and of endleſs duration. Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of which can have no meaning if they do not mean endleſs; or muſt have a meaning contradictory to the terms in which it is expreſſed. The ſcripture examples have deciſively the ſame language and import. And this puniſhment is ſet forth as eternal, by way of disjunction and oppoſition, as contraſted with the everlaſting life of the righteous, by a phraſe moſt deciſive of perpetual and endleſs. The puniſhment and happineſs both ſaid to be "day and night forever and ever." And it is as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſively ſet forth by way of connexion, the puniſhment of the wicked the ſame, and of the ſame duration with the everlaſting puniſhment of the devil and his angels. On the whole, it is evident the duration of this puniſhment is deſigned to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed and aſcertained to us. And can it be more ſo than in having all the parts, deſcriptions, and whole exhibition of one import, and centuring in one point, endleſs? Can this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant doctrine which runs through the revelation of God, be ſo revealed to us without deſign, when deſign is ſo ſtrongly mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through the whole? Or can any thing be deſigned leſs, or any otherwiſe than what is clearly, plainly, fully and deciſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſented and imported through the whole? It is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; becauſe it implies deſigned falſhood and deception, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:019737_0073_0FACA44C2AD7BE30"/>
of the moral character of God, and of the doctrine of inſpiration. Moſt certain then it is, that this puniſhment, in all its everlaſting terrors, will be executed upon the wicked, in the future and eternal ſtate. God hath deſigned it—hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed it—is able and reſolved to do it: and his wiſdom, holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, juſtice, truth and immutability inſure the dreadful execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For the truth and immutability of God are as truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the execution of his threatnings, as his promiſes. So taught the prophet Samuel, "the ſtrength of Iſrael will not lie nor repent: for he is not a man that he ſhould repent."<note n="†" place="bottom">1 Samuel 15.29.</note> One would apprehend by the united force of all this evidence the concluſion ſhould be clear to an unbiaſſed mind. If lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage hath any fixed, determinate meaning—or if all kinds of deſcription can deciſively determine any point of doctrine— if the import of terms uſed, and the manner in which they are always invariably uſed of a ſubject, without end—together with literal and figurative deſcriptions, confirmed by examples, by contraſt and by connexion, all deciſively fixing the ſame conſtruction of a doctrine, can aſcertain the meaning and truth of it; then this doctrine of the everlaſting puniſhment of the wicked, is aſcertained unto us: and we are bound to believe and receive it upon the authority of God, the adorable reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of it. And there is nothing which relates to this doctrine as it ſtands in the book of God, to induce the leaſt doubt about it. And nothing in reaſon, or relating to any other doctrine, which ought to have any influence to it. To ſay it is incredible; what is it but to oppoſe our folly to divine wiſdom—to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach the wiſdom and truth of God? To ſay the original word tranſlated eternal, "ſignifies ſometimes a definite and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times an indefinite duration, and the nature of the ſubject to which it is applied muſt aſcertain its meaning," avails nothing in this caſe: For this doctrine doth not ſtand or reſt upon a ſingle word. The whole exhibition of this future puniſhment, in every deſcription of it, is endleſs. Wherefore, when the ſpirit of truth deſcribes it literally in perfect agreement with every other deſcription, with the import of every particular and the whole, ſo applied and in ſuch connexion, it fixes the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be ſtrictly eternal. And the meaning is likewiſe fixed
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:019737_0074_0FACA44CF84E3710"/>
by their own rule, viz. by the nature of the ſubject to which it is applied. When applied to God and his attributes, which are infinite and eternal, then ſay they, it muſt be underſtood ſtrictly and deciſively as eternal. By the ſame rule, the nature of the ſubject, when it is applied to beings by conſtitution of nature immortal (as all mankind good and bad will be in the conſtitution of ſoul and body after the reſurrection) then it muſt mean eternal. The happineſs of the one and the miſery of the other as laſting as their immortality. Their own rule ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to this important ſubject fixes and confirms our ſenſe and conſtruction of it. And the word is conſtantly, invariably and without exception uſed to mean as laſting as the conſtitution of things to which it is applied; of courſe, when it is applied to beings by nature and conſtitution immortal, and in an eternal ſtate, it muſt mean eternal; and there is not a ſhadow of force in their little criticiſm. Recourſe to prophetic and figurative diſcriptions which belong to other ſubjects, can have no effect to weaken a doctrine ſo compleatly and deciſively delivered. The meaning of ſuch texts muſt be aſcertained by the ſubjects to which they relate. Nor will the univerſal terms uſed reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the doctrine of ſalvation and the great atonement, have any force to weaken the faith of this doctrine. The meaning of ſuch terms of univerſality, muſt be aſcertained by the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to which they relate, viz. by the terms of life and way of ſalvation revealed in the goſpel conſtitution: and when ſo aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained, they will appear in perfect harmony, without the leaſt contrariety between the goſpol doctrine of ſalvation and this doctrine of future puniſhment we have been illuſtrating, as will be ſhewn in a more proper place. This doctrine ſo illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated and eſtabliſhed, ſuggeſts to us the following remarks.</p>
               <p>Remark 1. The ſupport of the authority, laws and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, is a matter of higheſt and eternal importance: and the greatneſs of this ſanction in ſupport of it, announces it to be ſo to all the univerſe. This puniſhment carries in it a declarative teſtimony of the immenſe majeſty and authority of God, the great King Eternal: the infinite evil of contemning and rebelling againſt it, and counteracting the infinitely wiſe, great and good deſigns of his government. It announces the ſupport of the authority, laws and government of God, to be of
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:019737_0075_0FACA44DABB502B8"/>
the higheſt importance, and that he is infinitely able and reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to ſupport it in all its dignity and glory; and to carry into full execution all the infinitely important deſigns of it: and when he ſhall execute it upon all the irreconcilable enemies of his kingdom, it will be ſeen in all its importance, and there can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be a doubt of it more. It announces the ſtrongeſt poſſible ſecurity to the faithful, and the fulfilment of all his promiſes to them that love and obey him: for if he executes this threatned judgment upon his enemies, which is as his ſtrange work, moſt aſſuredly will he accompliſh all his works and deſigns of grace and love, which is his delight, in compleating the promiſed ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and eternal glory of all his friends and children that love and obey him. The ſufferings of the eternal Son of God, for the ſupport and honor of the divine authority, law and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to open the way of mercy and ſecure the ſalvation of all that believe and obey him, and the final deſtruction of all his enemies, as a ſacrifice in ſupport of it, announces and demonſtrates the importance of it with ſtrongeſt force conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by us, and perhaps poſſible in the nature of things. The everlaſting life, from which thoſe that periſh are eternally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, is in itſelf of unutterable importance; but the glory of the divine character, and the ſupport of his authority and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in its connections, doth ſo infinitely ſurpaſs it in dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, excellency, worth and importance, that when they come in competition, it muſt be ſacrificed to it. And this great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of it, muſt inculcate godly fear and higheſt reverence, with deep and everlaſting impreſſions, upon the ſociety of the bleſſed. Inſpiration gives us their language, "ſaying, great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty; juſt and true are thy ways, thou King of Saints. Who ſhall not fear thee O Lord, and glorify thy name? for thy judgments are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt." <note n="*" place="bottom">Rev. 15.3, 4.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Rem. 2. This doctrine ſo extended throughout the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of God, evinces it of vaſt importance, to be taught, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved and realized, for the ſupport of the government of God and the good of mankind. Were it not of vaſt importance to the government of God, ſuch an infinitely terrible puniſhment would never have been threatned;—would never have been
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:019737_0076_0FACA44E6842FDD8"/>
executed upon rebel angels, and the impenitent of mankind:— and the final execution of it upon veſſels of wrath, would never have been ſo ſtrongly inſured in the word of God. And it's being ſo taught and exhibited in all the diſpenſations of God to men, in a ſtate of innocency, by inſtruction and exemplification before the law; and much more plainly and forcibly under the law and prophets, and under the Meſſiah; evinces it's vaſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to mankind in this world: to reſtrain from wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to reform the vicious, to excite to faith, to repentance, and to all the purpoſes of godlineſs. It ſeems revealed as an eſſential in the divine government, and fundamental in the ſyſtem of revelation.</p>
               <p>Rem. 3. This doctrine of the future puniſhment in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection with future rewards, is a full vindication of the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God: againſt all the reproaches of the ungodly and miſtakes of good men; in the ſeemingly unequal diſpenſations and diſtributions of this world. Particularly, in the proſperity of the wicked, and frequent ſingular ſufferings of the godly.— This great myſtery of providence in this world, is unfolded and cleared in the doctrine of retribution in the world to come. In a ſtate of trial and diſcipline, all things, mercies, afflictions, &amp;c. come alike to all. And to anſwer ſome great and good deſign of Providence, the godly may ſtruggle with great adverſity, perſecution, &amp;c. but in the ſtate of retribution there will be an open, viſible, everlaſting difference between "the precious and the vile, him that profanely ſwears, and him that fears an oath, him that ſerveth God and him that ſerveth him not." <note n="§" place="bottom">Good men ready to faint under adverſity, need this ſupport. It is given to them in 73d Pſalm and other ſcriptures. It is a firſt principle with them, "ſure God is good to Iſrael, to the clean in heart:" diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhingly good, and will make it fully appear in this world or that to come—verily there is a reward for the righteous, great, ſure and eternal. But who can behold the inconſiſtent reproaches and cavils thrown out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the government of God, without a mixture of pity and indignation? One ſet of men reproach and blaſpheme the providence of God, becauſe "the tabernacles of robbers proſper, and they who provoke God with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven-daring crimes are ſecure;" and juſtice doth not overtake proud, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing, perſecuting tyrants, who trample the poor and godly under their feet; to puniſh them according to their deſerts: becauſe the wrongs of the oppreſſed are not redreſſed, nor the pious diſtinguiſhingly rewarded here. Point them to the day of judgment and retributions of eternity, wherein all things will be perfectly righted. Eternity is long enough to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe evil to them who do evil, and good and happineſs to the pious and faithful. Then, another ſet of men cavil againſt an everlaſting difference to be made between the righteous and the wicked; and ſay, "it exceeds all belief." Thus, the one cavil becauſe perfect retribution don't take place in this world; and the other becauſe the moſt perfect takes place in that to come. But in the great day, God's ways will be evinced to be equal and his work perfect. And in thoſe eternal retributions his truth and righteouſneſs will ſhine forth in eternal honour. And it is in part the deſign of that day, to ſtop the mouth of cavillers—"to convince the ungodly of all their ungodly deeds and hard ſpeeches," and eternally clear and ſilence their impious cavils and reproaches. As Jude 15 v.</note> This teacheth us aloud "it is not a vain thing to ſerve the Lord, it is our life." Yea, the true and faithful ſerving of God in this life, is evinced to be of the higheſt poſſible importance to us; by the greatneſs of the rewards and puniſhments of eternity.</p>

                  <pb n="58" facs="unknown:019737_0077_0FACA44F27CE2F80"/>Which leads to</p>
               <p>Rem. 4. This doctrine, doth moſt ſtrongly inforce the great, goſpel doctrines of regeneration, faith, repentance and holineſs in this world, as of utmoſt neceſſity and importance to all. Becauſe there is no door of hope, to eſcape this tremend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous puniſhment, and inherit the great ſalvation of God, without it. It is this abſolute neceſſity, that impreſſes theſe doctrines and duties, as of near, home, everlaſting importance and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern to us.</p>
               <p>Rem. 5. This doctrine ſets forth the love and ſaving grace of God, and value of the Saviour's blood, in the higheſt point of importance and glory; in effecting, the ſalvation of all that believe; the whole redeemed world. For, as is the greatneſs, juſtice and terror of this puniſhment, and the greatneſs and glory of it's oppoſite ſalvation; ſo, is the tranſcendent, excelling glory of this ineffable grace and precious blood; whereby we are delivered from the one, and put in the eternal poſſeſſion of the other.</p>
               <p>Rem. 7. In this exhibition, we ſee all the inſpired men of God, who treat of this ſubject, do ſet themſelves with one mind and ſpirit, and with like zeal and vigor to ſupport this doctrine of the future puniſhment in it's eternal terrors; to impreſs the belief of it; that it might have it's full power and energy on the hearts and conſciences of men, for good.

laws and government; and with the moſt ſincere and ardent benevolence to mankind, to ſave them from this wrath to come and urge on their repentance and life. Here's the divine warrant for wiſe and good men in all ages, who have followed their example. But ſurely, no uninſpired man or men can be authoriſed by God to a direct contrary courſe and doctrine— to contradict and ſubvert the faith of this great doctrine—to cavil and criticiſe the terms in which it is delivered to render it doubtful—to weaken its energy in ſupport of the divine go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in the hearts and conſciences of men—and leſſen its influence to their repentance and life. If the inſpired men of God were right in thus ſerving God, this counter-work can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be of God, but of the wicked one: it was his firſt and great work in the ſeduction of mankind to ſupplant the belief of the threatning, and thereby induce the apoſtacy. And it is a ſerious, intereſting queſtion, can men do his work without his wages? Finally, this doctrine ſhews the infinitely alarming danger of all the impenitent going on in their ſins. The wrath of God is revealed from heaven againſt them: already under condemnation to this tremendous puniſhment, ſo extreme and never to have an end. O, who can think of and realize this danger as their own, without an aching heart and moſt ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous concern? What can alarm them to flee from the wrath to come, to betake themſelves to the goſpel way of eſcape and lay hold on the hope ſet before them, if this will not do it? If they hear not Moſes and the prophets, our Saviour and his apoſtles teſtifying this great condemnation to them, and withal opening the way of life to them in this world; neither would they be perſuaded though one roſe from the dead, nor by any means whatever. "Wherefore awake thou that ſleepeſt, and ariſe from the dead, and Chriſt ſhall give thee light."</p>
               <p>We paſs to the ſecond general argument: 2dly, To ſhew the doctrine of the future puniſhment before ſtated, is confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a variety of moſt pointed declarations, fitted and deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God, to cut off all preſumption and hope of eſcape or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution to the wicked, that die in their ſins.</p>
               <p>In the firſt addreſs of temptation to mankind, the grand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver deſigned both to ſupplant the belief of the divine threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and implant a preſumptuous hope in the human heart of

life and bleſſedneſs without complying with the terms of it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God in this ſtate; and againſt the force of the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. And this preſumptuous hope is deep rooted in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man heart. It is the poiſonous ſource of innumerable tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, diſhonours to God and miſchiefs to mankind. It is this induces many to delay and put off duty and repentance; and by it they are encouraged, imboldened and hardened in iniquity to final deſtruction. The patience and forbearance of God, the mercies of his providence, and all the adorable grace of the goſpel are perverted, by the falſe reaſonings of the heart, in ſupport of it. Inſpiration ſhews it's deſtructive ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration many ways. "Becauſe ſentence againſt their evil works is not executed ſpeedily, therefore the heart of the ſons of men is fully ſet in them to do evil." &amp;c. &amp;c. Now, univerſaliſts tell us, all men ſhall finally be ſaved, even all thoſe, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply not with the goſpel terms of life in this world; all the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and curſes of the book of God againſt it, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. They tell us, "we are brought into being expectants of a bleſſed immortality, and upon a foundation that will not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint us."<note n="‖" place="bottom">Salvation for all men, p. 26.</note> And hereby ſupport and eſtabliſh this hope, as well grounded. But a holy, heart-ſearching God, beholds this principle in the heart and all its corrupt operations, with great indignation. He hath denounced a variety of moſt pointed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations againſt it to extirpate it out of the hearts of mankind, What can be more pointed and adapted to this purpoſe than Deut. 29.18, 19, 20, 21; "Leſt there ſhould be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whoſe heart turneth away this day from the Lord our God, to go and ſerve the Gods of the nations: leſt there ſhould be among you a root that bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth gall and wormwood, and it come to paſs, when he heareth the words of this curſe, that he bleſs himſelf in his heart, ſaying, I ſhall have peace though I walk in the imagination (or ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornneſs) of my heart to add drunkenneſs to thirſt: the Lord will not ſpare him, but then the anger of the Lord and his jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy ſhall ſmoke againſt that man, and all the curſes that are written in this book ſhall lie upon him, and the Lord ſhall blot his name from under heaven.

fatal error deſcribed by the ſpirit of truth, in its principle, ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and end. "He heareth the words of this curſe," but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the force of it "he bleſſeth himſelf" with this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous hope, "that he ſhall have peace," eternal peace; "though he walks on in the imagination and ſtubbornneſs of his heart," and is encouraged, imboldened and hardened by it "to add drunkenneſs to thirſt." But oh! how dreadful the end! eternally cut off from peace and happineſs—"all the curſes of the book of God ſhall lie upon him," without a hope of removal forever—and ſo accurſed ſhall be ſeperated to evil and miſery without end. Surely to entertain and ſecretly cheriſh this preſumptuous hope in the heart, muſt be very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious and dangerous. But how aſtoniſhing! that any who have the book of God in their hands ſhould embrace, avow and openly profeſs this accurſed error, with all the curſes of the book of God upon it, as an article of their faith: and under the colouring of ſome miſtaken or perverted texts, ſhould preach this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> poiſon to the world, as the wholeſome doctrine of our Lord, againſt all his admonitions and warnings. Again, what can be more pointed for the deſtruction of this error, than thoſe repeated declarations of the Moſt High? "There is no peace, ſaith the Lord, unto the wicked." There is no peace, ſaith my God, to the wicked."<note n="‡" place="bottom">Iſaiah 48.22. and Iſaiah 57.21.</note> It cannot be ſpoken of the wicked who turn from their wickedneſs to God, in this world; for it is abundantly declared "they ſhall live," have mercy, pardon, peace with God in this world, and eternal peace and happineſs in heaven. It is ſpoken then to the wicked that die in a ſtate of wickedneſs: henceforth to eternity there is no peace and happineſs to them. That ſoft, deluding turn, "they muſt ceaſe to be wicked" in a future ſtate "before they can have peace," is evaſive and againſt the ſpirit of the texts; which are deſigned to cut off all hope of ſuch turning and peace after death; as is evident in the language of the texts and many parallel ſcriptures. To the ſame purpoſe it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, Iſaiah 27.11. "It is a people of no underſtanding; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he that made them will not have mercy on them, and he that formed them will ſhew them no favour." It is allowed on all hands, they cannot be ſaved but by the favour and

grace of God. When he declareth he will ſhew them no fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, is not all hope of ſalvation cut off by it? We read "the hope of the hypocrite ſhall periſh, and ſhall be cut off."<note n="*" place="bottom">Job 8.13, 14.</note> Now what is his hope but to enjoy eternal life and bleſſedneſs? But his hope of it ſhall perish, he ſhall never enjoy it. For if this was ever true, he would find his hope not cut off and periſhed, but eſtabliſhed in contradiction to the texts. The ſame pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous hope, the wicked often maintain through life; but death puts an intire end to it. So it is written, "the deſire of the wicked ſhall periſh"<note n="‡" place="bottom">Pſal. 112.10.</note>—"the expectation of the wicked ſhall periſh"‖—"when a wicked man dieth his expectation ſhall periſh: and the hope of the unjuſt man periſheth."<note n="†" place="bottom">Prov. 11.7. Rev. 6.16.17.</note> If there was ever to be a reſtitution to happineſs, their hope might be ſaid to be deferred; to be delayed: but could not be ſaid to be cut off, and abſolutely periſh at death. It is diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to conceive any form of expreſſion more pointed to the deſtruction of this hope, and to exhibit the future puniſhment of the wicked abſolutely hopeleſs, than thoſe ſo frequently uſed. And they are called to attend to it in this point of view, in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother form of expreſſion equally pointed and expreſſive. Pſal. 50.22. "Now conſider this, ye that forget God, leſt I tear you in pieces and there be none to deliver." The execution of this deſtruction, is hopeleſs of redemption and a deliverer. So alſo is that, Prov. 29.1. "He that being often reproved, hardeneth his neck, ſhall ſuddenly be deſtroyed and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out remedy or healing." Which deſtruction in terms, is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly oppoſed to their doctrine of healing and life. And when actually executed upon them, the miſerable ſubjects of this deſtruction, are repreſented to be in a ſtate of abſolute hopeleſs deſperation; as "calling upon mountains and rocks to fall on them, and hide them from the face of him that ſitteth on the throne, and from the face of the lamb. Becauſe the great day of his wrath is come, and who ſhall be able to bear it?"<note n="§" place="bottom">Prov. 10.28.</note> whence this hopeleſs, fruitleſs application to inanimate crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but from abſolute deſperation? Why not cry to God, and reſort to his mercy? but becauſe they know and feel them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves cut off from all mercy and hope forever. Moreover, the pathetic addreſs of the God of love and mercy, in Ezek. 33.11.
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:019737_0082_0FACA453F8A0C3E0"/>
is equally pointed by ſtrong implication to extirpate all hope of eſcape or reſtitution to them that die in their ſins. "Say unto them, as I live, ſaith the Lord, I have no pleaſure in the death of the wicked, but that he turn from his wicked way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways: for why will you die, O houſe of Iſrael!" Why this pathos? this preſſing earneſt to turn now and live? why inforced with a why will you die? but becauſe this life is the only time in which ſinners can turn and live—and in caſe they turn not, their eternal death is una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable, hopeleſs, irretrievable. The infinite love and grace of God hath opened a wide door of mercy and hope to a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing world, upon goſpel terms—to ſinners of all nations, of all characters, and in all conditions of life, in their day of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation. The offer is univerſal, the mercy and ſalvation ſure to all who comply with the terms. But our Lord has taught us this door will be ſhut againſt thoſe who neglect the terms of ſalvation. "When once the maſter of the houſe is riſen up and hath ſhut too the door, and ye begin to ſtand without and to knock at the door, ſaying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he ſhall anſwer and ſay unto you, I know you not whence you are, &amp;c."<note n="*" place="bottom">Luke 13.24.25.</note> The connexion ſhews then, there will be no more ſtriving and entrance. And he hath taught us when this door is and will be ſhut. In the parable of the rich man and Lazarus, he teacheth that at death, good and bad men en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into a ſtate of retribution; and that it is unalterable to both. Lazarus dies, and is carried by angels into the boſom of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, to a ſtate of ineffable reward and happineſs. The rich man dies, and in hell he lifts up his eye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

"Beſides all this, between us and you there is a great gulph fixed; ſo that they which would paſs from hence to you cannot: neither can they paſs to us, that would come from thence."<note n="†:" place="bottom">Luke 16.22, 3, 4, 5, 6.</note> If this doth not mean there is no intercourſe and no alteration of ſtate to the one or the other, what can be meant by it? At death then, this door is ſhut to every ſinner that dies in iniquity. And he further teaches it will be ſhut to all the wicked, in the day of judgment: for then they ſhall be ſentenced and go away into everlaſting pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment."

Paul likewiſe teaches the impoſſibility of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to thoſe who neglect it in the preſent ſtate: "How ſhall we eſcape if we neglect ſo great ſalvation? Heb. 2.3.—and that apoſtates ſhall have no benefit by the ſacrifice of Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ch. 10. v. 26, 27. "to them there remains no more ſacrifice for ſins:" i. e. they ſhall have no benefit by this or any other ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. What then remains to them? nothing "but a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful looking for of iudgment (without mercy) and fiery indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which ſhall devour the adverſaries." A ſtrong way of exhibiting their hopeleſs deſtruction. And he teacheth us, thoſe who make the death of Chriſt vain, as to the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of it in this world, ſhall be forever cut off from the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal benefits of it. He tells the Galatians, "if righteouſneſs come by the law, then Chriſt is dead in vain." Gal. 2.21. Then in ch. 5.2. "behold I Paul ſay unto you, that if ye be circumciſed (in expectation of righteouſneſs by the law) Chriſt ſhall profit you nothing." Shall Chriſt profit them nothing? Surely they ſhall be forever cut off from the eternal redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and benefits of his purchaſe. Yet the univerſaliſts ſay, they ſhall all be infinitely profited and eternally ſaved by Chriſt. Can any tenet be in more direct oppoſition and contradiction to the doctrine of inſpiration? From hence it is obvious, all their teſtimony, adduced from the writings of St. Paul, are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly miſconſtructions of his true meaning: for he certainly never taught ſuch palpable contradiction. St. James, in the 2d. ch. of his epiſtle, deſignedly proves, the ſubjects of a falſe, dead faith and hope ſhall never be ſaved. Alledging they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaved according to the example of Abraham, the father of the faithful, and pattern of all that ever will be ſaved: they cannot be ſaved no more than the devils. St. Peter tells us, the wicked "ſhall utterly periſh in their own corruption." <note n="§" place="bottom">2 Peter 2.12.</note> The ſame phraſeology and manner of expreſſion as is uſed for the deſtruction of the Amalekites, and of myſtical Babylon by fire, Rev. 18.8. where it is deſigned to denote and deſcribe perpetual deſolation, hopeleſs of reſtitution.

purpoſe for which they are alledged.<note n="‖" place="bottom">The Doctor is expreſs in point: He tells us "the common way (i.e. of ſalvation by the ſpirit and grace of God) is in the uſe of appointed means: nor is there ground of hope in the revelations of God, to be ſaved any other way." Seaſ. Tho'ts, p. 265: and again p. 280—the doctrine of the bible, "makes no proviſion of mercy for ſinners continuing ſuch; but poſitively excludes them the kingdom of heaven, notwithſtanding the grace of God, and merits of the Redeemer."</note> Theſe numerous decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations are evidently deſigned and fitted in infinite wiſdom, to cut off all hope of eſcape of the future puniſhment, and of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution and deliverance out of it, to thoſe who die in their ſins. Conſequently they do moſt deciſively determine their puniſhment will be as laſting and endleſs as their exiſtence. It is ſcarce conceivable that any words, mode or form of expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on can be made uſe of more clear, pointed, convincing and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, than thoſe we have cited, to extirpate this preſumptuous hope out of the hearts of men; and this error that eſtabliſhes it, out of the world. If the ſcriptures are of uſe to us, learned and unlearned, how can we (giving attention to it) miſtake the truth, in a caſe of ſuch plain, practical importance. For the God of truth aſſures us, "there is no peace to the wicked, all the curſes of his book ſhall he upon them." But they teach, "the wicked that live and die in their ſins ſhall be ſaved and have eternal peace." The one teacheth, "the hope of the hypocrite and wicked, ſhall be cut off and periſh:" the other, that they are brought into being expectants of a bleſſed immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, and upon a foundation which will not diſappoint them. God declares he will ſhew them no favour: they declare they ſhall have everlaſting life in his favour. The one declares, they ſhall be deſtroyed without remedy or healing: the other, that they ſhall have everlaſting healing and peace. The ſpirit of inſpiration announces, "Chriſt ſhall profit them nothing:" they tell us, they ſhall be finally ſaved and eternally profited by him. In a word, the ſpirit of truth aſſures us, "they ſhall ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly periſh in their own corruption," their ſins: they tell us they ſhall not utterly periſh in their ſins, but finally be ſaved. How is it poſſible any man of common ſenſe, giving attention to it, can miſtake the truth in a caſe ſo plain and of ſuch eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal importance, unleſs he loves error better than truth? Of
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:019737_0085_0FACA455EF636C88"/>
what uſe are the ſcriptures, or our reaſon to underſtand them, if we cannot be aſcertained in a matter ſo obvious? For whoſse words ſhall ſtand in the day of judgment and throughout eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, the words of the God of truth or of deluded men? Can this error live with Chriſtians who have the book of God in their hands, when all the curſes of it are levelled againſt it for its deſtruction? and when it is ſo ſtrongly teſtified againſt by Moſes and the prophets, in the book of Pſalms, and by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and his apoſtles? Theſe divine teſtimonies ſhew it very pernicious and dangerous to harbour this preſumptuous hope in the heart: but it is beyond expreſſion dangerous to teach the error that eſtabliſheth and confirms it. Will it ſtill be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that it is not a doctrine of licentiouſneſs, when we ſee it ſo ſtrongly teſtified againſt, as an evil moſt pernicious to the intereſt of the kingdom of God and to the ſouls of men? and is in truth the grand plot of the wicked one, for the ſubverſion of both? when the pernicious operation of it is traced out in ſcripture in a variety of ways, and reaſon, experience and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation plainly teach its evil operation? in a word, when its natural opperation is deſtructive of all good and inlet to all wickedneſs? What is ſuch pretence, but an inſult upon the underſtanding and common ſenſe of mankind? Their beſt ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vo, "that moral depravity is inconſiſtent with rational happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs," and the ſufferings of the wicked in the next ſtate will be great and long; taken in connexion with their ſure hope of recovery from this depravity and miſery to eternal life; is a flimſy buſineſs and weak defence againſt the current of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature and force of temptation. The ſame evil turn of heart, that induceth men to put far away the evil day, will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh the terrors of this puniſhment: and the ſubſequent good and happineſs they teach, will ingroſs the imagination; and the practical language of the vicious will be "we are delivered to theſe abominations." This is obvious to thoſe who have atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to human nature. Since the God of love, the infinitely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent Saviour, and the moſt wiſe, pious, great, good and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent men that ever lived and adorned human nature, have put forth ſuch ſtrong exertions to ſave men from this accurſed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption and error, with all its fatal conſequences, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them to turn and live; ſurely, coldneſs and lukewarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

"What is the chaff to the wheat?" Theſe ſtrong teſtimonies from heaven, warn us of the evil and danger of preſumptuous hopes—to beware of entertaining any hope of eternal life, but in compliance with the goſpel terms of life—to beware of every treacherous device of our own hearts, or by the artifice of others to lull us in ſecurity in ſin, to delay and put off repentance and turning to God, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially to encourage, imbolden, and harden us in iniquity, when we ſee the end is deſtruction, hopeleſs and everlaſting. Moreover, they teach us aloud, the vaſt importance of a well im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of life and time and the means of ſalvation in our hands —the infinite importance of ſeeking, ſtriving and ſecuring the things of our eternal peace in this day of our viſitation. With what an emphaſis do they bring home the apoſtolic admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, "behold now is the accepted time, now is the day of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation," in which, againſt all deluding artifices and temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, we ſhould preſs into the kingdom of God with violence, ſince the ſeaſon of the preſent life loſt, we are loſt to eternity.</p>
               <p n="3">3dly. This doctrine of the future puniſhment, is further confirmed by the conſtitution of nature, which connects ſin and miſery together, and will make the finally wicked neceſſarily miſerable as long they have exiſtence; unleſs this conſtitution be annulled or ſuperſeded by the grace of God, the author of it, which, by many declarations, he aſſures us ſhall never be. The connexion of ſin and miſery in the conſtitution of nature, is the dictate of reaſon, of conſcience, experience and obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on through the world. A doctrine frequently taught in reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and allowed by our opponents; who ſay, "a man will be miſerable, while he is wicked, and that he muſt be virtuous

in order to be happy." This conſtitution of nature is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrought in the revealed conſtitution of God; and an impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant part of the diſcipline of this ſtate conſiſts in the natural conſequences and rewards of virtue and vice: and ſuch is the force of it, that often thoſe who go on in iniquity find their way lined or hedged up with briars and thorns: ſuch is the bitter fruit of their ſins, that their way to deſtruction is hard and miſerable. And what is much to our purpoſe, they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times ſin beyond repentance and recovery in this world. Not a few of the vicious and profligate reduce themſelves to a miſerable, untimely end. Intemperate gluttons dig their graves with their teeth: and others their's, in their different ways of vice. Many have ſad experience of the truth of that neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed admonition of king Solomon, "and thou mourn at the laſt when thy fleſh and body are conſumed, and ſay, how have I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted inſtruction, and my heart deſpiſed reproof."<note n="*" place="bottom">Prov. 5.11, 12.</note> Now this is a preſage and premonition they may ſin themſelves into mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery beyond repentance and redemption in the world to come, as well as in this world.<note n="‖" place="bottom">The Doctor tells us, Sermons p. 236 in his note, "Men by the increaſe of their obſtinacy in ſin, may increaſe the impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of their being ſavingly wro't upon; yea, they may become ſo har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened and perverſe, as to be beyond the poſſibility of obtaining this mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy."

Will a wiſe, holy, ſin-hating and ſin-avenging God, in favour of the obſtinately wicked, annul this conſtitution, and therewith, the wholeſome, important inſtructions it now gives to the world to ſtop, to reclaim the vicious, and to inforce their repentance and life? Hath he declared he will annul or ſuperſede it? In no wiſe—but repeatedly the contrary. Our Lord aſſures us in moſt peremptory terms, "verily, verily, I ſay unto you, except a man be born again, he cannot ſee the kingdom of God." <note n="‡" place="bottom">John 3.3.</note> What is this but a confirmation of this conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as unalterable; whereby the habitually wicked cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the kingdom of God; and except they be ſpiritually and

We have ſeen the repeated declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God, "that there is no peace to the wicked,"—"that their hopes are cut off and periſh at death." Doth this ſpeak this conſtitution annulled, or confirmed? It is declared of the wicked "they ſhall eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices,"—"ſhall be filled with miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief," —"ſhall be filled with their own ways:"<note n="§" place="bottom">Prov. 1.31. ch. 12.21. ch. 14.14.</note> Strongly importing the perpetual force of this divine conſtitution againſt them in way of puniſhment. Still will they imagine, they ſhall ſome how be delivered from this bondage of corruption, and the fatal conſequences of their own folly, to the liberties of the ſons of God. God ſees the deluding imagination, and meets it with that awful declaration "his own iniquities ſhall take the wicked himſelf, and he ſhall be holden in the cords of his ſins." Still he hopes for extraordinary inſtruction and means of deliverance; to cut off which it is added, "he ſhall die without inſtruction, (his expected inſtruction) and in the greatneſs of his folly ſhall he go aſtray."<note n="†" place="bottom">Prov. 5.22, 23.</note> "Their feet (we are told) go down to death, and their ſteps take hold on hell," by natural tendency, by deſert, and by the connection of this eſtabliſhed conſtitution of God. And they ſhall be turned into hell, which ſhall be the portion of their cup."<note n="‖" place="bottom">Pſalm 9.17 &amp; 11.</note> God and heaven are repreſented as the heritage and portion of the godly: the wrath of God and puniſhment of hell, as the heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage and portion of the wicked. If the one be unalterable and eternal, why not the other? The ſcriptures make no differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in point of duration, and uninſpired men cannot "in the portion of their cup." Again, we are expreſsly taught, "de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and miſery are in their ways,"<note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. 3.16.</note> "and deſtruction is their end."<note n="‡" place="bottom">Phil. 3.19.</note> In what ſtronger terms can the perpetual opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting force of this conſtitution againſt them, be held forth to us? If God ſeparates them from his preſence and love, and lets looſe their guilty thoughts upon them, "the worm that dieth not," their end muſt be deſtruction and miſery, as laſting as their exiſtence. And how repeatedly, is this declared, "that their end ſhall be according to their works,"<note n="¶" place="bottom">2 Cor. 11.15.</note> "that their end is

deſtruction," "that their end is to be burned."<note n="‖" place="bottom">Heb. 6.8.</note> And by the ſentence of the laſt day, this end "is everlaſting deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord and the glory of his power."<note n="*" place="bottom">2 Theſ. 1.9.</note> There is no evading ſuch plain declarations, in terms of ſuch determinate and deciſive import, but by groſs abſurdity and contradiction. To ſay, that deſtruction will not be the find end of the wicked, is ſaying, this conſtitution of nature will be annulled and ſuperſeded, againſt all theſe divine teſtimonies, which declare and inſure it's eſtabliſhment and exemplification in their future puniſhment. To ſay this is their end, and yet they will have another; is holding up and maintaining an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd contradiction, in terms. It is their end—and yet it is not their end. For nothing can have two endings, any more than two beginnings. To ſay, deſtruction is their end, yet they ſhall be ſaved and have eternal life their end, is at once to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the two doctrines; and directly to contradict the letter and grand intention of the ſpirit of truth, in theſe repeated de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations. For they are deſigned to teach us the infinitely different rewards and puniſhments, ſtates and ends of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and wicked in the future world; according to their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters and works in this life. The one have their fruit unto holineſs, and the end everlaſting life—the other, bearing fruits of iniquity, their end eternal death; as motives to influence and govern the hearts and lives of mankind. In a word, to ſay they ſhall be puniſhed with deſtruction as their end, according to their works in this ſtate, as the rule and meaſure of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and yet affirm that by the plan of mercy, this ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution by which they are condemned, againſt this rule and meaſure of judgment given it (not according to their works in this ſtate) they ſhall be finally ſaved and rewarded with eternal life, is to deſtroy the rule of judgment—utterly to confound language—to confound the ſcripture doctrine of rewards and puniſhments—and to exhibit the government of God, without wiſdom, righteouſneſs and perfection, groſsly inconſiſtent. Theſe ſcripture teſtimonies ſeem full and clear, that this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine conſtitution will never be annulled or ſuperſeded in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the wicked that die in their ſins; and ſtrongly witneſs, that God will ſurely eſtabliſh and exemplify it in their future

deſtruction. Of courſe, upon their own principles, "their miſery muſt be as laſting as their immortality." One would apprehend, that a doctrine thus founded in the conſtitution of nature, ſo clear in it's evidence, ſo ſtrongly atteſted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in the revelations of God, and ſo infinitely intereſting in it's nature and conſequences, ſhould convey conviction and impreſſion to every heart that was not fully reſolved againſt conviction. For how vain to expect reſtitution or end of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment from that revelation of God, which ſo expreſsly, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily and repeatedly conſigns the wicked to all the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of an unchangable conſtitution of nature, as their end, in the future and eternal world?</p>
               <p>This ſubject gives us an alarming view of the exceeding evil and danger of ſin, in it's nature and operations, as well as deſert. It is connected in nature and in it's ſure operations with the miſery and deſtruction of thoſe in whom it reigns, and who fall a prey to the power of it. This ſubject diſcloſes the fallacy and deceit of all the temptations of the wicked one. He tempts men to believe the way of ſin, is the way of pleaſure, profit, happineſs—but 'tis the way of deſtruction and miſery, of that only and to eternity; if a righteous God conſigns them, but to the natural and fatal conſequences of it. How great a delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, the deliverance from the power as well as guilt of ſin, ſo eſſentially neceſſary to the life and happineſs of immortal ſouls?</p>
               <p>The glad tidings of a Saviour, to ſave us from our ſins in this world as well as from the wrath to come, ſhould be glad tidings of great joy to us. Surely, a glorious Chriſt, given of God to this great purpoſe, is worthy of all acceptation of a guilty world. This doctrine demonſtrates the neceſſity and credibility of a ſupernatural revelation from God. One would think, ſober deiſts would eaſily and readily perceive it. For it is demonſtrable, or rather is ſelf-evident from the conſtitution of nature, ſinners can have no deliverance and ſalvation, but by a ſupernatural remedy provided of God. And this can be known to us in this world, only by ſupe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="4">4thly. The doctrine of the future puniſhment, as hath been ſtated, is abundantly confirmed, by, and throughout the whole conſtitution of the goſpel. A right view of the goſpel conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:019737_0091_0FACA45A6DCE68F0"/>
is of great moment on all accounts; and particularly, for the deciſion of this controverſy. This well ſtated and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, we apprehend ſufficient to determine it, to ſatisfaction. I would therefore exhibit, a general view of it,—and then a number of particulars, which all conſpire with united force to one central point—a clear deciſion of the matter in diſpute. This divine conſtitution, is a conſtitution of government and mercy." AS AN INSTITUTION of government, it is fitted and deſigned by infinite wiſdom, to exhibit, ſupport, illuſtrate and exalt the character, authority and government of God in higheſt glory, in the ſalvation of periſhing ſinners of mankind. It is fitted and deſigned to reduce us, to a willing, cordial ſubjection and obedience, in the way preſcribed, by conſtitution. And is a diſcipline of the heart and life, to form the minds and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of mankind in this ſtate, to a meetneſs for the heavenly inheritance; and is inforced with the higheſt ſanctions in nature, in the univerſe, thoſe of eternity. As an inſtitution of mercy, it is deſigned to exhibit to us, the eternal plan of mercy in Chriſt, plainly and particularly, as to "the terms," "the way" and "the time;" in which, mercy and ſalvation may be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by it. This, being moſt eſſential and important for us to know, is made as plain, as it is important. This door of mercy and ſalvation is now opened to the whole world, upon the ſame terms; but is limited to this life and ſtate. At this cloſe, it is ſhut up forever. The letter, ſpirit, and whole frame of the goſpel conſtitution, ſhews it made for mankind in this ſtate; and not in the future: and that mercy and ſalvation muſt be obtained in this world, or never. Herein, are ſet forth the two grand periods of limitation as to time, when mercy may be had by us. This life to every one individually—and the end of this world, to the whole race of mankind. Then the ſcene cloſeth in a ſtate eſſentially different in reſpect to the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the divine government itſelf, and all the ſubjects of it. Then, this inſtitution of mercy will operate no more, in way of mercy and relief to thoſe who are loſt: but end, with the finiſhing the adminiſtration of Chriſt's kingdom; who now rules, diſciplines and ſaves them that are ſaved, by this conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. Yet, this conſtitution as an inſtrument of government, will remain in full force—and operate moſt ſtrongly, but in a

way eſſentially different from what it now doth, viz. as a rule of judgment and final deciſion of the ſtates of all mankind;— and in the way of rewards and puniſhments, only.</p>
               <p>This we apprehend to be a juſt, general exhibition and view of the goſpel conſtitution, in the nature, deſign and operations of it, reſpecting mankind. A few illuſtrations will ſhew the juſtneſs and confirm the truth of it. The tenor of the revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God, exhibits the following important truths in their connection, viz. This world made and earth given to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men, for a temporary ſtate of reſidence and abode— mankind, in ſucceſſive generations introduced upon this The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre, as being made, acting, and deſigned for a future and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſtate. The word of God, the covenant of his grace in every diſpenſation of it; with the miniſtry, inſtitutions and ſervices of religion appointed by God: together with the whole oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy of providence in all it's diſpenſations of light and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, mercies, judgments, trials, &amp;c. all fitted and deſigned in way of diſcipline, to form the minds, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> and characters of mankind for a future and eternal judgment, and an eternal ſtate of retribution. All centering in the grand concluſion, "that this ſtate and world, to mankind, is a ſtate of diſcipline and trial, only—the next, the inviſible one, a ſtate of rewards and puniſhments, only;" as contraſted with the idea of diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, or change of character and ſtate. And the more cloſely we attend to the tenor, ſpirit, and complexion of the goſpel conſtitution, the evidence of it, riſes more clear, ſtrong and irreſiſtable. For the proviſion of mercy made in it, is not for the fallen angels and the diſobedient ſpirits of mankind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned with them, to the infernal priſon: for verily our Saviour "took not on him the nature of angels," (to be a mediator for the fallen angels, and their aſſociates in miſery) "but he took on him the ſeed of Abraham;"<note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. 2.16.</note> to be a mediator for mankind; to carry into effect the goſpel plan of mercy in this world. And the whole oeconomy and diſpenſation of Chriſt's kingdom in this world, clearly evinces this conſtitution made for mankind in this ſtate, and it's ſaving operations limited, to this world. The grand apparatus of all ſaving means therein appointed, are for this world only; and not the future. "The
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:019737_0093_0FACA45C00B44858"/>
goſpel is the power of God to ſalvation to every one who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth in this life, only: the miniſtry of reconciliation is to reconcile men to God in this world, only: the ordinances of this conſtitution are for this ſtate, only: none will be admitted by baptiſm into our Lord's kingdom, in the inviſible world; and the ordinance of the Lord's ſupper will be no more (the end of it being compleatly anſwered) when, at the end of this world, our Lord ſhall come and finiſh his kingdom with infinite glory: and the diſcipline of his kingdom is for this ſtate only, "that men may not be condemned with the world" in the day of judgment. Likewiſe the addreſs and invitations of mercy and offers of ſalvation are all to men in this ſtate, only: not a ſingle one extended to thoſe in the infernal priſon. The wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God cries aloud, "Unto you O men, I call, and my voice is to the ſons of men."<note n="‡" place="bottom">Prov. 8.4.</note> All the means of grace, by way of ſeeking, ſtriving, &amp;c. are appointed and preſcribed only to mankind in this ſtate.<note n="‖" place="bottom">We have before noted, the Dr. tells us, Seaſ.

"He that believeth in this life, ſhall be ſaved" in the world to come. "He that believeth not" in this life, ſhall be damned in the world to come. The commands to believe and repent, inforced with moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious encouragements, are only to men in this world:—not a ſingle command or encouragement to any, in the future ſtate. And moſt of the commanded duties, thoſe of ſelf-denial, chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, &amp;c. are peculiar to this ſtate. Above all, the great promiſes and threatnings, to inforce the terms of life and requiſitions of duty preſcribed in this conſtitution; are made, to things done or not done, in this life. Not a ſingle promiſe or threatning to any thing, as done or not done, in the future ſtate. Which is a demonſtration, it is wholly adapted to mankind in this world, and will never operate to ſave any, that die in their ſins. When men die out of this world, they die out of this conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and can have no benefit by it, but what is connected with their tranſactions in this life. "For there is none of this work and device, to be done after we go to the grave."<note n="†" place="bottom">Eccl. 9.10.</note> "The night cometh, ſays our Lord, when no man can work."<note n="§" place="bottom">John 9.4.</note> Meaning

the works of this life, preparatory to eternal life. Paul tells us, "after death (without change of character or ſtate) the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment."<note n="¶" place="bottom">Heb. 9.27.</note> Then will all be judged and execution be done, "according to their works and the things done in the body." We before obſerved, that our Lord teacheth us, in the parable of the rich man and Lazarus, that at death good and bad, enter into a ſtate, not of diſcipline, but of retribution. And he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes the penitent thief, "this day ſhalt thou be with me in paradiſe." We read "of the ſpirits of the juſt made perfect," and of unimbodied "ſpirits, of diſobedient mankind, in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon." Moreover, as the whole goſpel conſtitution is thus e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently adapted to mankind in this ſtate; and all the means and ſaving operations of it, thus uniformly repreſented as limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to this life and ſtate: ſo it is of importance to add—"all the promiſes of the Spirit of all grace (the adorable ſanctifier of all that are and ever will be ſaved) are made to men in this life only." All hopes of the Spirit's ſtriving with the wicked, end at death. For the Lord hath declared, "his Spirit ſhall not always ſtrive with man." And as a confirming teſtimony of it to the world, he brought the flood upon the old world, and ſhortned the life of man, Gen. 6.3. Now, if his ſtrivings with men be not limited to this life and world, and if he is ever to be given to them after death and in torment; this ſhortening the life of man, could be no confirming evidence, "that he ſhould not always ſtrive with man." To ſuppoſe it, is to deſtroy this public witneſs and teſtimony of God. All the promiſes of the Spirit given us by the prophets, (and they abound with them to the church of God, for the converſion of Jews and Gentiles, &amp;c.) are evidently made, to mankind in this ſtate, only. Was it true, that ſo great a change was ever to be made by his grace, in the damned, as they tell of; it is incredible beyond expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that no promiſe, no notice ſhould be given of it. He is not to be given to them, and therefore we are ſolemnly cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned "to grieve not the Spirit," accompanied with that preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing earneſt, "to day, after ſo long a time; to day, if you will hear his voice, hearden not your hearts."<note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. 4.7.</note> In the day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we are told, the wicked "ſhall be puniſhed with an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord;" but where
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:019737_0095_0FACA4A9EED2C930"/>
the Spirit of the Lord is, there is his preſence to purpoſe.— This ſentence then cuts of all hope of this gift, to ſanctify and ſave them.</p>
               <p>It is very clear in this conſtitution, that all who are now heirs and ſhall finally poſſeſs the great ſalvation "are new creatures, created in Chriſt to good works" by the grace of this divine Spirit. "They are w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But all hopes of ſalvation, to them (that die in their ſins) by the ſacrifice and Spirit of Chriſt, is intirely cut off, by that declaration of Paul, Gal. 3.13, 14. "That he was made a curſe, that we might receive the promiſe of the Spirit, through faith." It is obvious from this text, that the ſacrifice of Chriſt is not deſigned, nor will operate to the ſalvation of any, but thoſe who receive the promiſe and gift of the Spirit:—and it is equally obvious, that the faith, by which we receive the promiſe, is a grace in this life:—and a-like evident, that the purpoſe for which the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is made and the Spirit is given, "is ſanctification and holineſs in this life." "That we being delivered out of the hands of our enemies, might ſerve him without fear, in holineſs and righteouſneſs before him, all the days of our life."<note n="‖" place="bottom">Luke 1.70, to 76.</note> "That we through the Spirit, might mortify the deeds of the body and live," &amp;c. &amp;c. Conſequently, as no promiſe of the Spirit is made to them that die in ſin and unbelief—after this life:— and as it is impoſſible to them, to receive the Spirit in that ſtate, to anſwer the grand purpoſe, for which he is purchaſed, promiſed, and given in this life: ſo, all poſſibility of ſalvation is cut off to them, by this declaration of the preſcribed method of ſalvation, in the goſpel conſtitution. For "the method of grace eſtabliſhed in this conſtitution, has all along been, now is, and always will be, the only way of life, for ſinful man."<note n="*" place="bottom">So the Dr. tells us in his note, Sermons p. 38.</note> In this curſory view, it ſeems very evident, that mankind under this divine conſtitution are in a ſtate of inſtruction, diſcipline and trial for improvement, and that this life and ſtate is their only ſeaſon for ſecuring mercy and ſalvation: and that all ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing means, and the grace of the Divine Spirit to render then effectual to ſalvation, are limited to this life and world.

A moſt unſcriptural, obnoxious, unaccountable ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent! We truſt we have ſaid enough already to ſhew Paul teaches the contrary doctrine in the paſſage whence they would collect it. And our Saviour in his parables, in conjunction with the whole current of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, deciſively teaches the contrary. I would alſo ſubjoin the Dr's wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt it. In his ſermons, "Breaking bread a goſpel inſtitution," p. 47. he tells us, There is no other "coming of Chriſt" ſpoken of in ſcripture, but his "coming at the end of the world, in the glory of his Father, with his holy angels," when a period will be put to the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of God's kingdom in its preſent form." And p. 48. he will not come until the "myſtery of God is finiſhed, and time ſhall be no more." On which I obſerve, "the coming of Chriſt" mentioned 1 Cor. 15.23, is his coming to judgment, for there is none other ſpoken of in ſcripture. Then the Dr. ſaith, "a period will be put to the adminiſtration of the kingdom of God in its preſent form." Now we read of no other change in adminiſtration, but that deſcribed v. 28. "the Son himſelf ſubject, and God all in all." Surely, this change will not take place, till the Son hath compleated his whole work with which he is intruſted to bring into effect. In this the Dr. is expreſs, "he will not come until the myſtery of God is finiſhed:" and when this is finiſhed, ſurely there can be no great deal, nor any thing more to be done; nor any long period requiſite for ſuch a purpoſe: nor can there be any next ſtate, as temporary, after the judgment: for the Dr. is expreſs, "time ſhall be no more." And in page 37, he repreſents thoſe who are not awakened to life in this world, as "undone for the future world;" if "undone for the future world," they cannot have everlaſting life in it.</note> This illuſtration and confirmation of the general exhibit given of the goſpel conſtitution, ſeems fully deciſive. Since the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of revelation, the letter, ſpirit, and whole frame of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel conſtitution, exhibits it to the world made for mankind in this world and not in the future—and all the ſaving means, grace and operations of it in recovering ſubjects of mercy to eternal life, are limited to this life and world. Will all men be ſaved at the day of judgment? No, the conſtitution an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces and aſſures us, in that day, all the wicked will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by ſentence and execution to an everlaſting puniſhment in righteous retribution, "for the things done in the body." And further, that all hope of end, or reſtitution from that ſtate of puniſhment, is eternally cut off; becauſe the adminiſtration of the kingdom of mercy comes to an everlaſting end with the deciſions of that day. What now is the obvious, and irreſiſtable
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:019737_0098_0FACA4AC29C1B668"/>
concluſion? Thus cut off and caſt out of the kingdom, their miſery muſt be as laſting and endleſs as their immortality; by the force of that conſtitution "which all along has been, now is, and always will be the only way of life for ſinful man." Their ſtate becomes as abſolutely hopeleſs, as though no plan of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy had ever been concerted; and no conſtitution of grace and ſalvation in purſuance of it had ever been exhibited to the world. Should it be aſked, is there no hope or poſſibility that this conſtitution may be ſet aſide, and another ſubſtituted to give relief to them that finally periſh? Were it ſo, this is of no avail to the univerſaliſts; for their ſcheme is, that proviſion and ſecurity of ſalvation for all men is made in the goſpel plan of mercy: of courſe, were this poſſible, their ſcheme is in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute ruins—they are reduced to the ſame ſandy foundation of hope with the infidel world. But let us conſider the impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of it. Can that conſtitution ever be ſet aſide, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of which is ſo often dignified in the lofty ſtile, the kingdom of heaven? concerted in heaven, ſent down from thence to execute the eternal plan of mercy in this world and conduct us to heaven? when, as an inſtitution of government it is, for wiſdom, benevolence, juſtice, energy and glory, the moſt amazing ever introduced into the univerſe? and when the greateſt ſacrifice ever made, that of the only begotten Son of God, is made in ſupport of the authority, laws and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, to make way for the introduction and ſupport of it, and to inſure the eternal energy and efficacy of it? Can it be ſet aſide after it hath ſtood for ages, ſupported by innumerable miracles and immediate atteſtations of God, as well as by the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:019737_0099_0FACA3D729256AB0"/>
of millions and millions that periſhed in the flood, in So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Ghomorrha, in the devoted nations of Canaan, with the Amalekites, the rebellious Iſraelites, &amp;c. &amp;c. whoſe deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were in ſupport of the juſtice and honour of it? likewiſe, after it hath been ſupported by ſalvations beyond annumerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, given to the heirs of ſalvation, and to thoſe in all ages who have been faithful in the ſupport of this divine conſtitution? Can the eternal ſanctions of rewards and puniſhments in it, be ſet aſide, when they are the great neceſſary ſupports of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral government of God through the univerſe? and ſo eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally neceſſary to ſupport this conſtitution, to illuſtrate the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite importance of it, and to inforce the terms and requiſitions of it? add to this, when it is the great charter of ſalvation to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful men to all that ſhall ever be ſaved, and the only baſis of their hope and ſecurity of everlaſting life? Can this foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Zion fail them? In a word, when the authority, wiſdom, truth, juſtice, goodneſs, and immutability of God, and glory to God in the higheſt, as the end of it are all pledged for the ſecurity and ſupport of it? Theſe things conſidered, is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to conceive of a greater impoſſibility than that it ſhould ever be ſet aſide? Wherefore we conclude this conſtitution as hath been explained, muſt undoubtedly remain without change, in full force, while there is perfection in the deity, or govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſtability to be found in the univerſe. The ſubject may yet appear clearer, when ſome particulars of the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are conſidered. This ſubject ſuggeſts the following re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections.</p>
               <p>Reflection 1. How aſtoniſhingly glorious this divine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution! It is ſurely worthy the acceptation of the whole world; with the moſt full, firm, cordial and obediential faith. For herein a moſt glorious way of ſalvation is opened to ſinful man, ſure, ſtedfaſt and immovable; wherein all the moral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of God are moſt brightly diſplayed. Wherein the glory of the everlaſting Father, of the eternal Son the redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and Spirit the ſanctifier; and the glory of the mercy and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of God, ſhine forth in higheſt and eternal luſtre, in the contrivance, the conſtruction, the adminiſtration, the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and final iſſues of it.</p>
               <p>Reflection 2. How inexcuſable the infidel world, who reject
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:019737_0100_0FACA3D7ED86A9C0"/>
the goſpel conſtitution, which carries in it ſuch numerous, plain, inconteſtible marks of it's divine original, which proclaim it to be of God?</p>
               <p>Reflection 3. How inexcuſable are the neglectors of this great ſalvation? ſince the God of love, in the goſpel conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hath publiſhed to the world his adorable plan of mercy and ſalvation for periſhing mankind; and hath opened the door to all upon the ſame gracious terms. And addreſſes our ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity and all the tender feelings of our hearts, with his infinite benevolence in gift and deſign. "God ſo loved the world as to give his only begotten ſon"—this is the unſpeakable gift— "that whoſoever believeth in him" of all ages, nations and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, "ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life:" this is his all-important deſign. Since he hath ſet him at the head of this glorious kingdom of mercy, to compleat the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of all that believe in him. And under his reign, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſeth us with the univerſal offer of it—whoſoever will may come—and "he that believeth ſhall be ſaved." And hath put it upon the loweſt terms poſſible, which can conſiſt with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his adorable authority, majeſty and government. "Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and thou ſhalt be ſaved;" "repent, turn and live." And God hath graciouſly furniſhed us with all deſirable ſaving means, accompanied with an abundant encouragement of all-ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent grace in the due uſe of them. And to induce and inforce our compliance with the terms of life, he not only addreſſes to our ingenuity and tender feeling, which are but feeble ſprings of action in degenerate minds; but alſo to our hopes and fears, the moſt powerful ſprings of action in our natures. And to theſe he addreſſes the higheſt and ſtrongeſt motives in nature and eternity. With the hope "of eternal life," and fear "of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting puniſhment." "He that believeth ſhall be ſaved, and he that believeth not ſhall be damned." Surely if we are found among the neglectors of ſo great ſalvation, and periſh from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a conſtitution which ſo exalts us, as to heaven, of all men we muſt be among the moſt miſerable. For how juſt, how neceſſary by conſtitution, and how aggravated ſuch a damnation? If "he that deſpiſed Moſes law, died without mercy, under two or three witneſſes," "of how much ſorer puniſhment ſhall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:019737_0101_0FACA3D8A882FCA8"/>
God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was ſanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done deſpite unto the ſpirit of Grace." Heb. 10.28, 29.</p>
               <p>Reflection 4. The immutability and eternal duration of this divine conſtitution, doth indeed carry in it eternal terrors to ſinners who go on in their ſins to perdition; but withal brings to them the higheſt encouragements in this life to "turn and live." The inſtruction is, believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt with a living, obediential faith, and this great ſalvation is aſſuredly yours. The importunate language of it is, "to day, while it is called to day, hearken to his his gracious voice"— comply with his gracious terms, that you may eſcape the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deſtruction of the threatning, and inherit the unſpeakable good and glory of the promiſes. Finally, this divine conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution addreſſes to believers, to all the faithful in the family of God, the language of ſtrongeſt encouragement, ſupport and conſolation in running the chriſtian race, and maintaining the chriſtian warfare faithful to the end. In this way their victory and triumph, their ſalvation and glory, will be ſure and everlaſting. For this purpoſe the eternal plan of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy was concerted and is publiſhed to the world in this conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, "he that hath begun will finiſh his good work" in infinite perfection and glory. Their Redeemer is Almighty —he is at the head of this kingdom of mercy—he hath open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the way and eſtabliſhed the foundation and eternal ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of it in his own great ſacrifice—he hath all power in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth—power all-ſufficient to ſubdue his enemies and compleat the ſalvation of his people; and he will reign till he hath compleated his work, and the "myſtery of God is finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed." He will never give up the kingdom till he comes in his glory, to take vengeance on his enemies, and puniſh them with everlaſting deſtruction and compleat the ſalvation of all that are his: to be eternally "admired and glorified in all that believe." What an addreſs of encouragement, ſupport, and comfort this to all true mourners in Zion, to all the feeble and faint-hearted in the flock of God, in all their afflictions, trials and conflicts? they ſhall return to the heavenly Zion, with everlaſting joys and ſongs of ſalvation. We now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to conſider ſeveral particulars of this divine conſtitution,
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:019737_0102_0FACA3D966D0B8C8"/>
which all conſpire with united force to a deciſion of this contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy. As firſt, the eſſential and neceſſary terms of life and ſalvation ſet forth in the goſpel conſtitution and proclamation, cut off all hope and poſſibility of ſalvation to thoſe that die in their ſins. For by this conſtitution, ſalvation depends on cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain terms as embraced or rejected by ſinful men, in this life. I ſhall illuſtrate it in the article of goſpel faith only: this is made abſolutely and eſſentially neceſſary in this life to ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. There is no declaration or promiſe of God to be a ground of faith, nor command to believe, nor promiſe or encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to induce faith, nor grace to effect it with divine power to any, beyond the grace. And yet faith is ſo neceſſary, "that no man can be in a ſtate of acceptance with God, till he is a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever;" and "men's being believers or unbelievers is the grand diſtinction the ſcripture makes between them," and "ſo intereſting that ſalvation or damnation depends upon it."<note n="*" place="bottom">See the Dr's note, Sermons p. 175.</note> The indiſpenſible neceſſity of faith to ſalvation, is ſet forth many ways—by conſtitution, ſalvation turns upon it. "He that believeth is paſſed from death to life," "hath everlaſting life," and "he that hath the Son hath life," and "he that hath not the Son hath not life," "ſhall not ſee life." By conſtitution, it holds an immediate, inſeparable connection with it: by command, "believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt and thou ſhalt be ſaved:" by promiſe, "he that believeth ſhall be ſaved:" by declaration, "the goſpel is the power of God to ſalvation to every one that believeth," Jew or Gentile— "we are ſaved through faith" and believers receive actual "ſalvation as the end of their faith."<note n="‡" place="bottom">1 Pet. 1.9.</note> Hereby thoſe who die in unbelief are evidently cut off from ſalvation. They can't be ſaved without this term ſo immediately and inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly connected with it: and it is impoſſible they can ever ſay, "we are ſaved through faith" "and receive ſalvation as the end of faith" in the ſenſe of this conſtitution. Moreover, no one can be ſaved without the prerequiſite qualification<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> made eſſentially neceſſary to it by conſtitution; which are all eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially connected with faith. I mention only our juſtification, adoption and ſanctification. No one can be ſaved who is not in a ſtate of juſtification and life: for till then he has no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:019737_0103_0FACA3DA35B1D1B0"/>
of ſin and title to life; but is under condemnation and wrath. And juſtification and glorification are inſeparably connected together, Rom. 8.30. and it is moſt evident in this divine conſtitution, that faith is the appointed medium "of our juſtification to eternal life, and is eſſentially neceſſary to it. Paul teaches it abundantly in his epiſtles to the Romans, Galatians, &amp;c. "that the juſt do live by faith," "that the righteouſneſs of God is by faith of Jeſus Chriſt unto all and upon all that believe," (unto juſtification and life) and "there is no difference." They "being juſtified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Chriſt Jeſus, whom God hath ſet forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteouſneſs," "that he might be juſt and the juſtifier of every one who believeth in Jeſus." And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduces believing Abraham as an example of juſtification by faith, as a pattern (in the terms and method of ſalvation) of all true believers, and the father of the faithful, that ſhall ever be ſaved. And draws his concluſion once and again, "therefore we conclude a man is juſtified by faith," "therefore being juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by faith," &amp;c. And declares, "Chriſt is the end of the law for righteouſneſs to every one that believeth." Rom. 10.4. So that "grace, Chriſt and faith are all neceſſary to juſtification of life, and the latter as truly as the former, tho' in a different view."<note n="§" place="bottom">See Sermons, p. 162, at the bottom. Ibidem, p. 158, at the top.</note> "The plain truth is, the juſtification of life, tho" the gift of God's grace, and his gift thro' the obedience of Chriſt to death, is no where in the ſacred writings, ſaid to be beſtowed upon ſinners in common:<note n="‡" place="bottom">This and other paſſages of the Dr. is in direct contradiction to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Rom. 5.18. Their conſtruction is, that juſtification of life is "to ſinners in common," the gift of it is to "all men, believers and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers." The Dr. reſtricts it to the ſubjects "of faith in Jeſus Chriſt." Their conſtruction muſt be falſe, for it makes the apoſtle directly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict and overthrow the doctrine of juſtification by faith, which he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours with ſuch pains and force of argument to eſtabliſh and confirm in this epiſtle and elſewhere: for if juſtification of life is come upon all unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, it certainly is not come to them through faith. Of neceſſity then, by all men, in this text, we muſt underſtand all that are in Chriſt by faith, his ſpiritual ſeed, the heirs of faith agreeable to his main ſubject, "the juſtified by faith," v. 1.—"who being juſtified, ſhall be ſaved from wrath through him," v. 9.—who have received "the atonement and reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation," v. 11.—"who have received abundance of grace and the gift of righteouſneſs," v. 17.—Nor can final unbelievers ever be the ſubjects of this faith, nor of this juſtification of life, which includes exemption from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation and ſuffering the future torments. This cannot be till both parts of a contradiction can be true.</note> neither are the ſinners, upon whom it is beſtowed, pointed out by their names; but by this grand characteriſtic, "faith in Jeſus Chriſt." Now, as unbelievers that die in their ſins, can never exerciſe this faith ſo eſſentially
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:019737_0104_0FACA3DAECD7DFA8"/>
neceſſary to their juſtification and life; the conſequence is clear, by this conſtitution they are and will be conſigned to eternal condemnation and wrath. It is evident likewiſe, that none but the children of God, by regeneration and adoption, will ever inherit his eternal kingdom. The apoſtle ſets forth this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection, "if children, then heirs, heirs of God and joint heirs with Chriſt."<note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. 8.17.</note> And by this heirſhip we riſe to the heavenly inheritance. Now, our adoption, as well as juſtification, is by the medium of faith, only. "But to as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the ſons of God, even to them that believe on his name."<note n="§" place="bottom">John 1.12.</note> "For ye are all the children of God by faith in Chriſt Jeſus."<note n="‡" place="bottom">Gal. 3.26.</note> They therefore who die without this faith, are not the children of God, nor can inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit with them in his eternal kingdom. Sanctification is alike neceſſary to qualify, to meeten us for and inſure us ſalvation. And this alſo is eſſentially connected with faith, as the living principle of it. And the faith that ſaves and by which "the juſt do live," is every where in ſcripture diſtinguiſhed from all others, by its ſanctifying operations and fruits. "It will have a powerful influence on men's hearts and lives:" and is ſpoken of as that which "purifies the heart,"<note n="†" place="bottom">Acts 15.9.</note> "works by love;"<note n="‖" place="bottom">Gal. 5.6.</note> as that "which overcometh the world:"<note n="§§" place="bottom">1 John 5.4.</note> "Yea as that which is a living, active, never-failing principle of all holy obedience to the laws of God."<note n="‖‖" place="bottom">Seaſ. Tho'ts, p. 31.</note> "And there can be no true virtue, goſpel holineſs or good works in a religious ſenſe, only as they proceed from a principle of faith in Chriſt, and ſuch a temper of ſoul as will argue men to be the children of God, and born from above."<note n="‡‡" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 279.</note> "'Tis plain from the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that ſalvation by grace, through Chriſt, is in the way of obedience; ſuch an obedience as proceeds from a heart puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied

The texts to this purpoſe are ſcattered all over the writings of the evangeliſts and apoſtles: nor is there any room to diſpute in this matter."<note n="*" place="bottom">Seaſ. Tho'ts. p. 200</note> Now it is very evident, "as no proviſion of mercy is made for ſinners continuing ſuch," ſo thoſe that die in their ſins, will be excluded ſalvation in the day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and muſt remain eternally excluded from it: Becauſe it will be forever impoſſible, they ſhould have that faith, juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, adoption and ſanctification preſcribed and made eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially neceſſary to ſalvation by this conſtitution; wherein "faith in the promiſed ſeed (the adorable Meſſiah) has all along been, now is, and always will be, the only way of life for ſinful man."</p>
               <p>We add, no one can be ſaved by all the proviſion, grace and mercy in the goſpel proclamation in any way, but in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the terms of life ſet forth in it. It is of the nature of all proclamations of mercy both of God and man, "to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit the plan and method of mercy, to diſcriminate the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of mercy, and to aſcertain, limit and bound it by the terms of mercy ſet forth in them." There is one conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to both, viz. "the terms of mercy and life ſet forth," "are a moſt eſſential part of them." All hope beyond this is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute preſumption, is unreaſonable, unſcriptural, and againſt the common ſenſe of mankind. And the terms of life and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in the goſpel proclamation, are ſo eſſential they muſt be ſupported in all their neceſſity and importance to anſwer the great deſigns of it, to ſupport the authority and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, do honour to it, and to inforce compliance with the terms and requiſitions of it, ſubjection and obedience: all hope of it without is vain. And this affords an eaſy, concluſive anſwer to all their arguments drawn from the terms of "uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſality" found in the goſpel proclamation. It is freely al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, terms of "univerſality" are uſed reſpecting the great atonement. "Chriſt is the Lamb of God, which taketh

                      facs="unknown:019737_0106_0FACA3DC6A052808"

away the ſins of the world;" "he hath made propitiation for our ſins, and not for ours only, but alſo for the ſins of the whole world;" hath taſted death for every man;" i.e. that every man, Jew or Gentile, may be ſaved upon the ſame terms of life: but no one in any other way. The adorable grace of God is ſet forth in terms of "univerſality," by the angel; "I bring you glad tidings of great joy, which ſhall be to all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple" —"peace on earth, good will towards man:" denoting it is of univerſal, infinite importance to all—a door is opened that they may be ſaved on the ſame terms. Again, "God wills all men to be ſaved, and come to the knowledge of the truth" as the means to it. Not only wills it, but enjoins it by all his dread authority, "commanding all men every where to repent for remiſſion of ſins." Yea, enjoins it on all upon peril of damnation: "He that believeth not ſhall be damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed." Now, in that part of the proclamation which exhibits the benevolence and love of God in its higheſt glory, "in gift and deſign," this matter is clearly "aſcertained." Our Lord tells us, John 3.16, "God ſo loved the world that he gave his only begotton Son, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh but have everlaſting life." Here the plan of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is exhibited clearly and in full to us, in the adorable ſpring and ſurce of it, the love of God "in the way of its exerciſe," in the gift of his only begotten Son," the ſubjects of mercy are diſcriminated, and the extent of mercy expreſsly limited by terms, to "whoſoever believeth in him ſhall not periſh, but have everlaſting life." Is this declaration upon the plan of the univerſal ſalvation of all men, or of thoſe only "who believe?" Did not our Lord underſtand the plan of mercy, he came to publiſh and carry into execution? Doth he nor give it to us, moſt truly and faithfully? Surely. Then, there is no room for a moment's heſitation, his declaration is deciſive "all that believe ſhall be ſaved," the reſt ſhall periſh, as excluded, by the terms of ſalvation ſet forth in the proclamation, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignedly deſcriminate "the ſubjects of mercy and life." The univerſaliſts argue the atonement, grace and mercy are ſet forth in univerſal terms, and in this partial view of the ſubject, infer —therefore "all men ſhall eventually be ſaved." The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion is falſe. And the error of it is manifeſt; becauſe, in
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:019737_0107_0FACA3DD2F9EEEE8"/>
this way, the terms of life and ſalvation ſet up in the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and proclamation, which make "a moſt eſſential part of it," are excluded; and the concluſion drawn, not only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, but in direct oppoſition to them. Whereas all the eſſential parts of the proclamation, with its deſign, muſt be taken together to form a right concluſion: and then it will be directly contrary to theirs, viz. that all thoſe who "believe" and comply with the terms of life, and thoſe only, "ſhall be ſaved." To the deciſion of this important queſtion, who of mankind ſhall finally be ſaved? the general terms of grace and mercy muſt of neceſſity be limited in their conſtruction, by "the particular terms of life and ſalvation" which "diſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate the ſubjects of it;" otherwiſe we introduce an irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable oppoſition and contradiction between them: making the terms of life neceſſary as they are by conſtitution, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary, as final unbelievers will be ſaved without them: which is abſurd. Their conſtruction exhibits the wiſdom of God which hath appointed theſe terms of life—the grace of God which hath given them to periſhing ſinners—and the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of God which hath enjoined them with the higheſt ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, of ſalvation and damnation, to be inconſiſtent in exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, operation and effect, in the ſame plan and conſtitution of mercy: in making theſe eſſential terms both neceſſary and unneceſſary; ſaving ſome with and others without them: which is groſsly abſurd and impious.</p>
               <p>Moreover, their conſtruction totally defeats the important deſigns to be anſwered by the goſpel terms of life. The way of ſalvation by faith is fitted and deſigned to anſwer the moſt important purpoſes in the government of God. For the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God hath appointed faith the medium of our union to Chriſt, and intereſt in all the eternal benefits of his redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to diſplay the righteouſneſs of God, "as juſt and yet the juſtifier of every one who believeth in Jeſus"—"to illuſtrate the riches and glory of his grace" in this way of juſtification and ſalvation—to do infinite honour to the atonement and righteouſneſs of Chriſt"—"to cut off all boaſting and glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the creature"—"to illuſtrate the truth, certainty and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the promiſes made to faith"—and to reduce and ſubject us by faith to the authority and government of God, by means
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:019737_0108_0FACA3DDE6DAF1F8"/>
of which it is reſtored in the hearts of his willing and obedient people to the praiſe of his grace." In a word, it is for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and ſupport of the authority and government of God and glory of his kingdom, in an inſeparable connection with the higheſt good of the faithful, the heirs of faith "in their juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, adoption, ſanctification and final glorification." De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns theſe of ſuch magnitude, glory, and importance as are undoubtedly infinitely too great to be ſacrificed to make way for the ſalvation of the unbelieving and diſobedient. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we conclude no man can be juſtified and ſaved but by the faith of Jeſus Chriſt: ſo that "as no proviſion of mercy is made for ſinners continuing ſuch," final unbelievers muſt ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitably periſh for ever, all the proviſion, grace and mercy of the goſpel proclamation notwithſtanding. So our Lord hath taught us to conceive of this ſubject, to argue and draw our concluſion, in the parable of the ſupper, Luke 14.16 to 25. The proviſion is full and abundant, the invitation is univerſal, but thoſe who do not in this life come in upon the invitation and offer, "ſhall none of them ever taſte of his ſupper." v. 24. Other arguments might be adduced in proof "that the general terms muſt be limited in conſtruction, by "the particular terms of life and ſalvation held forth in the goſpel; but it is needleſs, for common ſenſe teacheth it: (e.g.) Should any of the ſovereignties of the earth, iſſue a proclamation to their ſubjects in rebellion, couched in never ſo ſtrong, general and univerſal terms of grace and benevolence, inforced with the ſtrongeſt aſſurances of pardon and reſtoration to thoſe "who would lay down their arms, ſwear allegiance, ſubmit to govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and become good ſubjects, &amp;c." and ſhould any one take it into his head upon this, to run and preach "glad tidings of great joy"—"all the rebels in the dominion ſhall be pardoned, reſtored, one as well as another," and alledge in proof of it, "the proclamation exhibiting the plan of mercy is full, the terms are univerſal, and it is the very glory of the proclamation that thoſe who do not comply with the terms of mercy and pardon held forth in it, nor anſwer the deſign of it, ſhall be finally pardoned and reſtored as well as thoſe who do; would not every man of common ſenſe, judge ſuch an one delirious, or void of common ſenſe? Still it may be a queſtion, why are
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:019737_0109_0FACA3DEACF64100"/>
ſuch general and univerſal terms made uſe of to ſet forth the proviſion and grace of the goſpel, "if believers only ſhall be ſaved? Since ſome ſuppoſe they are deſigned to teach us "all men ſhall eventually be ſaved," and will admit of no other rational conſtruction. The anſwer is eaſy—the wiſdom and neceſſity of them are plain to be ſhewn, "though all men will not be ſaved, and thoſe only who believe." How could the great deſigns of divine government and mercy be carried into execution without them? No one is inſerted by name, nor would ſuch an inſertion anſwer the deſigns of government in a ſtate of trial. How could the all-ſufficiency of the atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and grace be ſet forth, but in general terms? Again, how could any one (not named) be warranted to hope and truſt in it upon the terms of life, unleſs it was exhibited as all-ſufficient and free to all upon the ſame terms? The terms, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers and commands muſt be univerſal, that all might read their concern in it, and to open a door of hope and ſalvation to all nations and characters of mankind without diſtinction or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of any, on the ſame terms, and that the believing of all nations might be ſaved, and to ſubject the unbelieving and diſobedient to the blame and righteous condemnation which awaits them. This is undoubtedly the deſign of them. This vindicates the wiſdom, uſe and neceſſity of them, though they are neither deſigned nor fitted in any juſt conſtruction of them, in the leaſt to encourage any hope of ſalvation but in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the terms of life held forth to us. Herein we have a clear conſiſtency between the general and particular terms—a perfect harmony in their nature, deſign and uſe. The great object of our Saviour's miniſtry and that of his apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, was evidently to ſet forth the proviſion of ſalvation made for ſinful men, the importance of it, the terms on which it might be had, and to urge compliance with theſe terms as the only way in which any would be finally ſaved. And nothing more diſtant from them, than to teach contempt of theſe terms as diſpenſible, and what would in fact be diſpenſed with to the final neglectors and diſobedient, againſt which their admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and warnings are moſt pointed. As to the numbers of mankind who ſhould finally and eventually be ſaved, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears not to have been the object of their attention; certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:019737_0110_0FACA3E032217348"/>
not of their deciſion. They reſt it on this general iſſue: an "innumerable multitude out of all nations ſhall be ſaved:" as 7th chapter of Revelations, all the believing and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient ſhall be ſaved, but all the diſobedient "ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction." And this ought to be deciſive. Hitherto we have argued all hope and poſſibility of ſalvation to thoſe who die in their ſins, is cut off by the neceſſary and eſſential terms of life held forth in the goſpel conſtitution and proclamation; in which goſpel faith is made ſo abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to it, that "ſalvation or damnation turns upon it:" "it is eſſentially and immediately connected with it many ways;" and eſſentially connected with other pre-requiſites which are made indiſpenſibly neceſſary to ſalvation." In a word, ſo that without it, no one can be ſaved by all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, mercy and grace of this divine proclamation, in the true, juſt and neceſſary conſtruction of it. It is this unfolds "the plan of mercy," "diſcriminates the ſubjects of mercy," "and limits the mercy to thoſe who comply with the terms of life herein ſet forth." All hope beyond is abſurd, fatal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption. In this way we ſee all hopes are entirely cut off to final unbelievers, without conſidering the damnatory clauſes annexed to inforce the terms. But theſe are annexed, yea, are an eſſential of this divine conſtitution and proclamation, and do more ſtrongly confirm the ſame concluſion. For it is as true, "he that believeth not ſhall be damned," as "he that believeth ſhall be ſaved," and theſe are oppoſite the one to the other: ſo that he who is a ſubject of the curſe cannot be of the bleſſing. This is of ſuch great weight as deſerves a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct diſcuſſion. Wherefore we obſerve, ſecondly, the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that die in their ſins, are by goſpel conſtitution all proſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed and forever excluded the kingdom of God and eternal life, and conſigned to a puniſhment which excludes all hope and poſſibility of it.

We have it from the higheſt authority, the Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, John 3.36, "He that believeth on the Son hath ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life;" "and he that believeth not ſhall not ſee life (i.e. ſhall not enjoy everlaſting life) but the wrath of God abideth on him." Paul announces it in a manner of addreſs that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports it one of the moſt plain, ſure and important truths of the goſpel, which he preſumed no chriſtian could be ignorant of and no one would deny. 1 Cor. 6.10, 11. "Know ye <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, ſays he, (i.e. by the plain doctrine and conſtitution of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel) that the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the kingdom of God?" and to put it forever out of all doubt adds, "be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abuſers of themſelves with mankind, nor thieves, nor cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, ſhall inherit the kingdom of God:" intending, no doubt, thoſe whoſe charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters theſe are at death &amp; the final judgment. It was his conſtant doctrine, of which he reminds the Galatians; concluding his annumeration of the works of the fleſh thus, "of the which I tell you before, as I have alſo told you in time paſt, that they which do ſuch things ſhall not inherit the kingdom of God." Gal. 5.21. To the ſame purpoſe are Epheſ. 5.5. Rev. 21.8. and by an unalterable ſtatute of this conſtitution, it is written, Heb. 12.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>4. "without holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord." And by many poſitive declarations before cited, which need not be repeated, the wicked are conſigned to the damnation of hell. There is no conſtitution in the world where ſtatutes of proſcription to traitors and enemies are more plain, and ſo in-wro't in the conſtitution, as thoſe in the goſpel againſt the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally diſobedient. Now every one knows the force and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of ſtatutes of proſcription, viz. that the juſtly proſcribed cannot inherit with the good and faithful ſubjects in the ſtate and kingdom where proſcribed, while the ſtatutes remain in force. They do not inſtitute a ſuit in courts of law and juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice being ſure of condemnation in them. They apply (if ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication for relief be made) to the ſupreme legiſlature, for a repeal of ſtatute, or to be ſuperſeded by an act of grace, as their only hope. Vain therefore are the hopes of thoſe who die in their ſins: for theſe goſpel ſtatutes and declarations can never be ſuperſeded or vacated. They are in-wrought in the
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:019737_0112_0FACA3E1A857C240"/>
divine conſtitution as an eſſential part of it. As an inſtrument of government, they are as important as the privileges of it; and they are as unalterable and laſting as the promiſes of it. The promiſes and threatnings conſtitute the wiſdom, ſtrength and glory of the conſtitution—both are given with the ſame merciful deſign, to inforce the terms and requiſitions of it: both are from the ſame authority; and both have the ſame founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſupport, viz. the wiſdom, goodneſs, juſtice, truth and immutability of God. All the hopes and ſecurity of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, as well as fears of the wicked, are dependent on it. The whole muſt be eſtabliſhed or periſh forever. Our opponants imagine it may be partly maintained and partly ſuperſeded,— but this is impoſſible in the nature and foundation of it, and is inconſiſtent with all idea of divine wiſdom and perfection. They maintain in ſome future period, at or after the day of judgment, the condemning ſtatutes and threatnings will be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſeded and vacated, and an univerſal reſtoration take place; then the conſtitution is deſtroyed, and all the ſecurities of it, periſh with it. And inſtead of the ſalvation of all men, it terminates in this moſt ſhocking of all concluſions, viz. an utter uncertainty whether any ſon or daughter of mankind ſhall ever inherit eternal life. So infinitely pernicious and deſtructive is this horrid error; but we are aſſured this "word of the Lord will endure forever"—"that not a jot or tittle of it ſhall fail, but all ſhall be fulfilled." And we are plainly told, the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of theſe excluding ſtatutes in the day of judgment and throughout eternity, Rev. 20.11. to the end. It is written, viz. "and I ſaw the dead, ſmall and great, ſtand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of thoſe things which are written in the books, according to their works." By "the book of life" we may underſtand "the book of divine revelation" which deſcribes the characters of thoſe who ſhall inherit eternal life; and in thoſe characters "their names are as inſerted and regiſtered, for life. And all whoſe names are not thus found written, are proſcribed to future condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and puniſhment, as v. 15. "and whoſoever was not found written in the book of life, was caſt into the lake of fire." And in v. 10. their puniſhment is deſcribed as "never-ceaſing and
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:019737_0113_0FACA3E26A122828"/>
never-ending;" "and ſhall be tormented day and night for ever and ever." This we have ſhewn is "the imported puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in every deſcription of it;" and that it is repeatedly "aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted to be everlaſting" in words and phraſes emphatically expreſſive of "eternity, and by figures the moſt emphatical— "by fire unquenchable" "a fire that ſhall never be quenched" and "a worm that dieth not." If the figure be dropped and we attend to the meaning, if this doth not mean "a puniſhment that ſhall never have an end" it can mean nothing, or ſomething directly contrary to the natural and ſtrong purport of it; which is abſurd and impious. And it is confirmed, by examples of deſtruction in which all hope of deliverance and reſtitution is barred by an impoſſibility natural, or moral, or both. Thus St. Peter teacheth us, "the old world periſhed,"<note n="§" place="bottom">2 Pet. 3.6.</note> with its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants: conſequently, Noah and his family came as to a new world after the flood. Which makes it naturally impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that thoſe who ſo periſhed, ſhould ever be reſtored again to the ſame ſtate as before, with Noah. God had ſworn the unbelieving Iſraelites ſhould not enter into his reſt; and they were deſtroyed in purſuance of his oath: which oath, made the poſſeſſion of this reſt, morally impoſſible to them. Sodom and Ghomorrha are uninhabitable, which renders their reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion naturally impoſſible; and they were deſigned of God to be enſamples of perpetual deſtruction, in this world and the world to come, and are ſo improved by the prophets and apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles; which renders their reſtitution likewiſe, morally impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And theſe examples are as fatal to their doctrine of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, as reſtitution. For if the future puniſhment, be by way of diſcipline, why are theſe enſamples choſen, who all periſhed in diſpenſations of vindictive wrath only, without mercy—not for any good to them that periſhed, but for the honour of the authority, juſtice and government of God; and by way of admonition, for the good of others in this world? why are they choſen, in preference of the many ſcripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, where diſcipline and reſtitution were evidently deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; while theſe examples carry no ſuch language in them, but deciſively that of vindictive wrath and perpetual deſolation? wherefore choſen, but according to their natural import, to
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:019737_0114_0FACA3E32E336C50"/>
teach "the future puniſhment to be a retribution of wrath only, and ſo in the ſtricteſt ſenſe "to be examples of eternal fire" and puniſhment, as Jude 7th? Which excludes all hope and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of ſalvation to them that periſh. Moreover, our Lord, in the parable of Dives and Lazarus teaches the future ſtate of the wicked as well as righteous, to be fixed and unalterable. "There is no paſſing from the one to the other." He alſo confirms it in his ſentence upon Judas, "it had been good for that man, if he had not been born;"<note n="‡" place="bottom">Mat. 26.24.</note> for it is evident this cannot be true of him, if he ſhall ever enjoy eternal life.<note n="*" place="bottom">Againſt this deciſive ſentence ſome have argued, Judas ſhall have eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, from Mat. 19.28. "And Jeſus ſaid unto them, Verily I ſay unto you, that ye which have followed me in the regeneration, when the Son of Man ſhall ſit in the throne of his glory, ye alſo ſhall ſit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Iſrael." But it is forgotten, that the promiſe is made and limited to them which followed Chriſt "in the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration," to which Judas hath no claim, and that he "fell from his apoſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip," after which he was not intitled to the leaſt benefit by it; and much leſs to one of ſuch tranſcendent importance:—and that in fact, at death he went not to heaven—but "to his own place" "perdition," of which Chriſt pronounced him "the ſon" or heir—and that Matthias was choſen to the apoſtleſhip in his room, Acts 1.25, 26.</note> He likewiſe confirms it, in his ſentence upon thoſe who ſin and blaſpheme againſt the Holy Ghoſt. It is aſſerted in moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptory terms, "it ſhall not be forgiven," Luke 12.10. "hath never forgiveneſs," Mark 3.29. "ſhall not be forgiven unto men," no, "it ſhall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come,"<note n="‖" place="bottom">It is to no purpoſe to ſay, "by this world and world to come" is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the Moſaic and Chriſtian diſpenſation. For this conſtruction is in itſelf without foundation; and if admitted, avails nothing. Becauſe, "there is none other name under heaven whereby we can be ſaved, but the name of Jeſus: and it is under his diſpenſation, he ſaves all that ever will be ſaved. For it is a contradiction to ſay, he will ſave any, after his diſpenſation of mercy and life is ended: as truly as to ſay, he will ſave men after he hath done ſaving them. Their own conſtruction teaches, they can't have pardon and ſalvation, while his diſpenſation laſts, which cuts off all poſſibility of it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. For after that there is no ſalvation by his or any other name. So their little criticiſm has not the weight of a feather, againſt a declaration in ſuch plain, poſitive, deciſive terms as will admit of no evaſion, but what amounts to a denial of the letter, ſpirit and evident meaning of them.</note> Mat. 12.30, 31. How is it poſſible to be expreſſed in more abſolute and deciſive terms? and if it ſhall not be forgiven, no, neither in this world
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:019737_0115_0FACA3E3ECEB1D70"/>
nor the future, all poſſibility of ſalvation is cut off forever. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> a word, it is abundantly confirmed by the ground and rule by which they are excluded and condemned, "for things done in the body in this life." This ground and rule is the only one known in this conſtitution—it is the ſame to the good and the evil, "the juſt and unjuſt," "they ſhall all be judged according to their works, good or evil, and "all receive according to the things done in the body." And as this ground and rule is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable, ſo the excluſion and condemnation of the wicked by it muſt remain to eternity. As clearly and ſurely as the juſtification and inheritance adjudged to the righteous ſhall remain to eternity. It admits no alteration in the character and ſtate of the righteous or wicked, after this life, and the ſentence and execution of the great day. We have the expreſs deciſive language of it, Rev. 22.11. "He that is unjuſt, let him be unjuſt ſtill: he that is filthy, let him be filthy ſtill: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous ſtill: and he that is holy let him be holy ſtill. Which evidently cuts off all hope and poſſibility of ſalvation to all the condemned in that great day.</p>
               <p>A third particular, which ſtrongly confirms this doctrine is, "the great objective deſign of the plan and conſtitution of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to mankind in this world, viz. to reconcile ſinful men to God, to recover them to cordial ſubjection in Chriſt; to the life of God, to the practice of holineſs and a meetneſs for heaven in this life; and in this way to bring them to the enjoyment of the great ſalvation." This is ſo evident, that he who runs may read it the great object of this divine conſtitution. The word and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of reconciliation, the appointed means of ſalvation, with the diſpenſation of the Spirit of grace, are all to this great end. And "the ordinary way in which God gives his Spirit, to effect a work of grace in the hearts of ſinners, is in the uſe of appointed means. Nor is there ground of hope, in the revelations of God, to be ſaved any other way."<note n="‖" place="bottom">See Seaſ. Tho'ts. p. 265.</note> Goſpel faith, repentance, and holy obedience, as the way of ſalvation was abundantly taught by the apoſtles, and indeed the reigning ſubjects of their mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry. Our Saviour hath taught us the true and only way of life for ſinful man, "ſtrait is the gate and narrow is the way which
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:019737_0116_0FACA3E4AC5234E8"/>
leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it." To ſuppoſe there is any other way of life, is to ſuppoſe our Lord taught it not perfectly, but partially and imperfectly, which is impious. "The grace of God which bringeth ſalvation to men" doth it by "teaching them (effectually) the denial of all ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, that we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent world, (and not in the future, as the only way in which we are to be) "looking for that bleſſed hope, (of ſalvation) and the glorious appearing of the great God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt,"<note n="†" place="bottom">Tit. 2.11, 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</note> to compleat it for us. We know it the great end of our Saviour in coming into the world "to ſave his people from their ſins" and not in them, Mat. 1.21. and that this was his great objective deſign to men in this world in his great ſacrifice, as the apoſtle adds, "who gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himſelf a peculiar people, zealous of good works." <note n="‖" place="bottom">13, 14.</note> That "he loved his church, and gave himſelf for it, that he might ſanctify and cleanſe it with the waſhing of water by the word, (in this world) that he might preſent it to himſelf a glorious church, not having ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing; but that it ſhould be holy and without blemiſh"<note n="§" place="bottom">Eph. 5.25, 26.</note> to the praiſe of his grace, —"that in the day of judgment and throughout eternity, "he might be glorified and admired in all them that believe."<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Theſ. 1.20.</note> Nor do we read of any others, by whom he will ever be glorified. This is a deſign worthy the wiſdom and love of God. It is certainly of the higheſt importance to the glory of God and the Saviour, and good of men. Can then, any of mankind ever be ſaved in a ſtate of ſin and oppoſition, to it? Can there be any device in the plan of mercy and conſtitution of grace, to ſecure &amp; effect ſalvation to mankind without their comporting "with this deſign" in being ſanctified and meetened for it, in this life? If ſo, it muſt operate as a ſuperſede as of ſubverſion, to the whole goſpel conſtitution, and particularly, to the terms of life, and to this grand object of it; by rendering it unneceſſary and poſſible to be totally defeated: and yet, the ſalvation of all men, be ſecured and accompliſhed. For if one can be ſaved without it, then all mankind might be ſaved without it, upon the ſame plan and in the ſame way. And it is ſelf-evident, of

                  </gap> this plan, Chriſt might have no church in this world to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented —yet all men be ſaved. Now, is ſuch a ſelf-inconſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, ſelf-repugnant and ſelf-ſubverſive ſcheme, in the eſſential parts of it; poſſible, to be the production of infinite wiſdom and perfection? Is the plan and conſtitution of mercy ſo conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as that from the conſtituent parts of it, the great object of it, of the ſacrifice of Chriſt, the gift of the Spirit, and of the whole of Chriſt's adminiſtration in this world, is rendered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary and poſſible to be defeated; and yet, the ſalvation of all men be ſecured and aſcertained by it? It is in the higheſt degree abſurd, diſhonorable and impoſſible. And the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is moſt evident, viz. that the goſpel way of life as taught and inforced in this world, is excluſive of all others, and that none of mankind, but thoſe who comport with this great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of it (i. e.) who are ſanctified and meetened for it in this world, can ever be ſaved by the goſpel plan and conſtitution of mercy. One would think this alone ſufficient to overthrow the ſcheme of our opponents and their hopes built upon it</p>
               <p>But to make it more evident, we add fourthly,</p>
               <p>All hope of ſalvation by this divine conſtitution is limited, to thoſe of mankind, who are of a diſtinctive, diſtinguiſhing character in this world, comporting with this great objective deſign of it. All hopes of ſalvation are by the promiſes of God, limited, "to the born of God," to the "believing," the "pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent," "the pure in heart," "the obedient" "that do his commandments," "that are the children of Abraham, by imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his faith and piety." Our Saviour deſcribes his ſheep, for whom he laid down his life, to whom it ſhall be effectual to ſalvation, by a diſtinctive, diſtinguiſhing character, as called and led by him, "who hear his voice and follow him" and will not follow ſtrangers, Joh. 10.3, 4.5. and admits none as his friends but thoſe who do his commandments, Joh. 15.14. In his revelations to St. John, they are deſcribed in their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing character as "the called, the choſen, the faithful." And are elſewhere deſcribed, as "the juſtified and ſanctified in the name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God." And we are told "he is the author of eternal ſalvation unto all them that obey him," Heb. 5.9. It is appropriated and

limited to them, and never once extended to the finally diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient, in the revelations of God. In a word, all the promiſes of eternal life are made to thoſe who are the children of God by regeneration, adoption and divine imitation. "If children, then heirs," &amp;c. Now the children of God are abundantly diſtinguiſhed, from the children of diſobedience, and of the wicked one. They are greatly diſtinguiſhed, "by character," "by ſtate" "by privileges and promiſes in this life" "at death" "in the reſurrection" "by ſentence and retribution in the day of judgment" and by "heritage, portion and end" in the future and eternal world. There is no diſtinctions clearer, and no truths plainer in the book of God. And is it poſſible, to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the purport and deſign of the whole, when pointed out as with the finger of God to us, viz. that "theſe to whom ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſo appropriated, and theſe only, ſhall finally be ſaved." Since a man may as well deny all ſuch diſtinction to exiſt in this world, to take place at death, and in the reſurrection, as to confound and annul it at the day of judgment, or in eternity, to make way for the ſalvation of any other; and in direct op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the letter, ſpirit and deſign of it; aſſign, "one end and portion" to the whole of mankind. For this appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſalvation and the heavenly inheritance to the ſanctified in Chriſt in this world; by ſo many ſcripture deſcriptions, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations, promiſes and benedictions, doth neceſſarily carry in it an excluſion of the ungodly: and will do it, while there is, meaning, propriety and force in language. It is the evident deſign of it, and is a full refutation of their wild dream, "that the elect ſhall firſt be received to favour, and the reſt ſhall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after:" ſome be received "in the reſurrection morn," and others, after ſuffering unutterable torments in hell for ages of ages, to which, the ſcriptu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Which leads me to obſerve fifthly,</p>
               <p>The doctrine of the future puniſhment we maintain in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to theirs, is interwoven throughout the goſpel conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, in the letter and ſpirit of it, in the practical and doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

parts of it; as a ſtrong inforcement of the requiſitions of duty, in it. "Be not deceived, God is not mocked: for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever a man ſoweth, that ſhall he alſo reap. For he that ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to his fleſh, ſhall of the fleſh reap corruption: but he that ſoweth to the ſpirit, ſhall of the ſpirit reap life everlaſting." Gal. 5.7, 8. ſo Rom. 8.13. "For if ye live after the fleſh ye ſhall die: but if ye through the ſpirit do mortify the deeds of of the body, ye ſhall live." Life and death here are oppoſed the one to the other, and are both eternal. For by death can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be meant that which is natural—this comes on all through the tranſgreſſion of Adam—nor ſpiritual and moral death, for in this ſenſe they are already dead: "thoſe that live in pleaſure are dead, while they live." It muſt mean, the eternal death that is the juſt wages of ſin. "To be carnally minded is death; but to be ſpiritually minded is life and peace." "Having their fruit unto holineſs, and the end everlaſting life," but having their fruit, iniquity, "the end is eternal death:" for "Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The texts to the ſame purpoſe, are too many to be recited. Now, is it poſſible, there ſhould be a device in the plan and conſtitution of mercy to ſave men, in a way oppoſite to and in the deſtruction of a doctrine ſo interwoven in it, in the ſpirit and letter of it, and of great practical importance, being deſigned to enforce the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental and practical religion taught in it? yea, and to ſave them, in a way, ſubverſive of this divine religion in this world; when ſo ſtrongly recommended and inforced by everlaſting life and death: by rendering the practice of it in this life, unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, to their final ſalvation? How incredible and impoſſible?</p>
               <p>It merits conſideration, ſixthly:</p>
               <p>That eternal life in heaven, is the gift of God's grace, and is given to all who ſhall ever enjoy it by way of promiſe; and is limited by promiſe, to thoſe who are heirs of it in this life.— Paul teacheth "the gift of God is eternal life, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord," Rom. 6.23. that "the inheritance was
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:019737_0120_0FACA3E7AF017668"/>
given to Abraham by promiſe," Gal. 3.18. that "they which are of faith are the children of Abraham, and heirs of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, ib. v. 7, &amp; 29. and that "it is of faith that it might be of grace," and that "the promiſe might be ſure to all his ſeed" Rom. 4.16. meaning his "believing ſeed," Jew or Gentiles, to whom the promiſe is made. St. John tells us, the gift of God is eternal life, that this life is in his Son—that he that hath the Son hath life, and he that hath not the Son hath not life, 1 Joh. 5.11, 12. and our Lord tells us the way in which we "have the Son and this everlaſting life," Joh. 3.36. "He that believeth on the Son, hath everlaſting life: and he that believeth not the Son, ſhall not ſee life, but the wrath of God abideth on him." Paul tells us "by faith we are all the children of God," Gal. 3.27. "If children then heirs; heirs of God, and joint heirs with Chriſt, Rom. 8.17. and "if ye be Chriſt's then are ye Abraham's ſeed and heirs according to the promiſe," Gal. 3.29. It is plain in theſe texts, that eternal life in heaven, is given and beſtowed on all the ſaved, by promiſe; and the promiſe of it is limited to the ſubjects and heirs of faith only. They are all made and limited to the godly in this world; they only then, can and ſhall be ſaved, according to this divine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. Not a ſingle promiſe of it to unbelievers that die in their ſins, nor to any thing that can be done by them in the future ſtate. Therefore the ſentence of wrath muſt abide upon them forever; as they can never have deliverance and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the way of the promiſe, which is ſet forth in this conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and by which alone it is obtainable. They cannot have it, but of God's gift; they cannot have it, but "by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe;" they cannot have it "by promiſe" unleſs heirs of it in this life. How is it poſſible, that an eternal excluſion of the unbelieving and ungodly can be more fixed, and more ſtrongly aſcertained, than is in this way effected by this conſtitution, "which all along has been," "now is," "and always will be" the only way of life for ſinful man.</p>
               <p>I mention but one particular more, viz. Their doctrine of ſalvation is eſſentially erroneous, and contrary to the goſpel doctrine of ſalvation and redemption. The ſalvation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption exhibited in the goſpel is compleat and perfect, to all the happy ſubjects of it. A partial, incompleat, imperfect
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:019737_0121_0FACA3E8746DFF40"/>
ſalvation, is inconſiſtent with the wiſdom and perfection of God—with the obvious deſign of the goſpel conſtitution; and is not of a piece with the other works of God, "which are all perfect." And therefore is to be rejected as incredible and impoſſible. Salvation, as exhibited in the goſpel, hath three conſtituent parts in it, viz. Salvation from the dominion of ſin, accompanied with the ſubſtitution and reign of divine grace in the ſubjects and heirs of it in this world; in connexion with their deliverance from wrath and deſtruction in the world to come; and both theſe, in connexion with their everlaſting poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the heavenly inheritance. Theſe are all inſeparably connected in the ſalvation and redemption exhibited in the goſpel conſtitution, and it knows no other. Chriſt the Saviour, "ſaves his people from their ſins," makes them his willing peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the day of his power in this life, Pſa. 110.3.—at death and judgment he delivers and ſaves them from the wrath to come, and puts them in poſſeſſion of eternal life. Their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine drops the two firſt eſſentials in the goſpel ſalvation, "de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from ſin in this world," and "from wrath in the world to come," and then aſſigns "eternal life to the wicked," not at death, nor in the laſt judgment, and no body knows when or how. Surely this doctrine is eſſentially different and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that taught in the word of God. The contrariety and oppoſition of the two doctrines is obvious at firſt view, in the ſtating of them; and more ſo, as they are compared together. By goſpel conſtitution, thoſe that ſhall be ſaved, are all ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and meetened for it in this world; but they teach all the unſanctified that die in their ſins ſhall be ſaved. Chriſt "came to ſave his people from their ſins," and we are expreſsly taught how and in what way, viz. "by ſanctifying and purifying to himſelf, a peculiar people, zealous of good works," "living ſoberly, righteouſly and godly, in this preſent world," Tit. 2.12, 14. They teach he came and died to ſave all the unſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that live and die in their ſins. Again, he came as truly to ſave us "from the curſe" and future torment, as from our ſins, "was made a curſe, to redeem us from the curſe," Gal. 3.13. that partaking of his ſalvation, we might never endure it. Yet againſt this deſign of Chriſt, and this ſalvation ſo plainly taught, they tell us, many whom he ſaves ſhall yet endure the

Paul ſets forth the aſſurance of this, in a ſtrong point of light, in an inference drawn from the doctrine of juſtification, by faith. If God hath deſigned the juſtified by faith, for eternal life; and hath taken ſuch an extraordinary ſtep as "to give his own Son" to die for them when ungodly, "and by the grace of faith, hath brought them into a ſtate of actual juſtification, including in it, a title to eternal life," much more then (ſays he) being now juſtified by his blood, we ſhall be ſaved from wrath through him." Rom. 5.1, 8, 9. Deliverance and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation from the wrath to come, is the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> an eſſential or rather is the very goſpel ſalvation itſelf; which Chriſt deſigned and hath purchaſed for his people, by being made a curſe for them. Which doctrine is confirmed, and this great bleſſing inſured them, in the goſpel doctrine of juſtification. But they teach many will ſuffer this wrath to come, and yet be ſaved. If ſo, they muſt be ſaved without the goſpel ſalvation; and what ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is that? if they can be ſaved, it muſt be "without juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification by the blood of Chriſt: for all that are juſtified by his blood" to a man, "ſhall be ſaved from wrath through him," by this inference and declaration of the apoſtle. And as this great eſſential of ſalvation, "deliverance from the wrath to come," is limited to thoſe, "who now in this life are juſtified by his blood through faith," ſo, the whole goſpel ſalvation is appropriated and limited "to the obedient to Chriſt in this world," as Heb. 5.9. "And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal ſalvation, unto all them that obey him." Why are the heirs and ſubjects of eternal ſalvation, ſo diſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated by character, "thoſe that obey him?" Why is Chriſt ſaid to be the author of this ſalvation "to them" in diſtinction from the diſobedient; but to point out eternal ſalvation as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated, as the peculiar, and limited to them only, "who obey him?" and this conſtruction is confirmed by this, "he is never ſaid to be the author of eternal ſalvation to the finally diſobedient; but contrarywiſe, it is aſſerted, that he will "pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh

them with everlaſting deſtruction," 2 Theſ. 1.8, 9. which is directly oppoſite to his being the author and giver of eternal ſalvation to them. Yet, they aver againſt the plain language, import and deſign of the apoſtle, and the current doctrine of divine revelation, that he is the author of eternal ſalvation to all the diſobedient, who ſhall finally be ſaved by him. Altho' at the ſame time, it is naturally impoſſible; "thoſe, who are unſanctified in this world, and endure the wrath to come, can be ſaved; in the goſpel ſenſe and plan of ſalvation as before ſtated: becauſe, it implies and carries in it as full a contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as to ſay they may be ſaved, without ſalvation. Whence it is very evident, their doctrine of the ſalvation of the finally diſobedient is eſſentially erroneous in itſelf; and as totally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the goſpel conſtitution, as the Mahometan paradiſe. And it reflects high diſhonor upon the adorable Saviour, as an imperfect Saviour, bringing a partial imperfect ſalvation to a great part of mankind, whom he undertakes to ſave: neither "ſaving them from their ſin in this world" nor "damnation in the world to come," according to his own divine, preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed plan in the goſpel.<note n="‖" place="bottom">The Doct. tells us, "It would indeed be a reproach to Chriſt, to introduce his blood as opperating to the ſinner's juſtification, in a way that God has not appointed." "If God has made it" neceſſary that the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſhould be a believer, before he ſhall be juſtified, or, what means the ſame thing, before he ſhall reap "ſaving benefit" by the obedience and blood of Chriſt, we ſhall give all due honor to this finiſhed work of his, while we conſider it as available to the juſtification (conſequently to the eternal ſalvation) of the believing ſinner ONLY." "We now give it its proper uſe; and ſhould diſgrace, rather than honor it, ſhould we extend its uſe, and attribute to it a ſufficiency, to a purpoſe God never deſigned it for." As they moſt evidently do, who attribute to it "a ſufficiency" and efficacy to ſave all the finally diſobedient &amp; unbelieving. See ſermons, p. 176, 7, 8. He further tells us, ib. p. 179, near the bottom, it is of meer mercy, "that his faith, by the goſpel conſtitution, intereſts him in the everlaſting advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages that reſult from the obedience of Chriſt to the death of the croſs." "This is the influence of faith." Now if it be the influence of faith, by goſpel conſtitution, to intereſt the believer in the "everlaſting advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges" of ſalvation, and God hath made it neceſſary, 'to this end—of courſe final unbelievers are forever cut off "theſe everlaſting advantages," by this ſame conſtitution.</note> And it is a doctrine, moſt dangerous and miſchievous to men. It teacheth them to hope for a ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, unknown, excluded and which hath no foundation in the revelations of God: and in a way directly oppoſite, to that
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:019737_0124_0FACA3EBA4314628"/>
which is ſet forth in the goſpel. Did our Saviour and his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles teach and warrant us to teach "that ſinners may go on in their ſins," "live in pleaſure in this world," "endure the wrath to come," and then "bow to the authority of God," and "have eternal life?" Surely, no ſuch incongruous, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent, and horrible connexion, is to be found in the revelations of God. It is directly ſubverſive of the doctrine of the croſs of Chriſt. The contrary doctrine of godlineſs is as clear as the ſhining ſun at noon-day, "that we muſt take up his croſs and follow him," "we muſt be waſhed, juſtified, ſanctified, in the name, by the ſpirit, and through the faith of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in this world, and in that way "be delivered from the wrath to come," and "inherit eternal life." One would think, that the error, folly and impiety of a doctrine, that ſtands in ſuch a barefaced oppoſition to the doctrine and way of ſalvation ſet forth in the goſpel, "ſhould be manifeſt to all men."

Is it poſſible, that two eſſentially different methods of juſtification and ſalvation, can belong to the ſame plan and conſtitution of mercy? the one by faith, the other by ſomething elſe without faith? If ſo, it ſeems both parts of a contradiction may be true. The ſcripture doctrine of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and theirs, are eſſentially different and contrary in their influence and effects, many other ways. The true doctrine eſtabliſhes the doctrine of the croſs and of godlineſs as abſolutely
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:019737_0125_0FACA3EC3030A3B0"/>
neceſſary to men in this world; theirs teacheth it unneceſſary to them in this world, to final ſalvation—the true doctrine, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms and illuſtrates the truth and glory of the promiſes; theirs makes the promiſe "void and of none effect." "It is of faith, to the end the promiſe might be ſure to all the ſeed," Rom. 4.16. But if the final unbelieving and ungodly can by any means and in any way whatever, become "heirs," and attain the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, then "faith is made void, and the promiſe of none ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect," as v. 14. becauſe neither "faith" nor "the promiſe" are of any conſequence or efficacy to ſuch ſalvation. And the doctrine that teacheth it, overthrows the goſpel doctrine "of faith and the promiſe," as the only way of ſalvation. And on the ſame ground, the example of Abraham, and all the forcible argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſtrong reaſonings of the apoſtle, in ſupport of the doctrine of juſtification and ſalvation by the faith of Chriſt only, are "made void and of none effect," by their doctrine. For if the unbelieving may be ſaved, "faith is made void," of courſe the doctrine of juſtification and ſalvation, in their connexion with faith, with all their divine ſupports, are likewiſe "made void and of none effect." They have no ſort of influence or connexion whatever with ſuch a ſalvation; but ſtand in direct oppoſition to it. 'Tis clear as day, that the doctrine of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and ſalvation by the faith of Chriſt, is the great goſpel doctrine that ſhews ſinful men, the true, the ſure, the only way of ſalvation, by Chriſt. But if "faith be made void" in this eſſential, neceſſary connexion with juſtification of life and final ſalvation, as is the caſe if all unbelievers ſhall be juſtified and ſaved; then this fundamental doctrine, which is the great guide of periſhing ſinners to eternal life, "is made void" "and of none effect" in the ſenſe of the apoſtle. And will any chriſtian ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that doctrine as true, in the face of ſuch a conſequence? In a word, theſe two doctrines of ſalvation neceſſarily infer two eſſentially different and contrary rules of final judgment to mankind. The one clearly ſet forth in the goſpel conſtitution; and the other unknown in it, and reprobated by it. For it is ſelf-evident to a reflecting mind, that one and the ſame rule and meaſure of judgment, cannot juſtify thoſe of oppoſite characters; the juſt and unjuſt, believing and unbelieving, the one approved and the other moſt expreſsly condemned by it. It is an evident
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:019737_0126_0FACA3ECEDF53E58"/>
contradiction. The ſcripture rule of judgment expreſsly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, "the ungodly ſhall not ſtand in the judgment, nor ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in the congregation of the righteous," Pſa. 1.5. It ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly ſevers the juſt from the unjuſt, and aſſigns them an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely different inheritance, portion, and end—it announceth "he that believeth ſhall be ſaved," but "he that believeth not ſhall be damned:" that "the righteous ſhall go into life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; but "the diſobedient ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction:" It deſcribes the wicked in their particular cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, and then expreſsly excludes them the inheritance of God's kingdom, and conſigns them to "the lake of fire," "and ſhall be tormented day and night forever and ever." Now, it is evidently impoſſible, that theſe condemned ones, after ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and execution; ſhould ever be approved, juſtified, and ſaved by this very rule and meaſure of judgment, whereby they are excluded, condemned and conſigned to puniſhment. And it is to be further noted, that the ſentence of final retribution, by the ſcripture rule and meaſure of judgment, is grounded upon the characters formed in this life and ſtate, and not in the future, "according to the things done or not done in the body." This is the doctrine of revelation throughout. "Every man will be judged according to their works," Rev. 20.12, 13. "We muſt all appear before the judgment ſeat of Chriſt: that every one may receive the things done in his body, (i. e. in ſentence and execution) according to that he hath done, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be good or bad." 2 Cor. 5.10. So taught the prophets, our Saviour in his parables, and in his repreſentation of the laſt judgment, and ſo taught his apoſtles. And this rule, meaſure and ground of judg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>nt doth neceſſarily preclude and exclude all change of character and ſtate; after this life and the final judgment. For the rule being infallible, and the ground of the ſentence likewiſe unalterable, the righteous ſentence purſuant to it, can never be repealed, reverſed or ſuperſeded by this rule, or in a conſiſtency with it, and conſequently, it muſt eternally remain in full force. Thoſe that are condemned by it, can never be approved and adjudged to life by it, by any thing that can be done by them or for them, when out of the body or in the future ſtate; this rule hath not the leaſt reſpect to thoſe things, they are all excluded by it. And the matter and ground of
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:019737_0127_0FACA3EDA68EA2D0"/>
their condemnation, "the evil things done in the body" being in their nature unalterable—by the force of this divine rule, their condemnation muſt be perpetual and unalterable. This rule of judgment alone, cuts up the doctrine of purgatory by the roots, as taught by papiſts and univerſaliſts.<note n="*" place="bottom">This evinces their tenet "that Chriſt will not finally and unalterably fix the ſtates of all men at his ſecond coming, but there will be a great deal after this to be done," to be an egregious error. Chriſt will then fix the ſtates of all men, they allow—and how? by a righteous ſentence of retribation: a ſentence purſuant to a rule that is unalterable: and upon a ground that is unalterable, "the things done in the body:" which muſt evidently conclude and fix their ſtates, unalterably. The Dr. is particular upon this point. He tells us "that no one can, in conſiſtency with truth, be judically declared juſt, unleſs he really is ſo in the eye, of that rule whatever it be, by which he is tried," Serm. p. 4. Can any final un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer then be judicially declared juſt, by that rule, "the juſt ſhall live by faith?" Can he ever be adjudged to ſalvation by that rule, "he that believeth ſhall be ſaved, but he that belie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

Then it is impoſſible for the wicked, who are condemned for their wickedneſs by the goſpel in the final judgment, ever to receive a ſentence of approbation by the ſame goſpel, adjudging them to eternal life; "it would be a glaring contradiction." And again, p. 13. "If the law curſes him, it cannot juſtify him; if it convicts him of ſin, it cannot acquit him of guilt: If it condemns him as a tranſgreſſor, it cannot vindicate him as a righteous perſon."

For if Chriſt hath made a propitiation ſufficient for the ſalvation of all men,—if it is free and ſure to all men upon the ſame terms, and he doth in fact uſe all ſuitable means in the goſpel to induce their compliance,—and all who comply with the terms of life ſhall in fact be ſaved; and that he doth in fact ſave all who are willing to receive his ſalvation, and whoſe characters finally will admit them to be ſaved in conſiſtence with the nature, terms, deſign and rule of the conſtitution of mercy, where is there a ſhadow of foundation for reproach? Again, if thoſe that periſh, periſh for their own iniquity; moſt juſtly, under the goſpel, for neglecting and rejecting the great ſalvation; by the force and rule of the conſtitution of mercy itſelf; and circumſtanced as their caſe is, it becomes neceſſary for the ſupport and honor of the divine character, authority and moral government of God: it is inconceivable how any reproach can poſſibly be faſtened upon Chriſt, the Saviour and Judge. Is it any reflection upon him, that men chooſe or refuſe for themſelves? or that they chooſe their own deluſions, and will purſue them? or, that they ſhould "reap" as they have "ſown," and ſhould receive and be awarded according to their own choice, in their chooſing time? who will avow it? If there was any truth in the ſuggeſtion, their ſcheme reflects diſhonor upon Chriſt in the ſame way, viz. becauſe he doth not in fact ſave all men with a compleat ſalvation in this world and world to come. It is a truth he doth not ſave all men from their ſins, nor from the deſtructions which follow them in this world, nor from the wrath to come, as he doth "his peculiar people" "that believe and obey him." Now if the reproach muſt fall upon Chriſt, in caſe he doth not finally ſave them with the eternal ſalvation of the people of God: why not on the ſame ground that he doth not effect for them this great ſalvation alſo, with which he bleſſeth his peculiar people? But ſurely, it can be no reproach to Chriſt, not to ſave them "who will not come to him for life," who neglect and refuſe his ſalvation, who reject all his overtures, counteract the force of all his ſaving means, who render his death vain, "who trample under foot his precious blood," "who do diſpite to the Spirit of Grace," and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue irreconcilable enemies to God: and when by goſpel conſtitution they cannot be ſaved. But it would be the higheſt reproach to him, to juſtify and ſave the wicked: It would be to counteract the divine perfections, to overthrow the moral character, the authority, law, and goſpel of God; with all the rules and ends of his moral government. It can be no reproach to him, that he doth not ſave them, when in future torment. It is not the work aſſigned him in the goſpel conſtitution, it is unknown in it. It is excluded and every where reprobated by it. It is no reproach to him as Judge, to exclude and condemn to everlaſting puniſhment, thoſe that are excluded by the conſtitution of mercy, and who are ſo to be condemned by the righteous rules of it; but it is a high reproach upon his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter to ſuppoſe he will not do it. It is no reproach to him, as ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Lord, Governor and Judge of all worlds, to render a righteous and eternal retribution to all moral ſubjects according to their character and works: to ſettle the kingdom of God in everlaſting righteouſneſs and peace: to gain a compleat victory and eternal triumph over all the incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able enemies of it, whether of heaven or earth, by conſigning them to a deſerved everlaſting deſtruction; and alſo to be admired in all that believe; and to be glorified as a Judge in all the condemned and loſt, as well as in all that are ſaved, as he aſſuredly will be. Upon this plain, ſcripture plan, all ground of reproach to Chriſt is evidently taken away, be thoſe that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh many or few. It is much to be wiſhed that men, inſtead of giving way to a bold ſuggeſtion, would reflect, and range their thoughts in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture line of truth, and they would at once ſee, there is no foundation for this baſe, moſt reproachful reflection, upon the Lord of glory. The ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, plainly goes upon the old plan of caſting off the blame from the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, upon the tempter, or upon God. "The ſerpent beguiled me, and I did eat," ſaid the woman. "The woman, which thou gaveſt to be with me, ſhe gave me of the tree, and I did eat," ſaid the man. Tacitly and implicitly caſting the reproach and blame upon God the giver. So if heaven doth not adopt and carry into full execution their corrupt ſcheme of ſaving all the wicked, then it ſeems, theſe men will caſt the reproach of all that periſh, upon the Lord of glory. But how groundleſs, unjuſt and impious is it, "when they are judged according to the deeds done in the body," and "receive the things done in the body?" Our Lord exerted himſelf faithfully and painfully to ſave the Jews from unparrallel'd de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. They were not ſaved, but ſunk under his neglected admonitions and warnings, into unexampled ruin. Where does he faſten the reproach and blame? upon himſelf, according to this ſuggeſtion? in no wiſe, but wholly upon them. "How often would I have gathered thy children toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not?" "Behold your houſe is left unto you deſolate," Mat. 23.37, 38. his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is infallible. So their miſcarriage of ſalvation, he charges to their obſtinacy. "Ye will not come unto me that ye might have life." That declaration of God which ſhut the mouth of Cain, will ſilence all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of the wicked: "if thou doeſt well, ſhalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doeſt not well, ſin lieth at the door," Gen. 4.7. Surely, the blame and conſequences, tho' eternal, muſt lie at the "door, where ſin lieth." And that home addreſs, carries ſtrong conviction in it; "if thou be wiſe, thou ſhalt be wiſe for thyſelf: but if thou ſcorneſt, thou alone ſhalt bear it," Prov. 9.12. It is natural to obſerve, the charge of reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting reproach upon Chriſt, comes with an ill grace from thoſe, whoſe ſcheme is ſubverſive of the character, authority, and moral government of God, and of natural and revealed religion; whoſe doctrine makes faith void; the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes —the example of Abraham—the goſpel doctrine of juſtification and ſalvation void and of none effect; and ſubverts the goſpel doctrine of the croſs and rule of final judgment: and diſhonors Chriſt as an imperfect Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and by "introducing his blood as operating to the ſinners juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſalvation in a way not appointed by God," and againſt the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod preſcribed in the goſpel, and many other ways as hath and will be ſhewn. The charge comes with a peculiar ill grace from "ſome of them" who highly diſhonor Chriſt, by a very corrupt conſtruction of his own words. (E. G.) our Saviour addreſſes a moſt ſolemn woe and warning to Judas, as Mark 14.21. "The Son of Man indeed goeth as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed: good were it for that man, if he had never been born." The words are expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of high indignation againſt the treaſon, and a heavy puniſhment to the traitor: ſo that it would have been better for him, "if he had never had a being." To ſay, it means, "that he would have eſcaped all the diſtreſs he ſuffered in this world, and might have been happy, if he had never been born," is a conſtruction, by which the pointed indignation, the heavy puniſhment, with the terror and force of the warning, are all loſt; is not this to diſhonor Chriſt? Again, he gives a pointed deſcription of Judas, as "the ſon of perdition, that is loſt," John 17. v. 6 to 13 in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive. He ſpeaks expreſsly "of the men given him out of the world," "to whom he manifeſted the Father's name," "to whom he gave his words," "who received them," "have known and believed him ſent, by him," "who were with him," "kept by him" and "none of them loſt, but the ſon of perdition," "that the ſcripture might be fulfilled." Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently referring to the ſcripture that predicted his crime and puniſhment. How could he have given, a more pointed characteriſtic deſcription, of Judas? Is it not then to diſhonor Chriſt, firſt to deny Judas is intended, and then to confront and endeavour to overthrow all this evidence of the truth, by moſt falſe and pitiful evaſions? as to ſay, "the fallen angel bears the character of perdition," in which there is no truth: "ſin is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by him, and therefore ſtiled a ſon." But can this ſon, ſin, be one "of the men given him out of the world," "to whom he manifeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the father's name," "gave his words," "who received them," "be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved him ſent, by him," "who was with him?" &amp;c. How falſe and ſtupidly abſurd? Or to ſay, "the ſoul of Judas was the breath of God," "and his body produced by ordinary generation," and "neither the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his ſpirit nor his natural parents could be termed perdition." How ridiculouſly impertinent? For Judas by character and righteous deſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, might ſurely be "the ſon of perdition," it is the thing intended. Juſt as the malicious Jews were by charter and imitation "of their father the devil, John 8.44. and as Elymas "was a child of the devil," Acts 13.10. "But to put it out of all doubt" we are told "Paul hath declared the ſon of perdition to be the man of ſin, who is to be revealed previous to the ſecond coming of Chriſt," 2 Theſ. 2.3. this makes bad, worſe—by a moſt evident perverſion of one ſcripture, to juſtify the perverſion of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For how evident, this man of ſin which had then no being, whoſe exiſtence was then future, and was to commence ſome ages after, cannot be the ſon of perdition, intended by our Saviour? Can this man of ſin be one of "the men given him out of the world," "who had been with him," &amp;c. How aſtoniſhing? It ſeems out of doubt indeed, that thoſe who ſo teach and write, either know not what they are about, or mean to deceive and impoſe upon others. And ſuch perverſions are the more inexcuſable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſenſe of our Saviour, to thoſe who attend to ſcripture language, is very obvious. As "children of wrath" are heirs of wrath, Eph. 2.3. and as "children of God are heirs of God," Rom. 8.27. and as ſuch, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtined to the heavenly inheritance. So Judas is a "ſon of perdition" as an heir of perdition, who hath merited it, and is deſignated and conſigned to perdition, by the righteous judgment of God. If ſuch notorious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions of ſcripture, be not to "corrupt the word of God" and "to handle it deceitfully," where can we find it? Equally falſe and more pernicious, is the conſtruction of "the ſheep and goats," 25 Mat. By ſheep we are told "is intended every ſon and daughter of Adam." But our Saviour points out "his ſheep" by a diſtinctive, diſtinguiſhing character "from the reſt of the world," in John 10. v. 3, 4, 5, 16, 26, 27, 28. and theſe no doubt are the ſheep here intended. "The goat"<note n="‖" place="bottom">See ſome deductions from the ſyſtem of revelation, p. 19, 20, 21, 22.</note> it is ſaid "in many places is given as the figure of the fallen angelic nature." But how wild and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous, when not an inſtance is found to ſupport it? the matter is very plain. Our Lord had often taught, in the great day "he would fever the juſt from the unjuſt," &amp;c. here from the 31ſt to the end, he ſhews the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the proceſs, viz. "by gathering of all nations of men before him," "by ſeparating them one from another according to their character "as juſt or unjuſt" which he ſets forth by the natural figure of "a ſhepherd dividing his ſheep from the goats;" he will then paſs ſentence upon the one and the other "according to their character and works." And when the ſentence is paſſed, the wicked will not look up to the Saviour and be ſaved as they preſumptuouſly teach, "but go away into everlaſting puniſhment, and the righteous into life eternal." This conſtruction is moſt plain and eaſy, and perfectly agrees with every repreſentation of the final judgment throughout revelation. Whereas the conſtruction we oppoſe doth not admit "the juſt ſhall be ſevered from the unjuſt," the good from the bad," "the faithful from the unfaithful," and that "all ſhall perſonally receive in actual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution, "according to the things done in the body," tho' abundantly taught by our Saviour and his apoſtles. It is therefore directly oppoſite to and ſubverſive of the ſcripture doctrine of the eternal judgment. It is ſtrange that any who have read the ſcripture with attention can endure ſuch an enormous error, and encourage ſuch teaching, againſt that divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition in the ſecond epiſtle of John v. 10, 11.</note>

all hope of deliverance from the wrath to come, and of ſalvation to them who die in their ſins, is intirely cut off by it. Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, their future puniſhment muſt be as endleſs as their immortality. And in a perfect agreement herewith, our Lord ſeems evidently to limit our faith, and all our hopes and prayers for the ſalvation of mankind, to this life and world. In teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to pray to our heavenly Father, "thy kingdom come, and will be done on earth, as it is in heaven."

for heaven, to their abode on earth. What can a univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaliſt want more to convince him, of the impoſſibility of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them, that die in their ſins? Would he be ſatisfied were it ſhewn, "that every way of relief to them is ſhut out," "all hope barred," and their "devices of relief are confuted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probated" in the revelations of God? we are content to do him this friendly ſervice. It is clear, the wicked cannot be ſaved by any thing done by them or for them in the intermediate ſtate between death and the reſurrection; for "they that have done evil" ſhall then have a reſurrection to damnation, John 5.29. nor in the day of judgment, for then every one "will be judged according to their works," and receive in ſentence and actual retribution, "according to the deeds done in the body" in this life. The wicked in their perſons ſhall be ſentenced and "go away into everlaſting puniſhment," Mat. 25.41, 46. "They that know not God, and that obey not the goſpel," as they are perſonally deſcribed, ſhall be perſonally "puniſhed with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting deſtruction, 1 Theſ. 1.8, 9. "And whoſoever are not found written in the book of life, ſhall be caſt into the lake of fire," Rev. 20.15. They cannot be ſaved by cries and intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, for when they pray "Lord, Lord, open to us," he will reject them with "I never knew you," "depart from me, ye workers of iniquity," Luke 13.25, 27.—'Tis added, v. 28.
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:019737_0133_0FACA3F22C10E240"/>
"there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth, when ye ſhall ſee Abraham, and Iſaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, and you yourſelves thruſt out." Nor can they be ſaved by any goſpel means of ſalvation whatever; for theſe are enjoyed only in the kingdom of Chriſt: but theſe "children of the kingdom ſhall be caſt out, into outer dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth,"<note n="‖" place="bottom">The wicked are ſo perſonally deſcribed and characteriſed in theſe two laſt mentioned texts in Luke and Matthew, it is impoſſible to be eluded, by any or all their corrupt evaſions. It is to Men that Chriſt addreſſes, and not to devils, nor to wickedneſs, nor to what of the devil is in men. It is men that are deſcribed as ſaying "Lord, open unto us," that are repulſed with "I never knew you," that will plead "we have eat and drank in thy preſence, and thou haſt taught in our ſtreets," that he will "bid depart," that are characteriſed as "workers of iniquity," that are tormented with "weeping and gnaſhing of teeth," that "ſee Abraham in the kingdom of God," that "are themſelves thruſt out," that are "children of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom," that "are caſt out into outer darkneſs" perſonally ſuffering with "weeping and gnaſhing of teeth." Nothing can be plainer. How will their corrupt evaſions apply to theſe deſcriptions? The devils cannot be meant, Chriſt addreſſeth not to them, but men under his miniſtry. Devils are not the "children of Chriſt's kingdom" in any ſenſe; they do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to it, but they are the open, avowed enemies to it. They are never deſcribed as "children of the kingdom," and cannot be thoſe, that are "to be caſt out of it." They cannot plead "we have eat and drank in thy preſence, and thou haſt taught in our ſtreets," for they never enjoyed theſe privileges of the kingdom, &amp;c. nor can wickedneſs, evil principles, or what of the devil is ſuppoſed, by them, to be 'blended' with wicked men, diſtinct from the perſons of the wicked, poſſibly come up to this perſonal charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eriſtic deſcription. Will wickedneſs ſay, "Lord open unto us," is it not blaſphemy to ſuppoſe it? Can it plead "we have eat and drank in thy preſence, and thou haſt taught in our ſtreets?" Can it be characteriſed "workers of iniquity?" Can wickedneſs and what of the devil is in men ſeparate from the ſouls and bodies of men, be "the children of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom?" are we ever ſo taught? Can it ſeparate from the wicked "ſee Abraham and the patriarchs in the kingdom of God," and be the "ye yourſelves thruſt out?" and be the ſubject of "weeping and gnaſhing of teeth?" and be "tormented day and night forever and ever?" Can it give an account," "be judged according to his works," "receive the things done in the body," or agree with any one ſcripture deſcription of the final judgment and future puniſhment?" by no means: it is a ſtaring error. And it ſeems a man muſt have a ſtrangely perverted underſtanding and conſcience, to put ſuch a thin, barefaced, moſt pernicious cheat upon himſelf, or to attempt it upon others. For the matter is reduced to a ſhort iſſue—either the ſubjects of threatnings and penal ſtatutes, after condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, muſt perſonally ſuffer the puniſhment denounced, or they muſt not. If not, all government of God and man is ſtruck up with one blow—there is no truth and juſtice in the univerſe—tranſgreſſors have nothing to fear —men and devils nothing to ſuffer—yea, and Moſes and the prophets, our Saviour and his apoſtles are condemned for "uſing the terrors of the Lord, to perſuade men" to repentance and reconciliation to God. But if they muſt perſonally ſuffer the puniſhment threatned, then it is as certain that the unjuſt in their perſons ſhall be reſerved to puniſhment,"—and "the finally diſobedient ſhall perſonally be puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction" as there is truth in the Deity and in the revelation he hath given us.</note> Mat. 8.12. they never were "children of the kingdom," only by the means and privileges of it. The caſting them out, muſt ſurely mean, a total deprivation of them; nothing leſs can be intended. So that "goſpel means of ſalvation ſhall never paſs upon them" as they teach. "Their caſting out, is followed with outer dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs," as contraſted with the enjoyment of theſe means. And are conſigned to "the blackneſs of darkneſs forever." Jude 13. If this alſo be contraſted with "goſpel light which now ſhines to the world," they periſh without a gleam of comfort or hope, or a ray of inſtruction out of it: for nothing leſs can come up to this deſcription. This muſt fix their puniſhment as laſting
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:019737_0134_0FACA3F2ED54E390"/>
as their exiſtence, as they have no way out of it. Moreover, they cannot be ſaved by any means ordinary or extraordinary, all hopes of it are excluded and barred, by our Saviour in his parable of Dives and Lazarus—in the anſwer of Abraham to Dives, teaching there is no paſſing from that ſtate of torment to the ſociety of Abraham and the bleſſed, Luke 16.26, 31. Neither can they be ſaved, by any terms of mercy and life pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in the revelations of God. Theſe terms are preſcribed for, addreſſed and limited to mankind in this ſtate, only, as hath been ſhewn. Not a ſingle one extended to thoſe who die in their ſins in the future ſtate. They cannot be ſaved by faith, repentance, bowing to the authority of God, and becoming his willing ſubjects in that ſtate, as they may in this. There is not an intimation in the whole book of God, of ſuch a thing poſſible to them in that ſtate; nor any encouragement for it; nor promiſe made to it: which takes away all ground of hope; eſpecially, as our Lord hath fixed it upon another iſſue, which is deciſive, viz. not upon the footing of any thing whatever to be done by them: but upon that of ſufferings only, to the full demerit of their ſins. When delivered over to puniſhment, and caſt into priſon, "he aſſures us with a very ſtrong aſſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:019737_0135_0FACA3F3B45BABD8"/>
"verily I ſay unto thee, thou ſhalt by no means come out thence, till thou haſt paid the uttermoſt farthing," Mat. 5.25, 26. Since all means and ways of deliverance are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly excluded, but that of ſuffering the eternal death which is the juſt wages of ſin: all hope of it muſt be barred and cut off forever. Their reſources of relief are alſo particularly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded and barred. All the hope of periſhing ſinners is in the infinite mercy and grace of God; but this mercy, by goſpel conſtitution is limited to "veſſels of mercy afore-prepared un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to glory," in this world. "And there is no proviſion of mercy for ſinners continuing ſuch," but it is written of the wicked "he ſhall have judgment without mercy," Jam. 2.13. and "they ſhall have wrath without mixture," Rev. 14.10. Again, all hope from the death and ſacrifice of Chriſt, to thoſe who make it vain in this world, is totally excluded: for it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, "his death ſhall profit them nothing:" and "there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains no more ſacrifice for ſin," to them—neither this or any other, "but a fearful looking for of judgment, which ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the adverſaries." Moreover, they cannot work out their deliverance and ſalvation by their own ability, or by any thing which can be done by them. For our Lord repreſents them, when "caſt into outer darkneſs, into a ſtate of weeping and gnaſhing of teeth," "as bound hand and foot," Mat. 22.13. under total diſability for ſuch exertion. But how can this be true of unimbodied ſpirits, or of the wicked after the reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? there is doubtleſs important truth and inſtruction in it: nor is it difficult to find it. In the conſtitution and frame of human minds, Hope is the mainſpring of action and exertion: deſpair cuts the ſinews of all endeavour. Therefore the door of mercy muſt be opened, to ſpring hope and exertion. And when this door is forever ſhut againſt them, all exertion for ſalvation is as effectually excluded and barred; as activity is to him who is literally "bound hand and foot." And our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour teacheth us "this door will be ſhut" againſt them, Luk. 13.25. which is another ſtrong evidence "that goſpel means ſhall never paſs upon them."<note n="‡" place="bottom">Some ſuppoſe Chriſt in his human ſpirit, in the interim between his death and reſurrection, went and preached to the ſpirits in priſon. So they conſtrue the words of Peter, 1 Pet. 3.18, 19, 20. "but quickened by the Spirit; by which alſo he went and preached unto the ſpirits in priſon; which ſometime were diſobedient, when once the long-ſuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was preparing, &amp;c. But this conſtruction is inconſiſtent with the letter of the text, which ſpeaks expreſsly of "the ſpirit whereby Chriſt was quickened" in his reſurrection—and not of his human ſpirit. By which eternal Spirit he inſpired Noah a preacher of righteouſneſs, to teach and warn thoſe diſobedient ſinners while the ark was conſtructing, who were now in priſon. This is the deſigned inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And this conſtruction of theirs is inconſiſtent with the deſign for which the apoſtle here and in 2 Pet. 2.5, to the 10th, introduceth the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the ſalvation of Noah, and the deſtruction of the diſobedient of the old world. It is adduced for warning, that the diſobedient and ungodly under the goſpel, ſhall be caſt into the priſon of hell, and "be reſerved to the day of judgment, to be puniſhed;" as exemplified in the diſobedient, that periſhed from under the preaching of Noah. And alſo to admoniſh, encourage and animate chriſtians ſo to do and ſuffer the will of God, as to anſwer the great deſign of the chriſtian diſpenſation, that they may be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and enjoy the great ſalvation of God, as exemplified in that of Noah. Now the deſigned inſtruction, warning, admonition and animating en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement are all loſt, in their conſtruction; which ſhews it cannot be true. This conſtruction of theirs, is likewiſe confuted, by the manifeſt abſurdity of it. According to ſcripture, the work of Chriſt and his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters is to preach the goſpel to thoſe under the diſpenſation of his kingdom; and not to thoſe that are out of it; as thoſe are who die in their ſins. How abſurd to ſuppoſe Chriſt in perſon ſhould go and preach to thoſe in priſon, with whom he has no more concern as a Saviour, than with the devil and his angels their aſſociates in character and miſery; to whom he was not appointed a Mediator and Saviour? How abſurd to ſuppoſe him to go and preach the goſpel of life to them, when he knew it would be all loſt labour, and not a ſoul of them would hear, repent and live? when he knew and had taught the world in the parable of Dives, their characters and ſtate was fixed, and would admit of no change? and had repeatedly taught, that in the day of judgment they ſhould be condemned and puniſhed, as workers of iniquity? and very expreſsly that "they that have done evil, ſhall come forth unto the reſurrection of damnation?" John 5.29. which is deciſive, there is no change of character and ſtate to them, between death and the reſurrection. It is evident their conſtruction cannot by any means be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited: but if it was, it avails them nothing. For the goſpel was not preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them in priſon, in the extenſive addreſs of mercy and hope, in which it is now preached to all the nations of the earth: but is limited "to the diſobedient in the days of Noah." The reſt of the diſobedient, ungodly world, notwithſtanding this ſuppoſed partial, preaching of it, are left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der condemnation, without hope, reſerved to the day of judgment, to be puniſhed." Their end is deſtruction.</note>

And conſequently, the impoſſibility of their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is fully evinced. It ſeems proper in this place to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider two doctrines which are main pillars in the ſcheme of our opponents, that are directly oppoſite to the exhibition we have given of the goſpel conſtitution, and are to be conſidered as objections againſt it, viz. One is, that the future puniſhment is a ſtate of diſcipline, "to make the ſubjects of it a willing people" and fit them for heaven; and not ſtrictly of retribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is a diſciplinary, and not capital puniſhment. The other is, that at ſome unknown period, they will all bow to the authority of God—and ſo be delivered and ſaved. As to the firſt point, it is to be noted, that a ſtate of trial, and a ſtate of retribution, in the ſtrict ſenſe, of diſcipline and of capital pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, are as diſtinct and contraſted as any two things in nature, as virtue and vice, as life and death—eſſentially dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent in nature and deſign. And it is to be obſerved, the ſcripture conſtantly holds up this diſtinction, as what makes the grand, the infinite difference between the ſtates of men in this world and world to come. For there is no doctrine more plain throughout revelation, than that this is, a ſtate of trial and diſcipline; and the future a ſtate of retribution in the ſtrict ſenſe as contraſted with it. And it is ſealed and confirmed beyond doubt, by the doctrine of the eternal judgment, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we are taught "every man ſhall be judged and be rewarded according to his works:" and "he that is unjuſt, ſhall be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt ſtill," and "he that is holy ſhall be holy ſtill."

Is death, by the hand of public juſtice, that is the award of juſtice, and cuts men off from the kingdoms of this world, a capital puniſhment, with men? ſo is that death, that cuts off the wicked from the kingdom of God, and in which they muſt endure the juſt, the full wages of ſin. And the perdition and
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:019737_0138_0FACA3F79C76E168"/>
deſtruction of the ungodly, purſuant to their demerit, and to judicial ſentence executed in a diſpenſation of wrath and juſtice, neceſſarily carries the idea of capital puniſhment. And when the word eternal or everlaſting is added, it is capital, retributive puniſhment in the ſtricteſt, higheſt, ſtrongeſt ſenſe conceivable by the mind of man. The ſcriptures are very plain, that in the ſenſe of ſtrict retribution, "God will render vengeance to his enemies," "and reward them that hate him." But the idea of diſcipline annexed to the future puniſhment, ſhocks us by its abſurdity and impiety, every way. Whoſe diſcipline is it? we know of no diſcipline to ſave men, but that appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the kingdom of Chriſt; and exerciſed under his adorable adminiſtration. But this puniſhment is inflicted after the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of his kingdom is ended, and the great affairs of it are all ſettled in the day of judgment, and on thoſe, who are cut off and caſt out of it, and from all the diſcipline and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of it, and are delivered over to be tormented, &amp;c. Surely, it can be none of his diſcipline. If their doctrine of diſcipline be admitted, then the devils are now under a diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of mercy, for ſalvation. Yea, they are the firſt candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates for it, for this puniſhment was originally prepared and appointed for them, Mat. 25.41. which ſuppoſition is abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to ſcripture and common ſenſe. Again, if the doctrine of future retribution, be a doctrine of diſcipline, then in the day of judgment the righteous will be adjudged to a ſtate of diſcipline, as well as the wicked, in which it will be poſſible for them to change their ſtate, and to loſe their characters and bleſſedneſs to eternity. Which is too ſhocking to be admitted, nor do they admit it. Yet the doctrine of retribution is the ſame to both; and the ſcripture makes no diſtinction, "every one ſhall be rewarded according to their works," and "every one ſhall receive according to the things done in the body." Conſequently, the character and ſtates of both, will be fixed for eternity in that day, or neither of them. Moreover, according to their doctrine, a ſtate of outer darkneſs is more effectual, ſavingly to enlighten men, than all the light of the goſpel: a ſtate of wrath and diſpenſation of wrath, more effectual to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due and ſoften the hearts of men, than a ſtate of mercy, under all the ſoftening, transforming means and grace of the goſpel:
<pb n="120"
                      facs="unknown:019737_0139_0FACA3F829A85268"
                      rendition="simple:additions"/>
and a ſtate of univerſal wickedneſs into which, all the prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate and abandoned of the earth, with the devil and his angels, are caſt, without a ſingle godly ſoul in it; is a more effectual ſchool to form to holineſs and meeten ſubjects for heaven; than the fellowſhip of ſaints, the ſociety, examples and prayers of the godly, and all the light, means, and grace of the kingdom of God, in this world. For altho' the latter are effectual for the ſalvation of many; yet they are not effectual to the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all under the diſpenſation of it. Whereas that diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline is maintained to be ſo effectual, as that all that are exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed with it, ſhall be ſaved. What can be more abhorrent to common ſenſe? or more reproachful to Chriſt, to his goſpel and kingdom? A man that can ſwallow ſuch ſhocking impiety and abſurdity, may ſwallow a camel. Let this queſtion be fairly examined, viz. Can their doctrine agree, with the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of diſcipline taught in ſcripture, and by common ſenſe? Is that puniſhment among men, which is to the ſubject of it "death," "deſtruction," "perdition," utter ruin, diſcipline; and not capital? if not, how can a puniſhment with everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſtruction, be diſcipline? In the ſcripture exhibition of diſcipline, a door of mercy is opened, terms and means of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation are appointed, whereby ſinful men may be reconciled and ſaved. But the door is ſhut—all theſe are excluded to thoſe, who are cut off and caſt out of the kingdom in the future pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. Scripture diſcipline, is to form the characters of men for a future judgment and a ſtate of retribution: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the characters of all, are already formed, diſcloſed, and judgment rendered on them, ſentence paſſed and put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherein the righteous are rewarded and the wicked pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. Again, it is a grand object and end of diſcipline as taught by ſcripture and common ſenſe, to form men to be good ſubjects of the ſtates and kingdoms of this world, and of the kingdom of God. But how can a capital puniſhment, that cuts them off and ſhuts them out of both kingdoms, poſſibly agree with it? In the divine diſcipline, infinite wiſdom ſo tempers judgments with mercies, as to be beſt adapted to the good of the ſubject. But how can a diſpenſation of judgment without mercy, and "wrath without mixture" conſiſt with it? A grand object of diſcipline is the good of the ſubject exerciſed
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:019737_0140_0FACA3F8ED6BAF80"/>
with it. But vindictive wrath as held forth in all the diſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the future puniſhment, and the enſamples of it in this world, is not for the good of thoſe who periſh in it; but for the vindication and ſupport of the divine character and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and for the good of others. How incongruous and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd would it be to addreſs a criminal going to execution, in the language of diſcipline? to tell him, in the deſign of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment you are going to be hanged for your good; to make you a good ſubject, and meeten you for the privileges of that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of which you will be forever cut off, by it. And equally falſe, ſhocking and more wicked, to addreſs ſinners—"if you go on in your ſins, you will be damned for your good; to meeten you for the inheritance of that kingdom of Chriſt and of God, from which you are caſt out, cut off and excluded, by your puniſhment." One inſtance more, in ſcripture diſcipline, the object is, that men be ſaved in the day of the Lord, and not condemned with the world, 1 Cor. 5.5. ch. 11.32. and infinite wiſdom, love and care is exerciſed in an addreſs of the moſt powerful motives, to preſerve and ſupport the characters of thoſe who are heirs and to inherit the heavenly kingdom. They are enjoined "to keep themſelves from idols" "unſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the world," "to ſhew themſelves children of their heavenly father" by divine imitation—"to ſhine as lights of the world," "that others by their good works might glorify their heavenly Father," "that they may be preſerved unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukeable," "be accounted meet and worthy, the heavenly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance prepared for them." But how eſſentially different and oppoſite, the diſpenſation of God to the wicked in the day of judgment and world to come? Their characters expoſed, and all their wickedneſs, ſecret and open, laid open to the view of all worlds in the day of judgment: then caſt out of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom as accurſed, and conſigned to the moſt ignominious and painful puniſhment with the devil and his angels; conſigned to ſhame and "everlaſting contempt?" Now, is it poſſible that the preſervation and total deſtruction and ruin of charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſhould both be appointed "to form characters and meeten ſubjects for the ſame kingdom &amp; inheritance?" Can both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one denomination and character of "diſcipline" belong to the ſame plan of mercy, and conſtitution of grace, whereby
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:019737_0141_0FACA3F9A4DE2BE0"/>
only, ſinful man can be ſaved? an infidel, might be aſhamed to imbrace ſuch palpable contradictions and abſurdities, as ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of his faith.</p>
               <p>I paſs to the other tenet, viz. That all who are conſigned to the future puniſhment, will in ſome future period, bow to the authority of God, and ſo be delivered and ſaved. Their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal ſupport is, Iſa. 45.22, 23. "Look unto me, and be ye ſaved, all the ends of the earth:" (not hell) "for I am God, and there is none elſe." "I have ſworn by myſelf, the word is gone out of my mouth in righteouſneſs, and ſhall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, that unto me every knee ſhall bow, every tongue ſhall ſwear." Refering the particular deſign of theſe words to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, I ſhall obſerve two or three things to clear the text from their conſtruction. I would firſt obſerve, St. Paul twice quotes and applies theſe words, but not to eſtabliſh this future bowing and ſalvation of the condemned, in the laſt judgment. Once it is to ſet forth the ſupreme and uncontroulable domin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of Chriſt over all things, Phil. 2.9, 10, 11. This will be il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate when in fact "every creature (friend or enemy) ſhall be made to bow to him," and every tongue ſhall confeſs Jeſus Chriſt is Lord," the ſupreme Governor and Judge of all. But this is conſiſtent with the deſtruction of his enemies: yea, it is this ſupreme uncontroulable dominion and powe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> of Chriſt that inſures the everlaſtling ſalvation of his people, and deſtruction of his enemies. Therefore, moſt pertinent is the addreſs in the next verſe, "work out your own ſalvation with fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling." In the other inſtanc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he applies it expreſsly to the day of judgment, Rom. 14.10, 11. "For we muſt all ſtand before the judgment ſeat of Chriſt," "for it is written, as I live ſaith the Lord, every knee ſhall bow to me, and every tongue ſhall confeſs to God." It is evident from this application of the words of the prophet, that they will have their fulfilment in the day of judgment, and it is the laſt fulfilment they will ever have, for it is the laſt we read of. But it is certain that "this bowing and confeſſing will not be accompanied and connected with the ſalvation of all men in that day: for the wicked will then be condemned and muſt ſuffer unutterable pain and torment as they allow.<note n="†" place="bottom">See Salvation for all men, preface, p. 4. and p. 24.</note> Their conſtruction then is
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:019737_0142_0FACA3FA658312B8"/>
excluded, confuted and wholly ſet aſide. I would next obſerve, "this bowing" belongs to the conſtitution of the kingdom of Chriſt in this world; as truly and fully as any other text in the book of God. This cannot be denied: conſequently, it muſt and will have its accompliſhment in his diſpenſation of the kingdom in this world, or in the ſettlement of it at the end of the world. For then every thing appertaining to his kingdom will be fulfilled, "and the miſtery of God will be finiſhed." This cuts off and excludes their conſtruction, intirely. To make the matter more plain, I obſerve further; the text hath a ſpecial reference to two grand, remarkable periods, in which it will have a literal and eminent fulfilment. The firſt period is in the diſpenſation of this kingdom in this world; in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gathering of all nations, even "the fullneſs of Jews and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles" into it: "When the kingdoms of this world" by cordial ſubjection, ſhall literally "become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Chriſt," Rev. 11.15. The call to "the ends of the earth, to look to him and be ſaved," hath a pointed reference to this period: it will be ſo extenſively effectual, as that it may literally and with greateſt propriety be ſaid "that every knee doth bow to him, and every tongue doth ſwear" fealty and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to him: and ſhall openly profeſs "in the Lord have I righteouſneſs and ſtrength," v. 24. and an innumerable mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude no doubt will be ſaved. "In the Lord ſhall all the ſeed of Iſrael be juſtified, and ſhall glory," v. 25. The other pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, is the day of judgment, at the final ſettlement of the great affairs of his kingdom. This we ſee Paul expreſsly witneſſeth. Then all and every one, willing or unwilling muſt bow, to his authority and ſentence as ſupreme Lord and Judge. The unwilling and diſobedient muſt bow under the ſentence and weight of his wrath. The ſcripture very clearly gives us the key of this conſtruction; but never once extends it beyond the day of judgment. In this way the text gives us important in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and encouragement to bow in a cordial ſubjection to Chriſt in this world, that we may be ſaved. And inforces the duty with a ſolemn admonition and warning, that in caſe we neglect it, we muſt bow to his authority, power and ſentence, and abide the tremendous, and eternal conſequence. But in their conſtruction, the deſigned inſtruction and admonition for
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:019737_0143_0FACA3FB28470130"/>
the good of the world, is loſt. For this and many other reaſons we muſt of neceſſity, reject it. Let the queſtion be put, Where is this bowing in the future ſtate, required? where as a term of ſalvation? where is there any promiſe made to it? there is none in the revelations of God: it is unknown in it. It is not that bowing by faith, that is the goſpel term of life; that is for this world "to ſave us from the wrath to come" and not thoſe who are in that ſtate of miſery. Goſpel faith, eſſentially differs from that bowing to divine authority they ſet up, in all reſpects. It differs as to ſtate, ſubjects, worlds, and effects. Faith is for this ſtate, that for the future: the ſubjects of the one, are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of mercy, under a diſpenſation of mercy: the other "veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of wrath, fitted for deſtruction, in a ſtate of perdition:"— the one in this, the other in the world to come: and as different in effect. Faith brings glory to God, to his Son, to his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and grace: it "purifies the heart from dead works to ſerve the living God" in this world: "it overcomes the world," &amp;c. but their bowing in the future ſtate cannot poſſibly anſwer the grand purpoſes of faith, in this world. It brings no glory to God and his promiſes; doth no honor to Chriſt and his goſpel; brings no ſecurity to piety, to vertue and holineſs, and to the intereſt of the kingdom of God, in this world. It doth not eſtabliſh the law, nor the requiſitions of the goſpel, but makes both void. It cannot overcome the world, for it commences after the earth is periſhed; and there is no world to overcome, in the goſpel ſenſe. Therefore, this bowing can overcome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but the whole goſpel conſtitution, with its infinitely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant connexions; to which it is directly oppoſed. For the plain language of it is,—God gives up to his enemies, his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite authority and government as exerciſed in this world: he makes the great ſacrifice of the honor of it; and of all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions of law and goſpel in this ſtate; and cancels all the threatnings and curſes of his ſacred book; then they bow and take ſalvation. The ſuppoſition is big with blaſphemy and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor, horror and ruin. 'Tis deſolation to the character, autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and government of the infinite Jehovah: and it announces abſolute ruin to the whole moral creation. For, this great ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice once made, no foundation is left for the confidence, hope and happineſs of creatures, to reſt upon. This future bowing
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:019737_0144_0FACA3FBF08036C8"/>
is a doctrine of infinite reproach &amp; miſchief, every way. What more ruinous to periſhing ſinners? while it promiſeth them redemption, it lulls them aſleep in a ſtate of condemnation and wrath: while it promiſes them liberty and ſalvation, it rivets the chains of bondage, corruption and miſery upon them; with a vain deluſive expectation of a future bowing to effect it. It caſts the higheſt reproach upon the eternal judgment, by teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it will not be final to mankind; nor any manifeſtation of retributive, vindictive juſtice, againſt the objects of juſtice, &amp;c. It is highly reproachful to the infinite majeſty, truth and juſtice of God. When to alarm a loſt, ſtupid world to their duty and ſafety, he hath ſo oft proclaimed it his prerogative and glory "Vengeance is mine, and I will recompenſe it:" Yet when the great day of vengeance is come; this doctrine teacheth, no vindictive wrath will be executed upon his enemies; no retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butive juſtice will be rendered to veſſels of wrath fitted for deſtruction;—it is all "diſcipline" in earth and hell. But diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline cannot be retribution; no more than light and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, black and white, can be the ſame. It is highly reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the Saviour, teaching that he executes the office, and ſettles all the great affairs of his kingdom, as Judge; before he has finiſhed his work as a Saviour: After which we are told, "there is a great deal to be done," &amp;c. It doth indeed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to honor the grace of God and merit of the Saviour: but it caſts infinite reproach on both, as inſufficient to ſave in this world, thoſe who are to be ſaved, thereby: inſufficient, to ſave them but by their perſonally enduring the future torment to make them a willing people. It is moſt highly reproachful to the kingdom of Chriſt, with all the glorious apparatus of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, means, privileges and advantages of it, accompanied with all the exertions of God and men to ſave men in this world. This doctrine teacheth, it all unneceſſary; the whole might be ſpared. This bowing, it ſeems, will ſave them as ſurely, effectually, and more extenſively. In a word, it levels the goſpel and the divine religion taught in it, with the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions of this world, and with no religion at all in point of neceſſity in this world, to final ſalvation. This bowing, it ſeems, will ſupply the want of the goſpel, and of all religion and vertue in this world, and ſave all that need ſalvation, without it.—
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:019737_0145_0FACA3FCAA9006D0"/>
Who now doth not ſee, that this doctrine in the natural opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, is an outlet to all vertue and good; and an inlet to all wickedneſs to deluge the earth? and that it is moſt ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of the good and happineſs of mankind, in time and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity? It is as fatal to the ſouls of men, as the doctrine of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by the law and by works, ſo ſtrongly refuted and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated by St. Paul; and far more miſchievous to the intereſts of ſociety and welfare of men, in this world.

can ye eſcape the damnation of hell?" "ye ſhall receive grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter damnation," &amp;c. Mar. 23.13, 14, 33, &amp;c. it is morally cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, from their carping diſpoſition and their particular concern in ſuch an application, that they would have excepted againſt his doctrine, could they have found any poſſible room for it. Therefore, their profound ſilence upon this head, is a clear, tacit confeſſion and ſtrong witneſs his general doctrine with all its everlaſting terrors, was agreeable to their public faith, how much ſoever they diſliked the pointed application.</p>
               <p>Further, it is well known the Jews maintained, that ſinners of the Gentiles living and dying in idolatry, without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the true God, would be utterly and finally loſt, to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and hope. And in this ſenſe, familiar to the Jews and diſciples, our Lord ſpeaks of Judas as "loſt:" ſtiles him "the ſon of perdition," denoting him an heir of and conſigned to perdition, as before noted. Paul taught, and the chriſtian church believed, this ſame doctrine with the Jews; that "Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters ſhall not inherit the kingdom of God," 1 Cor. 6.9. that idolatrous gentiles, continuing in that ſtate, are "without God" and "hope" of his ſalvation, Eph. 2.12. that unbelievers under the goſpel are in the ſame ſenſe "loſt": "but if our goſpel be hid, it is hid to them that are loſt:<note n="†" place="bottom">To evade the force of all this, it is ſaid, "yet the Son of Man came to ſeek and to ſave them who were loſt." "He came, not to call the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, but ſinners to repentance," ſee ſome deductions from the ſyſtem of revelation, p. 18. and what then? The inference deſigned is, "that all that our Saviour and his apoſtles repreſent as loſt, and all the impenitent ſhall be ſaved." Never worſe logic and divinity. Our Saviour has taught us the way in which only he will ſave them who were loſt. "He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth ſhall be ſaved, but he that believeth not ſhall be damned." He not only calls ſinners to repentance, but inforces the duty with certain perdition to the impenitent. "Except ye repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh." Now will he in the day of judgment, or in any future period, gainſay this doctrine, which he taught on earth? and ſay to the finally impenitent and unbelieving, "ye ſhall not periſh and be damned, but ſhall be ſaved? Will any but a thoro' placed infidel affirm it? and yet if he doth not ſo gainſay it, they are forever loſt, and cannot be ſaved; and the deſigned inference is deſtroyed.</note> in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them that believe not," 2 Cor. 4.3, 4. that Paul had no hope of the ſalvation of any, but thoſe who entertained the goſpel faith in this world, is evident, from his great anxiety for the Jews that they might "believe and be
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:019737_0147_0FACA3FE2B23F5E8"/>
ſaved:" from his great and ardent labours, "if by any means he might ſave ſome of them," Rom. 11.14. 1 Cor. 9.22. and from his expreſs declaration, that the diſobedient to the goſpel ſhould "be puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction," 2 Theſ. 1.8, 9. Moreover, there is one article of faith, in which the jewiſh and chriſtian church were united; which is deciſive, viz. that no one can ever be ſaved but in compliance with the terms of life, appointed of God to men, in this ſtate. This ſeems evident, in the queſtion reſpecting circumciſion agitated by the apoſtles and primitive church at Jeruſalem, as recorded in the 15th chap. of Acts. The judaizing teachers and chriſtians maintained, the abſolute neceſſity of circumciſion to ſalvation. They taught "except ye be circumciſed after the manner of Moſes, ye cannot be ſaved," ver. 1. The ſimple queſtion in diſpute was, whether circumciſion and a ſubmiſſion to the ritual of the law of Moſes, was an eſſential term of ſalvation under the goſpel, or not. This fully implies, their unanimous agreement in this principle, viz. "That the terms of ſalvation appointed of God to men in this world, muſt of neceſſity be complied with; and that no one under advantage for it, could ever be ſaved without it. For if no terms were eſſential and neceſſary to ſalvation, or if all men might be ſaved in the future world without complying with any terms in this; the queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther circumciſion was neceſſary, and they could not be ſaved without it; was idle, futile, and very abſurd. Surely it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible, that the chriſtian church, with thy inſpired apoſtles at their head, accompanied with the ſuperintending influences of the Holy Ghoſt, ſhould be concerned, in the deciſion of a queſtion which in reality had no foundation for it. The ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition carries the higheſt reflection of diſhonour in it. The concluſion therefore, forces itſelf upon us "that it was the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited faith of the jewiſh and chriſtian church, and their inſpired teachers, that of neceſſity we muſt comply with the appointed terms of life in this world, or never ſee and enjoy the ſalvation of God." The conſequence is clear, the final neglectors of ſalvation cannot be ſaved, but muſt be miſerable throughout their exiſtence. And what need we more? we have the faith once delivered to, and actually embraced by the ſaints of God: the faith of the apoſtolic church, built upon the apoſtles and
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:019737_0148_0FACA3FEF9E7DA40"/>
prophets, Jeſus Chriſt the chief corner ſtone; which we are told is the pillar and ground of truth. We know no other rule of faith; here we are ſafe, and no where elſe. I ſubjoin but one remark: All the arguments of our opponents from ſcripture, muſt be from miſtake and miſconſtruction of the ſacred texts: for the inſpired penmen, and particularly Paul, never believed their doctrine, but the contrary: which he and they taught, and the church of God received from them. They never taught, that all the unbelieving and diſobedient of this world ſhould be ſaved in that which is future, "by bowing to the authority of God," becauſe it is contrary to their unanimous <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>th, as hath now been evinced. They never taught but one doctrine of ſalvation as heretofore illuſtrated; and but one way to obtain it, by a cordial compliance with the goſpel terms of life in this ſtate and world: by which, as the rule of judgment, the ſtates of men will be deciſively and finally determined, in the day of judgment.<note n="‡" place="bottom">From this principle, and many other ways, it is evident, the jewiſh and chriſtian church did not believe in two manners of ſalvation; one for the elect and ſanctified in the reſurrection and day of judgment; the other for the unſanctified non-elect, afterwards. It is directly oppoſite to this article of their faith, and the current of ſcripture. Nor did they believe in their patch-work doctrine of a world to come and next ſtate, not eternal, conſiſting of ages of ages taken off from eternity and the adminiſtration of God when all in all; and ſomehow tacked on to time, after "time ſhall be no more," in which the Saviour, when he hath long before executed his work as a judge, ſhall compleat his work as a Saviour. Theſe enthuſiaſtic dreams, of viſionary, theoretic dreamers, have ſtarted forth into the world long enough ſince the days of inſpiration, and appear as much unknown and diſregarded by the church of God, in the days of inſpiration, as the wild reveries of the Elect Lady in the north of us.</note>
               </p>
               <p>This brings us to the 6th and laſt propoſition, viz. to ſhew that the doctrine of the laſt, the eternal judgment ſet forth in the word of God, and particularly by our Saviour and his apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, is deciſive of this controverſy; that the ſentence and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of the wicked will be eternal.</p>
               <p>Is not the day of judgment purpoſely appointed, to adjuſt and ſettle the all-important affairs of God's moral kingdom, for eternity? If ſo, the deciſion will be final, and the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy is at an end. The deciſions of that day as final and for eternity, or as temporary, makes a moſt eſſential difference in the ſyſtem of revelation, and in the practical influence of the
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:019737_0149_0FACA3FFABDA8C18"/>
doctrine upon mankind; and therefore highly merits attention. That there will be ſuch a final ſettlement, in which the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God will ſhine forth in eternal perfection and glory; ſeems a clear dictate of reaſon and ſcripture. And when to be effected, if not in the great day of univerſal judgment? They admit there will be ſuch a ſettlement, but ſay not at that period. For "there will be a great deal to be done after the ſecond coming of Chriſt," &amp;c. If ſo, it ſeems, the ſettlement of this great kingdom our Lord will then make, will be partial and imperfect: he finiſhes the diſpenſation of his kingdom before he hath compleated his ſaving work: and he executes his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of judge, before he has finiſhed his work as a Saviour; and before matters are prepared for a final ſentence and deciſion of the ſtates of multitudes, who are to be judged by him. How irrational, unſcriptural and diſhonorary is all this? The abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of that tenet is ſo glaring, at firſt view, that a few hints will be ſufficient to evince and fix the true doctrine.</p>
               <p>When it is conſidered—the tenor of revelation teacheth, this ſtate of mankind is introductory to one that is eternal:— this, a ſtate of diſcipline; that, of retribution; that the day of judgment is certainly appointed to decide and ſettle the ſtates of all men, good and bad, for the world to come: that then in fact, the righteous will be adjudged "to life eternal" and the wicked "to everlaſting puniſhment;" and the belief of that deciſion as final and unalterable to them, is the grand ſupport of the faith, hope, conſtancy and fidelity of the godly in all ages; and that the hopes and fears of all men are every where terminated in the deciſions of that day and no other—"by thy words thou ſhalt be juſtified, or by thy words thou ſhalt be condemned," "the word that I have ſpoken, the ſame ſhall judge him in the laſt day," is the doctrine of Chriſt. Paul prays for his friend and benefactor Oneſiphorus, "that he might find mercy of the Lord in that day:" and Jude teaches us "to keep ourſelves in the love of God," in that way "look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the mercy of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt unto eternal life." But not a ſingle inſtruction in the book of God, to look for mercy after the deciſion of that day. Who that views the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring evidence and force of all this, can doubt, the deciſion of that day will be final? Again, the grand deſcriptions of
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:019737_0150_0FACA4009AFCA160"/>
the day of judgment, with the infinitely important tranſactions and deſigns of it, clearly indicate it, final. When all nations and the whole moral world ſhall be aſſembled before Chriſt— ſhall render their account at his bar—the character and ſtates of all be fixed by him: ſentence and execution ſhall paſs upon all univerſally, both the righteous and wicked:—What more can be requiſite, to a compleat, final ſettlement, of the ſtates of all men, and the whole moral world? And what can be the meaning of this inconceiveably grand aſſemblage of the whole moral world, and proceſs of the eternal Judge, if it be not final and for eternity? Further, the heavens will reveal Chriſt in that day, for the reſtitution &amp; regulation of "all things ſpoken of by all the prophets,"<note n="‖" place="bottom">Acts 31.21.</note> which remain to be regulated. And when he hath finiſhed his work, adjuſted &amp; regulated all things ſpoken of in revelation, there can be no more to be done, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ſcripture: it is final and for eternity. Again, Chriſt will then come in his glory, and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels of ſet purpoſe, to raiſe the dead, judge the world, ſettle the kingdom of God, and to be glorified as Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and Judge, in a manner as never before or afterwards. We ſurely conclude, he will then execute ſuch an all-important work, as never was before and never will be repeated: that the ſtates of all that are judged, will be finally fixed; and the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God will be ſettled finally and in higheſt perfection and glory; to be adequate and anſwerable to ſuch an appearance and deſign. Can a partial, imperfect ſettlement be adequate and anſwerable to ſuch an infinitely magnificent appearance, and to a deſign correſponding to, and worthy of it? Doth the ſpirit of inſpiration arreſt the attention of the church and world of mankind, to look for no more, than ſuch a work, at his coming? Will ſaints and angels behold no more than this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, temporary work, in the finiſhing of his kingdom, in that great day, for which to glorify the adorable Immanuel? Who can believe it? It is alſo to be noted, it is the day of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic manifeſtations of the ſons of God in their glory, as never before or afterwards; and the day of vengeance of our God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his enemies: the great day to magnify his word and illuſtrate the promiſes and threatnings of it in the cleareſt and
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:019737_0151_0FACA4028B944B60"/>
ſtrongeſt light: to reveal and manifeſt his righteouſneſs; to vindicate his authority and government, and to diſplay the glory of his moral character and government, in the open view of the univerſe. This done, what more can be needful? Yea, what more can be done, to ſettle the all-important affairs of his kingdom in the higheſt perfection conceivable, for eternity? and we repeat the queſtion, When will it be effected, if not in that great day? Inſpiration gives us a prophetic view of the grand ſcenes of providence, to take place to the end of the world, and of the unutterably grand ſettlement of the kingdom of God and the ſtates of the moral world in the day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but if this, be not final; it gives us no intimation of the time and manner in which the final ſettlement for eternity, by far the moſt important of all, is to be made. This ſurely is a moſt dark and incredible affair. It is admitted, the ſtates of the righteous will be then fixed for eternity: and why not of the wicked, likewiſe? when there is one judge, one day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and one and the ſame rule, for both. Add to this, the ſcripture no where teach, that he will ever ſettle the ſtate of the finally diſobedient in a retribution of mercy; nor any rule given whereby they ever can be adjudged, to eternal life: but in every account of it by our Saviour and all the apoſtles, particularly Paul and John, it will be ſettled in a diſpenſation of ſtrict, retributive juſtice and vindictive wrath. Our Lord will ſay to the wicked, "depart ye curſed," and "theſe ſhall go away into everlaſting puniſhment," as he teacheth us, 25th Mat. St. Paul exhibits the ground and whole proceſs of the day of judgment againſt the diſobedient, upon the footing of ſtrict, impartial, retributive juſtice. "Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompenſe tribulation to them that trouble you; and to you who are troubled, reſt with us." Here is the righteous ground of it. He proceeds to deſcribe the manner of his coming, correſponding with the deſign of it, in the ſtrongeſt language of vindictive wrath "when the Lord Jeſus ſhall be revealed from heaven, in flaming fire," this is the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his appearance, "taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; who ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power,"<note n="§" place="bottom">2 Theſ. 1.5, to the 10th.</note>
                  <pb n="133" facs="unknown:019737_0152_0FACA402CA400600"/>
this is the work he will execute. St. John teaches, after the judgment "whoſoever were not found written in the book of life, were caſt into the lake of fire," Rev. 20.15. Now, we read of no mercy for them, no reverſal of this judgment, no other deciſion of their ſtates for eternity: and it being ſo writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and left, plainly ſhews it final, and for eternity.</p>
               <p>Moreover, every general deſcription of the future judgment with its reſult and conſequences, exhibit it, as a final ſettlement of the ſtates of all, good and bad. The prophet Malachi re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents it, "the day of God's making up his jewels" for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting glory: when there will be a perfect, final diviſion made "between the righteous and the wicked," "him that ſerveth God, and him that ſerveth him not."<note n="‖" place="bottom">Mal. 3.17, 18.</note> And what is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence? "all the wicked ſhall be burnt up, as an oven."<note n="‡" place="bottom">ch. 4. v. 1.</note> Is not this final to them? John the Baptiſt aſſures us "Chriſt will thoro'ly purge his floor, gather the wheat into his garner, and burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire? Can any figure more ſtrongly repreſent, a final ſettlement? Is not the diviſion perfect, between the righteous and the wicked, intended by the wheat and chaff? and is not the work as finiſhed for the chaff, the wicked, when "burnt up with unquenchable fire" as for the righteous? we have ſeen that our Saviour in a variety of parables teacheth us, that at the end of the world, "he will come and ſettle the great affairs of his kingdom, by making a perfect ſeparation between his ſubjects according to character, "between good and bad, the juſt and unjuſt," accompanied with a full retribution, and cloſed with everlaſting ſentences on the righteous and on the wicked. If this doth not clearly and ſtrongly evince it a final ſettlement of their ſtates for eternity, what words, what deſcription can do it? One thing more merits attention, the peculiar epithets and emphaſis put upon the future judgment, indicates it final. It is frequently ſtiled "the laſt day:"<note n="†" place="bottom">Joh. 6.39, 40, 44, 45. &amp; ch. 11.24. &amp; ch. 12.48.</note> and the grand works appropriated to it are, the univerſal reſurrection, and univerſal judgment and deciſion of the ſtates of the whole moral world. Now as there will be no reſurrection of the dead, after that period, there is the ſame reaſon to conclude, there will be no more judgment; and that no one will be adjudged to eternal life, after that day. It is
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:019737_0153_0FACA4036DC3DDB8"/>
repeatedly deſcribed as "that day" by way of emphaſis, to denote it the moſt important day that ever will be. But if the moral kingdom of God, and the ſtates of all men, will not be finally ſettled for eternity at that period, whence this emphaſis? where is the propriety of it? It is deſcribed, as "the eternal judgment:" thus it was taught by the apoſtles, and ſo it was received by the chriſtian church and as a "firſt principle of the chriſtian faith:" "Therefore leaving the firſt principles of the doctrine of Chriſt," &amp;c. "of the reſurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment," Heb. 6.1, 2. but why was it ſo taught and ſo received, if the deciſion and ſentences of that day, be not final and for eternity? Is it not a glaring contradiction, to ſay, there will be a judgment after "the laſt" and that which is "eternal?" Why ſhould not this convince and ſatisfy every one, ſince all the deſcriptions of the future judgment uniformly and deciſively ſpeak the ſame doctrine; and there is no intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in revelation of a judgment, alteration, or another deciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, after that great day of the Lord. Still dreaming theoriſts would fancy another day, and ſettlement: but they are preclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the teſtimony of God. "For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son," Joh. 5.22. "The Son will execute the office of judge, the power of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and finiſh the work of judgment, in the "laſt day;" and then give up the kingdom and commiſſion of Judge unto the Father, and "God will be all in all," in adminiſtration thro' out eternity. An impartial mind may ſee this clearly taught 1 Cor. 15.24, to 29. We have before tranſcribed the para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph at large and obſerved, that "the coming of Chriſt," "the reſurrection," "the end," "the putting down all enemies, and ſubdual of all things unto him," "the delivering up the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom," "the Son himſelf ſubject," and "God all in all," are all ſet forth, as coeval, cotemporary events to take place toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the grand period of the laſt day: and doth clearly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the all-important ſettlement then made; final, and for eternity. How can it be otherwiſe, when the diſpenſation of Chriſt's kingdom is at an end? and there is neither judge— tribunal—nor day appointed, for any after audit and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? the ſpirit of inſpiration hath connected theſe grand events together, nor can they be ſevered and diſconnected,
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:019737_0154_0FACA4042DA418E8"/>
without unſcriptural preſumption and violence. Upon the whole, we find not a ſyllable in ſcripture upon this ſubject, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it: but from all the deſcriptions given of it, we have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very reaſon to confide in it, as an undoubted truth, "that the day of judgment is purpoſely appointed to adjuſt and ſettle the all-important affairs of the kingdom of God and of Chriſt, and the ſtates of all mankind, for eternity; and was accordingly taught and believed by the apoſtles and primitive church, to be "the eternal judgment," and as ſuch received as "a firſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple" of the chriſtian faith. The concluſion is irreſiſtable— the ſentence both upon the righteous and wicked to comport with this grand deſign, muſt be "eternal." That day is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to reveal and manifeſt the righteous judgment of God, in a retributive juſtice and puniſhment to the wicked, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the demerit of their ſins, which is eternal death.<note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. 6. laſt ver.</note> The ſentence and puniſhment awarded in that day, will perfectly agree with all the imported, figurative and literal deſcriptions of it throughout revelation; which we have ſhewn, uniformly teach it without end, and eternal. In that day, there will be an open, viſible and laſting ſeparation made, between the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and the wicked: and to anſwer to the enſamples of it, it will be "everlaſting." The goſpel conſtitution, promiſes, threatnings and rule of judgment are all unchangeable, and will abide forever. Therefore the ſentence of condemnation in that day, muſt be eternal; it being impoſſible they can ever be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared juſt, by the ſame conſtitution &amp; rule of judgment, which condemns them. The ground of the future ſentence, things done in the body in this life, is unalterable and unchangeable: of courſe, a righteous ſentence upon it, muſt be irreverſible and eternal: inaſmuch as the ground and rule upon which it is paſſed, will remain everlaſtingly the ſame.—A puniſhment, to anſwer the grand purpoſe of a full, everlaſting vindication of the character, authority and government of God, and to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle his kingdom in eternal peace, ſecurity, dignity and glory; we have before ſhewn, muſt be eternal. In a perfect agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with theſe evident poſitions, our Lord aſſures us, the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment to which he will ſentence the wicked in that day, and into which they ſhall go away, is "everlaſting." "Then ſhall
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:019737_0155_0FACA404EDCC03A8"/>
he ſay unto them on the left hand, depart from me, ye curſed, into everlaſting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels." "And theſe ſhall go away into everlaſting puniſhment: but the righteous into life eternal."<note n="‡" place="bottom">Mat. 25.41 and 46.</note> Can any one doubt, the word "everlaſting" in this ſentence is to be underſtood in the ſtrict ſenſe? Let it be conſidered, when our Lord is revealed in his immenſe majeſty and glory on the throne of judgment, no one doubts, he will fully ſupport the dignity and glory of his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, as judge. From which we infer, "the words in this ſentence are moſt clear, unambiguous and deciſive." For it is inconſiſtent with all propriety, decorum and dignity in a judge, to announce a capital ſentence in any other words, but what are familiar and of a determinate meaning. The ſame word, therefore, in the ſame ſentence, muſt have determinately the ſame ſenſe and meaning. This word "everlaſting" as deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the puniſhment of the wicked, and of the devil and his angels, muſt have the ſame meaning to both. This ſame word, in the ſame ſentence, contraſting the duration of the puniſhment of the wicked, with the life and happineſs of the righteous, muſt deciſively point out the ſame duration to both. To ſuppoſe, our Lord means to point out a temporary puniſhment to the wicked, and an everlaſting happineſs to the righteous, by one and the ſame word<note n="*" place="bottom">Thoſe who know the original, know the ſame adjective is uſed in each part of the deſcription.</note> in the ſame ſentence, is to ſuppoſe him to uſe it with ſuch amazing ambiguity, impropriety and indeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, as no earthly judge would be guilty of, in a capital ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. Far be ſuch an imputation from the Judge of all worlds. This ſentence was given by our Lord, and is written to aſſure the world how he will ſettle the ſtates of all men, good and bad in the day of judgment, for eternity. And we have juſt the ſame aſſurance in it, that the puniſhment of the wicked will be ſtrictly "everlaſting" as we have of the life and happineſs of the righteous. Again, upon this ground of conſtruction, puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to be underſtood, in the ſtrict ſenſe of "retributive juſtice," and the word "eternal" muſt be taken in that ſenſe in which it would be moſt eaſily and naturally underſtood by the Jews and diſciples. And by the uſe and repetition of this term of duration, our Lord deſigns deciſively, to determine the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:019737_0156_0FACA405AB4FCC90"/>
of this puniſhment, which is by far the greateſt terror of it, as ſurely and fully as that of the happineſs of the righteous. It is a puniſhment in the future, inviſible ſtate, and this word that deſcribes the duration of it, muſt naturally be underſtood in that ſenſe in which it is uſed, to deſcribe the things of the future and inviſible world; which is "the never ending ſenſe:" "the things which are ſeen are temporary, but the things which are not ſeen are eternal."<note n="‡" place="bottom">2 Cor. 4.18.</note> We muſt doubtleſs underſtand it, according to the invariable uſe of it (i.e.) to be as laſting as the nature and conſtitution of the things, to which it is applied: being here applied to beings by nature and conſtitution immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, in an eternal ſtate; the ſentence to the righteous and to the wicked muſt be ſtrictly, eternal. The diſciples would natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, yea neceſſarily underſtand it, in the ſenſe taught by the prophets, commonly believed by the Jews, in which they had been educated, and which had been repeatedly confirmed by our Lord, which is ſtrictly eternal. And our Saviour doubtleſs deſigned it in this ſenſe, in which they would naturally receive it; to ſuppoſe otherwiſe, would be a direct impeachment of his integrity as a teacher, and to diſhonour him as a judge. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, he hath deſignedly and deciſively fixed the duration of the future puniſhment, by way of connexion and contraſt: it will be as laſting, as "the fire," "the everlaſting one prepared for the devil and his angels," with which it is connected; and as laſting, as "the eternal life of the righteous," with which it is contraſted. For why is this word uſed? why, in this connxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and with ſuch repetition, but to fix the duration of it? and how is it poſſible to be more clearly and ſtrongly fixed, in ſo few words? This muſt be deciſive and determine the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy. Criticiſm upon a word in ſuch a caſe, avails nothing. When the nature, the grand deſign, the conſtitution and rule of judgment, the grounds of the ſentence, and the ends of this infinitely important tranſaction in the laſt day, are all conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with the deciſive language and manner of the ſentence, by connexion and contraſt, it is impoſſible the apoſtles could un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the puniſhment of a limited period; which, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable they had never heard of. The word "eternal," placed in ſuch variety of ſtrong connexions, is as determinately fixed, as
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:019737_0157_0FACA40674D13D80"/>
is perhaps poſſible for a word to be: and this ſentence ſo clear, unambiguous and deciſive (than which perhaps no capital ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence was ever more ſo) will do honour to the eternal Judge. It precludes all cavil and criticiſm, and mocks it with defiance. Indeed, there is ſomething extremely indelicate, incongruous and abſurd, in criticiſing the words of a capital ſentence, to ſet aſide the ſpirit and energy of it. Becauſe, from the nature of the thing, they are always ſuppoſed to be the moſt plain, clear and determinate. Suppoſe one of the carpers of this world, ſhould criticiſe the word "death" in a capital ſentence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced upon a murderer: he addreſſes the criminal, with the great mercy of the government which forbid the execution: tells him, ſuch violent execution ſhocks humanity with its hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and our reaſon with its incredibility, "it exceeds belief:" and to ſooth his fears, adds, You muſt note the word "death" is ambiguous, and certainly uſed in a variety of different con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions in ſcripture, and in common language; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is doubtful, as connected in the ſentence paſſed upon you: ſometimes it means natural death, ſometimes tho' ſeldom, a violent death, at other times moral death, ſome times neither of theſe, but only the fear and danger of death: "in deaths oft" ſays Paul: not that he often died, but was oft in fear and danger of it: ſo the ſentence may put you in fear and danger, and not be literally executed: or, it may mean death in law, that you ſhall be an outlawry and ſuffer loſs and damage by it; and this may in part be the meaning of it. But there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a modern ſenſe, which (altho' unknown in ſcripture and to all the conſtitutions of the world) is yet the true ſenſe, viz. "that the murder<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>, the wickedneſs itſelf, and what of the evil ſpirit blending with you inſtigated to it, ſhall literally be hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but you perſonally, ſoul and body, ſhall ſlip through the rope, and ſhall be compleatly ſaved alive." Would not every man of common ſenſe, reprobate ſuch an unnatural, barbarous kind of criticiſm, as a ſhocking, abuſive impoſition on the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, and the higheſt indignity offered to the judge? And is not the impoſition upon periſhing immortals, and the indignity offered to the ſupreme and eternal Judge in the ſubject before us, beyond all conception greater, and more deteſtible? Verily, it appears ſo horribly impious, to attempt to criticiſe away the
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:019737_0158_0FACA40736024370"/>
terrors of the laſt, the eternal judgment, and of that deciſive ſentence, the moſt tremendous that ever was or will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced in the univerſe, as well may make one's heart and fleſh to tremble.</p>
               <p>We have now exhibited the proofs propoſed, and truſt it is made deciſively clear and evident under each propoſition, and particularly the laſt; that the future puniſhment of the wicked, as literally deſcribed in the text, will be ſtrictly for ever and ever—perpetual, and without end. If the future judgment be final, the ſentence is irreverſible, and it is impoſſible the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in that day ſhould ever be ſaved. And it behoves us, to realize the certainty, the great practical deſign, and eternal importance of the doctrine, that hath been illuſtrated. How loudly doth it admoniſh the world of mankind, to ſtand in awe and ſin not? what more forcible argument to repentance can be adduced, than that of the future judgment, with its eternal conſequences, as addreſſed by Paul to governor Felix, and the reſt of his illuſtrious audience? well may ſinners on the brink of this everlaſting deſtruction, tremble like Felix, at the thoughts of continuing in ſuch a fearful condition, adore God for his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and be led to repentance by the riches of his goodneſs. With what readineſs of heart and adoring gratitude, ſhould we embrace the offer of life and ſalvation in Chriſt? For, the eternal importance of his redemption may be ſeen and read of all men, in the greatneſs and eternal pains and terrors, from which, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers all who believe and obey him. Surely, it ought to be exceedingly important and precious in our eyes. Well may the happy ſubjects of it rejoice in the beginnings of it, and lift up their heads with joy at the approach of the great day, when their redemption ſhall be compleat, and they put in poſſeſſion of the eternal inheritance. The great day is coming, which will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly decide our ſtates, for eternity: and it is juſt as certain, that that everlaſting life or death await us in the coming world, as that the future judgment is final. And what can more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly warn us, not to neglect ſo great ſalvation; and quicken us to haſten our preparation for the coming and kingdom of the Lord. The evidence produced may be further ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and the ſubject appear ſtill more clear, when the arguments of our opponents from ſcripture texts, and their evaſions are conſidered and confuted, in the ſequel.</p>

                  <p>PROPOSITION III. Chriſt died, not for a ſelect number of men only, but for mankind univerſally, and without exception or limitation. The author alledges in proof the texts which ſpeak of Chriſt's dying "for us" "for our ſins" "for ſinners" "for the ungodly" "for the unjuſt" and as "the lamb of God which taketh away the ſin of the world" and "hath made propitiation for our ſins, and not for us only, but the whole world, "who gave his life a ranſom for all" and "taſted death for every man." And further adds, as though it were on purpoſe to prevent a miſconception of this extenſive deſign of his death, he commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned his apoſtles, and ſent them forth "to preach repentance and remiſſion of ſins, through his name, to all nations, "yea, to every reaſonable creature under heaven," which he infers could not conſiſtently be done, if in virtue of his death, the forgiveneſs of ſins, and eternal life, had not been attainable by all the ſons of men.<note n="*" place="bottom">See the ſalvation of all men the ſcheme of God. Printed in London, 1784, p. 20, 21.</note> The true inference is, that remiſſion of ſins and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life are attainable by all the ſons of men, in the way of faith in Chriſt, and repentance towards God, in this life: upon the exerciſe of which, it is aſcertained unto them. This comports with the deſign of theſe texts; and ſtates the deſign of the death of Chriſt in its true extent and juſt limitation. The goſpel com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion is produced, as teaching "the extenſive deſign of Chriſt's death" with ſuch preciſion "as to prevent miſconſtruction." It is fatal to their ſcheme: for, the apoſtles were to teach faith and repentance, in their connexion with remiſſion of ſins and eternal life, as attainable by the ſons of men in this life, only. This doctrine they were to preach to all "the living nations of the earth; and as opportunity preſented, to every humane crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:019737_0160_0FACA408B1C65AF8"/>
in them, under heaven:" but not to the dead, who died in their ſins—not to any in future torment: conſequently, the ſalvation of all theſe, is not attainable; they are excluded out of the commiſſion, and from the deſign of this death, as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely and deciſively taught in it. They are neither included in the commiſſion, nor in a ſingle paſſage in revelation, as thoſe who are to be ſaved by the ranſom of Chriſt. The meaning of theſe texts is very eaſy, if we take this commiſſion, or the goſpel conſtitution for the key of their conſtruction, as we ought to do. Thus 1 Joh. 2.2. "He is the propitiation for our ſins (who are believers) and not for ours only, but alſo for the whole world:" ſo that by becoming believers, they, as well as we, ſhall aſſuredly be ſaved by it. We have before ſhewn, that the univerſal terms of the goſpel proclamation, exhibiting the fulneſs of the proviſion made for the ſalvation of men, muſt be limited by the terms of mercy and life ſet forth in it; which deſignedly diſcriminate the ſubjects of actual, final ſalvation. So our Saviour taught, notwithſtanding the proviſion made, and invitation given, is in the fuleſt and ſtrongeſt terms, "be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, all things are now ready," "whoſoever will may come." Yet thoſe who refuſe the invitation &amp; neglect the goſpel terms of life "ſhall never taſte of his ſupper." "Chriſt hath taſted death for every man," that whoſoever believeth on him thro" the world, ſhall be ſaved, and yet actual ſalvation will never be extended to any but the believing and ſanctified in this world. That this is the genuine meaning and conſtruction of theſe texts, ſeems very evident by theſe ſhort arguments. (1.) Actual ſalvation cannot be extended beyond the deſign of God, in providing the Saviour and ſetting forth this propitiation; which is limited to thoſe who believe, Joh. 3.16. "For God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life." (2dly.) Actual ſalvation cannot extend beyond the intention of Chriſt in giving this ranſom, which is limited to the ſanctified in this world. "Who gave himſelf for us, that he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem us from all iniquity, and purify to himſelf a peculiar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, zealous of good works," Tit. 2.14. (3dly.) It cannot extend beyond the grace of God, given in purſuance of it, and to render it effectual. But this grace of God which brings
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:019737_0161_0FACA4096DEC2A20"/>
ſalvation, teaches the only way to it, "by denying all ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and worldly luſts, living ſoberly, righteouſly and godly in this preſent world," Tit. 2.11, 12, 13. (4thly.) Salvation cannot be extended beyond the interceſſions of Chriſt, which are founded on this ranſom and atonement. Now our Saviour tells us expreſsly, he prays not for the unbelieving world, Joh. 17.9. but his interceſſions are for all who believe in all ages of the world, v. 20. and it is for thoſe who come unto God by him, Heb. 7.25. nor is there an inſtance of his interceſſion, for any who die in their ſins. (5thly.) Salvation cannot be extended to thoſe who make the death of Chriſt vain, in the grand intention of it, in this world. Paul teſtifies "Chriſt ſhall profit them nothing," Gal. 5.2. In a word, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of theſe texts is ſo limited, "that by the conſtitution of grace founded upon his death and ranſom, faith in Chriſt always was, now is, and always will be, the only way of life for ſinful man." This muſt ſettle the meaning of thoſe texts fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, to the overthrow of the doctrine "that all men ſhall be ſaved." Inaſmuch as the intention of them is ſo expreſsly poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out, and the final efficacy of them ſo deciſively deſcribed and limited. For no one will be ſo hardy as to affirm, that all the unbelieving and diſobedient world will be ſaved, beſide and beyond the intention of the God of ſalvation, and without and beyond the interceſſion of Chriſt, and beyond the intention of his death likewiſe—and beſide, and in ſubverſion of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of grace and mercy itſelf, whereby any can be ſaved.</p>
                  <p>His general remark is, "If Chriſt died for all, his ſcheme perfectly falls in with the great deſign of his death." It doth not, if it be deſigned to open the door of ſalvation to all, upon the ſame terms, and to ſecure ſalvation to the believing and ſanctified in this life, only, as has been proved. In extending ſalvation to the finally diſobedient, it is in direct oppoſition to the declared deſign of the Father and the Son, in it, in the texts we have alledged. It is very evident in theſe texts, that it is deſigned to bring men to faith, repentance and goſpel holineſs in this world, and to limit ſalvation by it, to the ſanctified in this world. He adds, "it is far more reaſonable to believe that the whole humane kind, in conſequence of his death, will finally be ſaved, than that the greater part of them ſhould periſh."
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:019737_0162_0FACA40A30238838"/>
Not, if the greater part be unbelieving and diſobedient, and as ſuch are excluded by the conſtitution of grace and mercy itſelf: eſpecially, as this conſtitution is adapted in infinite wiſdom to ſupport the authority and government of God, and to illuſtrate his moral character and perfections and the honour of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt in higheſt glory, and for the greateſt good of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in this world and world to come, in the method of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion preſcribed in it. It is further added, <note n="‖" place="bottom">P. 22.</note> "more honour is hereby reflected on God, and greater vertue attributed to the blood of Chriſt" on his ſcheme. How? Is it more honourable in the ſupreme Jehovah, to give up his authority, law, goſpel and government in this world, to his enemies, than to ſupport and illuſtrate it in all its energy and glory? Is it honourable for our Saviour to ſave thoſe who will not have him to rule over them? and, after he hath expreſsly declared they ſhall be bro't and ſlain in his preſence? Is it honourable to give up a divine conſtitution, with ſuch characters of wiſdom, grace, glory and perfection, as above deſcribed, becauſe his enemies do not like it? Is it honourable or wiſe to annul and ſet it aſide after being confirmed by the promiſes, oath and immutability of God, and thereby to deſtroy the everlaſting ſecurity of the believing and redeemed world, and to unhinge the moral world of confidence in his adorable truth and immutability? It is not in imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to conceive greater diſhonours to God and the Saviour, and miſchiefs to the moral creation, than muſt follow the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the goſpel conſtitution, to make way for the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of final impenitents; nor any thing more impoſſible. So exceedingly the reverſe is their ſcheme, from what they would gloſs it off to the world, to be. This inſinuation is ſuggeſted once and again. To what is already ſaid, I will only here ſubjoin the Dr's teſtimony againſt it, as highly diſhonourable to God and the Saviour. His words are, "faith in the only begotten Son of God ſtamps a character, and the greateſt and moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting one too, upon the ſubjects of it. They have upon them that mark of God, which diſcriminates them from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſinners in the world: nor can they be juſtified, unleſs they have this diſtinguiſhing mark or character. This is as evident a truth as any in the ſacred books of ſcripture. And if God has revealed this as a goſpel truth, for any to ſay, that diſhon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:019737_0163_0FACA40AEDE62328"/>
is hereby reflected on the obedience and blood of Chriſt (by limiting juſtification and ſalvation to believers only) is in reality of conſtruction, to reproach God: and it would indeed be a reproach to Chriſt alſo, to introduce his blood as operating to the ſinner's juſtification (and ſalvation) in a way God has not appointed." "The fooliſhneſs of God, is wiſer than men," and "the wiſdom of this world is always found (eſpecially when the reaſoning is in direct oppoſition to the all-wiſe conſtitution of God) in the end, "to be fooliſhneſs with God." If God has made it neceſſary that the ſinner ſhould be a believer (which can be only in this world) before he ſhall be juſtified; or, what means the ſame thing, before he ſhall reap ſaving benefit by the obedience and blood of Chriſt, we ſhall give all due honor to this finiſhed work of his, while we conſider it as available to the juſtification of the believing ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, only. We now give it its proper uſe (and that which is infinitely the moſt honourable) and ſhould diſgrace, rather than honor it, ſhould we extend its uſe, and attribute a ſufficiency to it to a purpoſe God never deſigned it for."<note n="‖" place="bottom">See his ſermons, p. 174, 5, 6, 7, &amp; 8.</note> And to extend it to the ſalvation of final unbelievers, is to extend it to a purpoſe expreſsly againſt the deſign of God and our Saviour declared in the texts we have argued from. This teſtimony of the Dr. is full and ſtrongly concluſive, and is a full confutation of the abſurd inſinuations and reaſonings in the general remark.</p>
                  <p>To proceed,</p>
                  <p>PROPOSITION IV. "It is the purpoſe of God, according to his good pleaſure, that mankind univerſally, in conſequence of the death of his Son Jeſus Chriſt, ſhall certainly and finally be ſaved." The firſt text adduced in proof is, Rom. 5.12, to the end. It is as needleſs, as it would be tedious, to go over his paraphraſe and notes to ſupport it, which take up about ſeventy pages. That which immediately concerns us at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent is, his doctrine deduced from v. 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 and 21, viz. that by the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, the juſtification of life is come upon all men, ſo that they ſhall univerſally "reign in life forever." He ſays, p. 80. "the plain truth is, final ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting ſalvation is abſolutely the free gift of God to all men, through Jeſus Chriſt; that is to ſay, he has abſolutely and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conditionally determined, of his rich mercy, through the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:019737_0164_0FACA40BB1888AC0"/>
mediation of his Son Jeſus Chriſt, that all men, the whole race of lapſed Adam, ſhall finally reign in life, and be prepared for that ſtate, by being formed into righteous perſons." This is the doctrine he makes this apoſtle preach to the world. Certainly, Paul taught no ſuch doctrine, "that juſtification of life is come upon all the finally wicked, and that they ſhould reign in eternal life." It involves the groſſeſt abſurdities in it; it is contradicted by the current doctrine of ſcripture, and is repeatedly refuted by Paul himſelf: the word juſtification can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not admit of three or four different ſenſes in the ſame continued diſcourſe, as in his introduction and paraphraſe he makes it to do, to ſupport his tenet; and this tenet is directly ſubverſive of the apoſtle's doctrine "of juſtification by faith," with all his arguments and illuſtrations in ſupport of it; and in fact infers the very concluſion and doctrine which Paul rejects with the utmoſt abhorrence, "with a God forbid." In a word, the ſcope of the apoſtle in the foregoing part of this epiſtle, his reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in ſupport of, and inferences from his doctrine of juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by faith, in connexion with his grand deſign in the whole, all naturally and neceſſarily lead us to a conſtruction eſſentially different, and ſubverſive of this author's conſtruction and doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine. If theſe things are true, it is impoſſible the apoſtle could preach the doctrine we oppoſe. Here (1.) the ſuppoſition that Paul taught this doctrine, involves the groſſeſt abſurdities in it. Paul could not teach the finally wicked ſhould "reign in life forever," without tranſgreſſing the bounds of his ſacred com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and directly contradicting his inſtructions given in it, in the letter and ſpirit of them: which is groſsly abſurd. His commiſſion we have recorded, Acts 26.17, 18. "delivering thee from the people, and from the gentiles, unto whom now I ſend thee; to open their eyes, and to turn them from dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to light, and from the power of ſatan unto God, that they may receive the forgiveneſs of ſins, &amp; inheritance among them which are ſanctified by faith that is in me." Chriſt's inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in this commiſſion plainly warrant and limit him, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and inſure the forgiveneſs of ſins and the inheritance of heaven to them, and them only, that are ſanctified in this world, by faith in Chriſt. He could not therefore teach that juſtification of life is come upon all the unbelieving and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified,
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:019737_0165_0FACA40C7759A998"/>
and they ſhall reign in life forever, without directly contradicting the letter and ſpirit of his inſtructions, in this ſacred commiſſion: which no believer can admit. And the commiſſion to the other apoſtles carries preciſely the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions and limitation in it. They were commiſſioned to go forth into all the world, and "preach the goſpel to every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;" and to inforce the requiſitions of it, by theſe infinitely weighty arguments, "he that believeth ſhall be ſaved, but he that believeth not ſhall be damned," Mar. 16.15, 16. They could not go beyond the commandment of the Lord to alter theſe terms of ſalvation and damnation, to ſettle the ſtates of believers and unbelievers, for eternity. They had no authority to alter the terms of life and death to mankind, ſo deciſively fixed, in their inſtructions: and therefore they could not teach that final unbelievers "ſhould reign in life forever" without contradicting the very language, letter and ſpirit of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, nor without betraying their ſacred truſt, in ſubverting the terms of life and death they were ordered to publiſh to the world: and withal ſubverting the adorable authority, theſe terms were deſigned to ſupport, and by which, they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſionated: and theſe terms are infallibly fixed, as the only way of life for ſinful man. No Chriſtian can admit ſo impious an abſurdity. Again, the object of Paul's miniſtry was, "to open the eyes of men and turn them from darkneſs to light, and the power of ſatan unto God." It is groſsly abſurd to ſuppoſe, he would take the devil's doctrine, to ſubvert his kingdom, to open the eyes of men and turn them from ſatan unto God.— This is the fact in the ſcheme we oppoſe. For, the old ſerpent firſt taught man to diſregard the authority, government and threatnings of God; and to rebel againſt the term of life ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly appointed of God to man, in this ſtate, with a promiſe "ye ſhall not die, but be as gods," i. e. immortally happy. This is the grand ſnare of rebellion againſt God, and of ruin to mankind. This author is more explicit, the juſtification of life is ſo come upon all men, including all that live and die in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt the goſpel terms of life, that they ſhall reign in life forever. Paul could not attempt to open the eyes of the idolatrous gentiles, by teaching, if they lived and died in their idolatry, ſuperſtition and wickedneſs, yet they would finally
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:019737_0166_0FACA40D2FF417B0"/>
reign in life forever; for it would infallibly cloſe their eyes, and harden their hearts in infidelity, idolatry and wickedneſs: he could not teach thoſe who live in rebellion to the goſpel terms of life, and die enemies to the croſs of Chriſt, that they ſhould reign in life, for he taught them oft moſt affectionately, with tears and weeping, "their end was deſtruction," Phil. 3.18, 19. Again, we know Paul executed his commiſſion by teaching a doctrine as contrary to this, as light is to darkneſs; "he was not diſobedient to the heavenly viſion," but taught Jews and Gentiles to repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance," to obtain forgiveneſs &amp; the heavenly inheritance, as v. 19, 20. And he called the elders of Epheſus to record, "that he was pure from the blood of all men," and "had not ſhunned to declare the whole counſel of God" nor kept back any thing which was profitable to them. How? by teſtifying (not that all men ſhould be ſaved, but) to Jews and Gentiles "repentance towards God, and faith in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt," as neceſſary terms whereby they could be ſaved, Acts 20. 17th to the 28th verſe: he could not therefore abſurdly teach, this contrary doctrine. Moreover, the grand deſign of Paul's mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, was to reconcile ſinful men to God, in this world: to reduce them to a willing ſubjection and obedience to the divine authority, goſpel, law and government, by faith in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and repentance towards God. As is evident from 2 Cor. 5.18, 19, 20. compared with the 20th chapter of Acts forecited. It was to carry into execution the grand intention of the death of Chriſt "to redeem men from all iniquity and purify to himſelf a peculiar people zealous of good works" in this life, and of the ſaving grace of God, given in purſuance of it, and to effect it; and bring them "to deny all ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, and to live ſoberly, rignteouſly and godly in this preſent world," as he himſelf teacheth it, Tit. 2.11. to the end. And for this important end, we know he ſpent a moſt active life, and all his labours. Therefore we know that Paul could not teach, that all the wicked that live and die enemies to God and the croſs of Chriſt, "ſhould reign in eternal life," becauſe, in this he would preach rebellion againſt the deſign of his miniſtry, the intention of the death of Chriſt, and of the ſaving grace of God, as revealed to men, as he himſelf hath
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:019737_0167_0FACA40DEB0CEB78"/>
declared it. It is teaching rebellion in the conſtruction of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe, and of ſcripture, in the ſenſe in which Hananiah taught it. Hananiah did not in direct terms teach Iſrael to go on and be wicked, no more than the univerſaliſts: but againſt all the ſolemn meſſages of inſtruction, warning, threatning and exhortations to repentance addreſſed to them, by the prophet Jeremiah, Hananiah taught them they ſhould have peace and deliverance: and for this contraſted inſtruction, he is charged by Jehovah with teaching rebellion againſt the Lord; and has the ſentence and execution of an untimely death; ſee Jeremiah 28th chap. To impute ſuch a doctrine of rebellion to Paul, is a baſe reflection upon the apoſtle, and the ſpirit of inſpiration. Whatever be the meaning of theſe diſputed texts, the doctrine we oppoſe cannot be taught in them; becauſe we ſee it involves the groſſeſt abſurdities, and is deſtruction to the character of the apoſtle. He could not ſo palpably contradict the inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in his divine commiſſion, nor take the old ſerpent's doctrine to deſtroy the devil's kingdom, and turn ſinner's to God and holineſs, when it can only ſerve to blind and harden them to deſtruction; nor, teach rebellion againſt the declared deſign of his miniſtry, of the death of Chriſt, and for which the ſaving grace of God is revealed to men. It is impoſſible. And that he never taught this doctrine is further evident, (2dly) "be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is contradicted by the current doctrine of ſcripture, and repeatedly refuted by Paul himſelf." What have the finally wicked to do with peace, and an eternal reign in life; when the God of truth hath repeatedly declared, in abſolute terms "there is no peace to the wicked?" yea, after the ſtrongeſt and moſt extenſive proclamation of peace to mankind: "I create the fruit of the lips peace; peace, peace to him that is far off, and to him that is near, ſaith the Lord," i. e. to thoſe who imbrace the terms of peace: it cloſes to them who rebel againſt them, "there is no peace ſaith my God to the wicked," Iſa. 56.19, 21. Paul could not encourage ſuch a preſumption of peace to the wicked, when he knew that "all the curſes of the book of God" were levelled againſt it, to extirpate it out of the hearts of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; as hath been ſhewn from Deut. 29.19, and onwards. He could not encourage ſuch an hope, when he knew it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly written, "the hope of the wicked and hypocrite ſhall
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:019737_0168_0FACA40EAACE6F60"/>
abſolutely periſh, at death." Beſides, our Saviour teacheth us, thoſe in future torment cannot paſs from thence, to the ſociety of the bleſſed: "that the door ſhall be ſhut to the finally wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:" "that they ſhall never taſte of his ſupper," "ſhall never ſee life," "but the wrath of God abideth on them." Could Paul open heaven's gates to theſe wicked ones, and teach that they ſhould reign in life, when ſo abſolutely excluded from it, in repeated, moſt peremptory terms, by the Lord himſelf? No, Paul is as peremptory in teaching the ſame doctrine, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
<q>they ſhall not inherit the kingdom of God: that they have not any inheritance in the kingdom of Chriſt, and of God</q>
the Father, Eph. 5.5. How abſolute their excluſion? they have not any inheritance in it by gift, grant, by preſent title, or in reverſion. In his epiſtles to the Corinthians and to the Hebrews, Paul introduces the unbelieving Jews, who were excluded God's reſt in Canaan, as examples of inſtruction, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition and warning that final unbelievers ſhould never enter the heavenly reſt with the people of God. And he aſſerts of the wicked in peremptory terms "that Chriſt's death ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit them nothing." How then, is it poſſible that they ſhould reign in life, by it? Are theſe the true ſayings of God? Are they ſealed with his truth and immutability? Surely, they muſt be an everlaſting bar to the finally wicked's reigning in eternal life. And the whole goſpel conſtitution ſpeaks the ſame lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and witneſſeth the ſame truth, as hath been ſhewn. It is then, incredible, yea, impoſſible, that the apoſtle ſhould teach the contrary doctrine, and of ſet purpoſe too, as this author makes him to do. This may appear more evident, when it is ſhewn,</p>
                  <p n="3">(3dly) "The word" juſtification "cannot admit of three or four different ſenſes, in the ſame continued diſcourſe, as in his introduction and paraphraſe, he makes it to do, to ſupport his tenet." It is unreaſonable to ſuppoſe any good author, and eſpecially one ſo accurate as Paul, ſhould uſe ſo important a word as "juſtification" in ſo many different ſenſes, in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of twenty verſes in connexion. Nothing but the moſt ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent neceſſity from the force of connexion, or notice, given by himſelf, can warrant ſuch variety of conſtruction; which in this place, there is not the leaſt occaſion for. In the firſt verſe
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:019737_0169_0FACA40F6E1E6D50"/>
of this context "therefore being juſtified by faith" this author underſtands "the juſtification of life, as appropriated to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers;" including their exemption from the wrath to come, and inſtatement in eternal life, in the great day, as p. 37 and 90. in this, he is undoubtedly right. And I would remark, this is the only ſenſe, in which "juſtification of life" is uſed in the new teſtament. The Dr. is full and explicit in this ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He ſays, "the plain truth is, "the juſtification of life" tho' the gift of God's grace, and his gift through the obedience of Chriſt unto death, is no where in the ſacred writings, ſaid to be beſtowed upon ſinners, in common: neither are the ſinners, upon whom it is beſtowed, pointed out by their names; but by this grand characteriſtic "faith in Chriſt."<note n="*" place="bottom">Sermons, p. 158.</note> In direct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to the Dr. this author makes "the juſtification of life," v. 18. to come upon ſinners in common, upon all men univerſally, ſo "that they ſhall reign in life for ever." The Dr. without doubt is right, and this author palpably wrong, The Dr. ſays, p. 165. "that no ſinner ſhall ever enjoy the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of Chriſt's finiſhed work, who is not a believer in him, is a goſpel truth: and it is as ſimple and plain a truth, as that Chriſt finiſhed his work by dying on the croſs." I wiſh the univerſaliſts to attend "to this plain and important truth," it might effect their conviction: it is fatal to their ſcheme. They muſt be believers or never reign in life: and they muſt be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in this world, or never. Sinners in hell, can never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come believers in the ſenſe of the goſpel conſtitution. Nor doth this author ever once, in his whole treatiſe, pretend they will be believers there: Conſequently, "this plain, ſimple, goſpel truth" ſhews "they can never be ſaved." In the laſt verſe of the foregoing chapter, ſpeaking of Chriſt, Paul ſays, "who was delivered for our offences, and was raiſed again for our juſtification." By "our juſtification," meaning," thoſe who believe, whether jew or gentile." His preceeding ſubject leads to this conſtruction, only: for he is treating not of the juſtification of ſinners in common, but by faith only: and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly as it is oppoſed to juſtification, by law and works. Again, the immediate connexion leads to this conſtruction, he infers from the example of Abraham, whoſe faith was imputed
<pb n="151"
                         facs="unknown:019737_0170_0FACA4102CBDB088"
                         rendition="simple:additions"/>
for righteouſneſs, ſo will our's alſo, jew or gentile, "if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on him that raiſed up Jeſus or Lord from the dead; who was delivered for our offences, and was raiſed again for our juſtification:" the juſtification of whom, can he mean, but thoſe who believe as Abraham did, and not unbelievers? Again, the connexion with what follows, indicates this conſtruction. For he immediately draws his concluſion, and points out the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing bleſſings and privileges connected with, and flowing from, "the juſtification of life" appropriate to believers, as this author allows, "therefore being juſtified by faith we have peace with God," &amp;c. v. 1. of the context and onwards. But this author ſays, "he was raiſed again for our juſtification" includes jews and gentiles, us, the whole world; and means our being brought back to a capacity of being juſtified, and put into the goſpel method of juſtification, by faith, p. 34. the whole world who are become guilty before God, as ch. 3.19, 20, 21. "theſe all now (he ſays) under the goſpel ſtand juſtified in fact by the blood of Chriſt" in the ſenſe above explained, p. 37. To this I object, it cannot be true of that part of the whole world, who have died in their ſins. They are not in fact, in a capacity of being juſtified, by faith: nor are the great bleſſings of juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of life, poſſible to them: they will not be ſaved from wrath in the day of wrath, nor then be inſtated in eternal life. This he allows, is appropriate to believers. Again, if this doctrine be true, what can we make of our Lord's words, "he that believeth not is condemned already, and the wrath of God abideth on him? or, what can we make of it as to the damned, when our Lord's ſentence is paſſed and executed upon them? they belong to the whole world of mankind, and do they in fact ſtand juſtified, by the blood of Chriſt? either this doctrine directly contradicts that of our Saviour, or the terms juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, condemnation, and damnation are utterly confounded. Further, juſtification is a law term, and the juſtified muſt ſtand approved as righteous, by ſome law or other. Upon which, I aſk, by what law or rule of judgment do the unbelieving and ungodly ſtand juſtified before God? not, by the covenant of innocency, for in this author's opinion, the poſterity of Adam had no concern in it. Not, by the law of nature, for the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle expreſsly excludes juſtification by the law and by works.
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:019737_0171_0FACA410FA7C6598"/>
Not, by the goſpel conſtitution, for none can be juſtified ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this, but believers. There is therefore, no law or rule, by which juſtification can be predicated of the unbelieving and ungodly. I would add, "a capacity of being juſtified, is not juſtification: and a man's being put in the way to be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, cannot denominate him, juſtified: no more than a man's being in a capacity to be rich can denominate him rich; when he is in fact, wretched poor: nor any more, than a man's being under means and advantages to be a good man, can denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate him good; when in truth and fact, he is very wicked. It is not common ſenſe, but a manifeſt abuſe of language.</p>
                  <p>This author introduces verſe 9th of the context, "much more then being now juſtified by his blood, we ſhall be ſaved from wrath through him," as another inſtance, where juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation muſt be underſtood in his lax ſenſe, "of a capacity of juſtification and being put in the goſpel way of being juſtified by faith." But why? when the apoſtle is ex profeſſo, drawing his inferences and concluſions from the juſtification appropriate to believers, verſe firſt—it is moſt natural to underſtand it, in the ſame ſenſe v. 9. this author ſays no, and blames Dr. Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dridge for this conſtruction; for two reaſons: firſt, becauſe the apoſtle celebrates the love of God, from the character of the perſons for whom he ſent his Son to die, "while ungodly and ſinners he died for them." This doth not prove, but faith is the medium of our juſtification, and that we cannot be juſtified without it." For the apoſtle plainly teacheth us, "this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation of Chriſt is effectual to our juſtification through faith in his blood," Rom. 3.24, 25, 26. So taught the apoſtle, and ſo teacheth the Dr. ſpeaking of juſtification "as the gift of God, the gift by grace,"&amp;c. he ſays, "we were indeed, in the eye of God, without ſtrength, enemies, ungodly, ſinners, when he purpoſed and contrived the goſpel method of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion."<note n="*" place="bottom">Serm. p 149.</note> And yet in a perfect conſiſtence herewith, he every where, in his ſermons and notes maintains, that faith is the medium of our intereſt in Chriſt, and the mean whereby we are juſtified. And aſſerts "that no ſinner can have the benefit of Chriſt's finiſhed work, who is not a believer:" and that no man can be juſtified, while he is an unbeliever."<note n="†" place="bottom">Ib. p. 165.</note> If the Dr. is right, the apoſtle in this text, is ſpeaking of believers only, and
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:019737_0172_0FACA411ABCA9240"/>
not of ſinners in common, as "juſtified by his blood." But his ſecond reaſon, he ſays, "is deciſive," becauſe if we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand him in this ſenſe, we ſhall abſolutely deſtroy the force of the argument, he uſes; for as ſalvation from wrath is one thing eſſentially included in that juſtification, which is the reſult of true faith, it would be ridiculous to argue, much more being juſtified meaning hereby this juſtification, we ſhall be ſaved from wrath: and adds, the word now is emphatical, p. 37. His deciſive reaſon, is with me no reaſon, and what he calls ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, has not the leaſt impropriety, in it. Surely, when the apoſtle had eſtabliſhed his doctrine of juſtification by faith, and proceeds by way of inference, to point out the great benefits of it; there is not the leaſt impropriety in illuſtrating the contents of the doctrine, itſelf. But it was highly important, that he ſhould teach it plainly to the world, for who ſhould teach it but the apoſtles? and it is his ſpecial deſign to do it, in the two great branches of it, v. 9 and 10. And in this view, his concluſion is drawn with the greateſt propriety and force, as appear thus, Since God hath taken ſuch an extraordinary mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure as to give his Son to die for us while ſinners and enemies, and hath beſtowed the grace of faith on us, and brought us into a ſtate of juſtification of life, wherein we are intitled to reign in eternal life: "much more now (emphatical) being juſtified by his blood" "ſhall we be ſaved from the wrath to come," which is an eſſential benefit of this juſtification. And by the ſame mode of arguing he proceeds in the 10th verſe to infer, the other moſt important privilege, contained in this juſtification. "For if when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God, by the death of his Son, (through faith, as v. 1.) much more being reconciled, ſhall we be ſaved by his life:" ſaved with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat ſalvation, by being inſtated immediately in eternal life, in the great day. This is arguing with great clearneſs and cogency. And this conſtruction is far the moſt inſtructive and edifying, and beſt fitted to impreſs every heart with the vaſt importance of becoming believers; becauſe the privileges and bleſſings of this juſtification are ſo infinitely important, on the one hand and on the other: and it is the only ſenſe it will bear.</p>
                  <p>This author ſays, juſtification in the 9th, and reconciliation in the 10th verſe mean the ſame thing, though ſignified by dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:019737_0173_0FACA4128E0124E0"/>
alluſions, p. 39. Agreed. By reconciliation he means, ſuch a rechange of ſtate in ſinners in common, that they are put into a capacity, whereby, by becoming believers, they may attain eternal life. But this is not a being reconciled to God, nor can they be ſo denominated, on that ground. It is a great impropriety and abuſe of language: as much as it would be, to ſay of all ſinners under the goſpel, becauſe they have the means, and are under a capacity of getting to heaven, that they are actually in heaven; nor is this what Paul means "by being juſtified and reconciled to God:" as is evident (1.) becauſe reconciliation to God, is eſſentially connected with juſtification of life. And it is the very firſt great bleſſing the apoſtle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes, as appropriate to believers, v. 1. "Therefore being juſtified by faith, we have peace (reconciliation and friendſhip) with God, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt." And this peace with God is every where appropriated to believers; and is ſaid to paſs all underſtanding; for the importance, bleſſings and comforts of it. And why this author did not bring it to view, I know not, unleſs he found it difficult to reconcile it with his intended conſtruction of verſe 10th; and apprehended the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning reader would ſee its manifeſt inconſiſtency with it. (2dly) becauſe the word reconciliation never means a rechange of ſtate ſimply, and no more. I have conſulted all his texts, and find not one that will anſwer his purpoſe; that which ſeems moſt to favour it, is 1 Cor. 7.11. "But and if ſhe depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her huſband." He paraphraſes "reconciled" let her be rechanged, return back to her former ſtate of living with him. But common ſenſe teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that more is implied and muſt be ſuppoſed in this caſe, than is contained in his paraphraſe. For what loving huſband or wife ever parted and ſeparated from one another, without ſome difference and alienation of affections? in the nature of the thing, it is an unſuppoſible caſe. The removal or healing of the difference, and conciliating of the affections, muſt then, from the nature of the thing be preſuppoſed, and be in fact comprized, in the reconciliation, whereby their ſtate is rechan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, ſo as to live together. It is needleſs to remark upon his other texts, a diſcerning reader, will eaſily ſee they mean more than ſimply a change of ſtate. But (3dly.) what is deciſive,
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:019737_0174_0FACA414396490E0"/>
is, his conſtruction totally deſtroys the force of the apoſtle's reaſonings, and makes his concluſion an abſolute falſhood, in fact. The apoſtle could not infer from the juſtified, in his ſenſe, "much more ſhall thoſe who are put in a capacity to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come believers, and attain eternal life, be ſaved from wrath;" becauſe, as to all of them, who are final unbelievers, it is a falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, in fact: they muſt ſuffer the wrath to come, the agonies of the ſecond death. Had Paul uſed the prepoſition ex or ek they would have argued, they ſhould be delivered out of a ſtate of wrath; but as it is, apo tes orges, his meaning is deciſively clear: the juſtified he intends ſhall not undergo the future wrath. And the ſame falſe concluſion follows, from his notion of reconciliation in the 10th verſe: for all ungodly ſinners who are now in a capacity of being ſaved by faith, will not be ſaved with a compleat ſalvation in the day of judgment; as is inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in this verſe, in Heb. 9.28. and throughout his writings. And therefore his conſtruction of the words juſtification and reconciliation, muſt be as evidently falſe, as the falſe concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it would faſten upon the apoſtle. Moreover, it is certain from this concluſion, Paul draws, of "the juſtified by the blood of Chriſt," viz, "that they ſhall be ſaved from future wrath" that believers are intended and they only: for this is a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, appropriate to them. And it is certain from this declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that every individual perſon that is juſtified by the blood of Chriſt, ſhall in fact be ſaved from the wrath to come. This is fatal to his conſtruction of verſe 18. The juſtification of life is not come upon all men; for if it was, they would (by this concluſion of the apoſtle) be univerſally ſaved from the wrath to come, Whereas, all the finally ungodly ſhall in fact endure this wrath, and ſuffer the ſecond death; this author being judge. Conſequently, the juſtification of life in this 18th verſe, muſt be the ſame with verſe firſt, and which we have proved to be intended in verſe 9th, and is peculiar to believers: and the all men upon whom it is come, intends all believers, whether jew or gentile, as I truſt will be fully evident, before we quit the ſubject. It will likewiſe follow, that his key of conſtruction, viz. that the all men in both ſides of the compariſon, between Adam and Chriſt, muſt be univerſally the ſame, is a false one,
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:019737_0175_0FACA414A8D11CA8"/>

                  <p>The apoſtle having inferred to the juſtified by faith, ver. 1. two infinitely important privileges and bleſſings which await believers, in the great day—deliverance from wrath—and a compleatly glorious ſalvation, ver. 9th and 10th, proceeds ver. 11th to another great and diſtinguiſhing bleſſing they have in the interim, the preſent time: "And not only ſo, but we alſo joy in God (as our covenant God And Father) through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom we have now (by faith, as ver. 1ſt.) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the atonement or reconciliation." This makes the word "now" emphatical, the coherence and connexion, clear and ſtrong, the ſenſe exhibited important, and the whole adapted to anſwer his deſign, to recommend the doctrine of juſtification, as worthy of all acceptation through the world; on account of the peculiar privileges, bleſſings and glories contained in it, and flowing from it, to believers. But this author underſtands re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation in verſe 11th the ſame as in the foregoing verſe, a change of ſtate common to believers and ſinners, through the world. To me it appears abſurd, that after the apoſtle had ſo ſtrongly and of ſet purpoſe deſcribed the peculiar happineſs and bleſſings of believers, he ſhould conclude in ſuch a flat man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, "that they had received, but what is common to them and an ungodly world. It is incredible. Eſpecially, as we have ſhewn the word "reconciled" in the foregoing verſe, will not bear his conſtruction; and alſo, that peace, reconciliation and friendſhip with God, is the very firſt appropriate bleſſing to believers, deſcribed verſe firſt. This author, having thus fixed his wrong ſenſe upon the words "juſtification and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation," and hereby got his own mind and the mind of his reader upon the wheel of an ambiguous change of words, by annexing theſe wrong ideas to them—is prepared to apply his damage by Adam and advantage by Chriſt, to the ſame all men, univerſally: and to fix a ſenſe to the word juſtification of life, verſe 18, not only different from both the ſenſes, in which he had already uſed it; but far remote, from what it is ever uſed, in the whole book of God. I will give the reader the words of the apoſtle, and his paraphraſe, in two columns.</p>

                  <p>It is obvious, at firſt view, that in his conſtruction, this juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication means, a reſurrection to a happy immortality. But ſurely, juſtification and a reſurrection are different things, as different as a pſalm book and a teſtament, or any two things that can be named. And it is falſe in fact, to aver, that a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection "to reign in life for ever," is come upon all men: for certainly, the reſurrection of the wicked, will be to damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, It is alſo evident, "that juſtification of life," bears no ſuch ſenſe, any where elſe, in the book of God. Nor doth he pretend to adduce any parallel text, to juſtify this conſtruction. The ſubſtance of his reaſon for it is, that the oppoſition in the compariſon, upon his ſcheme, requires it. But, if ſuch a liberty may be taken, to put an uninſpired ſenſe upon a text, which is no where found in ſcripture, to accommodate it to a man's ſcheme, there is no ſecurity in revelation: nor is there any ſcheme of error in the world, but in this way may be fathered upon the oracles of God. In paraphraſing that clauſe of verſe 16. "but the free gift is of many offences, to juſtification," he gives another and more ſtrange ſenſe of the word: He ſays, it is a "juſtification including in it their deliverance from ſin as well as death," p. 26. that is, it includes both ſanctification and the reſurrection: which is not only entirely remote from the ſenſe in which Paul always uſes the word, and from which it is ever uſed in ſcripture; but it tends totally to confound ſcripture language, and the diſtinct, different doctrines taught in it. In his application of his paraphraſe and notes, he gives us this reſult, p. 80. "the plain truth is, that final, everlaſting ſalvation is abſolutely the free gift of God to all men, through
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:019737_0177_0FACA416273C2C98"/>
Jeſus Chriſt," and ſo on as before noted. Upon which I would remark, if this gift or grant of God be made to all men, and the apoſtle has ſo taught, it muſt be at leaſt, principally collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from verſe 18. where he ſays "the free gift came upon all men, unto juſtification of life:" for it is the only text, which exppreſſes all men, the reſt are ſuppoſed, by implication. Let us traverſe this text, and ſee if this doctrine be taught in it.— It is obvious, that this complex <hi>all men,</hi> includes two manner of people, in this world and world to come, whoſe ſtates are far more different than was that of Eſau and Jacob and their poſterity, as nations, in this world. For this complex all men, are ſome in heaven, ſome in hell, and others on earth; in whoſe caſes, reſpecting juſtification of life, there is a moſt eſſential difference: conſequently, this juſtification, as predicated of the whole, muſt carry in it two as extremely wide and different ſenſes, as there is in the ſtate of this complex all men, on whom it is ſaid to come. Is this poſſible? It is incredible, that Paul ſhould uſe it, in ſo many different ſenſes, as already noted in the compaſs of twenty verſes. But that one and the ſame phraſe reſpecting the ſame ſubject, at the ſame time, ſhould carry in it two ſenſes ſo extremely different, as this juſtification applied to all men muſt do; ſurely "exceeds all belief," and is enough to ſtun an infidel. Again, to ſay "the juſtification of life," one of the moſt important privileges of the goſpel and kingdom of God, is come upon all thoſe who now are, and ever will be caſt out of this kingdom, and all its bleſſings, and be conſigned to the damnation of hell, is ſuch an outrage upon common ſenſe that a ſavage might bluſh to be guilty of. Moreover, if this gift and grant be made to all men, then, the privileges and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of it, muſt be eſſentially the ſame to this complex <hi>all men,</hi> otherwiſe this author's key is blown, "the plaiſter is not as big as the ſore" as he expreſſes it. Try this gift and grant by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe, and ſee the reſult. Common ſenſe teacheth, that every gift or grant "whether of power or privilege," muſt convey eſſentially the ſame power or privilege, to all the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of it. E. g. thus, the commiſſion to the miniſtry, granted to the apoſtles, conveyed the ſame and equal powers to all, whom Chriſt commiſſionated, by it. And the great charter of adoption, granted by our Lord to believers, John 1.12. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:019737_0178_0FACA416EC79A690"/>
eſſentially the ſame privileges, to all the ſubjects of it. "To as many as received him, to them gave he power to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the ſons of God, even to them that believe on his name." And thus it muſt be with the important gift and grant "of juſtification of life." The eſſential privileges and bleſſings of it, muſt appertain, to all the happy ſubjects of it. Is it true, that the ſame eſſential privileges and bleſſings of juſtification, appertain to this complex all men, in this world and world to come, on whom it is ſaid to come? trace the fact. To the one, the believing part of this all men, the juſtification of life brings with it "peace with God," "acceſs by faith into his grace wherein they ſtand," "rejoicing in hope of the glory of God," "glorying in tribulations for the ſanctified improvement and benefits of them," "a hope that maketh not aſhamed," "ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the love of God ſhed abroad in the heart," and "joy in God as their covenant God and Father" in this world, as the bleſſings are annumerated v. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 11th of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, together with their being approved as righteous, delivered from the wrath to come, and immediately inſtated in eternal life, in the great judgment day, as v. 9 &amp; 10th. To the other, the whole unbelieving part of this complex all men, this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed gift and grant conveys not one of theſe peculiar annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated bleſſings in this life, nor at the day of judgment. But the Saviour and Judge tells us, "they are condemned already, and the wrath of God abideth on them." And that in the great day "they ſhall go away into everlaſting puniſhment." And this author ſays, in that day, they will be condemned to an age of awful, unutterable puniſhment, and will literally die, the ſecond death. But ſomehow, and at ſome time or another, they will be quickened from that death, and if ſtill ſtubborn, will be tranſmuted into a different ſtate or ſtates, and be tormented in a different diſpenſation or diſpenſations for ages of ages, till they are humbled and purified, nobody knows how—where— or when—but when fitted for it, they ſhall reign in eternal life. Here we have traced the fact as this author would have it.— Let the reader judge, does this gift and grant as applied to this great complex body, convey the ſame eſſential privileges and bleſſings to all the individual ſubjects of theſe all men, on whom it is ſaid to come? by no means: their ſtates are as different
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:019737_0179_0FACA417A6B3AB48"/>
as heaven and hell. Did the apoſtle mean to contain all this variety and contradiction, in this important phraſe? Could he mean that this free gift's coming upon men, ſhould have ſuch a conſtruction, contradictory to all the gifts and grants of power or privilege ever given or granted by God or man, thro' the whole world? it is impoſſible. Therefore, the all men on whom it is come, muſt mean believers only: on theſe only, can it be predicated, and to theſe only doth it agree.</p>
                  <p>I will add once more, "juſtification of life" cannot be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to all the unbelieving and ungodly, becauſe it is a repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant contradiction, to the nature, import and deſign of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant privilege. "Juſtification" can no more mean the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, or the reſurrection and ſanctification, than it can mean election and adoption: ſuch an application being alike, entirely alien, from the nature and deſign of it. But what I would particularly note is, the apoſtle could not per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>haps have choſen a word, more abſolutely excluſive of the conſtruction and doctrine we oppoſe, than "juſtification:" for the whole of this glorious privilege, conſiſts in the bleſſings appropriate to believers in this life, and beſtowed in the day of judgment: in their being approved, ſaved from wrath, and inſtated in eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, in that day. The doctrine and ſubject is then exhauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: for the whole privilege and final bleſſings of it, are then all beſtowed of God, and compleatly enjoyed by all the juſtified, the whole believing world, in that day. The doctrine is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly illuſtrated, fulfilled and finiſhed. It is ended, ſucceeded, and if I may ſo expreſs it, ſwallowed up, in another more illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious privilege, eſſentially connected with it, viz. their glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; as in that golden chain, Rom. 8.30. "and whom he juſtified, them he alſo glorified." Now ſince the whole bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of juſtification are then beſtowed, and the whole deſign of it, then compleated; it is impoſſible in the nature of the thing, that it can be extended to any others, or any more, than to the believing and juſtified, in that day. Juſtification in the goſpel ſenſe, can no more be extended to the unbelieving and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in that day, either then, or afterwards to eternity, than a prophecy that hath been already compleatly fulfilled, can be ſaid to be ſtill in force and yet to be fulfilled. The predication in both caſes, being alike repugnant and abſolutely contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:019737_0180_0FACA41866F3B1E8"/>
to the nature and deſign of the ſubject and doctrine, to which it is applied.</p>
                  <p>We truſt we have made full proof, that the word "juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion" will not bear the different conſtructions he puts upon it, in ſupport of his tenet. It is already ſhewn, that the Dr. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly aſſerts, "the juſtification of life" is no where in the ſacred writings, ſaid to be beſtowed upon ſinners in common; but is appropriate to believers, and repeatedly aſſerts and proves, "that no one can be juſtified, who is not a believer." With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out recurring to all the texts upon the ſubject, by what hath been laſt offered we ſee the ſure and evident ground upon which it ſtands, viz. "it is a contradiction to the nature, import and deſign of the great doctrine of "juſtification" to apply it to the unbelieving and ungodly "who are condemned already" and will be condemned in the day of judgment. And from what hath been proved it clearly and certainly follows, that the <hi>all men</hi> on whom juſtification of life is come, are believers, only— that his key, in applying it to all unbelievers, is a falſe one; and that his doctrine of the ſalvation of all men is not ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on, but is in fact confuted, by this text, in its connexion with the context.</p>
                  <p>To proceed, (4thly.) the tenet we oppoſe, is directly ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of the apoſtle's doctrine of juſtification by faith, with all his arguments and illuſtrations in ſupport of it: and in fact in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers the very concluſion and doctrine which Paul rejects with the utmoſt abhorrence, with a "God forbid." It is already ſhewn, the great doctrine of juſtification by faith, will terminate in the tranſactions of the day of judgment. The final bleſſings of it will then be beſtowed, and the deſign of it be compleatly anſwered and terminate in it. Now, to ſay that the condemned in that day, will yet be ſaved in ſome after diſpenſations, is entirely to ſet aſide this whole doctrine as unneceſſary to the ſalvation of men; as uſeleſs, and no inſtrument or medium of ſalvation in fact, to a great part of them, who ſhall be ſaved. Surely, Paul could not thus ſubvert and aboliſh his divine doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of juſtification, by faith. He labours with many argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to exhibit this doctrine, the only way of life for ſinful man; and illuſtrates it in the example of Abraham in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding chapters. Can it be ſuppoſed, when he is making his
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:019737_0181_0FACA4192A3CC650"/>
inferences from this very doctrine, to illuſtrate the importance and glory of it, and comes to this paragraph in diſpute, that he ſhould go intirely off from his main ſubject, and ſet up an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite doctrine, in contradiction to it, viz. that all the unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ungodly world ſhould be ſaved, without this juſtification, and in a way ſubverſive of it? Is it ſuppoſible, that he ſhould introduce this tenet, and another diſpenſation for the ſalvation of all the finally wicked, and thereby ſet aſide not only this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of juſtification by faith, but the whole ſcheme of goſpel doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine connected with it; as regeneration, faith, repentance, goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel holineſs, goſpel precepts, inſtitutions, promiſes, means, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and privileges; in a word, that he ſhould ſet aſide the whole oeconomy of the diſpenſation of the kingdom of God in this world, as unneceſſary to their ſalvation? No friend to revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who well conſiders it, can poſſibly admit it; for ſuch an amazing contradiction of doctrine, in a continued diſcourſe, carries the higheſt reflection upon the character of the apoſtle as a writer, and upon the doctrine of inſpiration itſelf. Again, the very ſame abſurdity attends this tenet, as juſtification by the law, upon which Paul rejects it, viz. it makes "faith void," &amp; the promiſe made to faith, and to believers "of none effect:" "for if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promiſe made of no effect," Rom. 4.14. This argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is full as ſtrong againſt this ſtrange tenet: for if final, condemned unbelievers (who neither have, nor ever can have faith) are heirs, and ſhall be ſaved, it is glaringly evident "that faith is made void and the promiſe of none effect." The apoſtle argues this cannot be, v. 16. "therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace, to the end the promiſe might be ſure to all the ſeed, not to that only which is of the law, but to that alſo which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all." Final unbelievers can never be the ſeed here meant, nor can Abraham ever be the father of the finally condemned, in the ſenſe intended, in this text. It is further to be noted, the very concluſion Paul reprobates, with utmoſt abhorrence, with a "God forbid" certainly attends this ſtrange doctrine, viz. "it makes void the law." "Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid; yea we eſtabliſh the law," Rom. 3.31. The goſpel doctrine of juſtification and ſalvation by faith, doth
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:019737_0182_0FACA419E8A41D20"/>
moſt ſurely and ſtrongly eſtabliſh the moral law of God, in its variety of uſes, and as of indiſpenſibly binding obligation upon all men, believers and others, in this world. It is eſtabliſhed upon many unchangable grounds, as that of the moral excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and perfection of it, being "holy, juſt and good." Again, as it is the deſign of the Father, in opening this way of life to ſinful men, to ſet up and eſtabliſh his authority, law and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment over them; by opening a door whereby he may be juſt and the juſtifier of every one who believes in Chriſt, and becomes cordially obedient unto him: and as it is the deſign of the Son of God, in the redemption and ſalvation of ſinful men, to eſtabliſh it upon the moſt ſure and unchangeable foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations; partly, by magnifying the law, and making it honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, in that righteouſneſs whereby all the believing world are juſtified, and partly, by his Spirit and grace actually reducing all whom he ſaves, to become a willing people, cordially obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to the authority, law and goſpel of God in this world. Furthermore, Chriſt hath a new eſtabliſhed the binding obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of this divine law, upon all men by his own authority: announcing to the world "not a jot or tittle of the law ſhall fail;" and that he who teacheth and exemplifieth this law, ſhall be great in the kingdom of heaven; but he who doth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſhall be leaſt, (i. e.) ſhall have no part in it, Mat. 5.18, 19. Paul teacheth we are under law to Chriſt. But what is of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial note is, the very faith whereby we are juſtified and ſaved, teaches and influences "to a cordial ſubjection &amp; obedience to the authority, law and goſpel of God. It works by love, puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the heart, and ſanctifies the life: and by this eſſential pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, it is diſtinguiſhed from the faith which will not ſave; as taught by St. Paul, James and John. So that this very faith eſtabliſhes and exalts the law of the Lord our God. In a word, this divine law is the indiſpenſible rule of our duty and meaſure of our happineſs; and without a genuine conformity to it "in goſpel holineſs, no man ſhall ſee the Lord." It is very evident, that in theſe and other ways which need not be mentioned, the goſpel doctrine of juſtification and ſalvation by faith, doth moſt ſtrongly eſtabliſh the divine law as indiſpenſibly binding upon all men in this world, and a cordial ſubjection and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diential regard to it in this life, as abſolutely neceſſary to the
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:019737_0183_0FACA41AA5D04858"/>
ſalvation of men. "Bleſſed are the pure in heart, for they ſhall ſee God;" but "except a man be born again," "be born of the Spirit" and be made ſpiritual, "he cannot ſee the kingdom of God," are the doctrines of Chriſt, eſtabliſhing this truth. But the doctrine of the ſalvation of all the final unbelieving and diſobedient, teaches rebellion and defiance to the law eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doctrine of faith, and to the law of God, itſelf: it teaches that men may live and die rebels to all the laws of God and man in this world, and yet there is not force enough in all the threatnings and curſes in the book of God, to bar and finally exclude them, a reign in eternal life. Is not this to make void the law of God, in the precepts and penalties of it? What doth Paul mean by making void the law, but making it ſo uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, as that an obediential regard to it in this life, is unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the ſalvation of men? and doth not the doctrine we oppoſe, in this very ſenſe make the law abſolutely void? and the very doctrine of faith he was eſtabliſhing, likewiſe void? it is an horribly uſurping doctrine: it uſurps an authority above all that is called God, in heaven and earth: for it uſurps a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing power over all the authority and laws of God and of mankind: it ſo diſpenſes all the obligations of mankind to God and to one another, that in violation of the whole, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes the rebellious ſinner "a final reign in eternal life." What can be a more glaring abſurdity in itſelf, or more flagrant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to the whole tenor of revelation? to impute it to the grace of God, is a high diſhonour to his wiſdom and grace; becauſe it is exhibiting his grace as oppoſing and ſubverting the authority, law and government of God, in this world. To impute it to the mediation and blood of Chriſt, is to make him inſtead of the great ſupporter, in reality the ſubverter of his Father's authority and government in this world; and alſo the ſubverter of his own authority and government, What diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honours can be greater to the grace of God and to the Soviour of the world, than ſuch impious imputations? and can ſuch a doctrine be attributed to Saint Paul? No, he reprobates it, with greateſt indignation, with a "God forbid:" and let all good men join him in it, and ſay amen, to it. As a concluding evidence that Paul never taught this doctrine and particularly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n this paragraph, we proceed to ſhew (5thly.) the ſcope of the
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:019737_0184_0FACA41B6AC93B58"/>
apoſtle in the foregoing part of this epiſtle, his reaſonings in ſupport of, and inferences from his doctrine of juſtification by faith, in connexion with his grand deſign in the whole, viz. to recommend and inforce it, all naturally and neceſſarily lead us to a conſtruction eſſentially different, and ſubverſive of this author's conſtruction and doctrine. I apprehend this author did not recur back far enough to fix the ſcope of the apoſtle and introduce the connexion, truly: had he done it, he might have ſaved himſelf and the world the trouble of his paraphraſe and notes. The grand deſign of the apoſtle is, to ſet forth, eſtabliſh and recommend the doctrine in which he much glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried. It is in the firſt chap. v. 16. "For I am not aſhamed of the goſpel of Chriſt, for it is the power of God unto ſalvation to every one that believeth, to the jew firſt and alſo to the greek." It is ſurely effectual for ſalvation to every believer without diſtinction or exception: and it is excluſively, the only way of life for ſinful man." This ſeems to be the preciſe view and grand intention of the apoſtle, as appears by his arguments, illuſtrations and inferences. The Dr. is full in this ſentiment; affirming, that "faith in the promiſed ſeed (Chriſt) has all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long been, now is, and always will be, the only way of life, for ſinful man." Would the, univerſaliſts heartily ſubſcribe this, the controverſy is ended. For the concluſion is self-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, "if this be the only way of life" no final unbeliever can poſſibly be ſaved. To prove his doctrine and compleatly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer his intention, the apoſtle adduces and ſets forth "the doctrine of juſtification by faith:" this opens a door of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all the living world, upon the ſame terms. Jews and gentiles without diſtinction or exception, upon becoming be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, ſhall be juſtified and ſaved. On the other hand, in the nature of it, it is excluſive of every other way of life: for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful men cannot be ſaved, unleſs they be juſtified: and no one can be juſtified but by faith in Chriſt. His argumentation is as clear as demonſtration, and fully anſwers his intention. The jew can have no objection, for it is the way of ſalvation pointed out in the revelation of God to that people. This is his firſt argument and proof, "for the righteouſneſs of God is revealed (in that revelation) from faith to faith," "as it is written, the juſt ſhall live by faith," verſe 17th. That it is excluſively,
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:019737_0185_0FACA41C2907F7A0"/>
the only way of life, he evinceth by this general argument, viz. that all men, jews and gentiles are under ſin, and the whole world guilty before God, as he proves by particular inductions, from verſe 18 to v. 9th and 19th of the 3d chap. Whence he argues, therefore no man can be juſtified, but in this way of faith in Chriſt, inſtituted of God. They cannot be juſtified by works, by any law; not by the law of innocency, by the law of nature, nor by the revealed law of the jews, without faith: they are all alike ſinners, and ſhut up to the faith of Chriſt as their only hope. He alſo proves it by this, "every other way makes faith void and the promiſe of none effect." Again, that it is a way of ſalvation opened to all the living world, he illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates by the example of Abraham. Furthermore, that it is effectual and inſures ſalvation to every believer without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; he ſhews we have every aſſuring reaſon and inducement to believe. For the moral perfections of God are all harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly diſplayed in this way of juſtification and life; his holineſs and juſtice is honoured in it, "for he can now be juſt and the juſtifier of every one who believes in Jeſus;" his wiſdom and grace are moſt illuſtriouſly diſplayed in it: all boaſting is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from the creature: the higheſt honours redound to the mediation, blood, righteouſneſs and redemption of Chriſt: and this propitiation is ſet forth for this very purpoſe, that the world through faith in it might be ſaved: and the promiſes of God are gloriouſly illuſtrate in it. And the laſt concluding proof of it is the laſt verſe of the fourth chapter. It is the grand intention to be anſwered by the death and reſurrection of Chriſt: "who died for our offences, and was raiſed again for our juſtification:" who believe, "to the jew firſt, and alſo to the gentile." With this he cloſes his proof of the glorious doctrine he ſet out to evince. And immediately proceeds to his inferences, to illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate the importance and glory of it, in an exhibition of the diſtinguiſhing privileges and bleſſings accruing to the juſtified believer. And it is for this double purpoſe, the eſtabliſhment of believers, and to recommend it to the world, as worthy of all acceptation, to induce and engage them to believe and be ſaved. And the peculiar privileges annumerated v. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, and the 11th verſes are appropriate to believers. It is they, verſe the 11th, who joy in God, through our Lord Jeſus

Chriſt, by whom they have now received the atonement: whereby he becomes their covenant God and Father.</p>
                  <p>This introduces the paragraph in diſpute, wherein he is ſtill purſuing the ſame ſubject, in another method of illuſtrating the abounding bleſſings to believers, viz. as they are derived to them from Chriſt their federal head and ſurety; in a manner ſimilar to what ſin and death are conveyed to the natural poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erity of Adam. For this purpoſe he inſtitutes the compariſon between Adam and Chriſt; and ſhews, that by the grace of God, believers receive righteouſneſs and life from Chriſt with ſuper-abounding advantage, in ſeveral very important reſpects, above and beyond the loſs ſuſtained, in the firſt Adam. Now, in this way, the connexion is eaſy, clear and ſtrong. And the grand ſubject he had been evincing with ſo much labour; the tenor of his arguments and illuſtrations; together with the ſpecial deſign of his inferences in the foregoing context; all naturally, yea neceſſarily point out this connexion, and lead us to this conſtruction. It is this conſtruction only, that illuſtrates the goſpel the power of God to ſalvation to every one that believes —that evinces, juſtification by faith the only way of life, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive of all others—that is beſt fitted to eſtabliſh believers in the faith without wavering, againſt the force of perſecution and ſeduction, by temptation or error. It is this alone that recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends this doctrine as worthy of all acceptation, and enforces faith as of the laſt importance to periſhing ſinners—and in a word, that gives every word and ſentence in the two ſides of the compariſon, their natural and full force, as applied to each ſide of it. In this conſtruction, as applied to believers, juſtification and juſtification of life, have their full force, as they are always uſed; and need not be forced to mean, the reſurrection, the reſurrection and ſanctification, and be predicated of the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that are condemned already, and that are condemned in the great day, in a ſenſe that carries in it the groſſeſt abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity and contradiction in terms. And what ſeems ſufficient to decide the caſe is, that believers arc characteriſtically pointed out to be the perſons intended verſe 17. "for if by one man's offence, death reigned by one, much more" they which receive abundance of grace, and the gift of righteouſneſs, "ſhall reign in life by one Jeſus Chriſt." He evidently ſpeaks of what they
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:019737_0187_0FACA41DA583D608"/>
now receive and are the ſubjects of, in this preſent life, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with a reign in life, in the future world. But it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers only, that receive abundance of grace (faith and all the concommitant graces of the divine life) and the gift of righteouſneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereby they are juſtified in this life, as connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with their reign in life, in the world to come: and theſe muſt be intended: for, to ſay of all graceleſs, ungodly men; that live in defiance of all the laws of God and men, that they are recipients of abundance of grace, and the gift of righteouſneſs, every one ſees is a ſtaring falſhood and abſurdity. Beſides, this text is evidently parralel with verſe 11th, where believers are deſcribed as receiving the atonement: and with John 1.12. "But to as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the ſons of God, even to them who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on his name;" where believers are preciſely and charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſtically pointed out. And the ſame verb "to receive" is employed in each of theſe places. And one thing more, which to me confirms this conſtruction beyond doubt, is, that the apoſtle here employs the ſame forcible method of arguing, as in ver. 9th and 10th applied to believers: inaſmuch as they are "now" the happy ſubjects of this abundance of grace, and the gift of righteouſneſs, whereby they are juſtified, he argues a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiori, "much more ſhall they reign in life, by one Jeſus Chriſt." Can this method of arguing apply to graceleſs, wicked men? inaſmuch as they do not receive abundance of grace, nor the gift of righteouſneſs, but do deſpite to the ſpirit of grace, and trample under foot the blood of Chriſt, that "much more they ſhall reign in life?" ſurely it cannot. To which may be added, all the promiſes of the heavenly inheritance and of a future reign in life, are made to the ſubjects and heirs of faith only, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out revelation: and doubtleſs the apoſtle doth intend and doth in fact draw his concluſion upon this well known goſpel foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation: and therefore believers only can be intended. To ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, all final unbelievers and ungodly are here intended as reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pients of this abundance of grace, is againſt the tenor of ſcripture, which deſcribes them veſſels of wrath, &amp;c. as a fact, it is groſsly falſe and a horrible abſurdity: and it is ſuch a ſenſe, as there is no evidence, it ever entered into the mind of the apoſtle or any man, for ſeventeen hundred years after it was wrote; and ſeems

coined only to ſerve a purpoſe. To ſuppoſe, they are ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed as recipients of it, becauſe they will be purified in hell, or in ages of torment after the future judgment; and then will be the recipients of it, and reign in life, as this author doth; is to ſuppoſe a doctrine moſt abſurd and pernicious in itſelf; and when this apoſtle hath not given any hint in his writings of ſuch ages of future diſcipline; and when at the ſame time, it is ſubverſive of the grand doctrine in which he gloried, and hath taken ſo much pains to illuſtrate and enforce: for accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this tenet, it is not the goſpel accompanied with the power of God, that ſaves thoſe who believe, excluſive of any other way of juſtification and life: but it is hell fire— and the tormenting diſcipline of ages, that has this mighty pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to ſave the unbelieving world, the greater part of mankind, according to this writer. This is to make the apoſtle in his inference, to deſtroy the text, he would illuſtrate, with all his arguments and labours to ſupport it: and inſtead of recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and enforcing it, to render it contemptible to the world. Moreover, unleſs believers are here intended, the apoſtle's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, drawn in the next verſe, v. 18, is not true: "There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as by the offence of one, judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even ſo, by the righteouſneſs of one, the free gift came upon all men unto juſtification of life." By "all men" in this laſt clauſe, he means, every one who believes, jew or gentle without diſtinction or exception, preciſely according to his doctrine, expreſſed in the 18th verſe of the firſt chapter, which he had been illuſtrating and recommending to the world. This conſtruction only, preſerves and ſupports a conſiſtency in his doctrine, argumentations, illuſtrations, and inferences in connexion with his grand deſign in the whole, viz. to teach and enforce the goſpel way of juſtification and ſalvation by faith in Chriſt, as of the laſt importance to all men, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend it by the infinite advantage of it to believers, in all points of view, both abſolute and comparative. I am not the leaſt moved, by the remark of this writer upon Dr. Doddrige's conſtruction of verſe 11th and theſe texts in diſpute, as applied to believers. He ſays, p. 32. "It can be no other than a flat contradiction to the expreſſ words of the apoſtle himſelf, to ſay, that in the latter part of this compariſon, not all men are meant,
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:019737_0189_0FACA41F892E1518"/>
but believers only, that is a few of them." For if the <hi>all</hi> in the two ſides of the compariſon, includes the all of mankind in each part, who are deſigned to be compared, though one part be not ſo many as the other, yet there is no contradiction, but the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt propriety in it. He adds, "if any can bring themſelves to embrace a ſenſe of this paſſage, that is attended with ſo groſs an abſurdity, I ſee not but they are prepared to make the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpeak what they pleaſe." Why ſo harſh and haſty a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure? In the two ſides of a compariſon. whether of men or things, there may be more in number of one character and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination, than in the other; and yet the word all, may with the greateſt propriety be applied to deſcribe and comprehend the whole in each character and denomination, in the two ſides compared. Thus if you compare the ſaved and loſt of mankind by their diſtinguiſhing character, and ſay, all men that believe ſhall be ſaved; and all men that believe not ſhall damned; the all men applied to the firſt part, is as properly uſed, though this writer ſays they are few, as in the other part, which he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes to be many more. So in this text the judgment through the offence may come upon all men univerſally, and the juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of life may come upon all believers in Chriſt as univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally; and the term all men may with ſtricteſt propriety be applied to both ſides of the compariſon. For different ſubjects are treated of in the compariſon, Adam and Chriſt, with the influence of their tranſactions in reſpect to mankind. And eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially different things are predicated of the one and the other, condemnation comes to all his natural poſterity by his offence, but juſtification of life comes to all who are Chriſt's, "to all his believing ſeed" as univerſally, through the world. However, as the term all men, in this laſt part, hath induced others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this writer, to a conſtruction of this paragraph, which it will by no means bear, as Dr. Doddridge hath obſerved; I ſhall endeavour to fix the certainty and propriety of this application of the term all men, to believers only, in this ſide of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon. Previous to which, I would obſerve, this author in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts the word "eternal" in the laſt ſentence to the righteous and wicked, ought to have a different conſtruction, becauſe of the difference between the ſubjects of it: for which I ſee no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. But if ſo, ſurely, with far better reaſon, the term all men,
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:019737_0190_0FACA41FE975E440"/>
in the two ſides of a compariſon, where the ſubjects are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent as life and death, condemnation and juſtification of life, may have a different conſtruction, according to the ſubjects treated of. And my reaſons for fixing this conſtruction, are theſe; the connexion and introduction of this paragraph leads to this conſtruction only, as has been ſhewn. The apoſtle had been inferring the bleſſings appropriate to believers, and gives notice he was proceeding to illuſtrate the ſame ſubject, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing it, verſe 12th, with a Wherefore, &amp;c. This author admits it is brought in as a proof or illuſtration of what went before p. 29. Another reaſon is, becauſe, believers are charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſed in the foregoing verſe from which he draws his conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, of juſtification of life "come upon them in this verſe. And this author allows, the words "they which receive the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of grace," plainly intends to ſpecify the perſons on whom it is beſtowed."<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 62.</note> And how? but by a characteriſing of them, as diſtinguiſhed from others, as is done in all other parts of ſcripture? A further reaſon is, becauſe this juſtification of life, is every where elſe appropriate to believers, and therefore ought to be underſtood here in its natural ſignification, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the invariable uſe of it in ſcripture; add to this, we have proved it will bear no other conſtruction: and eſpecially not that given by this writer. We have ſhewn that the application of it to all the unbelieving and ungodly, involves in it the groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt abſurdities and contradictions, it ſubverts the doctrine and reaſonings of the apoſtle in the foregoing chapters; and it infers the doctrine he rejects with a God forbid; neceſſity, therefore obligeth us, as we would vindicate the doctrine of inſpiration and the character of this great apoſtle as a conſiſtent writer, to reject the application of the term "juſtification of life" to all the unbelieving and ungodly. And it is far more rational to admit a different conſtruction of the term "all men" in the two ſides of a compariſon, than to admit ſuch palpable abſurdities and contradictions: more eſpecially, as there is not the leaſt impropriety, in applying ſuch a different conſtruction, to ſuch eſſentially different ſubjects. For it is "an invariable rule, the term <hi>all men,</hi> and all other univerſal terms, muſt have a more extended or limited conſtruction, according to the ſubject to which they relate and are applied." Therefore the ſubject trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:019737_0191_0FACA420B47542A0"/>
of and to which they are applied, muſt firſt be attended to, before we can determine whether they are to be underſtood in a ſtrictly univerſal or limited ſenſe, and how far limited. And it is alſo to be noted, the term all men is often, yea, far oftener uſed in a limited ſenſe in the new teſtament writings, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in St. Paul's, "than in that which is ſtrictly univerſal. Therefore we put no new ſenſe upon it, in this conſtruction, but affix ſuch a limited ſenſe as is common, and muſt be put upon many texts, unleſs we admit groſs falſhoods. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark we ſhall illuſtrate in ſome texts, they lay ſtreſs upon. And it may be further noted, that Paul himſelf, uſeth this very phraſe "every man" in the ſingular number, rather more em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatical than the plural, in a ſenſe far more limited, than we do in conſtruing "this juſtification of life" as the appropriate privilege, of believers in all ages and generations. Thus Col. 1.28. "whom we preach, warning 'every man,' and teaching 'every man,' that we may preſent 'every man' perfect in Chriſt Jeſus." Here the term "every man" is three times uſed in this verſe, and yet it cannot poſſibly mean "every individual of the humane race exiſting from the beginning, to the end of the world." It is an evident impoſſibility in nature, that the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles could teach and warn the millions of millions that lived and died in the four thouſand years, before they were born. And there were millions of their cotemporaries, whom they had no opportunity or advantage, perſonally, to teach and warn. All theſe are excepted, excluſive of the million of millions that have been, and now are, and will be after them, to the end of the world, whom they cannot perſonally, teach and warn. The preciſe meaning then, according to the truth of fact, muſt be this, viz. "they taught and warned every man jew, gentile or chriſtian without diſtinction or exception of any, as they had opportunity and advantage for it:" and the term "every man" is uſed with utmoſt propriety in this intended deſcription; and is far more elegant, than to have inſerted the deſcription at large. And this is the preciſe meaning of the term "every creature" in the apoſtolic commiſſion, and in the account of their execution of it, preaching the goſpel "to every creature under heaven," Col. 1.23. And it is the preciſe ſenſe, of "all men" in almoſt every text where chriſtian duty is required to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:019737_0192_0FACA42165EEA9B0"/>
all men; as will be illuſtrate in a more proper place.— Now, in a ſimilar ſenſe doth he uſe it, of believers in this laſt part of the compariſon: not only to denote all believers, but alſo with that note of deſcription added chapter firſt, v. 16. "whether they were previouſly 'jew or gentile' without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction or exception." And if this be intended, it is obvious at firſt ſight, ALL MEN, is far more elegant than the deſcription at full length; and when the ſubject is known, it is equally determinate. Add to this, it is altogether agreeable to that ſhort, conciſe, ſententious manner he uſes, throughout this pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph; as every one, at once perceives, who is acquainted with the original.<note n="*" place="bottom">The author will probably at once ſet me off, for one who is prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red "to make the ſcripture ſpeak what ſenſe I pleaſe:" but he is miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in the man. The conſtruction given to this paragraph, and the ſcope of the apoſtle, is not newly taken up to ſerve a turn, nor from an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due attachment to common expoſitors: but is the reſult of diligent ſearch and enquiry. When I read the books of Dr. Taylor, ſo magnified in his preface, I was not ſo captivated with them as this writer: but was much diſſatisfied with ſeveral things, particularly his ambiguous uſe and change of the ſenſe of the ſame words, in the ſame diſcourſe, in ſeveral different conſtructions, interchangeably backwards and forwards. I was morally certain (previous to critical examination) that he muſt be wrong in it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I could particularly diſcover wherein. To me it was certain, ſuch an accurate writer as Paul, under inſpiration and giving familiar inſtruction to the church and world, in matters of the greateſt moment, would never write in ſuch a perplexing and embarraſſing manner. This put me upon a diligent ſtudy of Paul's epiſtles, and particularly this to the Romans; to find and "fix his main <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>cope," as the true key, whereby the conſtruction of his words and phraſes muſt be governed, as in all wiſe, good and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent writers. The conſtruction I have given is the reſult of this inquiry. And that before I had opportunity of examining that of Dr. Doddridge, with whom I am happy to agree.</note> This I truſt, is ſufficient to ſhew, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers only are intended in this laſt part of the compariſon; and that they are deſcribed by the term "all men," with far greater elegance and propriety than they could be by any other that would fully convey his meaning.</p>
                  <p>We have now laid before the reader, the evidence we propoſe to produce, to make evident, Paul never taught the doctrine imputed to him, "that the finally wicked ſhall reign in life for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever:" and have made evident, it involves many moſt groſs abſurdities in it. Paul could not ſo directly contradict his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, betray his ſacred truſt, ſubvert the terms of life and
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:019737_0193_0FACA42225E4E998"/>
death he was to publiſh to the world, and ſubvert the adorable authority by which he was commiſſioned—teach the doctrine of the wicked one, to convert the nations to the faith and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the goſpel—teach rebellion againſt the deſign of his commiſſion, &amp;c. as he muſt do to teach this doctrine: nor could he teach it in contradiction to the whole current of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and when ſo repeatedly and ſtrongly refuted, by himſelf —and the word juſtification will not endure their conſtruction, but the very texts they rely upon, taken in their connexion, confute their conſtruction and doctrine—that it is impoſſible Paul ſhould teach it in ſubverſion to his doctrine of juſtification by faith, ſo as to make faith, juſtification, the law and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes all void: and the language of the texts themſelves, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with parralel ſcriptures, that treat of juſtification, and in their connexion with the foregoing part of the context and of this epiſtle carry in them a full confutation of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and doctrine. In a word, that Paul ſhould preach the goſpel a glorious inſtitution of God, whereby all who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ſhall be ſaved, and teach and urge the things of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God and of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, with great aſſiduity, pains and pathos, as of the greateſt importance to all men; and yet while recommending this grand ſubject with all his force, ſhould at the ſame time, pour ſuch contempt upon it as to teach all the world ſhall be ſaved, though they pay no regard to this divine goſpel, to the law and authority of this gracious God, in this life, is ſuch a ſtaring inconſiſtence, as I ſhould think no conſiderate man, can any more believe, than that a pure foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain can iſſue forth both pure and foul, ſweet and bitter ſtreams, at the ſame time.</p>
                  <p>I might now leave this paragraph, but as the author lays great ſtreſs upon it, as a key for the conſtruction of a paragraph in the 8th chapter of this epiſtle, and another in the firſt epiſtle to the Corinthians 15th chapter where his great ſtrength lies, with others; it may not be improper to ſhew his own ſcheme to be ſo embarraſſed otherways, as that it cannot anſwer his purpoſe or be admitted. In p. 121, he ſays, "the apoſtle's way of arguing in this paragraph, and in the 8th chapter, is very unlike that of common commentators and chriſtian writers; they ground the ſuffering ſtate of mankind, on the ſin they
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:019737_0194_0FACA422EE237660"/>
have been guilty of, having ſinned in and fell with Adam in his tranſgreſſion: whereas, he ſays, the apoſtle frees mankind from all blame on the account of the offence of their firſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp;c. The proteſtant doctrine, here intended to be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, I take to be this, viz. "That all the natural poſterity of Adam, were ſo included in him as their foederal or conſtituted head, in the conſtitution of innocency, that if he had perſevered in obedience through the term of trial, the avails and bleſſings of it would have redounded to all his poſterity, as well as to himſelf; and conſequently, the natural and legal reſult of his diſobedience, righteouſly comes upon all his poſterity." It is in this ſenſe (not actively) they maintain they ſinned in him and fell with him. This ſentiment ſeems to be countenanced, at leaſt, verſe 19th, "for as by one man's diſobedience many were made "conſtituted" ſinners; ſo by the obedience of one ſhall many be made "conſtituted" righteous:" for how could they be conſtituted ſinners, by a diſobedience to that conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if they were no way included in it? or in what way, but in the natural and legal reſults of that conſtitution? how can they all die in Adam, if in no ſenſe they lived in him, any more than a man can be ſaid to die, who never lived? It is in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the ſentiment above ſtated, I conceive, this writer muſt mean "mankind are freed from all blame, on account of the offence of their firſt father." How doth this agree with what he aſſerts page 45? By the laſt clauſe of verſe 12th, "in whom or upon which, all have ſinned," he ſays, the apoſtle means preciſely the ſame thing, as when he ſaid, chap. 3.9. "All are under ſin;" and again, v. 19. "All the world are become guilty before God;" and yet again, v. 23. "All have ſinned." For if in fact, all men ſtand in ſuch a connected rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Adam and his firſt offence, that in conſequence of it, they are all under ſin and guilty before God, how are they blameleſs in reſpect hereto? Is not this to confound language, and to make ſinful, guilty and blameleſs, to mean the ſame thing? To paſs this, verſe 15th, "for if through the offence of one many be dead," he paraphraſes, "for if the many, that is all men, are ſubjected to death through the lapſe of the one man Adam." Now if they are all ſubjected to death through this offence, this offence is the righteous ground of it: but if
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:019737_0195_0FACA423A86CDC98"/>
they are not ſo conſtitutionally connected with Adam and this offence, as to be guilty and juſtly liable to it; how is this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence the righteous ground of their ſubjection to it, any more than the ſin of angels? Again, verſe 16, "for the judgment was by one, to condemnation," he paraphraſes, "for the judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial ſentence took riſe from the lapſe of one man, and proceeded to condemnation, condemnation ſubjecting mankind to death, and thereupon to ſin alſo." Upon which I would remark— every righteous, judicial ſentence is grounded on, and purſuant to ſome law or conſtitution, as the meaſure of it, and cannot extend beyond it, to reach the innocent as well as guilty. This judicial ſentence is purſuant to the conſtitution of innocency. Now, if all the poſterity of Adam, were abſolutely excluded that conſtitution, and abſolutely blameleſs, in reſpect to that offence, which is the ground of this judicial ſentence purſuant to it, and were ſo in the eye of the righteous Judge of the world; why is this terrible ſentence, carrying ſin and death in it, exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to all this innocent, blameleſs poſterity? where is the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, holineſs, goodneſs, or ſtrict righteouſneſs of it, in this view? would the infinitely wiſe and good God, when opening an infinitely wiſe and perfect government, which in the final iſſue of it, ſhall diſplay the glory of his moral character in high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt luſtre, preface the diſpenſation of it with a terrible judicial ſentence, upon millions of millions in his ſight, of abſolute in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocents? is it ſuppoſible, when he hath revealed the righteous rule of judgment, "he that juſtifieth the wicked, or condemneth the juſt, they are both an abomination to the Lord, Prov. 17. 15. and hath expreſsly forbid it in capital caſes among men, as Deut. 24.16. "The fathers ſhall not be put to death for the children, neither ſhall the children be put to death for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: every man ſhall be put to death for his own ſin." Would he ſet the counter example of this rule of righteouſneſs, in the view of the world, reaching to all generations of mankind? it is incredible. Theſe ſeem inſuperable difficulties in the way of holding them innocent and blameleſs in reſpect to this offence, in the eye of the righteous Judge. He ſhifts his poſition, ver. 19th, and tells us, "by the diſobedience of the one man Adam, the many or all men in conſequence of "a divine conſtitution" ſubjecting them to a frail mortal ſtate, occaſioned by this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:019737_0196_0FACA424674AA3B8"/>
of his, became ſinners," p. 27. Here it is not by judicial ſentence, as before, but by a "divine conſtitution" that all men become ſinners. Theſe do not agree, exactly: for a judicial ſentence, and a conſtitution, are eſſentially different things: as different, as a conſtitution, and the legal, judicial effects, of it. He ſtates his ſentiment more clearly, in his note upon Rom. 8.20. "for the creature was made ſubject to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, not willingly, but by reaſon of him, who ſubjected the ſame in hope." He tells us, "though the devil's temptation was the occaſion of ſin, and ſin the occaſion of mankind's ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to vanity, and ſo the devil may (as well as our firſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents) in a ſenſe, be ſaid to have been the authors of this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection: yet, the will of God, publiſhed in the judicial ſentence, taking riſe from Adam's lapſe, was that, and that only, which really ſubjected mankind to vanity, (i. e. to ſin, calamity and death). This will or conſtitution therefore, thus taking riſe from Adam's lapſe, muſt be the thing intended by the apoſtle," p. 105. Upon this ſtating, it is natural to inquire (1.) if A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam's diſobedience was diſpleaſing and hateful to God, is it credible a holy God, ſhould take occaſion from that, to make a conſtitution by which his natural poſterity in all generations, ſhould likewiſe be children of diſobedience and wrath; if they were in no ſenſe connected with the firſt tranſgreſſion? how could this be pleaſing to a holy, ſin-hating God? what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of wiſdom, holineſs, goodneſs and government could it poſſibly anſwer? (2dly.) If this will and conſtitution of God is that, only, which ſubjects the innocent poſterity of Adam to ſin, calamity and death; who, in true conſtruction, is the author of all theſe moral and natural evils, which reign through the world? not the devil, nor Adam, they are ſet aſide as occaſional cauſes only; and in contradiſtinction from them, it is aſcribed to the will and conſtitution of God, as the efficient or effectual cauſe, whereby they are ſubjected to them; and ſo ſubjected to them "as this damage certainly and univerſally comes into event," as p. 87. Who is the author of this conſtitution, but a holy God? And upon this plan, to whom are the reſulting evils to be aſcribed, as the author, but to him? And can ſuch an aſcription be endured by any who have juſt apprehenſions of the glorious moral character of God? In vain doth he lay
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:019737_0197_0FACA42528CD4830"/>
blame to Adam as having done hurt, as the ſource of death, &amp;c. when he takes of the whole, and aſcribes it to the will and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of God, only. Upon his plan, notwithſtanding any connexion with Adam and his offence, his poſterity might have remained innocent, happy and immortal forever. And it is the conſtitution of God only, made after this offence, which fixes their ſtate, as it is. (3dly.) Will it not follow, that in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion and promiſe of a Saviour to mankind, he viewed all the poſterity of Adam, as an innocent, and blameleſs race? For this promiſe was given, before the judicial ſentence was paſt; and ſo before "the conſtitution" was made or had any exiſtence, which only in fact, ſubjected them to ſin and condemnation. So, he ſays, "they were ſubjected in hope, and conſequent upon this promiſe," p. 106, 107. Is this credible? that the infinitely wiſe God, ſhould provide and reveal a Saviour, for an innocent race, who needed none, and might upon his plan, have never needed any; but in conſequence of an after divine conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which ſubjected them to ſin, condemnation and death? Where is divine wiſdom and grace to be ſeen in this? The Dr. gives us the true account, they were in the eye of God, without ſtrength, enemies, ſinners, ungodly, when he purpoſed and contrived the goſpel method of juſtification," ſermons, p. 149. (4thly.) Upon this plan of their ſubjection, by the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign conſtitution and will of God, will it not follow, that the proviſion and promiſe of a Saviour is a matter of juſtice to mankind; and conſequently, the riches and glory of goſpel grace, ſo celebrated in ſcripture, is excluded? This at leaſt in part, is implicitly, conceeded by this author: for he tells us, "their being ſubjected in hope may ſignify, that it was not merely poſterior in point of time, to the hope of deliverance, but conſequent upon it, in the purpoſe of God; and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent as that he never would have paſſed the ſentence, had he not intended to have given reaſon for this hope," p. 106. By hope, he means of their ſufferings terminating finally in their ſuperabounding advantage. For he tells us, "it is this thought only, ſo far as I am able to judge, that can reconcile the una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable ſufferings of the race of men, occaſioned by, and taking riſe from, the lapſe of their common father Adam, with the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of God, particularly with his infinitely perfect and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:019737_0198_0FACA425E5EEA9B0"/>
benevolence," p. 122. If ſo, it ſeems the proviſion of a Saviour, and the celebrated grace of the goſpel, became a matter of higheſt expediency, and indeed of neceſſity; for theſe two grand purpoſes; one is, to repair and make good the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age done to the race of men, by this divine conſtitution (conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent upon the lapſe of Adam) which ſubjected them to their ſins and ſufferings; the other is, to vindicate the character of the Moſt High, his juſtice and benevolence particularly, from that indelible reproach and diſhonour by means of this divine conſtitution, which could not otherwiſe, be removed. Where then is the celebrated divine love and grace of the goſpel, to mankind? it is removed out of ſight, and inſhrouded in a cloud of thick darkneſs. For is there any grace, in repairing of inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries brought upon the innocent and blameleſs? eſpecially when it becomes neceſſary to vindicate the juſtice and goodneſs of the repairer? Is there divine wiſdom and perfection exhibited in ſuch conduct? What ends of wiſdom, goodneſs and government can be anſwered by ſuch repugnant conſtitutions, the one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing innumerable natural and moral evils upon an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, blameleſs race; and the other repairing of it again, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent aſcriptions of diſhonour, upon the great author? Is this agreeable to the character we have of the infinitely perfect Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? all whoſe ways are holy, juſt &amp; good, and need no repairs, becauſe he never can do injury or wrong to his creatures. Can this be the grace celebrated in the goſpel as rich, free, ſovereign, unbounded, exerciſed to ſinners, the ungodly, and juſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned? Can theſe things be ſo, if the happineſs of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be the grand object? or if the greater object be in view, the eternal celebration of the moral character and government of God, in higheſt glory; in connexion with the higheſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of his obedient creatures? It is impoſſible. Would a wiſe and good parent do thus, ruin the moral character and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural conſtitution of all his children, and make them all diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to parental government, for the offence of one, in which they had no manner of concern, and when he muſt be at a vaſt expence to repair the damage? Could ſuch a reparation be magnified, as great wiſdom and grace in him? In no wiſe. What is it in true conſtruction, but to aſcribe that conduct to the infinitely wiſe and good God, which is abominable in man,
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:019737_0199_0FACA7DAA78BA840"/>
"to do evil, that good may come of it," Rom. 3.8. Nor is this all, for (5thly.) upon this plan, the great glory of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of Chriſt, as well as of the love and grace of God, as exhibited in the goſpel, is ſubverted and overthrown. Chriſt teacheth us, that God ſo loved the world, (a loſt periſhing, juſtly condemned world) that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth on him might not periſh, but have everlaſting life. In this ſtating, the love is unutterable, and incomprehenſible. Saint John tells us, "he was manifeſted to deſtroy the works of the devil." But this plan teaches another doctrine, in contradiction to the whole exhibition of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, viz. That God ſent his Son into the world, to repair the damage and remedy the evils, natural and moral, which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf introduced, "by his own judicial ſentence and divine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, upon all the innocent, blameleſs poſterity of Adam," not to deſtroy the works of the devil, or any evils introduced by Adam's diſobedience; for theſe are ſet aſide as occaſional, cauſes; but it is the evils, to which, the poſterity of Adam were in reality ſubjected, "by the will and conſtitution of God, only." Where then is the greatneſs of the love of God and of Chriſt, to mankind, in this redemption, as a remedy to evils, ſo intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced? What can be more horrible in ſuppoſition, than that God ſhould ſend his only begotten Son, to do and ſuffer the amazing things reported of him in the goſpel, to deſtroy his own works, "his own divine conſtitution," with its appendages and effects ſin and miſery introduced, upon a blameleſs race? I purſue it no farther, a diſcerning reader will ſee it full of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror: It carries deſtruction to the moral character of God, to the grace of the goſpel, and to the glories of Chriſt's redemption. What doctrine can equal it, but that which makes a holy God the efficient cauſe of ſin? and they both alike totally ſubvert and overthrow the glory of the grace of God, and of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of Chriſt, as exhibited in the goſpel. We ſee this ſcheme is ſo far from bringing more honour to God and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, as is pretended, that in various ways it reflects the higheſt reproach and diſhonour. We never ſee the glory of this grace and work of redemption, but when we ſee it provided and given of God infinitely free, and as effectually relieving and ſaving ſinners, the ungodly and juſtly condemned, who exerciſe faith
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:019737_0200_0FACA7DB634EA2A0"/>
in Chriſt, and repentance towards God. How much more eaſy, rational and ſcriptural the proteſtant faith, in this important article, to view the whole poſterity of Adam as included in him as their conſtituted head, in the conſtitution of innocency? The whole vindication of the character, judicial ſentence and government of God, then centers in one point, only, viz. in vindicating the wiſdom, fitneſs &amp; goodneſs of that conſtitution as worthy of God, and in itſelf, adapted to the great good of mankind. The vindication ſtands upon the ſame ground, and is no more difficult, than that of judicial ſentences upon crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals among men. If the law and conſtitution be good, ſo is a righteous ſentence purſuant to it. For the genuine, natural, legal and judicial reſult of every wiſe, good and righteous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, muſt be righteous. And ſurely, it is not a hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to vindicate that divine conſtitution as wiſely adapted for the beſt good of mankind; by which no evil could enſue; but by the default of the creature: but it is beſide the preſent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate. What hath been ſaid is ſufficient to anſwer the intention, to ſerve as a ſpecimen to ſhew, that his conſtruction of this paragraph, and doctrine inferred is ſo greatly embarraſſed, that it cannot anſwer his purpoſe, nor by any means be admitted.</p>
                  <p>The text next offered for proof is, Rom. 8th, from the 19th to the 24th verſe. V. 19. "For the earneſt expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifeſtation of the ſons of God. v. 20. For the creature was made ſubject to vanity, not willingly, but by reaſon of him who hath ſubjected the ſame in hope: v. 21. Becauſe the creature itſelf alſo ſhall be delivered from the bondage of corruption, into the glorious liberty of the children of God. v. 22. For we know that the whole creation groaneth, and travaileth in pain together until now: v. 23. And not only they, but ourſelves alſo, which have the firſt-fruits of the Spirit, even we ourſelves groan within ourſelves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body." It is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to go over his paraphraſe and notes, for the whole force of his argument from this paragraph, centers in one point, "in the conſtruction of creature and whole creation in this paſſage." He ſays, "mankind univerſally, are the creature and whole creation here intended; the whole rational creation, the whole world of mankind," p. 116 and 117, and ſhall be delivered in
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:019737_0201_0FACA7DC220EB830"/>
the liberties of the ſons of God. If he fails in his proof of this, or we prove the contrary, his argument is totally deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall firſt take ſome notice of his introduction and key; then examine his ſcripture witneſſes, that all mankind are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by every creature, or the whole creation, which if I miſtake not will teſtify the contrary; and I ſhall add ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming evidence that all mankind cannot be intended by the creature and whole creation in this paragraph. To introduce the connexion, he ſays the apoſtle had argued, with reſpect to himſelf and all good chriſtians, v. 17. "And if children, then heirs, heirs of God, and joint heirs with Chriſt: if ſo be we ſuffer with him, that we may be alſo glorified together," he paraphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, heirs to ſome valuable inheritance, worthy of ſo great and munificent a father, and joint heirs to it with Chriſt, inaſmuch or ſince we ſuffer with him, &amp;c. Why did he not ſay, heirs to the promiſed heavenly inheritance, which the apoſtle no doubt intended? wherein thoſe that ſuffer with him &amp; on his account, ſhall be glorified together. In his note, p. 95. he ſays, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle's argument, from ſonſhip to heirſhip lies in this, that the children are at preſent in ſuffering circumſtances. "Since we are children of God, yet in a ſtate of ſuffering, we may argue we are heirs to a better ſtate: thus we may argue now: but when we have attained that glorious ſtate, we can no longer argue, if children then heirs." Surely, when we are in actual, full poſſeſſion of the chartered, promiſed inheritance, we have no need to argue about heirſhip, it is altogether ſuperſeded by the poſſeſſion; but this doth not prove the apoſtle argues, from ſufferings to heirſhip. The fallen angels are in a ſuffering ſtate, but they cannot infer heirſhip, to a better. The apoſtle goes upon firmer ground, he argues, from ſonſhip to heirſhip, upon the ground of the goſpel conſtitution and promiſes of God. So he argues, Gal 3. "they that are of faith, are bleſſed with faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Abraham—are children of God—and heirs according to promiſe." So to the Epheſians—in this text and every where elſe. And he argues from joint-heirſhip with Chriſt, and joint-ſufferings with him, for his ſake, cauſe, intereſt and kingdom, which are the ſufferings ſpecially intended, to joint-glorification with him; all upon the ground of promiſe, and joint-heirſhip: which is a very different foundation from mere ſufferings: ſo
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:019737_0202_0FACA7DCE2472580"/>
that his introduction and key is a miſtake, and in like manner is his reaſonings upon it. Paul argues, v. 18. that "the ſufferings of the preſent time, are not worthy to be compared, with the glory that ſhall be revealed in us." He remarks, this glory is future, and to ſhew the reaſonableneſs of his arguing, the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God are heirs to a glory incomparably beyond their ſufferings, and to reconcile them to the thought of its being "glory not in poſſeſſion, but in expectation only, which they muſt patiently wait for," he makes this paragraph to be intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced: on which he argues, if the rational creature, mankind in common, are ſo the ſons of God, as that glory ſhall be revealed to them; much more ſhall it be the caſe of thoſe who are the children of God by adoption: and if this whole rational creation muſt come to this glory through ſufferings and after long and patient waiting for; the children of God, as partakers of his nature, have no reaſon to complain that it muſt be ſo with them. And ſays, upon this ground alſo, chriſtians may argue a fortiori, that their ſufferings will be over-balanced with a future weight of glory, p. 96, 97, and 101. This arguing ſeems ill founded, and ineffectual to the apoſtle's purpoſe. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive reaſoning, the medium of proof is more evident or better known, than the concluſion produced by it, was before. But in this caſe, the concluſion inferred, that preſent ſufferings are not to be compared with future glory, is incomparably clearer in goſpel promiſes and declarations than his medium of proof it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, viz. that all the ſons of belial ſhall ever be revealed to be the ſons of God. Again, this arguing ſuppoſes, it was a known principle, that theſe ſons of belial ſhould be ſo revealed, where <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s in fact it is a tenet unknown in the church of God and by the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, in that day &amp; for ſome ages afterwards, and it is conc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the note, p. 253. This arguing ſuppoſes, that it was better known, that all the wicked who are excluded the kingdom of God ſhould inherit it, than that the ſufferings of good chriſtians will be overbalanced, with a future weight of glory. It ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, it is more obvious that all infidels will be ſaved, than that the ſufferings of good chriſtians ſhall be graciouſly crowned with an overbalancing reward; and conſequently it ſuppoſes the doctrine of infidelity, is a more obvious medium by which to infer the peculiar glories of chriſtianity, than the plain doctrines
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:019737_0203_0FACA7DDA0F2C4C8"/>
of chriſtianity itſelf. Paul was too great a divine, and accurate reaſoner, to argue in ſo abſurd a manner. Nor could it anſwer his deſign, to ſupport chriſtians in their perſecutions and trials, ſuffering<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> with Chriſt, in his glorious cauſe. Would Paul ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs his ſuffering brethren—"your bloody perſecutors will be revealed the ſons of God, as well as you; and they muſt all come to future glory, through ſuffering, after long and patient waiting for it; and therefore you have no reaſon to complain of your ſufferings; but with this conſideration you may well indure with meekneſs and patience, all their horrid abuſe, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty and wickedneſs." Upon the ſtating of it, every one muſt ſee the impertinence and abſurdity of it. And it muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual on the other ground alſo forementioned: it was a principle unknown to them, and they could not infer ſupport from it. This arguing is like ſeeking light in a dungeon, or building a ſuperſtructure without a foundation. I would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, it is the ſanctified, adopted children and ſons of God, in this world, the apoſtle treats of in foregoing verſes and context, as this author allows, it is theſe therefore he undoubtedly means "in the manifeſtation of the ſons of God," v. 19. But this writer includes all the wicked of mankind in it; "the creature mankind, he ſays, waits in earneſt expectation for the time, when it ſhall be revealed, that they are the ſons of God, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gloriouſly immortal, p. 92. he foiſts into the text this laſt clauſe, "when it ſhall be revealed that they are the ſons of God," againſt the force of the connexion, and manifeſt deſign of the apoſtle, and when it is never ſo uſed in revelation of the finally ungodly. In ſupport of his conſtruction, that the rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal creation is intended by the creature in this text, he argues, "if the meaning be extended, to take in the inanimate part of the creation, much more the rational and moral part, ought to be comprehended:" for though on the one hand, the rational part might properly be ſtiled (paſaktiſes) the whole creation, without the inanimate part, yet it would be highly incongruous on the other hand, to give this ſtile to the leſs valuable part, leaving out the moſt excellent, p. 98. He ſubjoins, "what is moſt worthy of notice is, the phraſe paſaktiſis, every creature, is never uſed (one diſputed text excepted, Col. 1. 15.) in all the new teſtament, to ſignify more than the whole moral crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="185"
                         facs="unknown:019737_0204_0FACA7DE60FF0D50"

or all mankind," p. 99. I would produce one text, where more than mankind are intended by the word creature, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther where they are excluded: "Neither height, nor depth, nor any other creature" in the laſt verſe of this context certainly means more than all mankind. And in 1 Tim. 4.4. "For (pan ktiſma) every creature of God is good, (for food) and nothing to be refuſed, if it be received with thankſgiving."— Where the apoſtle ſpeaks of food to eat, all mankind are as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly excluded in the phraſe "every creature:" for our oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents would not countenance maneaters. Nor is it any abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity to ſuppoſe the moſt excellent part are here excluded; but it would be a groſs abſurdity to include them: and perhaps it will appear not leſs abſurd to include them in this diſputed text.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall now proceed to croſs examine his poſitive ſcripture witneſſes. He ſays, "'tis remarkable, when the apoſtles were commiſſioned to preach the goſpel to all mankind, the words are Mark 16.15. paſa ktiſis, every creature. So, when the goſpel is ſaid to have been preached, in conſequence of this commiſſion, to all mankind, the ſame words are uſed, paſa ktiſis, Col. 1.25. and that the rational creature, or mankind, is the only meaning of theſe words, may certainly be collected from Mat. 28.18. and Luk. 24.47. where the goſpel is ſpoken of as intruſted with the apoſtles to be preached, is panta ethne, "that is, to all nations of men." So that it is the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional creature, the rational creation, or mankind, that the apoſtle is here ſpeaking of," p. 99 and 100. here are his witneſſes and concluſion in full length. That men are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by every creature" in theſe texts, is granted: but that they do not include "all mankind" we ſhall prove from the texts themſelves, and conſequently his concluſion is ill founded. This commiſſion is deſigned to open a door and way of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all nations upon earth, upon the ſame footing. And when it is conſidered, the jews were the only covenant people of God, under the Moſaic diſpenſation; that they were ſtrongly poſſeſſed with the notion they always ſhould be ſo; and that the gentiles could not become ſuch, but in becoming jews, by circumciſion, which occaſioned the controverſy, recorded Acts 15. and when it is alſo conſidered, our Lord's miniſtry was to the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael, and the temporary miniſtry
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:019737_0205_0FACA7DF210AEC60"/>
of his diſciples in his life time, was likewiſe limited. Theſe particulars ſhew us the wiſdom and propriety of the clear, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive, deciſive and comprehenſive language of the goſpel commiſſion, whereby they are now authoriſed to preach the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to all nations, jew or gentile, ſcythian, barbarian, bond or free, as annumerated by Paul, without diſtinction or exception. But this is a very different thing from all mankind, in their ſenſe: for the words of the commiſſion and the promiſe of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, ſhew it limited to mankind upon earth. "Go ye into all the world, and preach the goſpel to every creature," ſays Mark the firſt witneſs: "Go ye therefore teach all nations," ſays Matthew: "That repentance and remiſſion of ſins ſhould be preached in his name, among all nations, beginning at Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem," ſays Luke. Nothing is more evident, than that they were to go from Jeruſalem &amp; preach to the nations then living, and every creature in them, as they had opportunity for it; and were to inforce it with "he that believeth ſhall be ſaved, but he that believeth not ſhall be damned," Mark 16.16. They had no commiſſion to preach to the million of millions that lived and died in the four thouſand years before they were born, to none of mankind in heaven, nor to any in hell; which would have been impoſſible to them, while living on earth: and their ſucceſſors in the miniſtry, in all ages, are to preach it in like manner, to every humane creature of their cotemporaries, as they have opportunity for it. And the promiſe of our Saviour, "Lo I am with you to the end of the world," Mat. 28.20. ſhews that the commiſſion will end, and be no more, at the end of the world. So that "every creature" and "all nations" in the commiſſion, cannot poſſibly include all mankind from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to the end of the world, conſiſtent with the deſign of it, and the truth of fact. Moreover, the apoſtles certainly ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled their commiſſion in their day, according to the full im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of "every creature:" and their next witneſs will give us the preciſe meaning of it: Col. 1.23. "and be not moved away from the hope of the goſpel which ye have heard, and which was preached to 'every creature' which is under heaven." Their commiſſion was fulfilled, not by preaching to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, from the beginning to the end of the world, which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, and is contrary to fact, but it was to every humane
<pb n="187"
                         facs="unknown:019737_0206_0FACA7DFE2BAD2C8"
                         rendition="simple:additions"/>
creature under heaven, as they had opportunity for it: which therefore is the preciſe meaning of their commiſſion: and alſo, of "teaching every man and warning every man" without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction or exception, as verſe 28 of the ſame chapter, as before noted. Wherefore theſe texts, when allowed to ſpeak for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, do not prove their all mankind, and whole rational cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, but witneſs the contrary, in the moſt deciſive manner. If therefore this diſputed text be parallel with them, it cannot poſſibly mean all mankind; nor is the phraſe uſed in that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive and excluſive ſenſe, in all the new teſtament. Their conſtruction is fully confuted by their own witneſſes. I ſhall now proceed to add ſome confirming evidence, that all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind cannot be intended by the creature, in this paragraph: and this is evident, (1.) becauſe the apoſtle holds up a diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and disjunction through the whole, between the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the ſons of God; are not the ſons of God a part, and very important part of the rational, moral creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Certainly. If ſo, and the term creature, intends the whole moral creation, they muſt be included, and cannot be diſconnected and disjoin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> from it. But this diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion and disjunction between the creature and the ſons of God runs through the whole paragraph. The creature "has earneſt expectation, waits, groans, travails in pain, is delivered from the bondage of corruption in the liberties of the ſons of God." "And the ſons of God, they that have the firſt fruits of the Spirit, the apoſtles themſelves, in way of diſtinction and disjunction from the creature, groan and wait for the adoption, the redemption of the body." Wherefore, their conſtruction of the term creature, is againſt the ſpirit and language of the paragraph, and holds up an abſurd contradiction in it, viz. that the ſons of God are both included and excluded in the ſame term, which is a manifeſt contradiction and abſurdity. A 2d. reaſon, why the finally wicked cannot be intended by the creature in the text, is, becauſe the reaſon aſſigned by the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle for the earneſt expectation and waiting of the "creature" for the manifeſtation of the ſons of God, is no reaſon or cauſe, why they ſhould deſire and wait for it. The reaſon here aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for it is, becauſe the creature itſelf ſhall be delivered from the bondage of corruption, "in the liberty of the glory of the
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:019737_0207_0FACA7E0A33FA2C8"/>
ſons of God:" that is, in the time of their manifeſtation. Now the ſcripture teaches but two manifeſtations of the ſons of God; one in Chriſt's glorious reign in this world, in which by ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, they are not delivered; the other, in the reſurrection and laſt judgment; when the ſons of God will be exhibited to the intelligent creation, in all their glory, and Chriſt will be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in, and with them. To this, the apoſtle has ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>efer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence— this magnificent "adoption &amp; redemption of the body," We read of no after manifeſtation of the ſons of God, nor can it be expected; for then "ſhall they be caught up to heaven, and be ever with the Lord." All hope of any after manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, is excluded by this text, and the current doctrine of ſcripture. Now it is certain, in this final manifeſtation of the adopted ſons of God, in the reſurrection of the juſt, the finally diſobedient will not be delivered from the bondage of corruption, in the glorious liberties of the ſons of God; for their reſurrection will be to damnation, as taught by our Saviour, and allowed by this author: and conſequently they cannot be the creature that hath earneſt expectation, and waits for this manifeſtation, for they will have no deliverance and benefit by it. This author takes for granted, "that all mankind are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the creature, and that they are all to be revealed to be the ſons of God, by being gloriouſly immortal, and ſhall be delivered into the liberties of the ſons of God;—and argues from one part, to the other in a circle to ſupport it; without any ſupporting, concluding evidence, of any one part of it. The text gives not the leaſt hint of their doctrine, but fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes it. The creature that will ever be delivered, will have this deliverance in the time of the manifeſtation of the ſons of God; but in his final manifeſtation of them, the finally wicked will not be delivered; after which, there is no deliverance. Their conſtruction intirely annuls &amp; deſtroys the reaſon aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for the creatures expectation, and waiting for the manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the ſons of God, in every view. The finally wicked will have no deliverance in their final manifeſtation: and if it be ſuppoſed they will have deliverance in ſome after diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yet this affords no cauſe or reaſon why they ſhould earneſtly deſire, expect and wait for this previous manifeſtation. For this final manifeſtation of the ſons of God expreſſed in the text,
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:019737_0208_0FACA7E1611A4DE0"/>
hath no ſort of connexion with ſuch a ſuppoſed after deliverance: no, not in time, means, place, or worlds, to be any ground or cauſe, why they ſhould ſo deſire and wait for it. The cauſe aſſigned, and connexion of things in the paragraph is abſolutely deſtroyed, by ſuppoſing the finally diſobedient are intended, by the creature. It is ſo far from being true, that all mankind are included, that they are abſolutely excluded, from being the creature here intended. The ſons of God are excluded by a disjunctive deſcription thro' the whole: and the finally wicked are excluded by the cauſe of the creature's waiting, expreſsly aſſigned; which cannot agree to them. A 3d. argument, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their conſtruction and doctrine is, that it is directly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the main ſubject of the apoſtle, and to the tenor and ſcope of his diſcourſe in the foregoing and ſubſequent part of the context, in which this paragraph is inſerted. The apoſtle of ſet purpoſe, is treating of the diſtinguiſhing character, ſtate, privileges and happineſs of the ſanctified, adopted ſons of God, in the foregoing and ſubſequent part of this chapter, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. He inſerts many characteriſtic marks and rules, whereby this great diſtinction in character, ſtate and happineſs may be known; as every one may ſee at firſt view, in reading of it. There is not a chapter in revelation more intirely taken up with this important ſubject. And it muſt be allowed, that there is not a more certain key of conſtruction, to every conſiſtent writer, than his main ſubject and deſign: every doubtful word, phraſe and ſentence muſt be conſtrued into a conſiſtency with that. Now, is it poſſible, when Paul from the firſt to the laſt verſe of this chapter, is holding forth a grand, eſſential and moſt important diſtinction in character, ſtate, privileges, and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in this world &amp; the eternal, between the ſanctified in Chriſt and the reſt of mankind; that in the middle of it, he ſhould ſtop ſhort, in a full and flat contradiction to the ſubject matter, ſcope and tenor of the whole? that then he ſhould annul all his rules of trial, throw down all diſtinction of character and ſtate between them, and put all mankind upon the ſame footing for eternity? Can it be, that he ſhould roundly aſſert that all the ſons of belial and wickedneſs, in earth and hell, ſhould be alike gloriouſly immortal, with the ſanctified in this world, in the time when theſe ſons of God are manifeſted in their diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:019737_0209_0FACA7E22B78BD08"/>
glory, in this world, or the redemption of their bodies? for in this paragraph they are cotemporary, coincident events. Can he here aſſert this of all the wicked, in full contradiction to his own doctrine in the 6th and 13th verſes, "to be carnally minded is death;" "if ye live after the fleſh, ye ſhall die:" alſo in contradiction to his account of the laſt judgment; that then "the diſobedient ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction;" and in direct oppoſition to the plain doctrine taught throughout revelation? this ſurely cannot be. What is it but to confound all language and ſentiment; to ſet up diſtinctions of character, ſtate, privileges and happineſs, and then to demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the whole again with a ſtroke; and in effect to teach us that the infinitely wiſe, holy, righteous and good Governour and Judge of the world, has no regard to vertue or vice, or to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters formed by the one or the other in this world: but the ſons of God, and of belial ſtand upon the ſame footing of favour with God, and their end will be the ſame? this is impoſſible. It reflects the higheſt reproach upon the character of God, of the apoſtle, and ſpirit of inſpiration. (4thly.) Their conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and doctrine is evidently falſe, becauſe it is directly repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the deſign of this paragraph, as an argument of ſupport to ſuffering chriſtians in all their perſecutions and trials in this world. This is evidently the deſign of it; for after deſcribing the appropriate happineſs of good chriſtians, in their relation to God as children, and to Chriſt as joint heirs, and aſſurance of the heavenly glory as founded in it, ver. 17th, "and if children then heirs, heirs of God, and joint heirs with Chriſt; if ſo be that we ſuffer with him, that we may alſo be glorified together." He adds, "for I reckon, that the ſufferings of this preſent time, are not worthy to be compared with the glory which ſhall be revealed in us." Then comes in this paragraph in diſpute: "for the earneſt expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the ſons of God." A very different time from the "preſent" is coming on, when there will be a grand exhibition of an innumerable multitude of "the ſons of God" out of all nations: when the kingdom of Chriſt, for which you and we ſuffer, will be gloriouſly triumphant over all the nations and kingdoms of this world: and chriſtians, ſo far from a ſtate of reproach and ſufferings, as at preſent, will then appear in dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:019737_0210_0FACA7E2E2053E68"/>
and honour, "the glory of Chriſt," and ruling the world. And this will reflect great glory, upon thoſe of us, who have previouſly ſuffered in ſupport of this glorious cauſe, and lead the van of this illuſtrious army; and may well ſupport and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate us in it. For it is a cauſe of ſuch vaſt magnitude, that not only innumerable numbers of mankind, to be delivered and revealed in the glorious liberties of the ſons of God, are moſt deeply intereſted in the ſupport, progreſs, ſucceſs and iſſues of it; but it is intereſting to the whole viſible, inferior creation. So that this whole inferior creation may, by an eaſy, ſtrong fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, be ſaid to be earneſtly expecting and waiting for it. For this ſelf-ſame creature, now ſubject to vanity and great abuſe, which may be ſaid to groan and travel in pain, under the tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and manifold abuſe of the wicked of the earth, contrary to the end of its creation, "ſhall be delivered from this bondage of corruption," in the time and by the means "of the glorious liberty of the ſons of God,"<note n="‖" place="bottom">The original is literally, "in the liberty of the glory of the ſons of God." I am ſenſible a noun genetive put adjectively, is often the moſt elegant conſtruction: but in this verſe the literal one, may beſt point out the time and inſtrumental cauſality, of their deliverance from their baſe vaſſalage and ſuggeſt a ſtimilus to it, viz. it is by means of that divine nobleneſs and liberality of ſpirit, which ſets them above evil and cruelty, and excites them to do good to all creatures, as they have opportunity; and is "the glory of the ſons of God."</note> and ſhall participate according to its nature, of the glory and bleſſings of that ſtate, when the curſe is removed, and plentiful bleſſings will be poured out from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, upon this lower creation. And not only doth the whole inferior creation travail in pain for the birth of this great event which will attend the goſpel and cauſe for which we ſuffer in this world; but ourſelves alſo, the chriſtian world, and thoſe of diſtinguiſhed eminence in it, "who have received the firſt fruits of the Spirit," "even we ourſelves, groan within ourſelves, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly looking and waiting for a ſtill more glorious manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and adoption, in the view of the intelligent creation, at the redemption of our body;" when a diſtinguiſhing reward will be given, and glory be revealed in and upon thoſe who have ſuffered with Chriſt, as v. 18. In this view this paragraph carries weighty argument of ſupport to ſuffering chriſtians. What could be better adapted, than to addreſs to them the vaſt

And it is in ſubſtance the ſame ſupport given to the church of God by the prophets, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted theſe glorious times, in ſtrong, lively and energetic de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, and by our Saviour in his parables, which ſet forth the triumphant progreſs and ſucceſs of his goſpel and kingdom in the world, and which are more particularly and ſtrongly ſet forth in his revelations to St. John. Will their conſtruction and doctrine anſwer as a ſupport to ſuffering chriſtians? How? what, to tell them that all the reprobate ſons of belial and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, in earth and hell, are waiting with earneſt expectation the manifeſtation and glorious adoption of the ſons of God, and ſhall have part in it? To tell them, that all who pay no regard to the ſacred cauſe for which they ſuffer, but live in pleaſure, caſting off all regard to God and religion, and live and die ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the croſs of Chriſt, "ſhall be revealed to be the ſons of God, by being made gloriouſly immortal? yea more, to tell them, that their tyrannie, blood-thirſty perſecutors, thoſe roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lions, ranging bears, and devouring wolves, worſe than common beaſts of prey, who were worrying and hurrying them by hundreds and thouſands, as lambs to a bloody execution; were all waiting with earneſt expectation, were groaning and travelling in pain, for their manifeſtation and glorious adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; when "they that groan, ſhall groan no more," but ſhall be delivered with themſelves, in the liberties of the ſons of God? No doctrine could better ſuit the devil and his wicked inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But ſurely, it is cold frozen comfort to the godly, under perſecution. It carries in it a death chill to the ſufferers, and to the cauſe for which they ſuffer. What is it but to tell them, there is no judgment: no redreſs of their wrongs: that it is vain to ſerve the Lord: that their ſufferings are fruitleſs; for in the time of their manifeſtation as the ſons of God, their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies will be gloriouſly immortal as well as they: for it muſt be at that time, if ever, according to this text.

And perhaps, it is not in the power of the devil himſelf, to wreſt the Paulina of this apoſtle into a worſe conſtruction and accuſation, than to make him a preacher of infidelity. Wherefore, their conſtruction and doctrine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo directly repugnant to the whole ſcope of the context, and to the argument of ſupport and comfort to ſuffering chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians deſigned in this paragraph, is evidently falſe and abſurd. I will only ſubjoin, all mankind cannot be intended by the creature, for it is inconſiſtent with the deſcription here given of it, and with the truth of fact. One part of the deſcription
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:019737_0213_0FACA7E522519D30"/>
is v. 20. "for the creature was made ſubject to vanity, not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly," which this author conſtrues "not through any fault of its own." Now this cannot be true of mankind univerſally, for it is certain Adam and Eve were ſubjected to condemnation for their own fault: and it is as certain as words can make it, that the creature mankind is ſubject to condemnation, ſin and death, by the ſin, faulty offence, and diſobedience of the one man Adam, Rom. 5.12, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. If the words <hi>amar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, paraptoma,</hi> and <hi>parakoes,</hi> ſin, offence and diſobedience, do not ſignify fault in the creature, there are no words in any lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage that can convey and fix it. Now it is by "ſin" the firſt word, that death hath paſſed upon all men, v. 12. and it is by and through the offence, the ſecond word, that judgment is come upon all men "to condemnation," v. 15, 16, 17, 18. and by diſobedience, the laſt word that many are made ſinners, v. 19. It is true, this ſubjection of mankind, comes through the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um of the righteous ſentence of the holy and righteous judge of the world, grounded upon the faulty offence of the creature; and it is this which deciſively diſtinguiſheth it from that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection by ſovereign act and arbitrary conſtitution, whereby the inferior part of the creation, without fault of its own, are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to vanity, as is intended in this text. Men may uſe am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous words, ſuch as "occaſion" "taking riſe," &amp;c. and may ſhuffle with them ſo as to diſguiſe facts, but cannot alter them. It will appear from the apoſtle's words, to every unbiaſſed ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious perſon, that the creature mankind is ſubjected to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, by and through the ſin and fault of the creature man, and therefore cannot be intended in this verſe 20. The ſophiſtry to evade it is eaſily expoſed. E. g. A man dies a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent death for murder,—ſays a byſtander, this man was not ſubject to this death by any fault of his own. Why not? he ſurely dies "for his own iniquity," in the very ſenſe of the law of God. He replies, it is true, he committed the offence, and ſo the devil that tempted him, as well as himſelf, may be ſaid to be the occaſional cauſes of this death: but the fact is, the judgment took riſe from the offence, and proceeded to condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and it is the judicial ſentence of the judge that condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him to it, and that only, that really ſubjected him to this death. The futility of it is obvious. According to this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:019737_0214_0FACA7E5E0EF0BA8"/>
no man could ever die for his own iniquity. For accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the law of God and man, ſuch death ought to, and muſt come through the medium of a judicial ſentence. Nor can the other part of the deſcription of the creature, v. 20. "who hath ſubjected the ſame in hope" agree but to the inferior part of the creation. It is they only that ſhall be delivered from the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of corruption, in the time of the manifeſtation of the ſons of God, as before ſhewn. To ſay that all the wicked of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind are ſubjected in hope of a glorious immortality, is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the whole tenor of revelation, and the ſpirit and language of the goſpel conſtitution, which limits the hope of it to the believing, the penitent and ſanctified in this world; and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed by many as plain texts, as any in revelation. Again, the ſeveral parts of the deſcription of the creature and whole crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will by no means agree to the whole moral creation and mankind univerſally. Is it true that thoſe who are without God in the world, are ſubjected in hope; when Paul tells us expreſsly they are without hope in the world? Is it true of the wicked cut off in wrath, whoſe hope periſheth at death, that they are ſubjected in hope? Is it true of thoſe who live in pleaſure, riot in wickedneſs, and drink in iniquity like water, and refuſe the goſpel means of deliverance, that they are groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and travelling in pain for deliverance from their bondage? Is it true of the ſpirits of the juſt made perfect, that they are groaning under the burthen of corruption, and travelling in pain? or is it true of the diſobedient ſpirits in priſon, that they are waiting with earneſt expectation, for the manifeſtation and adoption of the ſons of God, at the reſurrection, when their own reſurrection will be to damnation? Reduce it to fact, and it is exceeding evident their conſtruction of creature, and whole creation, is every way falſe, abſurd, againſt the truth of fact and tenor of ſcripture. The word of God never deals in error, nor confuſion: it never repreſents the whole moral world (except in their ſtate of degeneracy and condemnation) as of one chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter, nor in one ſtate of happineſs or miſery: but conſtantly holds up a moſt clear diſtinction between the righteous and wicked, in character and ſtate in this world—at death—in the reſurrection and laſt judgment, and in their deſtination to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as different as heaven and hell. On the whole, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:019737_0215_0FACA7E6A13F7D68"/>
the creature and whole creation, to mean all mankind, and the deſcription given of it literally; we plainly ſee it to be every way falſe, in fact. If we underſtand it of the inferior part of the creation, and the deſcription figurative, it gives not the leaſt countenance to their error; and therefore it affords not a ſhadow of ſupport to their abſurd doctrine.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall make a brief remark upon his argument, "from thoſe who have received the firſt fruits of the Spirit," in this and ſome other texts. He argues thus, the apoſtle "certainly alludes to the jewiſh cuſtom of offering the firſt fruits of their increaſe; which oblation ſanctified not only theſe fruits, but all the reſt." And ſuppoſes the gifts and graces they had received, to be a ſpecimen, pledge, or earneſt of what would be beſtowed upon the reſt of mankind; and that the whole race of men were the following harveſt. It is eaſy to obſerve, the offering of the firſt fruits, ſanctified the reſt of the preſent harveſt, but no more. To make his argument from this alluſion clear, and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion ſtrong, he muſt ſhew that the offering of the firſt fruits, not only ſanctified the reſt of the preſent harveſt, but likewiſe all the preceeding harveſts up to the beginning of the world; and alſo, all ſucceeding harveſts to the end of it. This he can never prove: it is confuted by the inſtitution itſelf, which was annual. As to his other texts, it is ſufficient to obſerve, the believing jews and gentiles of that day were a ſort of firſt fruits, as an earneſt and inſuring pledge of the ingathering of the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs both of the jews and gentiles, including all nations, into the kingdom of God, in the diſpenſation of it in this world; as predicted by the prophets.</p>
                  <p>We now paſs to his twin texts: Col. 1.19, 20. "For it pleaſed the Father that in him all fulneſs ſhould dwell: and (having made peace through the blood of his croſs) by him to reconcile all things unto himſelf; by him, I ſay, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven. And Epheſ. 1.9, 10. Having made known unto us the miſtery of his will, according to his good pleaſure, which he purpoſed in himſelf: that in the diſpenſation of the fulneſs of times, he might gather together in one all things in Chriſt, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth, even in him." By heaven in theſe texts, this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor underſtands the aerial heaven which ſurrounds the earth;
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:019737_0216_0FACA7E761714780"/>
by earth, the earth itſelf and all things that appertain to it: and by "reconciling all things in them" the renovation or rechang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the viſible heavens and earth, with all men and things in them; according to Dr. Thomas Burnet's theory of the new heavens and earth. A conſtruction, which is as foreign to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the apoſtle, as Sir Iſaac Newton's principia of the ſolar ſyſtem, and not ſo well founded in truth. His ſcheme of the reſurrection, millenian world, and new heavens and earth, needs no diſcuſſion here, as I truſt it will be ſufficiently confuted in another place. Theſe texts rightly underſtood, are ſo far from helping their cauſe, that I apprehend, taken in connexion with other things ſaid in theſe epiſtles, they afford a deciſive argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt it. Mr. White's conſtruction of "reheading all things in Chriſt," to me appears preferable to this author's. But "the all things in heaven and upon earth" muſt not be taken in his unbounded ſenſe: no, they are limited by the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject he is treating of, viz. "to all things which have been, now are, and ever will be reconciled and ingathered, as his body, in Chriſt their head:" whether they be now in heaven with Chriſt, or on earth. In the diction of the texts, it ſeems "the all that are reconciled by himſelf, and to himſelf;" and "the all that are reheaded in him, whether in heaven or earth "are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſively intended. And how are they reconciled to God in him, and gathered together in him as their head, but in the diſpenſation of the goſpel as the means, and by the medium of faith in him? The ſcripture points out this, and no other way: conſequently, all that ever will be reconciled and inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, will be ſo in the preſent ſtate. And what to me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms the above-given conſtruction, is this, that the apoſtle is (ex proſeſſo) treating of true believers, and of the church as his body, of which Chriſt is the head, in both the contexts.— Thus he addreſſes to the Epheſians, as "ſaints and faithful in Chriſt Jeſus," v. 1. as bleſſed with all ſpiritual bleſſings in heavenly places in Chriſt, v. 2. as predeſtinated by God, to the adoption of children by Jeſus Chriſt unto himſelf, v. 5. as made accepted in the beloved, v. 6. as having redemption and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſins, v. 7. and as "believers who were ſealed with the holy Spirit of promiſe, which is the earneſt of their inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, until the redemption of the purchaſed poſſeſſion," v. 13,
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:019737_0217_0FACA7E841C0B330"/>
14. "whoſe faith in Chriſt and love to the ſaints" he had heard of, v. 15. and concludes the chapter with this deſcription of Chriſt, "as head over all things to the Church," which is his body, the fulneſs of him that filleth all in all," v. 22, 23. It is his church explicitly and deciſively that is "his body," and "his fulneſs" as ſuch, and not all the lapſed race of Adam. He is head over all things in the univerſe as ſupreme Lord and Governor, and for the benefit of his church; but in contradiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction from all the reſt of our lapſed race, &amp; all other things, "the church only, is his body." In the ſame manner is his addreſs to the Coloſſians, "to the ſaints and faithful brethren, at Coloſſe—he gives thanks and prays for them, ſince he had heard of their faith in Chriſt, and love to all the ſaints;" for the hope laid up for them in heaven, and not in the new earth, v. 2, 3, 4, 5. he gives thanks for them as made meet for the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance of the ſaints in light: as delivered from the power of darkneſs, and tranſlated into the kingdom of Chriſt: "as having redemption through his blood, and forgiveneſs of ſins," v. 12, 13, 14. Surely theſe are deſcriptions which do not belong to all the lapſed ſons of Adam. And what is to be particularly noted is, that he introduces the text in diſpute, with the deſcription of Chriſt as head of the church, "his body," v. 18. "and he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firſt born from the dead; that in all things he might have the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence." Then comes in theſe words, "for it pleaſed the Father," &amp;c. I ſhould think it manifeſt to every eye, that he gives not a hint in either context of a new heaven and earth, nor is he treating of all the lapſed race of Adam, but preciſely and deciſively of believers, and of the church as the body of Chriſt, in contradiſtinction from an unbelieving and ungodly world. If we pay attention to the ſubject matter treated of in both contexts, and the connexion in which this laſt text is introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, it ſeems moſt natural, yea neceſſary to underſtand the all things in heaven and earth, to mean all the reconciled to God, and ingathered out of all nations into Chriſt their head "by faith in him;" and as comprehending the whole of this happy body. And it is eaſy to ſee, the term "all things," ſo applied, to comprehend all of this denomination and deſcription of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled and ingathered in heaven and earth, whatever their previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

character might be, whether jew or greek, barbarian, ſcy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian, bond or free, as annumerated, Col. 3.10, 11. is both elegant and emphatical. The above exhibition of the deſign of the apoſtle in theſe two chapters, will lead us to a clear de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſive ſenſe of "Chriſt's filling all things." It is but twice uſed, and both times in this epiſtle, and in both alike, with reſpect to the church "his body." "Who is head over all things to the church, which is his body, the fulneſs of him that filleth all in all." Take it in its connexion in the ſentence, and with his deſign in the context, and it ſeems evidently deſigned to teach us, what Chriſt is to his church in the diſpenſation of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in this world; by communication of gifts and grace to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gather, preſerve, edify, and build it up to the everlaſting king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God. And the apoſtle's illuſtration of it in this ſenſe, muſt fix it deciſively, as ch. 4.10, 11, 12, 13. "he that deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, is the ſame alſo that aſcended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things." How? he proceeds to ſhew, "and he gave ſome, apoſtles; and ſome, prophets; and ſome, evangeliſts; and ſome, paſtors and teachers; for the perfecting of the ſaints, for the work of the miniſtry, for the edifying the body of Chriſt: till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt." It is evident theſe gifts are imparted for the ingathering and edification of the church, the body of Chriſt in this world; and that they are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar and appropriate to the preſent diſpenſation of the goſpel; which will come to a period at the end of the world; as is allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, p. 266. and "Chriſt's filling all things," is his imparting theſe gifts, with his grace for this important purpoſe. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, his whole work of filling all things, will be complea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, at the end of the world. But this author conſtrues it, "a filling all the lapſed race of Adam, and he will go on imparting gifts to this end, in future diſpenſations, until every individual of the human race comes to the unity of the faith," &amp;c. p. 154, 5. without a ſhadow of proof, againſt the force of connexion, and the deſign of the apoſtle as explained by himſelf. I would remark, from what hath been ſaid, it is eaſy to ſee, Mr. Relly's ſcheme of the union of all mankind to Chriſt, as his body, is altogether unſcriptural and palpably erroneous: for the church

conſiſting of believers, and as contradiſtinguiſhed from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing world, are repreſented in the above texts, and in all the apoſtolic epiſtles, as "the body of Chriſt." Our Saviour, in his miniſtry, held up the diſtinction moſt clearly: he cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſes his ſheep as thoſe "that are called; and lead out by him, that know his voice and follow him "as diſtinguiſhed from the reſt of the world," Joh. 10.3, 4. and he ſpeaks of his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples "as not of the world, as he was not; and as hated by the world, becauſe they hated him," Joh. 15.18, 19. and cha. 17.14. and ſays expreſsly, v. 9. "he prays not for the world, but for thoſe given him, for all who believe," v. 20. And the world in the ſenſe here intended, we are taught by Paul, will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in the great day. Now, is Chriſt hated by his body, will he not pray for, but condemn his body, in the great day? how abſurd? And "they that are Chriſt's," is a deſcription of true believers, as diſtinguiſhed from the reſt of the world, 1 Cor. 15.23. And what is ſpecially to be noted is, that all the promiſes, and great privileges of redemption are every where appropriated to them who are in Chriſt, by faith, only. We have already ſhewn they have juſtification by faith, that they are children of God and heirs of the promiſes by faith, Gal. 3.26.29. and to them that are in Chriſt there is no condemnation, Rom. 8.1. and to them "who are in him," he is made of God wiſdom, righteouſneſs, ſanctification and redemption," 1 Cor. 1.30. Who are they? Paul tells you, if any man be in Chriſt, he is a new creature; old things are paſt away, behold all things are become new, 2 Cor. 5.17. and he further deſcribes them, Rom. 8. as "thoſe who walk not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit," as "delivered from the law of ſin and death, as "mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the things of the Spirit," and "ſpiritually minded," and "as lead by the Spirit, as the ſons of God," v. 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 14. and ſays, v. 9. "now if any man have not the ſpirit of Chriſt, he is none of his." Surely they who have not the ſpirit of Chriſt, cannot be of his body, for Paul ſays expreſsly, they are none of his (i.e.) are not of is body: and this diſtinction between be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, the church of God, as the body of Chriſt; as contradiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inguiſhed from the unbelieving and ungodly: and ſo, between the righteous and wicked, them that are Chriſt's and them that are none of his, is as clear, as any doctrine in ſcripture, and runs

through the revelation of God. Wherefore his doctrine, that all the reprobate ſons of belial in earth and hell are united to Chriſt, as members of his body; is a moſt groſs and palpable error; and his ſcheme of doctrine built upon this union, is a moſt manifeſt deluſion. I would further remark, that the free incorporation of jews and gentiles without diſtinction, into the church of Chriſt, by their profeſſion of faith in him; and the incorporation of all true believers of all nations in him, as their head, life and hope, ſo as to become members of his body, and members of the great family of God in heaven and earth, is the miſtery the apoſtle is treating of, in both theſe epiſtles. This is emphatically "his reconciling all things in heaven and earth by himſelf and to himſelf, and reheading them, in himſelf." The prophet taught the converſion of the gentiles in the reign of Meſſiah, but the free incorporation of all nations upon the ſame footing "of faith," ſo as to become one church and body of Chriſt, and members of the illuſtrious family of God in heaven and earth, was a great ſecret in foregoing ages, compared with the clearneſs with which it is revealed by the apoſtles. Now, believers of all nations "are no more ſtrangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the ſaints and of the houſhold of God," Eph. 2.19. ſee Heb. 12.22, 3, 4. this I take to be "the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery which hath been hid from ages and generations, but now is made manifeſt to his ſaints," to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this miſtery among the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, which is Chriſt in you the hope of glory, Col. 1.26, 27. It cannot be their "myſtery of the reſtoration of all the lapſed race" for this miſtery we ſee "was manifeſt to the ſaints" whereas theirs, by their own conceſſion, note p. 253, was unknown to the apoſtles, and of courſe, to the ſaints. It is to be noted, as the ſpecial deſign of the apoſtle, in theſe diſputed texts, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit Chriſt, as the only reconciler of all things in heaven and earth, that have been, now are, and ever will be reconciled: and the phraſeology in them, conveys this inſtruction, with great plainneſs and force: and it is alſo his deſign in theſe epiſtles, to exhibit his all ſufficiency for this important work; to induce ſinners of all nations to believe in him, and to fix and ſettle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in a firm, perpetual hope and truſt in him, and adherence to his divine goſpel, ſervice and kingdom: to this end, he gives
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:019737_0221_0FACA7EB22C9DE58"/>
us the moſt exalted deſcriptions of him, as "having all fulneſs dwelling in him," "all t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, in the diſpenſation of his kingdom in this world; before the ſettlement of it in the great day. It is obſervable, after both texts, he proceeds immediately to ſhew, Chriſt is in fact now carrying this great deſign into execution. In the next words, he goes on to ſay to the Epheſians, "in whom alſo we have obtained an inheritance," &amp;c. and the ſame to the Coloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians, "and you that were ſometime alienated, and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled, in the body of his fleſh, through death, to preſent you holy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable, and unreproveable in his ſight," v. 21, 22. Further, the place, the time and means, and ends of it, as deſcribed by the apoſtle, do all pointedly and ſtrongly ſhew the whole work to be accompliſhed, in this world. The "place" in which this great work is accompliſhed, is ſpecified and fixed in both texts, it is (epi tes ges) "upon earth," in both. From the expreſs deſcription "things in heaven" and "things on earth," the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconciled, finally impenitent, and thoſe in hell, are abſolutely excluded, from the things that ever will be ingathered and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled: and the diction, in connexion with his ſhewing how this work is now effecting, naturally and plainly indicates the whole work will be accompliſhed, during this preſent earth. But this is more ſtrongly fixed, in the phraſe, that points out "the time and means" for the perfecting of it. In the ſecond text it is, "in the diſpenſation of the fulneſs of times." The plain meaning I take to be this; this work will be accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the means of the diſpenſation of his kingdom and grace, and in the fulneſs of the times of the adminiſtration of it, before the grand expected ſettlement of it, at the end of the world, when time ſhall be no longer. There was a glorious ingather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of believers in Chriſt their head, in that day; and there will
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:019737_0222_0FACA7EBE0E40758"/>
be a gradual ingathering of them in the more ordinary times of this diſpenſation: but in the fulneſs of the times predicted for the ingathering of the fulneſs of the jews, and of all gentile na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in a long and glorious period, will be the greateſt harveſt of all; and the whole work will be compleated in the fulneſs of the times of the preſent adminiſtration of this kingdom, before the final ſettlement of it, in the great day. Then cometh the end of his adminiſtration of this kingdom, and the end of time. And it is a contradiction to ſuppoſe time, when it ſhall be no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Nor do the inſpired writers annex (chronon) or any note of time, to any things whatever, after the laſt judgment. This author ſays, it ſhould "be particularly regarded here," this time of Chriſt's adminiſtration ought not to be confined, as moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines do confine it, to this preſent ſtate; but it is to be carried into the reſurrection world," &amp;c. p. 147, 148. We do note it, but as an error in him, which has no foundation in revelation. He conceeds (in the note afore referred to) that the apoſtles did not know his ſcheme of reſtoration; and therefore Paul did not, could not carry it into the reſurrection world. And we ſtop, where he confined, and deſigned that we ſhould confine it; not daring to be preſumptuouſly wiſe above what is written, and manifeſtly deſigned, by the inſpired penman. Moreover, the goſpel way and means, whereby this divine work will be effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as particularly pointed out by this apoſtle, ſhew the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of it in this world. Hence, he ſpeaks of every thing relating to the unity of the body of Chriſt, the perfecting of this work and the grand means to effect it, as in this world. As in Epheſ. 4.4. and onwards; "there is one body, and one ſpirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling; (which cannot mean the uncalled, unbelieving world) "one Lord, one faith, one baptiſm, one God and Father of all, who is above all, and in you all: but to every one of us is given grace according to the meaſure of the gift of Chriſt." He is evidently ſpeaking not of all the lapſed race, but of the church as formed into one body and ſpirit in Chriſt, in this world; and as effected by goſpel faith and ordinances. For there is no "calling" by the goſpel, no profeſſion "of faith," no "baptiſm" in the future world, whereby the finally impenitent may be brought into the church of God. And he is more particular in his deſcription of goſpel
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:019737_0223_0FACA7ECA1AAE968"/>
means which belong to Chriſt's kingdom in this world, only, in the next verſes. "Wherefore he ſaith, when he aſcended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men," v. 8. and he tells us preciſely what they are in the next verſes before tranſcribed, the goſpel miniſtry and adminiſtrations: and it is to be noted, they will continue till the whole work of the body of Chriſt be compleated, "till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt." The whole work will then be compleated; the connexion ſhews, the goſpel miniſtry will continue till this be effected; but, by the promiſe of Chriſt they will continue only to the end of this world; and it is conceeded by this author: and this confirms the conſtruction we have given of the diſpenſation of the fulneſs of times. The miniſtry, the diſpenſation, and the fulneſs of times come to a period in the great day, when the whole work will have been compleated. I have one thing more to add, the great ends to be anſwered in this all-important work of Chriſt, as ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified by the apoſtle in theſe epiſtles, clearly confirm the ſame concluſion. It is that the exceeding riches of God's grace might be manifeſted in all the ſaved, by faith in Chriſt; and that they might be to the praiſe and glory of his grace in this world, in heaven and eternity: as Eph. 2.7, 8. and every where.— "It is to the intent, that unto principalities and powers in heavenly places, might be known by the church (called, ingathered and ſanctified by faith in Chriſt, and not the reſtoration of all the lapſed race) the manifold wiſdom of God," Eph. 3.10. As to the happy ſubjects themſelves, who are cordially reconciled to God and ingathered into Chriſt their adorable head, it is that they may be "preſented holy, unblameable and unreproveable in his ſight," Col. 1.22.—In reſpect to Chriſt the adorable Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, it is "that he may preſent it" (this illuſtrious body of all the reconciled, ingathered, redeemed &amp; ſaved out of this world) "to himſelf a glorious church, without ſpot and blemiſh," as ſpecified Eph. 5.27. in and by whom he will be eternally ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured and glorified. Now we read of but one preſentation of the redeemed and ſaved of our world, and that is in the great judgment day; "when Chriſt ſhall be glorified in all his ſaints, and admired in all that believe," 2 Theſ. 1.10. It ſeems evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:019737_0224_0FACA7ED62FB5A50"/>
this whole work of Chriſt muſt be compleated before that day, to anſwer all theſe grand intentions of it. How could we expect, in theſe epiſtles, a more full information of the comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this whole work of Chriſt before the final ſettlement of his kingdom, in the great day, than is contained in theſe col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected particulars taken all together. The concluſion we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce is, that theſe texts taken in connexion with other illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting paſſages in theſe epiſtles, produce a full and deciſive witneſs not only againſt their conſtruction of them, but alſo againſt their whole ſcheme, reſpecting the ſalvation of the finally diſobedient.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall briefly notice ſome things ſaid upon theſe texts, which may further elucidate the ſubject. "By heaven and earth," he underſtands "the whole lower world, the earth and all men and things in it, and the heavens that environs it." And he ſays, the plain meaning of "it has pleaſed God to reconcile all things to himſelf, things in heaven and things in earth, is "that he has rechanged their ſtate, brought them back to that they were ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally in," p. 129. This is ſo far from "obvious" that we ſee it falſe in fact, and know it to be both a natural and moral im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility; as any man with a little unbiaſſed reflection may ſee. Beſides, reconciliation is never predicated upon material, inan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imate things, nor the brutal creation. He inſiſts much that "reconciliation" intends "all mankind univerſally are put into a ſalvable condition," p. 133, 139. But this is not reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as has been ſhewn: nor can it prove, that all will be ſaved. For altho' the way of ſalvation is open to all upon earth through faith in Chriſt; yet many live and die unbelievers, and unrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled enemies to God; and will be condemned and ſuffer the future puniſhment. And to ſpeak of theſe unreconciled, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and executed enemies, as "reconciled," is contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous nonſenſe. Nor is it true in fact, that all that die in their ſins are put into a ſalvable condition, by the death of Chriſt. The tenor of revelation teaches the contrary, as has been proved. And Paul deciſively gives us his own meaning in the text, in the words which immediately follow: "And you that were ſometimes alienated, &amp; enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled," Col. 1.21. Paul evidently means by "reconciliation" ſuch a change of ſtate whereby thoſe who were before enemies "in their minds" become cordial friends
<pb n="206"

to God; ſuch a change of temper in them, as fits them for the ſervice and kingdom of God, and introduces them into a ſtate of peace with him, through faith in Chriſt. And this is invariably his ſenſe upon this ſubject, throughout his epiſtles. But theſe finally condemned, executed enemies he tells us, will be reconciled by other means, in future diſpenſations which will prove more effectual," p. 139. It cannot be by faith, nor by the goſpel—it muſt be then by another conſtitution—another goſpel; and who dare to preach it, when Paul teaches us tho' it were an angel from heaven, let him be accurſed?" Gal. 1.8. But what theſe means and diſpenſations are—and how, or when, or where they will be recovered by them, no body knows, not can tell a ſyllable about them. It is the blind lead the blind in this dark way; and no deiſtical, yea atheiſtical leap was ever more abſolutely in the dark. Could Paul pour ſuch contempt upon the glorious goſpel, ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> ſuperſede the neceſſity, annul the energy, and counteract the efficacy of it; as to encourage the rebellious, they may ſafely neglect the great ſalvation; for future means and diſpenſations yet more effectual that await them, and which enſure, their eſcape and recovery? Could he do it in the face of ſcores of as plain texts, as ever he wrote? It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, it is horridly evil. But what I deſign chiefly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark on, is his manner of making out his "miſtery" of the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of all men, from theſe texts. He firſt ſuppoſes, all the lapſed race are included in "the things in heaven and upon earth," who are to be reconciled, recovered and reduced to a regular, well ſubordinated whole. Whereas, all that have died in their ſins, all the diſobedient ſpirits in the infernal priſon; all the conſigned to the future puniſhment in the great day, are as abſolutely excluded, in the diction of the texts, as the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan creed, is. He then improves this, as a key to the after deſcriptions of this miſtery. Whereas, theſe after deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are deſigned illuſtrations of that, and ſo are in truth the true key of the conſtruction of it. The free incorporation of believing jews and gentiles into the church and body of Chriſt, is ſo evident, in ſeveral of the deſcriptions of this miſtery as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied: but he adds "the ultimate intention is, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction or reſtoration of the whole;" whereas, it is clearly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the texts, nor is there a ſingle illuſtration in either epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:019737_0226_0FACA7EEE9277A08"/>
that gives any countenance to it. In moſt of theſe illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting texts, believers are ſo pointed out, that he can argue with plauſibility, but from one or two of them, where they are yet manifeſtly intended. His principal text is, Eph. 3.6. "that the Gentiles ſhould be fellow-heirs, and of the ſame body, and partakers of his promiſe in Chriſt, by the goſpel." He conſtrues it, jews and gentiles, mankind univerſally, were fellow-heirs, ſo united together as to make one and the ſame body, and copar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tners in eternal life, which, in Jeſus Chriſt, is the great promiſe of the goſpel," p. 158. Believing jews and gentiles, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly intended here, as well as every where elſe, as fellow heirs of the promiſe in Chriſt." Paul could not intend the wicked that die in their ſins; for he tells us expreſsly "they have no inheritance in the kingdom of God." He could not mean thoſe who died in their ſins before the goſpel, nor thoſe who reject the goſpel, nor his unreconciled final enemies, whom he expects to be ſaved by other and more effectual means and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations than the goſpel; for it is expreſs in this text, "theſe jews and gentiles become fellow heirs, "by the goſpel." Theſe exceptions exclude no ſmall part of mankind. Again, the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous Gentiles muſt be excluded, for Paul moſt expreſsly excludes them this fellow-heirſhip. In the 2d cha. v. 12. he deſcribes them, as "without Chriſt, being aliens from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth of Iſrael, and ſtrangers from the covenants of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, having no hope, and without God in the world." He could not in the compaſs of ſixteen verſes, ſet up ſuch a ſtaring contradiction, as to ſay, theſe excluded aliens, were all fellow-heirs of the goſpel promiſe of eternal life: nor could he intend the unbelieving jews whom he repreſents in the 9th, 10th and 11th chapters to the Romans, as cut off by unbelief, and will remain cut off from joint heirſhip, till graffed in again, by faith. Again, Paul could not ſo palpably contradict the apoſtolic commiſſion, as to teach this joint heirſhip, of all mankind: for by this commiſſion, neither jew nor gentile could have heir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and partnerſhip in the privileges of the kingdom of God in this world, unleſs, they believed and were baptiſed: nor be ſaved but by faith in Chriſt. Again, this apoſtle teaches us the inheritance is by promiſe, that the promiſe is to the believing ſeed, excluſively: that juſtification, adoption and heirſhip to
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:019737_0227_0FACA7EFA1FD37B8"/>
the goſpel promiſes, are all by faith. He labours the ſubject in the four firſt chapters to the Romans, and ſecond and third to the Galatians. It is impoſſible, that in contradiction to all this, he ſhould here aſſert that all the unbelieving of mankind univerſally, are joint partners in the great promiſe of the goſpel, which he every where elſe appropriates to believers. Further, that which alone is ſufficient to decide it, that he here intends believing jews and gentiles as fellow heirs, is this; that he is treating of this ſubject, this miſtery (and not of the reſtoration of all men) in both the foregoing chapters. We have ſhewn it in the firſt, and the ſecond is in the ſame ſtrain, throughout. It is thoſe "once dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, now quickened," v. 1. "quickened together with Chriſt and ſaved by grace," v. 5. "raiſed up together and made to ſit together in heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus," v. 6. "ſaved by grace, through faith," not unbelievers, v. 8. who are God's workmanſhip created in Chriſt to good works, v. 10. "who were in time paſſed gentiles" (not chriſtians) and "at that time were aliens, ſtrangers to the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants of promiſe, without God, Chriſt, and hope," v. 11, 12. "but now in Chriſt Jeſus (being believing chriſtians) are bro't nigh, by the blood of Chriſt," v. 13. "for he is our peace," (meaning believing jews and gentiles) "to make in himſelf of twain, one new man, ſo making peace, that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the croſs," v. 14, 15, 16. and "have both acceſs by one ſpirit unto the Father," as his child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, v. 18. "now therefore" (their ſtate being changed from idolatrous Gentiles into believing Chriſtians) "they are no more ſtrangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens with the ſaints, and of the houſhold of God," v. 19. "built upon the foundation of the apoſtles and prophets, Jeſus Chriſt the chief corner-ſtone," "an habitation of God through the Spirit," v. 20, 22. which ſurely cannot agree to the infidel world. Now, the apoſtle is purſuing the ſame ſubject, in this third chapter, as, in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going ones, illuſtrating the miſtery of the incorporation of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving jews and gentiles into one body in Chriſt. And un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, it is theſe that are intended as "fellow-heirs and of the ſame body" in this diſputed text. Faith and heirſhip to the promiſes, are connected together in the goſpel conſtitution, and every where in Paul's writings. Therefore to extend the great
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:019737_0228_0FACA7F061E060E8"/>
promiſe of the goſpel to all the unbelieving, ungodly world, is moſt manifeſtly to disjoin what God hath joined together, in a matter of higheſt importance to the kingdom of God, and to the ſouls of men. I might ſubjoin to all this, the ſuppoſition of ſuch a promiſe of joint heirſhip and fellowſhip granted to all ſaints in heaven and earth, and to all the reprobate ſons of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs in earth and hell, is as irrational and miſchievous, as it is unſcriptural. Promiſes and rewards beſtowed purſuant to them, are wiſely deſigned to be the great ſupports of government, to inforce ſubjection and obedience: but a promiſe of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion could do no good, but is pregnant with infinite miſchiefs. To ſet up the promiſe in oppoſition to, and in ſubverſion of the threatnings and ſtatutes of diſheriſon, to final enemies, is not to ſupport, but to deſtroy government. Such a promiſe, could be no inſtrument of wiſe, holy, righteous and good government, but deſtruction to it. Where is the inducement to faith, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, to be good chriſtians, dutiful to God and man; if the great promiſe of the goſpel makes all the diſobedient joint heirs of eternal life, with the ſaints of God? What is it but deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the character of the infinitely perfect being, by exhibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him as having no regard to ſin and holineſs, or to characters formed by the one or the other; nor to the honour of his adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble majeſty, authority, law, goſpel and government, in his grant of a promiſcuous promiſe of eternal life to all his rebellious ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, as copartners with the obedient? a tenet as oppoſite to the tenor of Paul's writings, and of all revelation, as any that can be named. The tempter taught man to rebel againſt the term of life, appointed to him of God, with this encouragement, "for God doth know that ye ſhall be as gods." But to carry the doctrine farther, that all men univerſally, who rebel againſt the goſpel terms of life and mercy in this ſtate, "are fellow heirs and copartners of eternal life, by the great promiſe of the goſpel," ſeems the ſummit of infatuation. Another text is, Paul's commiſſion, "and to make all men ſee, what is "the fellowſhip" of the miſtery, which from the beginning of the world, hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jeſus Chriſt," v. 9th. The reaſons already given evince "the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the miſtery" in this text, means, "the joint heirſhip, and fellowſhip of believing jews and gentiles in the church of
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:019737_0229_0FACA7F120C78290"/>
God and body of Chriſt:" and this is further confirmed by the text immediately following: "to the intent that "now" unto principalities and powers in heavenly places, might be known "by the church" the manifold wiſdom of God." The church of theſe collected believers muſt be here intended, by which, theſe principalities, &amp;c. ſhould now ſee, the manifold wiſdom of God, for he had ſpoken of none other; and therefore this is certainly the fellowſhip of the miſtery in the foregoing verſe. According to this author, "Paul was to make all men, the whole world of men" to ſee "their fellowſhip," as fellow-heirs, one miſtical body, and partners in common of eternal life, the great thing promiſed, in the goſpel, p. 158, 9. But Paul could not in his ſenſe, make all men ſee this miſtery, by preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the gentiles, in his day: he could not make all the mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions who died before he was born, nor all the millions then living, to whom he never preached, "to ſee it." Why doth he annex the pronoun "their" fellowſhip to this all men? it is not inſerted in the text, nor within the meaning of the apoſtle.

                     </gap>gues it p. 159, 160. How doth this prove, Chriſt will ſave all the wicked, and not condemn them to everlaſting puniſhment, as he hath aſſured us he will? He argues "if God created all men by Chriſt, we may eaſily collect how he comes to be their common Father, Mal. 11.10. and if their Father, how they are his children; and if they are children, how fit and reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it is that they ſhould be fellow-heirs to, and joint partners in, that happy ſtate which he hath purpoſed ſhould take place, when he has gathered all things into one, under the agency of that ſame Jeſus Chriſt, by whom he created them all. This ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument concludes as ſtrongly for the joint partnerſhip of the devil and his angels, as for mankind; for they were all created by Chriſt, "and without him was not any thing made which is made." To argue, from the foot of creation, to what is wiſe and reaſonable in the diſpenſation and final retribution of an infinitely wiſe, righteous and good government; and ſo, from the relation of creatures as ſuch, to creatures in rebellion, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce one and the ſame concluſion, appears ſo extremely looſe as to carry no conviction in it. If the ratio of heirſhip, and of joint partnerſhip in eternal life, in fact, be grounded on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted relation of creatures, in creation; then wiſe, rational, good moral government, a ſtate of probation, and characters formed in it for retribution, and all regard to them, are abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely excluded; and no rebellion can poſſibly defeat the inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feaſible inheritance, on this ground. For the natural relation
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:019737_0231_0FACA7F2A2AC8A88"/>
of creatures to their Creator, muſt eternally remain the ſame; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> their characters as they may, they are creatures ſtill. But theſe great excluded doctrines, are ſo interwoven throughout revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that we may as well give up the whole, as exclude them. —Again, this ſuppoſed reaſonableneſs of joint partnerſhip, on the ground of creation, excludes the goſpel conſtitution out of view. All regard to the terms of life and death in it, are plainly excluded in ſuch a joint partnerſhip. Did Paul, that affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate lover, preacher and defender of the goſpel conſtitution, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend in this paſſage, ſo to exclude it out of view, and out of the world? Beſides, this grounded heirſhip, ſuppoſes mankind a race of unoffending creatures; whereas, the truth of fact is, the goſpel is a diſpenſation of ſovereign grace and mercy to ſinful man, "to ſinners, ungodly, and enemies; which cuts of all hope "of heirſhip" on the ground of creation: it opens the way of a moſt happy change from enemies, to become the reconciled friends, adopted children and heirs of God. The terms of heir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, life and death are fixed in it, and a compliance with them, inforced by the moſt exceeding great and precious promiſes, and terrible threatnings, conceivable by us: and with this view, the promiſes are all made, not to men as men, but to thoſe of a diſtinguiſhing character, formed in this ſtate. Now, if heirſhip be grounded on the natural relation of creatures, this whole ſcheme of adoption is ſet aſide; and the grand intention of the promiſes, to inforce the requiſitions of goſpel duty, and that the heirs be partakers of a divine nature, is ſuperſeded and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. In fine, Paul is very expreſs, in pointing out the goſpel method of adoption, of heirſhip and joint fellowſhip, in eternal life. "For ye are all" (whether jews or gentiles) "the children of God, by faith in Chriſt Jeſus," Gal. 3.26. Our Lord gave the charter of it, Joh. 1.12. "But to as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the ſons of God, even to them that believe on his name." And "the many that will be brought to glory" are all "the ſons of God" in this world, by regeneration, faith, adoption and divine invitation, as is evident from theſe texts compared: John 3.5. Heb. 2.10. Rom. 8.17. and Mat. 5.45 &amp; 48. their miſtery is plainly an antiſcriptural, deluding fancy.</p>
                  <p>The next produced text is, 1 Tim. 2.4. "Who will have
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:019737_0232_0FACA7F361600588"/>
all men to be ſaved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth." Upon which he argues, "if God is ſincerely willing and deſirous that all men ſhould be ſaved, they certainly ſhall be ſaved." He might as well argue, that all men do and ſhall come to the knowledge of the truth, and be ſanctified by it; which is equally the object of the divine will in the text, and Mr. White allows to be neceſſary to their ſalvation: but it is a certain fact, all men do not come to a ſanctifying knowledge of the truth in this ſtate; and as certain from the words of Chriſt, that the wicked will be excluded his kingdom and the means of it in the future world; and therefore, their ſalvation cannot be argued from, but is rather diſproved, by the declaration in this text. The plain meaning appears to be this, viz. "It is the will and good pleaſure of God, that all men without diſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inction be ſaved, who comply with the terms of the goſpel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation and conſtitution; and to this end he wills all ſorts and nations of men to come to the knowledge of the truth, that they may believe, repent and be ſaved. This conſtruction ſeems moſt obvious, and is beſt fitted for the good of men in a ſtate of probation, and to anſwer all the wiſe, great and good intentions of the divine government deſigned in it. This is a doctrine written as in capitals in the face of the goſpel procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation &amp; conſtitution: that was the burthen of Paul's preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; that runs through all his epiſtles, and he gives it to us more full and expreſs in a parallel paſſage, Rom. 10.11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17. "For the ſcripture ſaith, whoſoever believeth on him ſhall not be aſhamed. For there is no difference between the jew and the greek: for the ſame Lord over all, is rich unto all that call upon him. For whoſoever ſhall call on the name of the Lord, ſhall be ſaved. How then ſhall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how ſhall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how ſhall they hear without a preacher? and how ſhall they preach except they be ſent."—"So then, faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God;" and ſalvation by faith. That Paul intends, it is the will of God that all ſorts of men without diſtinction be ſaved, in the way of the goſpel conſtitution, ſeems evident by his adding, "and come to the knowledge of the truth" (i.e.) that they might be ſanctified by faith in Chriſt, and ſaved in
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:019737_0233_0FACA7F421B14A38"/>
the way of this divine conſtitution. This clauſe has no force, as applied to the ſuppoſed ſalvation of the wicked, in the future world: for if they are to be ſaved in future diſpenſations, and by means more effectual than the goſpel, (heaven forgive the blaſphemy) their coming to the knowledge of the truth under this diſpenſation, hath no ſort of connexion, with that extra mode of ſalvation. Paul could not intend it. In a word, the whole context is taken up with chriſtian duty in the preſent ſtate, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the moſt diſtant hint of future means, diſpenſations, or a poſſibility of ſalvation to any that periſh. And therefore there is not a ſhadow of evidence of their doctrine in the text and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text. To return to this author: he ſays, p. 163. "It is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, the apoſtle is here ſpeaking of all ranks and ſorts of men, and not of all individuals." To remove which he introduces the whole paragraph. "I exhort therefore, that firſt of all, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, prayers, interceſſions, and giving of thanks be made for all men; for kings, and for all in authority: that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godlineſs and honeſty: for this is good and acceptable in the ſight of God our Saviour: who will have all men to be ſaved, and to come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth. For there is one God, and one Mediator between God and men, the man Chriſt Jeſus; who gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a ranſom for all, to be teſtified in due time." He ſays, it is paſt diſpute all men individually are here deſigned, for two reaſons: 1. "God's willingneſs that all men ſhould be ſaved, is brought in as an argument to enforce the duty of praying for all men:" "conſequently, we muſt underſtand, by all men, the ſame perſons in the motive, that are intended in the duty." And then aſſumes, "Now, all men univerſally are the object of the duty here enjoined. It is for all men without exception we are exhorted to pray: and therefore theſe all men, he wills to be ſaved." We deny his aſſumption and conſequence both, we are not to pray for all men without exception in his ſenſe; nor doth the apoſtle mean this; but we are limited to men, who are ſubjects of mercy, and under a diſpenſation of mercy. St. John gives us one exception, expreſsly, "thoſe that ſin, the ſin unto death, 1 Joh. 5.16. The proteſtant world give us ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, very juſt and great exception, not to pray for the dead. This exception, includes many millions of mankind, who have
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:019737_0234_0FACA7F4E1604020"/>
died from the beginning the world, to this day. We have no duty to this numerous all men, that have been before us, of prayer or any thing elſe. Thoſe that have died in their ſins, cannot be ſaved in the day of the Lord; for "their reſurrection will be to damnation." Which ſhuts the door of prayer and hope. Nor do our opponents pray for the "all men" that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in the flood—in Sodom and Ghomorrha—the Iſraelites that periſhed in the wilderneſs—the old Babylonians and others who periſhed in wrath. Should they publickly pray for theſe "all men," it is preſumed, no congregation of judicious chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians would hear them, a ſecond time. Their own conduct then condemns their conſtruction, and confutes their concluſion. Take the illuſtrating inſtance given us in this paragraph; we are certainly to pray for our preſent, living rulers, only. We are not to pray for all the wicked kings, governors and rulers which have been before us, for cruel Pharoahs, blood-thirſty Herods, Neroes, &amp;c. "that we might live peaceable and godly lives under them:" nor are "we to give thanks" for theſe "all men:" no, they were curſes to the world, while they lived— it was a mercy to mankind when they were taken away; and we have nothing to do with them. So that his aſſumption and concluſion both fail him, in his way of arguing. To ſettle the term "all men" yet more clearly, it may not be improper to note, we have many other duties to "all men" beſides praying for them; but in no inſtance is it to be taken in the univerſal ſenſe, they would fix upon it. Thus, we are required, "to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide things honeſt in the ſight of "all men," and "to live peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably with "all men," <note n="§" place="bottom">Rom. 12.17, 18.</note> "to do good to all men, eſpecially to the houſhold of faith;" <note n="‡" place="bottom">Gal. 6.10.</note> "to let our moderation be known to all men;" <note n="‖" place="bottom">Phil. 4.5.</note> "to be patient to all men, and follow that which is good to all men;" <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Theſ. 5.14.15.</note> "to be gentle to all men;" <note n="†" place="bottom">2 Tim. 2.24.</note> "to ſhew meekneſs to all men;" <note n="‖‖" place="bottom">Tit. 3.2.</note> "to follow peace with all men;" <note n="††" place="bottom">Heb. 12.14.</note> and "to honour all men." <note n="¶" place="bottom">1 Pet. 2.17.</note> "All men" in theſe texts, can't poſſibly mean all mankind, from the beginning to the end of the world. Such a conſtruction would be the groſſeſt abſurdity, becauſe the whole ſcheme of chriſtian duties to all men, in that way, would be naturally impoſſible to be performed. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:019737_0235_0FACA7F5A0A58F28"/>
meaning is, "all men" without diſtinction or exception, with whom we are converſant. This muſt be our chriſtian de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment towards them, whether they be good or evil, whether jew or greek, chriſtian or infidel. Now, in a ſimilar limited ſenſe, is this duty of prayer; it is for all men living under the preſent diſpenſation of mercy; and for poſterity. Nor, will it follow from our duty to pray for all men, that all ſhall be ſaved. The pſalmiſt prayed for his enemies; it availed not for them, but returned into his own boſom. But a deciſive argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſalvation of all men may be formed on this ground. Thus, our Saviour never prayed for thoſe who die in their ſins, nor for final unbelievers; nor hath taught us to pray for them: therefore they are not the ſubjects of mercy, nor objects of prayer and hope; if they were, they would be prayed for; and conſequently, they will never be ſaved. A 2d reaſon given, why God deſires the ſalvation of all men is, becauſe "there is one God, and one Mediator between God and men, the man Chriſt Jeſus." Now, it is ſaid, this is a reaſon that extends to all men equally, and without exception." Can this be the reaſon why God wills the ſalvation of men, when his will and purpoſe to ſave men, in nature, preceeds the providing a Modiator? Can the effect be before the cauſe, and the ground and reaſon of it? God has opened a way of ſalvation for all ſorts and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men, upon the ſame terms. All who comply with them, without diſtinction, ſhall be ſaved. He wills that all ſorts and nations of men be taught and prayed for, that they may come to the knowledge and obedience of the truth, that they may be ſaved. The meaning is exceedingly obvious: he ſays, the juſt and full ſenſe, may be collected from Rom. 3.29, 30. "Is he a God of the jews, only? Is he not of the gentiles alſo? yes, of the gentiles alſo; ſince it is one God that juſtifieth the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion by faith, and the uncircumciſion through faith." He ſays, "in like manner we may argue here, Is he the God of a ſmall portion of mankind only? is he not the God and Father of all men? ſurely he is; and equally willing to juſtify them all through "the faith of the goſpel." What then? the apoſtle's ſtating, and his own arguing, leaves all final unbelievers to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, notwithſtanding God's willingneſs to ſave all believers of every nation, without diſtinction or exception. It is directly

againſt his deſigned concluſion that unbelievers ſhould be ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alſo. His own arguing limits it to "faith in the goſpel." How doth this prove they can be ſaved without f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> their whole ſcheme of future ſalvation, abſolutely excluded, juſt as it doth here. The other branch of the reaſon is, there is one Mediator between God and men, the man Chriſt Jeſus, "equally extends to all men." That is, he equally mediates for jew and gentile, all ſorts of men, that whoſoever believes in him ſhall be ſaved. But this notwithſtanding, "whoſoever believeth not ſhall be damned." He ſays thoſe words, "who gave himſelf a ranſom for all, to be teſtified in due time," exceedingly favours his interpretation of v. 4th. So far from it, that it abſolutely confutes it, if we make the deſign for which it was provided and given, and the goſpel conſtitution founded on it, the key of conſtruction to aſcertain the meaning of it. For it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided and given of the Father, "that whoſoever believeth on him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life," Joh. 3.16. and Chriſt himſelf gave the ranſom for all, to ſanctify and purify to himſelf, a peculiar people out of all the nations of the earth," as Tit. 2.14. and Rev. 7.9, 10. and by the goſpel conſtitution founded on it. "Faith in Chriſt always was, now is, and always will be the only way of life, for ſinful man." Now, by this key of conſtruction, it is evident, "God wills the ſalvation of all men" in the way of this divine conſtitution, only,—and "Chriſt gave the ranſom for all," to purchaſe and ſecure final ſalvation to all the believing and ſanctified of all nations with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſtinction or exception. But unbelievers will be excluded the final reſt of the people of God—the death of Chriſt will profit them nothing, who make it vain—and to thoſe who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject this ranſom "there remains no more ſacrifice for ſin." Nor can the deſire and will of God, and the deſign of Chriſt be fruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated, as is ſtrangely imagined: for, as it is taught in the above texts, and throughout revelation, it will be accompliſhed in the ſalvation of all believers throughout all nations and generations. And the deſign, great glory and efficacy of this ranſom, will be illuſtriouſly atteſted to all ſorts of men, of all nations, in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gathering of the fullneſs of the jews &amp; gentiles, to be ingraffed

"by faith in him," as taught by Paul, Rom. 11. This author, argues ſtrenuouſly, from God's willing and deſiring the ſalvation of all men, to the certainty of it, p. 166, 7. "Infinite wiſdom, excited by infinite benevolence, and accompanied with infinite power, is able to deviſe and execute a ſcheme of ſalvation for all men, conſiſtent with their liberty, as moral agents." (But is it poſſible for God to lie? to receive thoſe into his reſt, whom he hath excluded by his oath? to admit thoſe to life, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit his kingdom, whom he hath expreſsly declared "ſhall not ſee life," and again and again, "that they ſhall not inherit his kingdom.") He goes on, if he deſires they ſhould be ſaved, it is conſtructively the ſame thing "as if it had been ſaid, he would ſave them, in event and fact:" for if he is able and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of it, he will uſe the means, that ſhall be effectual to it. This is the ſubſtance of the argument. To which, I reply.— God hath revealed his willingneſs to ſave all men, and hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly revealed the conſtitution and terms, by which, and by which only, he will ſave all men that are ſaved. The argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then amounts to this: if he wills to ſave men by the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel conſtitution, he wills likewiſe to ſave them without, and againſt it. That is, he wills to honour it, and to ſupport his authority and government, and illuſtrate his moral perfections in higheſt glory, in exalting believers to everlaſting happineſs, by it: and yet he wills to diſhonour it, to ſet it aſide, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice the infinitely important intentions to be anſwered by it; by ſaving all final unbelievers in ſome other way, which neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily ſubverts it. The abſurdity of which is obvious, at firſt ſight. Is there any force in arguing, becauſe he will ſave men in his appointed way, therefore he will ſave them out of it? the ſuppoſition is great preſumption, and reflects great diſhonor upon the wiſdom, government, truth and immutability of God. To this preſumption, the devil by an abuſe of ſcripture tempted our Saviour to caſt himſelf down from the pinnacle of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, if he was the Son of God: "for it is written, he ſhall give his angels charge concerning thee, and in their hands they ſhall bear thee up, leaſt at any time thou daſh thy foot againſt a ſtone," Mat. 4.6. The ſnare lay in this, he left out "in all thy ways," which is expreſsly inſerted in the text quoted, Pſal. 91.11. Which was deſigned to guard againſt all preſumption of ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:019737_0238_0FACA7F7E136D690"/>
and ſalvation, out of God's way. Had he inforced the temptation with "infinite wiſdom excited by infinite benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and accompanied with infinite power, is able to contrive and execute a ſcheme to ſave him, as well out, as in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed way; it would have availed nothing: he knew it hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid preſumption; and repels it with, "it is written, thou ſhalt not tempt the Lord thy God," v. 7. A clear inſtruction, that ſecurity and ſalvation may not be expected out of God's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed way; whatever may be urged, from the perfections, or word of God, to infer it. And the uſe of goſpel appointed means, in order to obtain ſalvation, is ſo neceſſary, that the Dr. is full and expreſs, "nor is there ground of hope, in the revelations of God to be ſaved, any other way," Seaſ. Thoughts, p. 265. Can there be a more prepoſterous way of reaſoning, than from the perfections of God, againſt his mind deciſively revealed upon the ſame matter, in a written conſtitution; ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the only way of life fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>PROPOSITION V. "As a mean in order to men's being made meet for ſalvation, God, by Jeſus Chriſt, will ſooner or later, in this ſtate or another, reduce them all u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thus much, he thinks, the obvious import of thoſe texts, which ſpeak of "the deſtruction of ſin," "taking way the ſins of men," "and ſaving them from their ſins, as the great deſign of the mediatorial miſſion Chriſt in the world," p. 171. It is true theſe texts teach us, how Chriſt will execute his work of ſaving men, even all men in this world, that will be finally ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, viz. by "ſaving them from their ſins." But in his ſecond coming, he will come to deſtroy ſin and the workers of iniquity another way, which will not infer their ſalvation, but deſtruction. He cites 1 Joh. 3.8. "For this purpoſe, was the Son of God manifeſted, that he might deſtroy the works of the devil," "that is, vice and wickedneſs." As Chriſt was manifeſt to ſave men in this way, ſo it is certain he will in fact, deſtroy the power of
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:019737_0239_0FACA7F8A17C4400"/>
ſin and wickedneſs in all whom he ſaves; conſequently all who go on impenitently in the ſervice of ſin and ſatan, cannot be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. And v. 4. "who was manifeſted to take away our ſins; the ſins of all who believe in him; and he certainly will do it." Joh. 1.29. "Behold the Lamb of God, who taketh away the ſins of the world." He ſo takes away the ſin of the world, that all men without diſtinction or exception, who believe in him, ſhall have the power and guilt of their ſins taken away. The name Jeſus is given to him, Mat. 1. 21. "becauſe he ſhall ſave his people from their ſins." Conſequently, his enemies who will not have him to rule over them, are not his people, and will not be ſaved by him: for all his willing people whom he ſaves with eternal ſalvation, he ſaves from their ſins in this world, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the grand intention of his office as a Saviour, and of his miſſion into the world. Theſe texts, taken in their true ſenſe and connexion, in the goſpel conſtitution, are ſo far from teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſalvation of all men, that they ſtrongly infer the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Neither is there a ſhadow of evidence in them, that it was the deſign of Chriſt's manifeſtation, to deſtroy ſin univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally in all men; but only, in them who become his willing people, and are ſaved in this inſtituted way: as is illuſtrated in truth and fact, throughout his diſpenſation.</p>
                  <p>His firſt main proof of his propoſition is, Pſal. 8.5, 6. as explained and argued from Heb. 11.6—9. "Thou madeſt him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedſt him with glory and honour, and didſt ſet him over the work of thy hands: thou haſt put all things in ſubjection under his feet." Theſe words he ſays are applied, "tending to prove the ſuperiority of Chriſt over the angels." (But this is a wrong key to conſtruct the paſſage by, ſo as to comport with the principal deſign of it.) For having ſaid, v. 5th, "unto the angels hath he not put in ſubjection the world to come:" he then introduces this paſſage, and having mentioned thoſe words "thou haſt put all things in ſubjection under his feet," he goes on and argues as 8th and 9th verſes, "for in that he put all in ſubjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him. But now we ſee not yet all things put under him: but we ſee Jeſus, who was made a little lower than the angels, for the ſuffering of death, crowned with glory and "honour, that he by the grace of
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:019737_0240_0FACA7F961B80CB0"/>
God ſhould taſte death for every man." He ſays, the word "all things" muſt be taken in the greateſt latitude, (God only excepted) and argues, "if nothing be left unſubjected by him, then the time muſt come when ſin will be ſubjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him. Now ſin can be ſubjected in no way, he tells us, but by effecting ſuch a change in ſinners as to make them Chriſt's willing and obedient people," p. 179. But this is ſaid without proof, that it may not be ſubjected another way, in the ſenſe of this text. He further argues, "if all things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception ſhall be ſubjected to Chriſt; then the time muſt come, when there ſhall be no rebels among the ſons of Adam, no enemies againſt the moral government of God." And he might as well have applied it to the devil and his angels, for they are all ſubjected to Chriſt, as well as final enemies of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and in the ſame ſenſe. "For, he ſays, there is no way of reducing rebels, ſo as to deſtroy their character as ſuch, but by making them willing ſubjects," p. 183. But where doth he find that the character of final enemies will ever be deſtroyed? the text ſays nothing of it, nor is there a hint of it, in all reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. Why may not rebels againſt God be reduced, in the way of governmental judicial ſubjection, without their charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters being deſtroyed? It is a known fact all over the world, that rebels and enemies are reduced and ſubjected to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul and honour of authority, law and government, among men, when cut off by the hand of public juſtice. And in many retributive providences, God hath thus reduced and ſubjected them, by his more immediate hand. He concludes, if any ſuſpect he lays too great ſtreſs upon the word "all things," he truſts they will acquit him and lay the blame upon the apoſtle, "for he is ſure, the argument concludes thus much, if it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes any thing at all." I moſt heartily acquit the apoſtle, for I cannot perceive he has given any occaſion or countenance to ſuch extravagant reaſoning. And if we can rectify his miſtaken key, and wrong ſenſe of the word "ſubjection" perhaps every one will ſee where the blame ought to lay. The true key is found in the foregoing verſes of a context: "Therefore we ought to give the more earneſt heed to the things which we have heard, leſt at any time we ſhould let them ſlip. For if the word ſpoken by angels was ſtedfaſt, and every tranſgreſſion and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:019737_0241_0FACA7FA21B9ED28"/>
received a juſt recompence of reward; how ſhall we eſcape if we neglect to great ſalvation, which at the firſt began to be ſpoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him; God alſo bearing them witneſs, both with ſigns and wonders, and with diverſe miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, according to his own will," v. 1, 2, 3, 4. then he intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces the paragraph in diſpute, in an argumentative way and connexion, to inforce the foregoing admonition and warning "of the impoſſibility of an eſcape, to the neglectors of this great ſalvation." "For unto the angels he hath not put in ſubjection the world to come, whereof we ſpeak;" v. 5. for if it was ſo, men might imagine an eſcape poſſible; but all poſſibility of it is excluded—for the world to come, as well as this world and all things in them, are put in ſubjection, into the abſolute diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal the adorable Jeſus, in the throne of God; to this very end, that all things ſhould now be regulated and governed by him, and all moral created beings in both worlds ſhould be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by his righteous ſentence in a ſtate of final retribution, for eternity: and the ſentence to the righteous and wicked of mankind will be according to the conſtitution of this goſpel, ſo gloriouſly introduced, and atteſted by God. How then an final neglectors of this ſalvation eſcape? this univerſal ſubjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we are taught by prophetic inſpiration in the text cited. Neither is it any objection, or encouragement to the diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, that we do not now ſee all things ſo ſubjected to him and by him; ſince we ſee that which is a certain proof of it. For we ſee Jeſus, who was made a little lower than the angels, for the ſuffering of death, now in his ſtate of exaltation "crowned with glory and honour" inveſted with the unlimited power of domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and judgment over both worlds; to ſave his people, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due his enemies, and regulate and ripen all things for the final ſettlement of the kingdom of God and all its concerns according to this goſpel. And he is now executing the office of a Saviour, ſanctifying and ſaving his people from their ſins, bringing many even all that are the ſons of God in this world, to glory, as v. 10th. And when he hath compleated this glorious work, he will execute the office of judge, and put down all enemies under his feet by ſentence and execution: whence it will be impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the neglectors of ſo great ſalvation can eſcape. This I
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:019737_0242_0FACA7FAE1CFE240"/>
conceive to be the thing intended, by the apoſtle. The word here uſed to "ſubject," is the ſame the apoſtle uſes, Rom. 8.20. where this author ſays, a ſubjection, by judicial ſentence, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. Here, in this paſſage, as it refers to final enemies, it muſt undoubtedly intend a governmental, judicial ſubjection by ſentence and execution. For as the connexion ſhews us, it is deſigned, to inforce the warning that impenitent neglectors cannot eſcape, it cannot have any force to his purpoſe, in any other ſenſe: and it muſt certainly be taken in that ſenſe, which will comport with his deſign, and not in that which will not. His argumentation is clear and ſtrong, in our conſtruction. If the word, of the conſtitution introduced by angels was ſo ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, that the diſobedient could not eſcape—ſurely, the finally diſobedient to the goſpel conſtitution cannot eſcape—inaſmuch as it was ſo much more gloriouſly introduced by the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſo extraordinarily atteſted by God: and eſpecially, ſince the ſame Lord who introduced it, and whoſe honour is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely concerned in the ſupport of it, is now crowned with glory and honour, with unlimited power of dominion and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for this grand purpoſe of ſubjecting the whole moral creation in a righteous ſtate of final retribution, for eternity, in the world to come: and he will certainly adjudge the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to everlaſting life, and the wicked to everlaſting puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, according to the word and conſtitution of this goſpel. No arrangement of argument can conclude and confirm the impoſſibility of their eſcape, with ſtronger force; and no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment more alarming, to inforce the admonition and warning. Let us now ſee the force of this other conſtruction. To the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larming queſtion, how ſhall we eſcape, if we neglect ſo great ſalvation? The anſwer it ſeems, is very eaſy—the time muſt come, when ſin will be ſubjected, when the ſecond death ſhall be deſtroyed, and when their characters as rebels ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, by their becoming a willing and obedient people, and then they ſhall all univerſally eſcape. And the argument of the apoſtle proves all this, if it proves any thing at all. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, is a direct ſubverſion of the apoſtle's deſign: it ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely deſtroys his argument, as addreſſed to inforce the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going admonition and warning, which it renders illuſive and vain: and it renders the argumentation, in its connexion with
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:019737_0243_0FACA7FBA0819050"/>
the foregoing verſes, palpably abſurd, by ſuch a total deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the intention, for which it is introduced. The chief thing in ſupport of it is this, he ſays, "in truth this is the only ſubjection, it can reaſonably be ſuppoſed he ſhould be advanced to regal dignity and power, at God's right hand in heaven, that he might accompliſh. Sinful men were abſolutely before in ſubjection to the kingdom of God's power, as being unable to make the leaſt reſiſtance to any of its diſplays, however fatal they might be in their tendency. There was no need therefore of Chriſt's exaltation in order to force ſinful men to ſuch a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection as this," p. 181, 2. In reply, I would ſay, the truth is, that God's moral kingdom and government of the moral world, is very different from that of power, exerciſed over the material and unintelligent part of the creation. This moral kingdom is adminiſtred by way of wiſe, righteous conſtitution, laws and inſtitutions, and followed with final retribution. The obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the ſubjects of it, is inforced by ſuitable rewards and puniſhments: and theſe to be rendered to all according to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and deſerts, in the appointed time of the ſettlement of this kingdom, for eternity. Now, the adminiſtration of this kingdom, of all the concerns, and over all the ſubjects of it, in this world and world to come, is put into the hands of Chriſt: all things in this kingdom are put in ſubjection under his feet, by an authoritative appointment; to regulate, govern and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally ſettle it, and the ſtates of all its ſubjects according to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and deſert; when ſin and ſinners will be deſervedly pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed; obedience and the obedient will be rewarded according to promiſe; all the friends of God will be exalted to everlaſting honour and happineſs; but all his enemies will be put down, "ſubjected," in eternal diſgrace and miſery: then will all things in truth and fact, in this governmental, retributive manner, be put in ſubjection to him, in the genuine ſenſe intended, in this diſputed paſſage. And how ſhall Chriſt execute this infinitely important truſt, in ſuch an arrangement and regulation of all things, in his preſent adminiſtration, and in the final ſettlement of this kingdom, as to illuſtrate all the excellencies, and anſwer all the intentions of an infinitely perfect government; but in a ſtate of exaltation at the right hand of God, inveſted with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited power of dominion and judgment? The ſimple ſtating
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:019737_0244_0FACA7FC608AEEC0"/>
of the genuine ſcripture doctrine in the outlines of it, is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to clear the ſub;ect of the objection, and ſuch kind of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baraſſing reaſonings. His next text is Phil. 2. 9, 10, 11th verſes, "Wherefore, God alſo hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: that at the name of Jeſus every knee ſhould bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue ſhould confeſs that Jeſus Chriſt is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. "He argues here as from the foregoing text, for a pious ſubjection, bowing and confeſſion, in all. He ſays, that this exaltation is, the reward of Chriſt's humiliation and death—and it is to univerſal dominion. Granted. And "it is that he might reduce all things univerſally under ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection; to the moral kingdom of God, which is now under his adminiſtration." This he judges the text teacheth. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not admit it in his ſenſe, but as we have before explained it, and obviated his conſtruction, that little needs to be here added. The truth is, he is exalted to ſupreme, unlimited dominion, to govern all things in infinite wiſdom; goodneſs and rectitude, during the probation of his moral ſubjects; to reduce to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and ſave a willing people, in completion of the deſign of his death; to controul the deſigns of all his enemies; to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the all-important deſigns of an infinitely perfect govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and finally to ſettle it in governmental order, in higheſt perfection and glory, in a ſtate of final retribution to all his ſubjects, according to their characters formed in this ſtate of trial: then all the pious will bow the knee, in pious, thankful acknowledgements; and then all his enemies will be conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to bow to his authority, and by the force of an ireſiſtible conviction to confeſs it is rightful, and his ſentence is righteous, to the honour of Chriſt the Judge; and to the to glory of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that appointed him. This conſtruction only naturally and forcibly introduces, the practical inſtruction and admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which immediately follows— "Wherefore work out your own ſalvation with fear and trembling," v. 12th. He objects, "there is no moral worth in ſuch a forced ſubjection," p. 190. The apoſtle ſays nothing of it, in that view. It will illuſtrate the glory of the divine moral character and government, and be an everlaſting ſupport of the divine authority; to the glory of
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:019737_0245_0FACA7FD25D6B8C8"/>
Chriſt and the Father: the end is anſwered. He argues, "ſo far as Chriſt is now in the execution of this power, it is the truth of fact, he is endeavouring to reduce mankind under o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, as faithful ſubject in the kingdom of God." This is a partial ſtating of the fact. It is true he is executing a glorious work of ſaving mercy to ſinful men in this world: in the completion of which an innumerable multitude out of all nations will be ſaved from the ſervitude of ſin and ſatan, be made his willing people, and will be eternally happy in and with the Lord. But this is not his whole work and deſign: he is now, in this world executing a work of vengeance upon his irreconcilable enemies: as is exemplified in the unparallel'd deſtruction executed upon the infidel jews: and alſo in his pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the viols of his wrath upon his wicked enemies in the ſeveral ages of the world, as ſet forth in the revelations of St. John. In both ways, he is now illuſtrating the wiſdom, power, mercy and righteouſneſs of the divine government, which will be perfectly diſplayed in the great day of retribution. But his chief argument is this, that this forced ſubjection and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion is not to be compared with that of the pious: and that this reward beſtowed upon Chriſt will be great or ſmall accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſenſe in which we underſtand this ſubmiſſion. If the whole race be reduced in a future mate, more glory will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to Chriſt and to the Father, and more good to men; and therefore his, is the moſt rational and glorious ſcheme. This is the purport of his reaſoning upon this text and elſewhere. To which I would reply: It is certain "tho' Iſrael be not gathered, Chriſt will be glorious in the eyes of the Lord," and in the eyes of angels, and will be eternally admired in all that believe.— The ſcripture no where repreſents, the whole race of men as to be recovered and given to Chriſt as his reward; but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is held forth in many texts. "He gave his life a ranſom for many," "and he ſhall juſtify many,"—" bring many ſons of God to glory." 'Tis not the whole world, but them that are given him out of the world "that are given of the Father, and all come to him," "believe in him," "that are called, according to his purpoſe—called, juſtified here and glorified hereafter;" and he is "the author of eternal ſalvation to all who obey him, and "will be admired and glorified in all who believe." This

is the conſtant doctrine of revelation. It is true, the greater the number that is ſanctified and ſaved out of this world, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er will be that part of Chriſt's reward. But this reaſoning can apply only to the recovered by his grace under the preſent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of his kingdom: and it may well be a ſtimulus to the moſt wiſe, wining, vigorous exertions to pluck ſinners as brands out of the burning; and in exciting them to faith, repentance, and goſpel holineſs, that they may be the ſanctified "jewels" of the Lord, "and a diadem" of glory in the hand of our God. But the ſcheme of the future reſtoration of the impenitent, hath no good in it to mankind; it tends only to blind and harden men to ruin, under a deluding expectation of more effectual means: and is full of diſhonour to the Father and Son, as hath already, and will be further ſhewn. At beſt, this is but a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial ſtating of the glorious reward of Chriſt's exaltation. The innumerable miriads of the redeemed by his blood, and ſaved by his power and grace, againſt the power of all enemies inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and external, of earth and hell, in whom he will be glorified in the great day, will be an eminent part of his glorious reward. But it is not the whole. The glorious power and exerciſe of his preſent ſupreme dominion, diſplaying his unbounded perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in the allwiſe government of all things—the adorations, ſubjection and ready obedience of all angels, principalities and powers to him, as his miniſtring ſpirits, together with the high honour of regulating and ſettling all the infinite concernments of God's kingdom, in higheſt perfection and glory for eternity in the great day, are eminent parts of the reward of his humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation and death: nor, is it in the power of all his enemies to exclude him his full reward; for they are all put into his hand and power: and it is his prerogative glory and an eminent part of his reward, to controul and defeat all their deſigns, and put them all in a governmental judicial ſubjection, under his feet. This final ſubjection of all enemies to him and by him, as righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Governour and Judge of the world, is as truly his reward as the ſalvation of his people: as ſuch it is repeatedly predicted and promiſed to him Pſalm 8th &amp; 110th, in the laſt paragraph we have conſidered, in the preſent text, in 1 Cor. 15th chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and many others. Now, while they argue for their future willing ſubjection, they are arguing againſt this predicted and
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:019737_0247_0FACA7FEA1548FF0"/>
promiſed reward of Chriſt, in their ſubdual in a judicial ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion: for there is but one promiſed ſubjection of final enemies; and if it be willing, it cannot be judicial: but we are aſſured it will be judicial, and will be effected in the laſt judgment: and it is the laſt grand act of his regal and judicial power, to put down all enemies in a judicial ſubjection to the law, authority, government and juſtice of the moſt high God; and the laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation to be made before he gives up the kingdom, as may yet more fully appear. And when Chriſt shall have compleated this moſt important work of the final regulation and arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all thingsin the kingdom of God in perfection, for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: that is, when vice and wickedness ſhall be ſubdued and put down by him, in eternal diſgrace, in the puniſhment inflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon the workers of iniquity; and piety and holineſs ſhall ſhine in its true excellence and importance, with eternal luſtre, in the rewards beſtowed on the rigteous: when all the friends of God ſhall be exalted in the higheſt honour and happineſs; and all his ungrateful enemies be ſubdued and put down in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal infamy; by a power indeed moſt glorious and irreſiſtible be their numbers as they may: and not only fo, but in ſuch a righteous retribution according to character, in which his ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable wiſdom, truth, goodneſs and righteoſneſs, and that of the divine government, ſhall ſhine forth with a clearneſs and ſtrength as the ſun in its meridian luſtre; ſo that all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the force of irreſiſtible conviction, ſhall confeſs his righteouſneſs, and him Lord of all, to the glory of the Father. Then, ſhall we ſee, ſomething of the greatness, glory and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſity of his reward—than which, taken in this comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſve view of it, I am perſuaded, neither men nor angels can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a greater poſſible to be given him of the Father, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion with the wiſe arrangements of his eternal kingdom. All reproaches will be ſilenced , nor will there be an atheiſt, deiſt, arian, or focinian in the univerſe. His adorable appearance will ſtrike their faſfe creed out of exiſtence: for he will appear in the full glory of his true character, "The great God our Saviour," Tit. 2. 13. and "every knee ſhall bow, and every tongue ſhall confeſs to Chriſt, to God that fits in the throne of' judgment, and hath ſworn to bring it to paſs, "Rom. 14. 1O, 11z. compared with Iſa. 45.23. and Rev. 20.12. We are told, there would
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:019737_0248_0FACA7FF610936E0"/>
be no difficulty of admitting this ſcheme of the next ſtate, a ſtate of diſcipline, and of the recovery of the finally diſobedient in it, which, it is ſaid, carries in it more good to mankind, and more honour to Chriſt and to the Father; were it not for the previouſly imbibed notion of the preſent ſtate only being inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the recovery of men, and thoſe who are not recovered now, muſt be miſerable in the next ſtate, a ſtate of endleſs tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, p. 191, 194. On which I would obſerve, God hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready formed and revealed the infinitely wiſe plan of his divine government, and it belongeth not to ſhort-ſighted mortals of yeſterday, to form and obtrude another upon mankind, in lieu of that. How came this previouſly imbibed doctrine, to be received by the jewiſh and firſt chriſtian church and their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired teachers, but by inſpiration from God? this is difficulty enough, to exclude his, and ſufficient reaſon for us, to receive this doctrine, ſo taught of God. His ſcheme is inconſiſtent with the plan of divine government, taught in ſcripture. It is excluded by the terms of ſalvation, the promiſes, the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and every part of the goſpel conſtitution: and it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by the doctrine of retribution, and of the laſt judgment every where taught, in revelation. Moreover, his ſcheme is abſurd to the reaſon of man, as well as abhorrent to the revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God. Two inſtances out of many, may ſerve as a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimen of it: one is, "that the future judgment is not final— that Chriſt will not unalterably fix the ſtates of good men or bad in it, but will have a great deal to do after it, to reduce all the condemned rebels of that day to a willing ſubjection to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine government," p. 208. Is it honourable to the infinitely wiſe Governor and Judge of the world, to repreſent him as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſuch an imperfect ſettlement of his kingdom, as to need another ſettlement, as much as ever; ſo that he muſt go on diſciplining the rebellious out-caſts for ages of ages, before he can compleat the ſettlement of it for eternity? to me, it reflects great diſhonour. The other inſtance, which hath a cloſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion with it, is, that Chriſt will never in fact, make a perfect ſettlement of his kingdom; nor give it up, nor put the ſaints in poſſeſſion of their eternal inheritance, nor God be all in all, 'till all the abandoned rebels of mankind are recovered to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and happineſs: ſo that their good diſpoſition and reſtored
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:019737_0249_0FACA800219D7BE8"/>
vertue is in fact, "the grand ſuſpending condition" on which the whole of theſe great events reſts; and without which, the whole muſt be eternally defeated. So he tells us, "when all things ſhall, in event, or fact, be reduced under ſubjection to him, (meaning the ſubjection above ſtated) then, and not till then, however long a ſpace of time it may require for its ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment; then ſhall the Son be ſubject, that God may be all in all," p. 200. Now, the ſcripture teaches, all Chriſt's works are perfect; that he finiſhed the work of his firſt coming, upon the croſs; that he will finiſh the work of his exaltation in his ſecond coming to judgment; and will then make the final ſettlement of his kingdom; put his ſaints in the poſſeſſion of their eternal inheritance in the kingdom of their Father; and in the laſt great act of his regal and judicial power, will put down all enemies by ſentence and execution—then give up the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and God be all in all. The ſaints of God in the various ages of the world, have lived and died in expectation of theſe great events, to take place in that day; which are infinitely the moſt important, that can take place in the univerſe. But ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the tenet we oppoſe, all expectation of it, in heaven and earth, will be fatally diſappointed. Neither God, nor Chriſt, nor angels or men, ſhall ſee any of theſe things true in event, in that all-important day. Is it honourable to Chriſt, to be prevented the final ſettlement of his kingdom? to ſupreme Jehovah, to be kept out of the final adminiſtration of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom? to the ſaints, to be kept out of their promiſed heavenly inheritance, in that day, and for ages of ages afterwards, all for the ſake of wicked enemies? What overwhelming diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the ſaints of God, if they fail of the heavenly inheritance in that day? But, ſtill more alarming, the before unknown danger, if their final poſſeſſion depends upon the forlorn hope, of the recovered vertue, of all the abandoned part of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? This inheritance of the ſaints, is, certainly connected with their faith, piety, enduring to the end, faithful to death, and with the purchaſe and promiſe of Chriſt, the promiſes, oath, truth and immutability of God, and the day appointed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it. Now is it wiſe, ſafe, honourable to have the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance taken off and removed from this ground, and put upon an eſſentially different iſſue, viz. the recovery of all the wicked
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:019737_0250_0FACA800E17BF1F8"/>
part of the creation, whether they ſhall ever, and at what time they ſhall enjoy it? when at the ſame time, their future reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very is in nature, an infinite improbability; and as the caſe is circumſtanced, a moral impoſſibility? Beſides, we are repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly admoniſhed, to ceaſe from man, not to put our truſt in man, and it is written "curſed is the man that truſteth in man, and maketh fleſh his arm." After all this, is this way of the curſe, the way to the heavenly inheritance? Is it credible and honourable to ſuppoſe, that all the hopes of all the ſaints, ſhould in fact be ſuſpended; and made to depend upon the courteſy, good diſpoſition, and recovered vertue of all their faithleſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate enemies, for their poſſeſſion of the heavenly inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance? Is this for the honour of God, of Chriſt, or for the good of mankind? Is this the way, for all iniquity to ſtop her mouth? for ſaints to be built up in faith, holineſs, and comfort to the kingdom of God? Is this, to encourage piety, vertue and all goodneſs, which is the true, great intereſt, glory and happineſs of mankind? In another view, can any thing be more degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the character of the infinitely wiſe God, than to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he "who puts no truſt in his ſaints," ſhould put ſuch an unbounded truſt in the greateſt knaves, in all the moſt faithleſs, finiſhed villains of earth and hell, as to make the inheritance of his ſaints, the fulfilment of his promiſes to Chriſt and to them, and all the concerns of his eternal kingdom, ultimately to reſt and depend on the will, power, good diſpoſition and recovered vertue of all theſe miſcreants? all to depend upon their reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered vertue; When? why, after their characters have been expoſed and ruined, in the great day: and after they have been hardening in puniſhment, a thouſand years, and for ages of ages afterwards. And how? without goſpel, without the grace of the ſpirit, or a ſingle privilege of the kingdom of Chriſt; without any means of recovery, but darkneſs and torment: for all beyond this, is the chimera of imagination only, and hath not a ſingle dictate of reaſon or revelation, to ſupport it. What a ſcheme of abſurdity, diſhonour and horror is this! In a word, what can be more diſhonourable and pernicious, than on the one hand, to exhibit the eternal concerns of the Creator, the Redeemer, and of all the ſaints of God, as depending upon the vileſt of ſinners and enemies, and upon their recovered vertue?
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:019737_0251_0FACA801A288AED8"/>
and on the other hand, to magnify the wicked, abandoned part of the creation into ſuch a vaſt importance and power, of doing great and eternal miſchief; as may on this plan be effected, only by their obſtinate wickedneſs? for if all depends on their reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered vertue and ſubjection; ſo that then, and not till then, theſe ſcenes of eternal importance ſhall all take place: it ſeems clearly to follow, that only by their obſtinate wickedneſs they may ruin this moral creation, defeat the ſaints of their eternal inheritance, and overthrow the eternal deſigns of the kingdom of Jehovah. Can a poſſibility of this be admitted? it ſurely cannot, any more than atheiſm itſelf. The ſcheme then is rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the foundation, and I know none to exceed it, in abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, miſchief and diſhonour. How vain and abſurd the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, that this is a ſcheme of greater good and honour, and adapted to convert deiſts?—The next text produced, is Iſa. 45.23, to the end; "Look unto me, and be ye ſaved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none elſe." "I have ſworn by myſelf, the word is gone out of my mouth in righteouſneſs, and ſhall not return, that unto me every knee ſhall bow, and every tongue ſhall ſwear," &amp;c. This paſſage we have before conſidered; and obſerved, as it belongs to the conſtitution of Chriſt's kingdom in this world, it will certainly have its accompliſhment, in the diſpenſation of it, or at the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſettlement of it. And we have ſhewn it will have a literal fulfilment, in the converſion of the jews and gentiles; and its final completion in the day of judgment: and it cannot go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond it. But this author ſays, tho' it will have an accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in that day, it is no argument it meant nothing more. He ſays, an inſtance parallel, and a deciſive illuſtration of it is found, Acts 2.28. where Peter applies the prophecy of Joel, "that God would pour out his Spirit upon all fleſh" to the out-pouring of the Spirit upon the apoſtles in the day of penti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſt." He argues this was one thing intended, but not all; there will be a more glorious out-pouring in time to come." Granted: but this makes nothing in favour of a future bowing, beyond the day of judgment: for this out-pouring of the Spirit will certainly have its full accompliſhment under Chriſt's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, in this world; and therefore is rather a deciſive illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration, that there will be no more ſubdual by grace, when this diſpenſation is cloſed, in the great day.</p>

                     <pb n="233" facs="unknown:019737_0252_0FACA80261025140"/>We proceed to 1 Cor. 15.24, 25, 26, 27, 28. "Then cometh the end, when he ſhall have delivered up (or ſhall deliver up, in the greek) the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he ſhall have put down all rule, and all authority and power: for he muſt reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet. The laſt enemy that ſhall be deſtroyed, is death. For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he ſaith all things are put under him, it is manifeſt that he is excepted, which did put all things under him; and when all things ſhall be ſubdued unto him, then ſhall the Son alſo himſelf be ſubject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all." This author profeſſedly lays the greateſt ſtreſs upon this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage: it was the key that opened to him his ſcheme, and he judges it ſufficient of itſelf to ſupport it, p. 197, 8. and yet he confeſſes, p. 201, 2. that he could not deduce it from this text, without the help of his conſtruction of Romans 5th chapter, which hath been ſufficiently confuted. We will examine it with attention, and ſee if his doctrine will ſtand upon this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. To me it appears, that here as uſual, he hath totally miſtaken the deſign of the apoſtle, and the true key of conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He ſays, p. 201. "that it is evident beyond controverſy that the apoſtle is ſpeaking of a univerſal reſurrection, of the whole race of Adam." Whereas it is evident, there is not a word of the reſurrection of the wicked, in the whole chapter; but it is wholly taken up in the deſcription of the importance, certainty; and glory of the reſurrection of the righteous only, with anſwering objections, &amp;c. The importance of the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection is argued, upon theſe two grand principles, viz. the whole doctrine of chriſtianity depends upon it, and the promiſed bleſſedneſs of the righteous, in particular; and the certainty of it is evinced by the reſurrection of Chriſt only. And the time, manner, importance and glory of the reſurrection of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, is illuſtrated by a particular deſcription. Every judicious reader may ſee this the contents of the chapter. Chriſtianity depends upon this doctrine, and the denial of the reſurrection is deſtruction to the whole doctrine of it, as is argued 13, 14, 15, 16 verſes, "but if there be no reſurrection of the dead, then is Chriſt not riſen: and if Chriſt be not riſen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith alſo is vain," &amp;c. The denial of it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:019737_0253_0FACA80320948BB0"/>
deſtruction to the chriſtian's faith, hope and promiſed bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs, as he proceeds to argue v. 17, 18, 19th. "and if Chriſt be not raiſed, your faith is vain, ye are yet in your ſins; then they alſo which are fallen aſleep in Chriſt, are periſhed. If in this life only we have hope in Chriſt, we are of all men moſt miſerable." But the whole is eſtabliſhed by the reſurrection of Chriſt alone; with which their reſurrection and bleſſedneſs is connected and moſt firmly eſtabliſhed, by goſpel conſtitution. This he argues, 20, 21, 22, 23d verſes. "But now is Chriſt riſen from the dead (not for himſelf alone, but for them that are his) and become the firſt fruits of them that ſlept." Who? them that ſlept in Chriſt, who otherwiſe would have periſhed, as v. 18. and ſo the firſt fruits to them, that his reſurrection is an earneſt of a like glorious reſurrection to them, wherein they will be faſhioned like unto his glory. "For ſince by man came death, by man alſo came the reſurrection of the dead," to them who have ſlept in Chriſt; it is to this immortality and glory. "For as in Adam all die, even ſo in Chriſt ſhall all (that are Chriſt's, for of them only is he ſpeaking) be made alive." But when? at his ſecond coming, as in the following words and paragraph. In what manner and order? "but every man in his own order: Chriſt the firſt fruits, afterwards they that are Chriſt's at his coming." All that will be raiſed to immortality and glory, will be raiſed at this revealed, appointed time: and the order of every man will be adjuſted by the goſpel doctrine of retribution, according to their eminence in piety and uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in this preſent world. As the apoſtle proceeds to explain and illuſtrate 40, 41, 42 verſes and onwards—"there are alſo celeſtial bodies, and bodies terreſtrial, but the glory of the cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtial is one, and the glory of the terreſtrial is another. There is one glory of the ſun, and another glory of the moon, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther glory of the ſtars; for one ſtar differeth from another in glory. So alſo is the reſurrection of the dead," in that day. The glorious qualities of theſe new raiſed bodies of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, cloſes his deſcription. This gives an eaſy and ſignificant ſenſe "of every man in his own order:" and we prefer the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, as his own expoſitor, much before this author. His tag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata, troops and companies, coming out of the place of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under their own ſtandards, are all abſolutely excluded.
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:019737_0254_0FACA803E7198580"/>
There is no occaſion, no place for them here, nor in all revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. We read of them no where but in this author, who brings gog and magog out of the place of torment, headed by the devil to inveſt the camp of God: which is all the tagmata of this kind we read of, which perhaps will be proved to be a ſpurious invention. From this view of the context, it is eaſy to ſee, there is not a word ſaid of the reſurrection of the wicked in it; nor, a word ſaid of a reſurrection to immortality and glory but in the ſecond coming of Chriſt, the time, expreſsly fixed for it. The whole context, and the connexion confirms the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction we have before given of this diſputed paſſage. To proceed. Were it a leſs ſenſible writer, I ſhould ſay, his whole reaſonings upon this paſſage, are ſophiſtical: they are founded in a petio principii, a meer begging of the queſtion. He takes every material article for granted, which cannot be granted him; which he hath not, and never can prove. E. g. (1.) He takes for granted the future general judgment, will not be finally deciſive to men; and yet offers not a ſingle proof that there will be any other public judgment to ſettle the ſtates of mankind, good or bad. (2dly.) He takes for granted, that the putting down and ſubdual of all enemies here, is pious, and by willing ſubjection to the divine authority: when he allows the ſame word "ſubject" Rom. 8.20. is by judicial ſentence: and when the apoſtle is not treating of the reduction &amp; introduction of new ſubjects into Chriſt's kingdom, but of the final ſettlement of it: and altogether of the external arrangement of things in the kingdom of God: and when it is againſt the tenor of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. (3dly.) He takes for granted, Chriſt will continue to reign after the ſettlement of his kingdom in the great day, in what he calls the reſurrection world, until all final enemies are ſubdued: againſt the fulleſt teſtimony of ſcripture. And (4thly.) that his giving up the kingdom, and God's being all in all, is not connected in point of time, with his ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the reſurrection and the laſt judgment: whereas they are evidently ſo connected in the paragraph itſelf, and throughout revelation. We read "of Chriſt's appearance and kingdom," his ſecond coming and giving up the kingdom; but never of a third appearance and giving it up. But he will have them diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connected with that time, and connected with a period far diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:019737_0255_0FACA804A1C98D28"/>
ages of ages after the judgment, no body knows when, when all enemies are ſubdued: which neither this text nor any others give any hint of. Theſe are the foundation ſupports of his ſcheme as argued from this paſſage; which he ought not to have taken for granted, without full, convincing proof. But we ſhall follow him in his arguments. 1. "Though the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in this paragraph, turns our view to the end of the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory ſcheme, when Chriſt ſhall have delivered up the kingdom to the Father, yet he ſays, he has evidently guarded againſt the error, that expoſitors have ſtrangely run into, viz. that this ſcheme will be finiſhed at the ſecond advent of Chriſt, by his then, unalterably fixing the ſtates of men good or bad," &amp;c. p. 208. He himſelf hath ſtrangely miſtaken the apoſtle to think otherwiſe; for we have proved, the laſt judgment is final to both; and ſhall further confirm it. (2dly.) "It is moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptorily affirmed, that an univerſal ſubjection to Chriſt ſhall yet be effected; before he delivers up the kingdom." And we have ſhewn how this will be effected in the laſt judgment: by ſettling the ſtates of all men, in final retribution, and the kingdom of God in everlaſting righteouſneſs, in that period and no other. (3dly.) "It is worthy of ſpecial notice, the laſt enemy muſt be deſtroyed, which is death, the ſecond death." In ſupport of which, he ſays (1.) "It is evident from the tenor of the new teſtament, that the wicked ſhall ſuffer the ſecond death." And we add, it is alſo evident, that it will be eternal, and they will never be delivered from it. But he adds (2dly) "this death may with as much propriety be called any enemy, as the firſt death." We ſay no, the firſt death is conſidered as an enemy, as while it reigns it holds or bars the righteous from the full and compleat enjoyment of their promiſed inheritance. Therefore it is ſpoken of as an enemy to them, and the laſt that ſhall be deſtroyed in the day of their redemption and glorious adoption: in this view, and in this only, the apoſtle treats of it in this text and context. But the ſecond death doth not hold the wicked from any promiſed inheritance, for "they have no inheritance in the kingdom of God:" therefore it is no enemy to them, in that ſenſe, in which the firſt death, is to the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. The ſecond death, is the puniſhment appointed of God for the final enemies of God and of mankind. It is friendly to
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:019737_0256_0FACA80561D42030"/>
mankind in the threatning, to warn and ſave them from that place of torment; and in the execution of it, it may anſwer an everlaſting good purpoſe in the great kingdom of Jehovah: it is no enemy to the people of God, they ſhall not be hurt of it, and in it their enemies will be put down under an impoſſibility of injuring them. It is no enemy to the authority and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſupreme Jehovah, but a great ſupport of it. It is no more an enemy in the government of God, than capital puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to traitors and murderers, is in the governments of men. In a word, it is not here or any where elſe in ſcripture ſpoken of as an enemy to be deſtroyed: and therefore the firſt and ſecond death, come under ſuch an exceeding different conſtruction, that there is no arguing from the deſtruction of the firſt, to that of the ſecond. He adds (3dly.) this ſecond death ſtrictly and properly is the laſt enemy, and the only one that is ſo: it is ſaid to have no exiſtence, till after the firſt death is ſo far deſtroyed, as that the wicked are raiſed to life, and then caſt into the lake of fire which is the ſecond death, p. 210, 211. There are thoſe who maintain the intermediate ſtate, to be a ſtate of ſufferings to the wicked. Our Lord teaches it, in the parable of dives: and Peter ſpeaks of the diſobedient ſpirits in priſon before the reſurrection. But if, as hath been ſhewn, it is no enemy to be deſtroyed, it is neither firſt nor laſt, nor any of the enemies which come within the deſcription in this text: and perhaps we ſhall prove it is eternal, and then there is no hope—it can never be deſtroyed: ſo that his "unanſwerable reaſons" do not conclude with any force. His 4th general argument is, "It is with a great deal of clearneſs and particularity aſſerted, in this ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that Chriſt ſhall not give up his truſt, till he has in fact and event ſubdued all enemies, p. 214. We reply, This is done in fact and event, when he hath put all moral enemies down in a ſtate of retribution, by ſentence and execution, in the laſt judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Nor hath he ſaid any thing to purpoſe in diſproof, nor can he poſſibly diſprove it. 5thly. "In the laſt place, it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily falls in with the obſervation of every attentive reader of this paragraph, that the reign of Chriſt in his mediatory kingdom, is to make way for God's being all in all; and will accordingly laſt, till he hath ripened and prepared things for the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that glorious period," p. 217. Two remarks, may ſet
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:019737_0257_0FACA80620D29E50"/>
this matter in a true light. Rem. 1. Neither this text or any other teach, that Chriſt will reign any longer as the ſaviour and judge of men, than to the judgment of the great day. His parables, and the whole tenor of ſcripture, point to this, as ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating his reign, as Saviour and Judge. Rem. 2. He will in fact and event in that day, put down all enemies under his feet, and perform the whole work in this paſſage, aſcribed to his reign: for, he will then put down all inimical 'rule,' 'power' and 'authority,' which is one part of the deſcription; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy "natural death" the laſt enemy of the righteous, and cauſe them to ſing in triumph "O death, where is thy ſting?" "O grave, where is thy victory?" v. 55. which is another thing deſcribed: and he will put down all moral enemies by ſentence and execution, in a ſtate of retribution: each particular and the whole work here aſſigned to his reign, is then compleated. And ſurely, his reign is then finiſhed, when this work is effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: and this muſt be the thing intended. And to confirm it, it may be noted, that all the predictions and declarations of his putting down all enemies, agree in this manner of it; and no other. Thus in the 110th plaſm here referred to, his enemies and his people are contradiſtinguiſhed. "He muſt reign till his enemies are made his footſtool," v. 1. "His people ſhall be made willing in the day of his power," that is, in the diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of his kingdom, power and grace in this world, v. 2, 3. but in the day of his 'wrath' his enemies will be deſtroyed, v. 5, 6. So where it is quoted Heb. 11 chapter, we have ſhewn this judicial putting down all enemies, muſt be the thing inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, for no other conſtruction will inforce the admonition, as there deſigned by it. So Heb. 10.13. "From henceforth expecting, till his enemies be made his footſtool." He is wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, expecting the laſt act of his regal, judicial, ſupreme power to compleat the deſign of his exaltation and kingdom (the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his people being firſt accompliſhed), viz. "in making his enemies his footſtool. As how? In their ſubdual by grace? we read not a word of that: but we read in the ſame chapter "of fiery indignation which ſhall devour the adverſaries" in a more terrible puniſhment, than any ſuffered under the law of Moſes. "And we know him that hath ſaid, vengeance belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto me, I will recompence ſaith the Lord." "And again
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:019737_0258_0FACA806E1AC77D8"/>
the Lord ſhall judge his people: it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God," v. 27, 28, 29, 30, and 31ſt. This ſurely is not the language of making them his footſtool by grace, but vengeance. The ſame laſt act of his power and reign in his kingdom before it is given up, is repreſented by John the baptiſt. "He ſhall firſt gather the wheat into his garner;" and then, "burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire." So in each of the parables of our Saviour, the righteous are firſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured; then, the wicked are puniſhed. And in the exhibition he gives us of the laſt judgment, 25 Mat. the righteous ſhall firſt be inſtated in the kingdom prepared for them; and then, the enemies, the wicked ſhall be put down and conſigned over as "accurſed into everlaſting fire," and "go away into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting puniſhment." And this, perhaps, lets us into the true reaſon, why Paul makes this ſolemn pauſe, and inſerts this pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph. The glorious reward of Chriſt muſt be perfected, in his triumphant, infinite exaltation over all his enemies, who have diſputed, oppoſed and blaſphemed his reign: and the kingdom of God be ſettled in perfect retribution, as well to the wicked as righteous, before it be given up. And it is wiſely deſigned for the ſupport and ſecurity of ſuffering chriſtians in all their perſecutions and trials, and for ſolemn warning to all men, to guard them from error, apoſtacy and wickedneſs, as what will be infallibly fatal. Becauſe all moral enemies muſt be put down in eternal diſgrace and ruin, at the time when all other enemies ſhall be deſtroyed; to compleat the full deſign of our Lord's exaltation and kingdom. He had inſerted "the coming of Chriſt," "the end," "the giving up the kingdom," as all coincident, in that grand period: but miſtake not, ſays he, it will not be compleated till he hath exerciſed the laſt grand act of his ſupreme regal and judicial power in deſtroying all natural, and putting down all moral enemies under foot, by righteous ſentence and execution; as taught and notified by the prophets, by the forerunner of Chriſt, and by our Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and thereby, hath ſettled the kingdom in perfection and everlaſting righteouſneſs. Then, will he reſign up the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration and kingdom. This is by far the moſt natural and uſeful conſtruction; and beſt harmonizes with the current doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of revelation: and before we have done, it will appear the
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:019737_0259_0FACA807A277DA40"/>
only one, that it will bear. He tells us, "it is remarkable, this prophecy in Pſalms, is five times applied to Chriſt, in the new teſtament," p. 216. It is ſufficient to reply; it is as "remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable" in all theſe times it hath not the leaſt reference to his conſtruction: which is a tacit refutation of it. Now, ſince there is but one ſubdual of all enemies taught in this paſſage; and it is clear, each part of this deſcription, and the whole of this work aſcribed to the reign of Chriſt, will in fact and event, be literally compleated in that day: his tenet of an after or continued reign for their ſubdual by grace, is abſolutely exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Then, the ſaints will be taken up with Chriſt, to the manſions promiſed and prepared for them, and "will be ever with the Lord." Certainly, the ſcripture doth not countenance any notion, that he will deſcend a third time, to reign in a new earth and reſurrection world.</p>
                  <p>A brief recapitulation and arrangement of what hath been before and now offered upon this paſſage, may give the reader, a proper advantage of judging of the conſiſtence and force of the whole, to eſtabliſhed the conſtruction we have given of it, and to refute the other. It appears (1.) there is nothing ſaid in the context, of the reſurrection of the wicked, or to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance his conſtruction; but it every way favours that which we have given. (2dly.) We before proved, that the apoſtle is here treating of an external arrangement of the kingdom of God, in way of governmental regulation; and not of introducing new ſubjects into it, in a ſubdual by grace: ſo that our conſtruction entirely falls in with the ſubject he is treating of; but his, is altogether beſide it. (3dly.) It is very evident, that all ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies will in fact and event be deſtroyed and ſubdued; and the whole work as deſcribed in this text and every part of it, will be literally effected and compleated in the great day: and all moral enemies will be put under his feet and made his footſtool by the laſt great act of his ſupreme regal power, as predicted by the prophets, by the forerunner of Chriſt, and repeatedly taught by our Saviour and the apoſtles to be exerciſed in the perfect ſettlement of his kingdom in retribution, for eternity. And (4thly.) as there is but one ſubdual of all enemies, and but one time of effecting it taught in the text; ſo with this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual then effected, when all enemies ſhall be caſt out of his
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:019737_0260_0FACA808608A75A8"/>
kingdom, is expreſsly connected, the delivering up the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. After which, there is no pretention of ſubdual or reduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of enemies, to be brought into it. And (5thly.) it is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther certain, from the repeated declarations of Chriſt himſelf, that he will reign over them no longer, for their ſubdual by grace. For, he hath repeatedly aſſured us, the workers of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity ſhall then be caſt out of his kingdom, from the means, grace and bleſſings of it, and accurſed, devoted to utter ruin. Now to ſuppoſe his reign over them any longer, is as abſurd as to ſuppoſe the continued reign of the governments of this world, over thoſe ſubjects who have been cut off from them by capital execution: the ſuppoſition, is a palpable contradiction. It is to ſuppoſe, the ſame ſubjects are both in and out of the ſame kingdom, at the ſame time: which is as ſtaring a contradiction as can be named. Once more, (6thly.) we have proved, the laſt judgment will be final, to all men, both good and bad. It is groſsly abſurd, to ſuppoſe, the infinitely wiſe Governour and Judge of the world, ſhould make ſuch an imperfect ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his kingdom in that day, in the view of the whole moral creation; as to need another, as much as ever—it is, if poſſible, more abſurd to ſuppoſe, he will execute the office of Judge, before he hath finiſhed his work as a Saviour—and full as abſurd to ſuppoſe, after he hath compleated his whole great work as a Judge, he ſhould go on to reign as a Saviour, over ſubjects caſt out, and remaining caſt out of his kingdom; with a view to reduce and ſave them in ſome blind, hidden way, no body knows where, when or how, and finally admit them into the kingdom without public judgment: and that this blind doctrine ſhould be an article of the chriſtian faith.—And no abſurdity can exceed the ſuppoſition, that for the ſake of ſtubborn, obſtinate enemies, the Lord of glory ſhould be prevented the final ſettlement of his kingdom, and ſaints be kept out of the heavenly inheritance: and that all the hopes of the poſſeſſion of this inheritance, to all the innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble miriads of the redeemed and ſaved, ſhould in fact be ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the vertue of the moſt abandoned, mercileſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate of enemies. Againſt all theſe impious, horrible ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities, we have proved, the future judgment is exhibited as deciſive, perfect and final in all the particular deſcriptions of it
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:019737_0261_0FACA80921016EB0"/>
throughout revelation:—that all the hopes and fears of good and bad men in ſcripture are abſolutely concentered, in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions of that day, as final:—that it has been the faith of good men in all ages—and the general fear and dread of the wicked through the earth—to all which, may be added; it is known to be final by the devils: they believe and tremble in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of it, as ſuch; as ſeems evident from their addreſs to our Saviour, "Art thou come to torment us, to deſtroy us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the time?" It would be ſad indeed, if the faith of chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, ſhould fall ſhort of that of devils, in an article of ſuch vaſt importance: which may well ſhame this moſt abſurd and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious notion, out of the chriſtian world. Now, if the future judgment be final, as hath been proved, and I truſt before we quit the ſubject will be put out of all doubt, the ſubduing all enemies can admit no other conſtruction but that we have given, a ſubdual by grace is abſolutely excluded, as being an impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, againſt the force of a final ſentence. It is now ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to the reader, whether the conſtruction we have given be not rational, conſiſtent with itſelf, with the context, and with the current doctrine of ſcripture. If ſo, whether this author's reflection be juſt, p. 226. "No wonder this has been reckoned among the dark and difficult texts in the apoſtle Paul's writings, while men have endeavoured to faſten a ſenſe upon it, that really ſets it at variance with itſelf, beyond the poſſibility of a reconciliation by any human ſkill: whereas, according to the ſenſe he hath given, the meaning is quite eaſy, and yet conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent." That it has been reckoned a dark and difficult text, is very true, but that it is "beyond human ſkill to give it a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent conſtruction" upon the common faith of the chriſtian world, is by no means true. The contrary, I truſt, is already clear, and will ſoon be more evident. Whereas his conſtruction is already confuted and will be repeatedly ſo, in the farther diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion of his ſcheme.—Upon this text, he opens his general ſcheme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and taken in connexion with the millennium deſcribed 20th Rev. and the new heavens and earth deſcribed Rev. 21. and 22d chapters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he gives us his whole plan, of the ſubdual of all enemies, and of Chriſt's continuing to reign for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of it, and then giving up the kingdom, as he ſuppoſes is intended in this paragraph. I would therefore, give an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:019737_0262_0FACA809E567BAB8"/>
of his general ſcheme, in the collected parts of it, in one connected view; make my remarks, and come to a general ſettlement upon it, in this place. To introduce it, he ſays, "it is eaſy to diſtinguiſh between theſe two, "periods," that wherein the mediatory kingdom is in the hands of Jeſus Chriſt; and that when God as king, will be all in all," p. 217, 218. we ſay, it is eaſy to diſtinguiſh theſe two manners of adminiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the ſame kingdom; and that the one ends and the other commences, at one and the ſame period, of the laſt judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and then his word 'period' will neither make him miſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ake, nor miſlead us. He next ſays, "the reign of Chriſt takes in the whole ſpace from his exaltation, till all enemies, all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man kind are reduced under due ſubjection to God." But, he hath not proved it; and we have proved the contrary. He repeats it again, this will prepare the way for the other grand period, &amp;c. All without proof. All this taken for granted, he next divides the reign of Chriſt into two periods: the firſt takes in the preſent ſtate of exiſtence to the end of this world: the other, he ſays, takes in that which intervenes between the general reſurrection and laſt judgment; and to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e when "God ſhall be all in all." He imagines there is a juſt founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſpeak of ſuch a period: we have proved theſe is no foundation for it, and doubt not to do it to full ſatisfaction; on which his ſcheme muſt be up, for ever. His ſcheme of the reign of Chriſt, in this ſecond period in the reſurrection world, as collected from ſeveral parts of his book, is this, viz. "The ſentence in the laſt judgment will conſign the righteous to an age of happineſs, and the wicked to an age of puniſhment, in the new earth: for the word eternal, he ſays, ſignifies a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain period, age, "or diſpenſation," p. 224. and tells us, the new earth will be "one part a hell for the wicked," and the other "heaven for the righteous," p. 394. and tells us, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the goſpel, reſpect this reſurrection ſtate and world; and are not promiſes of the eternal life and inheritance, which they ſhall enjoy, when the kingdom is given up, and "God is all in all." And "the threatnings to the wicked all reſpect this ſtate and period likewiſe, p. 222, 223. alſo, that Chriſt will reign in this reſurrection world, over the righteous, diſpenſing a glorious reward and happineſs to them; and over the wicked
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:019737_0263_0FACA80AA1978490"/>
in way of puniſhment and grace, with ſuitable means to make them a willing people. And in this period and "next ſtate in hell" all the wicked ſhall literally and univerſally, die the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond death, p. 312, 313. "upon which diſſolution of ſoul and body, they will have no more concern with that world, than they have with this, upon the coming on of the firſt death," p. 281. that for a thouſand years, the ſaints ſhall reign, "un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moleſted:" but at the end of it, thoſe wicked dead ones, ſhall be quickened and live again. For die they muſt in that "next ſtate" before they go out of it, as hath been ſaid, to ſupport his expoſition of Mark 9th. and live again they muſt, for the work he aſſigns to them, viz. "being found on earth, to go forth, to the four corners of it, and "overſpread the ſurface of it," "headed by the devil, with tempers fierce and cruel exactly fitted" for their predatory expedition of making one grand aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault, upon the camp of God; to anſwer the deſcription and do the work aſſigned to Gog and Magog, Rev. 20. 8, 9. p. 394. and ſuch ſhall be the fears and dangers of the whole camp of God, from their "formidable appearance" as to be ſaved from deſtruction, only by the extraordinary interpoſition of God, conſuming "this rabble rout of adverſaries," by fire from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ibid, and p. 382, with the text. Here we find them, die the ſecond death, live again and dead again the third death, and yet not ſaved. How doth this comport with "their being tormented day and night forever and ever? Rev. 20.10. we are told this means 'ages,' 'ſtates' and 'diſpenſations,' (p. 309) into which they ſhall be "tranſmuted," into one, and if ſtubborn and unſubdued in the firſt tranſmutation, they muſt die again, be quickened and tranſmuted into another, no body knows to what number: for it is ſaid, "wicked men may not be ſubdued, till they have again and again, in this and the other form of exiſtence, ſuffered torment, that ſhall end in death:" the reſult of which ſhall finally be, their reſurrection to reign in life forever," p. 404. In the mean time, while the wicked are under this diſcipline, we are told the ſaints (after that aſſault) ſhall go on to reign unmoleſted, for ages of ages, cotemporary, with thoſe of the wicked, which is ſaid to be the meaning of their "reigning forever and ever," Rev. 22.5. and when this laſt reſurrection of the wicked is compleated, at the end of "for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:019737_0264_0FACA80B614F1980"/>
and ever," then the laſt period ſhall commence: "when ſin, ſatan, death, the ſecond as well as the firſt death ſhall be totally and abſolutely deſtroyed, and the whole human race be reduced under a free and full ſubjection to the government of God," "the kingdom be given up," and "God be all in all."</p>
                  <p>This I take to be the ſcheme juſtly delineated: upon which I would make two or three general remarks, and then give a more particular attention to the ſeveral parts of it.</p>
                  <p>At firſt view, that heaven, earth and hell ſhould all be found, and be compriſed in "one earth," ſeems as romantick as Dr. Burnett's gog and magog made out of the ſlime of the earth; which he ſays, "needs no ſerious refutation." I would next remark, that his new earth doth not well agree with St. John's in the 21ſt and 22d chapters of the revelations, which he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes to be the ſame. In St. John's "there is no ſea" of tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent ſpirits; in his, there are gog and magog, the moſt furious of all turbulents. In St. John's, "there are no more cries and tears:" in his, millions are conſigned "to weeping, wailing and gnaſhing of teath." Again, in St. John's "there is no more curſe," "no more death;" in his, theſe multitudes of miſerables, endure all the curſes of the book of God, and die the moſt tremendous of all deaths, the ſecond death. Upon which diſſolution, they have no more concern with that world than the dead have with this. Which leads to a third remark, it is impoſſible upon his own ſcheme, that his gog and magog ſhould be the ſame, as is intended in the prophecy: for, his ſcheme ſays, they were conſigned to an age of torment in hell; and could not come out of that ſtate till they died there; and that then they had no more concern with it, than the dead have with this. Conſequently, they muſt have died there before they could come out: and when quicken'd, muſt be tranſmuted to ſome other ſtate, where they would have no more concern with that new earth world, than the dead have with this. For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, when quickened from the ſecond death, they cannot be found there, roving over the four quarters of that earth, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating and attempting an aſſault upon the camp of God: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, before they died, they belonged to that new earth, reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection world; they lived in it, were tormented and died in it, and can no more belong to it, after death. His wrong notion
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:019737_0265_0FACA80C20CD9D10"/>
of this death, and of ages in the future ſtate (which will be refuted hereafter) forces him upon the abſurd doctrine of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation into different ſtates and worlds. Let it be noted, once for all, the ſcripture knows and teaches but two ſtates and worlds for mankind; the one viſible, the other inviſible; the one temporary, the other eternal. Now, his gog and magog were in the inviſible, new earth, reſurrection world: that world where he ſays heaven, earth and hell are: there they lived and died, and have no more concerns with it. Certainly then, they cannot infeſt the camp of God there, where they have no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, no more than the dead can infeſt us, who are living. Beſides, on his general plan, when quickened, they are tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muted to another ſtate and world, than that to which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore belonged; with which, after death, they have no more concern. I aſk, what world is it? it cannot be the reſurrection world, or that world where heaven, earth and hell are; for this they belonged to before. It muſt it ſeems be then, an anoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, new-created world: and as often as they die and are quickened again, new worlds and ſtates muſt be created, to accommodate their tranſmutation. Can any thing be more irrational, romantick and incredible?</p>
                  <p>To introduce the more particular remarks which follow, I would obſerve, the apoſtle inſerts the firſt reſurrection, and the reign of Chriſt a thouſand years; with the ſubſequent attempt of gog and magog, before the general reſurrection and laſt judgment. This author tranſpoſes the whole after the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, into the new earth, as hath been noted. Why this arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary tranſpoſition, without neceſſity? Why is not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly received opinion, the truth? viz. that this firſt is a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual reſurrection of the church of God, to reign in eminence and glory in the ſpirit, purity and practice of genuine chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for a long period, termed a thouſand years, in this world, before the laſt judgment. He ſays no, it means the firſt reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection in kind, to reign in eternal life. It implies a ſecond, in which the wicked when fitted for it, will be raiſed in companies in the ſame kind of reſurrection: and ſays, the true ſeries of events is this: that after the deſtruction of antichriſt, ſatan will be bound in the bottomleſs pit, as Rev. 20th. 1, 2, 3 verſes: that the next event will be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> reſurrection &amp; laſt judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:019737_0266_0FACA80CE12CD7F8"/>
as ſet forth from v. 11th, to the end of the chapter: and that the whole account from the 3d to the 11th v. belongs to his reſurrection world, p. 370, 1, 2. If the reader would ſee the common conſtruction vindicated, and a literal reſurrection as here contended for, ſolidly confuted, he may conſult Dr. Whitby's ſelect treatiſe on the ſubject, and Mr. Lowman on this paſſage. But without regard to what they have ſaid, I muſt follow this author in his peculiar notion. He aſſigns three reaſons, as inſuperable difficulties, againſt the received con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. (1.) "The firſt reſurrection implies a ſecond, but a ſecond in kind there cannot be, for this will be the laſt, and the judgment inſtantly ſucceed," p. 382. (2.) That inſtantly, after a thouſand years reign of genuine chriſtianity, there ſhould be found ſuch ſwarms of abandoned wicked men "as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe gog and magog, here deſcribed as the ſands of the ſea, "it is ſaid exceeds all belief." A (3d) is, that the coming of our Saviour, is compared to the coming on of the flood in the days of Noah, for the univerſally prevalent wickedneſs of the earth, Mat. 24.37, 38, 39: and when he comes, it is ſaid ſhall he find faith in the earth, Luke 18.8. The coming of our Saviour in theſe texts, I take to be his coming to the deſtruction of Jeruſalem, and not to final judgment: and the diſobedient to be puniſhed at his ſecond coming, as deſcribed 2 Theſ. 1. 7, 8, 9, are the finally diſobedient of all ages and generations, and not of that generation only, which preceeds the judgment. Theſe texts therefore, to me appear beſide the purpoſe. The other objections deſerve attention. As to the firſt objection: This glorious ſtate of the church may be termed the firſt reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of it, not in kind, (it is conceeded to be the laſt of that ſort) but in reference to the general reſurrection of the juſt; when all the ſons of God will be manifeſted, in all their glory. It will certainly bear, by far, the moſt clear and lively reſemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of the glory and happineſs of the church in that day, of any ſtate of it, ever ſeen in this world: and on the ground of this reſemblance, may with great propriety be termed, a firſt reſurrection. I ſee no difficulty in it, for the apoſtle doth not limit it to the ſame kind of reſurrection, nor hath any one au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to do it. This conſtruction heightens and aggrandizes our views of the eminence, glory and importance of this ſtate
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:019737_0267_0FACA80DA1877F00"/>
of the church in this world, and of that moſt intereſting period to mankind; which ſeems the direct intention of the apoſtle. What can aggrandize our conceptions of it more, than to be taught, that under this long, glorious reign of Chriſt, ſuch will be his ſubjects for multitude, moral excellency and happineſs, as to exhibit a very lively reſemblance of the general, glorious reſurrection of the juſt? As to his ſecond objection: "That inſtantly after ſuch a long and happy reign of pure religion, and immediately preceeding the judgment," as he repreſents it, p. 383, 4, "ſuch ſwarms of wicked men ſhould be found on earth," would upon this ſtating, I confeſs, be incredible; but when the miſtating of the fact is corrected, and the text itſelf is conſulted, the ſcripture account is perfectly credible. It ſtands thus, Rev. 20. 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9. "And I ſaw an angel come down from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, having the key of the bottomleſs pit, and a great chain in his hand: and he laid hold on the dragon that old ſerpent, which is the devil and ſatan, and bound him a thouſand years, and caſt him into the bottomleſs pit, and ſhut him up, and ſet a ſeal upon him, that he ſhould deceive the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons no more, till the thouſand years ſhould be fulfilled: and after that, he muſt be looſed a little ſeaſon." "And when the thouſand years are expired, ſatan ſhall be looſed out of his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ſhall go out to deceive the nations, which are in the four quarters of the earth, gog and magog, to gather them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gather to battle, the number of whom is as the ſand of the ſea. And they went out on the breadth of the earth, and compaſſed the camp of the ſaints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them."— Upon which I obſerve (1.) 'tis certain, when ſatan is bound, mankind are living as nations in this world, according to the common courſe of it. This is allowed. And it is ſaid his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement is before the judgment. (2dly) It is fully and ſtrongly implied, that they would continue to live as nations in ſucceſſive generations, on this ſame earth, during the whole thouſand years in a ſtate liable to be deceived. To prevent which is the aſſigned reaſon in the text, wherefore ſatan is bound. It is thence certain, the reſurrection and general judgment cannot be the next event, to his being bound. For if the nations were to be immediately ſummoned to judgement and conſigned to
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:019737_0268_0FACA80E63285DC0"/>
their future ſtate, the very cauſe of his reſtraint would be of courſe ſuperſeded and made void: there would be no nations for him to deceive, nor any reaſon why he ſhould be bound to prevent it. The ſuppoſition of this next event, is a manifeſt, abſurd inconſiſtency. And (3dly.) it is as fully and ſtrongly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, as well can be, that mankind ſhould continue as nations upon this ſame earth, during this whole period; and under this circumſtance of diſtinguiſhed happineſs, above all other periods of time, "that they ſhould be exempt from his deceptive wiles." It is expreſsly aſſerted that "the ſeal is upon him," and that he ſhould deceive the nations no more, till the thouſand years be fulfilled." This cannot be after the judgment: for there will be no nations on earth to be exempt from his wiles. It cannot be applied to thoſe in hell, for they are deceived and undone by his deluſions. It is every way clear from the text itſelf, that this happy millennium ſtate will be in this world, before the general judgment. It ſeems, it will not admit of any other conſiſtent conſtruction. (4thly.) This reſtraint is limited and temporary; the term is fixed, and when it is expired, it is expreſsly ſaid "he muſt be looſed a little ſeaſon." Certainly, this "little time" is long enough for him to do his horrid work of deceiving the nations again; and of courſe it is long enough for us to account for it: for inſpiration doth not give us an account that is incredible. This corrects the miſtating of the fact: "that the millennium immediately preceeds the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and that inſtantly ſuch ſwarms of wicked men appear on earth." For this "little time" intervenes between the two e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents: and neceſſity obligeth us to conclude it long enough, for the whole work narrated, to be effected in it. It is inſerted for this very purpoſe. This alone is ſufficient to ſilence and remove the objection. (5thly.) The continued account, 7, 8 verſes, teaches "ſatan is looſed and comes out of his priſon" alone, and not bringing gog and magog with him. They were not caſt in with him, they do not come out with him, they never were there; for the text ſpeaks of them as living among the nations of the earth, who are repreſented as dwelling in the four quarters of the earth in the ſame manner, after, as before his reſtraint, and as they had been all along, during the time of it. They could not be thoſe, before deceived by him, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:019737_0269_0FACA80F29A915B8"/>
with him, and who had died a ſecond death in hell: for he goes forth to deceive them, whom he had been hitherto reſtrained from deceiving; and not any who were undone by his deluſions. The whole of this plain account is all in favour of the common conſtruction, that the millennium is before the reſurrection and judgment, and is a full juſtification of it: and is irreconcilable with his, which places it after the judgment. The activity of ſatan when looſed is great, extended over the four quarters of the earth; his arts doubtleſs employed upon the leſs enlightened and moſt likely to be deceived of the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the earth: and his ſucceſs is great, the deceived "are as the ſand of the ſea." But what is there at firſt ſight, incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in all this? This "little time" as hath been noted, muſt of neceſſity be ſuppoſed ſufficient. If any one finds himſelf diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culted, let him ſuppoſe this little time, but a twentieth part of the thouſand years, to which, it ſeems compared; fifty years; or, a fortieth part, which gives twenty-five years: if he conſult human nature, facts, and the natural circumſtances of this caſe, he will find time fully ſufficient, to account for it. We know how a common cauſe of vertue, will inſpirit men: how ſoon did the ſpirit of it pervade, and combine millions upon this continent? what great things were atchieved, againſt the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt oppoſition, in a little time, eight years? and the paſſions of evil men are uſually more violent, and their activity greater in purſuing their enterprizes, than the vertuous. How eaſily unprincipled men are deceived, and how impetuous their paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, when ſpoil in abundance is their object, is well known, as was with gog and magog in Ezekiel, whoſe ſpirit is here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed. And when evil and miſchievous men break looſe from reſtraints, they are very apt to precipitate into great exceſs and violence. And it is well known that very great things have in fact been done in a little time, by the united arts of intrigue, deception and violence, as in the ſudden riſe, and extenſive ſpread of the mahometan empire, and other inſtances. And natural circumſtances ſhew how tempting the object and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, in this caſe. From the flowing abundance of hundreds of years of peace and plenty, and when under an extraordinary bleſſing, from God: as alſo from the flattering proſpect of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, in going againſt a people unuſed to arms, having for ſome
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:019737_0270_0FACA80FE247ECB8"/>
hundreds of years beat their ſwords into plowſhears, and lived in the ſweeteſt harmony and peace, under the influence of that charity, which thinketh no evil: and therefore might readily be thought to be eaſily ſurprized, plundered and taken. And when in addition to all this, is conſidered the extraordinary pains to deceive, unite and cement all the wicked in the four quarters of the earth, in this grand enterprize; it ſeems very eaſy to conceive, in leſs than twenty years, a number from the ſeveral nations, might be inliegued and combined in it, as large as that of Judah and Iſrael in the days of Solomon, who are ſaid to be "as the ſand by the ſea," 1 Kings 4.20. Nothing is here taken for granted, but what is natural and ſuppoſable, and the concluſion deduced is altogether credible. In a word, every part &amp; circumſtance in the whole account pleads ſtrongly for it to ſtand in the connexion, where inſpiration hath placed it; before the laſt judgment: and as ſtrongly, againſt the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of it, to his reſurrection world. The objections be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing removed, and the common faith of chriſtians ſufficiently confirmed; I proceed to ſuggeſt ſome greater difficulties a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his tranſpoſition, and other parts of his ſcheme. His notion of this binding of ſatan in the bottomleſs pit, as the next event immediately preceeding the judgment, and to continue a thouſand years, is directly oppoſed to plain ſcripture: for the devil and his angels, are reſerved in everlaſting chains of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the judgment of the great day, Jude 6. and as ſure to be brought into judgment in that day, as the unjuſt men, who are reſerved to it. If the devil here be a collective noun, as he ſays may be, v. 10th, p. 294, including the devil and his angels, they are all chained and ſealed in the bottomleſs pit, before the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to continue ſo for a thouſand years: and their appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the general judgment, is an abſolute impoſſibility. And how ſhall the ſaints be aſſeſſors with Chriſt, to judge the angels as he repreſents? p. 281. As certain therefore, as theſe fallen angels ſhall appear in the judgment of the great day, ſo certainly falſe, it ſeems, muſt his conſtruction of this paſſage be. A plan to ſave all men, and to ſave the devil and his angels from the future judgment alſo, muſt be very extraordinary. Had the writer perceived this conſequence, we truſt he would not have adopted his conſtruction. Again, his notion of the wicked's
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:019737_0271_0FACA810A159B840"/>
diſturbing and terrifying the ſaints of God in the future world is directly oppoſed to, and confuted by many ſcriptures. It i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> confuted by the ſcripture doctrine of the future judgment, which in all deſcriptions of it exhibits the wicked in an utter incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of diſturbing or injuring the ſaints of God. After judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the wicked are repreſented, "burnt up as an oven," "deſtroyed," "impriſoned in a ſtate of cloſe confinement," "caſt into the lake of fire," &amp;c. How is it poſſible, chaff and tares, ſevered from the wheat and burnt up with unquenchable fire, ſhould ever injure the wheat gathered into a place of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſafety? or, "the wicked ſent into everlaſting puniſhment, ſhould moleſt the righteous?—it is confuted by the conſtant repreſentations of the future ſecurity &amp; bleſſedneſs of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous. It is utterly inconſiſtent with their promiſed everlaſting reſt: with the ſecurity of their treaſures in heaven, where no deſtroyer or diſturber can ever come: and with their perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally enjoying the preſence and beholding the face of God and the Lamb forever. And it is confuted by the conſolation now given them, in this very article: "In nothing terrified by your adverſaries; which is to them an evident token of perdition," (which ſhall devour the adverſaries, Heb. 10.27.) "but to you of ſalvation, and that of God," Phil. 1.28. ſo 2 Theſ. 1.6, 7, 9 verſes, "Seeing it is a righteous thing with God, to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe tribulation to them that trouble you," "and to you who are troubled reſt with us." How is it effected? we are taught ver. 9th, "when they ſhall be puniſhed with an everlaſting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, from that bliſsful preſence of the Lord; which the righteous ſhall eternally enjoy." From all which, it ſeems very evident, that the millennium in this prophecy, can upon no ſcheme be after the general judgment. For, no ſuch enemies as gog and magog, can ever ſo moleſt and terrify the ſaints of God, with their "formidable attempts and appearance" after that day. We have already noticed the inconſiſtency of the ſcheme of theſe rebels. When they died in that next ſtate, they ought to have quitted that world, and to have been tranſmuted into ſome other. But there they rove, attempt miſchief, and are killed the third time. Now ſurely, they muſt be tranſmuted. No, after this deſtruction by fire, upon the allowed conſtruction of verſe 10th, p. 294. they are caſt into the lake of fire to be
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:019737_0272_0FACA811624986E0"/>
tormented for ever and ever: after the third death, it ſeems, they are in the ſame world and place to which they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned before the ſecond death; upon which, they had no more concern with it than the dead have with this living world.— Here is contradiction upon contradiction, one part of the ſcheme oppoſing and deſtroying the other: and this gog and magog who are brought up, as friends, to ſupport the ſcheme, are ſuch outrageous rebels againſt its laws of death and tranſmutation, as in fact to daſh the whole into ruins. Moreover, the ſcheme is ſelf-ſubverted and deſtroyed another way. The apoſtle has fixed it as explicitly as poſſible "that death is the laſt enemy that ſhall be deſtroyed." This means, ſays this author, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond death:" and tells us, p. 215, 216. "now the ſecond death can be deſtroyed no way whatſoever, but by putting an end to its power over thoſe, who are the ſubjects of it." But upon this ſcheme, this ſecond death and laſt enemy may be deſtroyed and reign no more; and yet ſin not be deſtroyed, nor the wicked ever have a reſurrection to reign in life. For when the ſtubborn wicked have died the ſecond death, and are quickened and tranſmuted into the firſt of ages; the ſecond hath ſpent its whole force, and is abſolutely deſtroyed: it can never reign over them again, any more than the firſt death can, after the general reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: yet, ſin is not deſtroyed, they are ſtubborn ſtill, and under the reign of the third death. And upon this plan, they may be under the fourth, fifth and fiftieth. Infallably they can never be ſaved, becauſe ſin can never be deſtroyed in them. The laſt enemy that ever will be deſtroyed, he ſays, is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond death: this is deſtroyed in the firſt quickening and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation; yet they are under the power of ſin. Now a man muſt be loſt in natural arithmetick, to ſay, the third, fourth, fifth or fiftieth, is the "ſecond." Their whole ſcheme then, is ſelf-ſubverted and deſtroyed, and all their hopes built upon it, are buried in its ruins. Surely, a man, who will not receive conviction and quit an error, when mathematically demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſo that he muſt give up his natural arithmetick and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of numbers, to retain it, is, irrecoverable by argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. This deſtruction of it, is abſolutely unavoidable: for this pleaded ſecond death, muſt be maintained, to void the argument from the laſt ſentence, and confirm the doctrine of a
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:019737_0273_0FACA812215CF460"/>
next limited ſtate; to evade the argument from "the worm that dieth not," &amp;c. Mark 9. And the quickening and reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from it, muſt be maintained, to ſupport the doctrine of tranſmutation, which becomes neceſſary, to avoid the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, from their being tormented day and night forever and ever, Rev. 20.10. Now, it is infallible, "that death is the laſt enemy that ſhall be deſtroyed," and the ſcripture teaches but two deaths, the firſt and ſecond, take which of them they will, (this author takes the ſecond) the wicked, that are not recovered and ſaved, when that is deſtroyed in their quickening from it, can never be ſaved: for after this laſt enemy is deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, all hopes of the deſtruction of ſin in their ſenſe, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of ſalvation, are plainly, abſolutely and finally excluded and deſtroyed. The like embarraſſment, from ſcripture or reaſon, or both, attends all other parts of this ſcheme. The doctrine of diſcipline applied to the future ſtate, hath been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed, and ſhewn to be attended with ſuch groſs abſurdities, as can never be admitted. The doctrine of purgatory, and of hell as a purging fire, to prepare the wicked for the heavenly inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, is one of the groſſeſt corruptions in all corrupt religion. It is to be abhorred and deteſted by all men, for the "impiety" and "abſurdity" of it. For the impiety of it: for to aſcribe that moral, divine change that meetens men for heaven, to the operations of future torment, which every where in ſcripture is aſcribed to the Spirit of Grace, is groſs impiety. It is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that the Spirit of Grace is given to the wicked, there: and if it was, the ſcripture confutes it. Again, to aſcribe ſuch an omnipotency to this future torment, as to divinely change and ſanctify all the wicked, when abandoned as accurſed, to utter ruin; is as abhorrent to our rational and moral ſenſe and feelings, as the doctrine of tranſubſtantiation is to our natural ſenſes: and it is alike, a monſter of abſurdity. The ſceptical doctrine, of "wiſe, rational, more effectual means to be uſed for their recovery," is confuted by the goſpel conſtitution— by the doctrine of retribution—by the parable of dives, and by the repeated declarations of our Lord "that they ſhall be caſt out of his kingdom," from the grace, privileges and means of it. And we have ſhewn in another place, that by ſcripture, all hopes are excluded, and every way of eſcape is barred, to
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:019737_0274_0FACA812E160B938"/>
thoſe who die in their ſins. To ſay the door of mercy is open to them, is to contradict our Saviour, who ſaith it is ſhut. And to ſay they are reſerved for the great bleſſing of life "to reign in life for ever," is in the face of the laſt ſentence, which dooms them as "accurſed into everlaſting fire and puniſhment. And to name no more, to ſay that our Lord reigns over them in a diſpenſation "of darkneſs," "outer darkneſs," and "the blackneſs of darkneſs forever" for the ſame purpoſe that he now reigns in a glorious diſpenſation of light in this world, viz. "to enlighten, ſanctify and ſave men; is ſuch a monſter in ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as one would think no man could admit, unleſs his mind was ſo blinded in this inſtance, as to ſubdue his reaſon and mental feelings, to inſenſibility.</p>
                  <p>What further proof can be requiſite, to demoliſh this ſcheme utterly, to remove all ſceptic doubt, and ſet theſe gentlemen down ſatisfied in the common chriſtian faith? Will it be effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual to prove (1.) that goſpel promiſes, are promiſes of the heavenly inheritance, in the kingdom of our heavenly Father? (2dly.) that theſe promiſes and this inheritance hath been the great object of the faith and hope of good men in all ages, with a hope which cannot diſappoint them? and (3dly.) that in the great day of the reſurrection and laſt judgment, they will in fact be put in the poſſeſſion of this inheritance, in that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious kingdom? and laſtly, that when the righteous are tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated out of Chriſt's kingdom, into the kingdom of their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father (the kingdom being given up to him) that then the wicked ſhall be ſhut out of this kingdom and have no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance in it? All this I ſhould think, muſt fully ſatisfy every candid, impartial mind: if we make full proof of it, I can ſee nothing wanting. Wherefore I would proceed to ſhew (1.) goſpel promiſes are promiſes of the heavenly inheritance in the kingdom of our heavenly father. Moſt readers perhaps may judge this too evident to need proof: and truly, the ſcripture ſo abounds with theſe great and precious promiſes, that I did not expect theſe two firſt propoſitions would have been diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But we are told "that the reward promiſed under the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of Chriſt's kingdom in this preſent ſtate, in order to perſuade men to be his good and faithful ſubjects, is not the final happineſs God intends to beſtow upon them; but the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:019737_0275_0FACA813A07C9EB0"/>
of that ſtate which intervenes between the reſurrection and God's being all in all," p. 222. In like manner it is ſaid of goſpel threatnings, "that they point out the miſery of this intermediate ſtate, and not miſery that will have no end," p. 223. To clear this point; I would note ſome things more generally, to enable any attentive reader to recollect theſe precious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, in plenty, and then particularize ſome inſtances of proof. It may be noted, that the great ſalvation of Chriſt in the future world, certainly includes the heavenly inheritance; ſo that all the promiſes of this ſalvation, are promiſes of this inheritance. "Chriſt is the author of eternal ſalvation, to all that obey him:" this ſalvation certainly includes the heavenly inheritance. The goſpel commiſſion carries this glorious promiſe in the face of it. So all the declarations of our Saviour and his apoſtles, "he that believeth ſhall be ſaved," ſhall not periſh, but have everlaſting life—"believe and thou ſhalt be ſaved," &amp;c. are promiſes of the heavenly inheritance; and the contrary threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings to final unbelievers, are threatnings of diſheriſon and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion from that inheritance: and theſe are numerous in the goſpel, acts, &amp;c. It may alſo be noted, all the promiſes of "heaven" "the kingdom of God," "the kingdom of heaven," and "of the father," at and after the future judgment, are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the heavenly inheritance. "Ye ſhall have treaſures in heaven," "great ſhall be your reward in heaven," "it is the Father's good pleaſure to give you the kingdom," "ye ſhall ſhine as the ſun in the kingdom of your Father," &amp;c. are all promiſes of that ſort. The ſame may be noted of all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of future bleſſedneſs made to that "ſaith whereby the juſt do live," and "to that repentance which is unto life, and to ſalvation;" they are promiſes of the heavenly inheritance, and are numerous in the old teſtament and new. So are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of ſeeing God—that he will be their God, and exceeding great reward—and that great goſpel promiſe "he will be their God and they ſhall be his people, his ſons and daughters." As Paul teaches us to argue from the grant of adoption, "if chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, then heirs, heirs of God, and joint heirs with Chriſt," Rom. 8.17. Heirs of what? why of that glorious kingdom when "God is all in all," for Chriſt is more than heir, he is Lord of his own kingdom. Theſe general references might be
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:019737_0276_0FACA814943FF5C0"/>
thought ſufficient; but to put it out of diſpute, we will particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larize further proof. We know <q>that Chriſt hath obtained eternal redemption, and is a mediator to this end, that the called (according to God's purpoſe) might receive the promiſe of eternal inheritance,</q> Heb. 9.12, 15. They certainly then, do receive this promiſe. God hath prepared for them a city and kingdom in heaven, and "they are now come to Mount Zion, the city of the living God, the heavenly (not earthly) Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, and to an innumerable company of angels, to the general aſſembly and church of the firſt-born which are written in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, (not in the new earth) and to God the judge of all," &amp;c. Heb. 12.22, 23. How are they come to all this? not in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion) but by promiſe. And "now receive a kingdom which cannot be moved, v. 28th. How do they receive it? There is but two ways, the one by promiſe, the other by, or in actual poſſeſſion. It is by promiſe only, they now receive this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. What kingdom is this? not his reſurrection kingdom, for that we are told will be moved and given up. It is that kingdom then, wherein "God is all in all" which cannot be moved, which they now in fact, receive by promiſe. St. Peter teaches the ſame, "that they are begotten again "to a lively hope,"—"to an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and which fadeth not away, reſerved (not in the new earth) but in heaven for them. For who? not all the lapſed ſons of Adam, but thoſe "who are kept by the power of God, through faith, unto ſalvation, ready to be revealed in the laſt time," the laſt day, the end of time, 1 Pet. 1.3, 4, 5. And what doth this lively hope ſtand upon, but the promiſe of God? for, every hope of this inheritance not founded on a divine promiſe, is preſumptuous and vain. He alſo gives the promiſe of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible crown, to be received at the appearance of Chriſt, in the great day, 1 Pet. 5.4. St. John is expreſs in point. "This is the promiſe that he hath promiſed us, even eternal life," 1 John 2.26. Our Saviour gave this promiſe, and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting conſolation to his diſciples, at parting. "Let not your hearts be troubled, ye believe in God, believe alſo in me: in my Father's houſe (heaven) are many manſions; if it were not ſo I would have told you: I go to prepare a place for you: and if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:019737_0277_0FACA81522B6BBE8"/>
receive you unto myſelf, that where I am ye may be alſo." John 14.1, 2, 3. At his ſecond coming he will receive them into this heavenly inheritance. So they undoubtedly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood him; and he without doubt intended it, in this gracious promiſe. Neither, doth the fulfilment of theſe precious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes ſuſpend and reſt upon the will, power or vertue of the abandoned part of the creation; but upon the oath and immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability of God, as the apoſtle teacheth, Heb. 6.17, 18, 19 &amp; 20th verſes. "Wherein God willing more abundantly to ſhew unto the heirs of promiſe the immutability of his counſel, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed it by an oath: that by two immutable things, in which it was impoſſible for God to lie, they might have ſtrong conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope ſet before us: which hope we have as an anchor of the ſoul, ſure and ſtedfaſt, and which entereth into that within the vail, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the forerunner is for us entered, even Jeſus, made an high prieſt forever after the order of Melchiſedec." Theſe promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſo confirmed, are not made to all men, but to thoſe who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope ſet before us. They are not promiſes of an inheritance in a new heavens and earth; Chriſt hath not entered a forerunner there—they have no exiſtence: but they are promiſes of the heavenly inheritance. For their faith and hope founded on them, as an anchor of the ſoul enters within the vail, into heaven itſelf, where Chriſt their forerunner hath entered, to take the poſſeſſion in their behalf, and to inſure their actual poſſeſſion of it, in the great day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for it. Thus clear and numerous are the goſpel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the heavenly inheritance, announced by our Saviour and his apoſtles, to convert ſinful men to God, to eſtabliſh and comfort believers, and "to make them good and faithful ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to Chriſt." This firſt point being clear beyond diſpute or doubt, I proceed to ſhew (2dly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) that anſwerable to the great deſign of them, theſe promiſes and this inheritance hath been the great object of the faith and hope of good men in all ages, and with a hope which cannot diſappoint them. This is conſtructively conceded in their famous note, p. 253, and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not to be laboured. Paul proves it, by that cloud <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

looking for and deſiring a heavenly city and country (not a new earth one) "prepared for them of God," and lived and died in the faith and hope of it, by embracing the promiſes. Our Saviour teaches and urges it the duty of all, "to lay up their treaſures in heaven," not on the earth, new or old; "to ſeek firſt the bleſſings of the kingdom of God," "to labour for the meat that endureth to everlaſting life," and not for ages in the new earth. And St. Paul exhorts chriſtians "to ſeek the things that are above, where God and Chriſt are," and "to fee their affections on things above, and not on things on earth," new or old: and animates them to it, with the hope "that when Chriſt who is their life ſhall appear, they alſo ſhall then appear with him in glory," Col. 3.1, 2, 3, 4. And he exhibits theſe great objects of the chriſtian faith and hope, not only as the objects by which chriſtians ought to be, but are in fact in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced and governed in their labours and ſufferings in this world. 2 Cor. 4.16, 17, 18. and ch. 5.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. "For which cauſe we faint not, but though our outward man periſh, yet the inward man is renewed day by day. For our light affliction, which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; (here this author admits eternal in the ſtrict ſenſe) while we look not at the things which are ſeen, but at the things which are not ſeen: for the things which are ſeen are temporal; but the things which are not ſeen are eternal. For we know, that if our earthly houſe of this tabernacle were diſſolved, we have a building of God, an houſe not made with hands, eternal in the heavens." (Not the new earth). "For in this we groan earneſtly, deſiring to be cloathed upon with our houſe which is from heaven: if ſo be that being cloathed, we ſhall not be found naked. For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burthened: not for that we would be uncloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but cloathed upon, that mortality might be ſwallowed up of life," The connexion ſhews that at the time when mortality is ſwallowed up of life, then they ſhall be put in poſſeſſion of their houſe and inheritance which is eternal in the heavens. Nor can they poſſibly fail of it for the reaſon added. "Now he that hath wrought us for the ſelf-ſame thing," (this faith, hope and meetneſs for it) "is God" (who will certainly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat this whole work) "who alſo hath given unto us the earneſt
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:019737_0279_0FACA816A093FB28"/>
of the Spirit:" to inſure their poſſeſſion of this heavenly inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance in that appointed time, of the reſurrection. And in the following verſes he goes on to ſhew how they lived and were governed by theſe great objects of the chriſtian faith and hope. And "the ſaving grace of God teaches chriſtians to be looking for this bleſſed hope, at the appearing of the great God our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour," Tit. 2.11, 12, 13. This was ſo notoriouſly the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon faith of all chriſtians in that day and age, that the apoſtle appeals upon it, to perſecuted chriſtians, in theſe words, "Knowing in yourſelves that ye have in heaven (not on earth, new or old) a better and an enduring ſubſtance," Heb. 10.34. and exhorts them in the next verſe, "not to caſt away their confidence, which hath great recompence of reward." And in the laſt verſe tells them it is "the ſalvation of the ſoul." This point cannot labour with any one, who attends to the governing faith and ſpirit of the apoſtles and primitive chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. I will only add, they cannot be diſappointed in this hope. "It is a hope that maketh not aſhamed," Rom. 5.5. and it is promiſed, "they ſhall never be confounded." Principally, becauſe, as the promiſes are founded on the truth and immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability of God; ſo the time of their fulfilment is infallibly fixed and aſcertained: ſo that nothing might be wanting to ſupport "the great conſolation of the heirs of theſe promiſes." Our Saviour and his apoſtles have f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the time of their ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filment to the great reſurrection and judgment day. So that the faith and hopes of all good men in all ages (unleſs a few univerſaliſts be counted an exception) will ſuffer an amazing diſappointment, if they are not put in poſſeſſion of the heavenly inheritance, they have been looking, waiting, hoping for, in that day. It is impoſſible, for (3dly.) it is certain, that in the great reſurrection and judgment day, they will be put into this inheritance, in that glorious kingdom. The evidence of this, I ſhould think, is as clear and ſtrong, as can be wiſhed. All the prophets, from Enoch to St. John, point us to it, as the great day of retribution, and of rendering the rewards and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments of the inviſible and eternal world: and there is not a hint in revelation of any other retribution, after this. Our Saviour's motto is, "Behold I come quickly, and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work ſhall be,"
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:019737_0280_0FACA8177306DDC0"/>
Rev. 22.12. to render to every one the full reward, either of the promiſe or threatning. In his parables of the net—of the ſower—of the pounds and talents he aſſures us at the end of the world, he will execute his promiſes and threatnings in the recompences of the inviſible world, to the faithful and to the wicked. And in the 25th of Matthew he gives us the proceſs of the future judgment, and of the final everlaſting ſentences to the one and the other. The great doctrine of juſtification aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure us, the juſtified will then be ſaved from the wrath to come, and be inſtated immediately, in eternal life. And our Lord hath promiſed the good ſhall be rewarded in the reſurrection of the juſt, Luke 14.14. no doubt with the promiſed rewards in heaven. He repeatedly promiſes to them that believe "ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life, and that he will raiſe them up at the laſt day." To what? undoubtedly to the inheritance of this eternal life, with which he connects the promiſe. Accordingly, Dr. Taylor ſays, "that the revival and reſurrection of the body is frequently put for our advancement to eternal life."<note n="†" place="bottom">Note on Rom. 8.11.</note> At his coming again he will receive his faithful diſciples to the menſions prepared for them in heaven, according to promiſe, John 14.1, 2, 3. And St. Paul makes their reſurrection, when death is ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in victory, coincident in time, with their receiving their houſe not made with hands, eternal in the heavens, as before noted, 2 Cor. 5.1, 2, 3, 4. St. Peter teaches, his ſecond coming will be for the final regulation of all things, ſpoken by all the prophets, Acts 3.21. Certainly then he will fulfil all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and threatnings relating to the future and inviſible world. And conſequently, will put the ſaints into their final and eternal promiſed inheritance. Accordingly this ſame apoſtle tells us, this "incorruptible inheritance is now reſerved in heaven" for thoſe "who are kept by the power of God through faith unto ſalvation, ready to be revealed in the laſt time"—the laſt day when time ſhall be no more—"at the appearance of Jeſus Chriſt," when they ſhall receive the end of faith, the ſalvation of their ſouls: "the grace to be brought to them at the revelation of Jeſus Chriſt," 1 Pet. 1.4, 5, 7 and 13th; and he is as expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit as can be, "that faithful under ſhephards ſhall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away," "when the chief ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hard ſhall appear," and not at the end of ages of ages, after the

                     </gap> keep themſelves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt (at his coming) unto eternal life," Jude 21. St. Paul is very expreſs "that Chriſt will appear the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time unto ſalvation," Heb. 9.28. and chriſtians are to be "looking for this bleſſed. hope, and the glorious appearance of the great God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt," to compleat it at his coming, Tit. 2.13. For in that day they ſhall be put into their promiſed heavenly reſt: "reſt with us," ſaith the apoſtle, 2 Theſ. 1.7. "In that day" "all that love his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhall receive their crown, connected with their inheritance, 2 Tim. 3.8. and to paſs ſeveral other paſſages which confirm it. I would obſerve, in addition to all theſe declarations and promiſes of their being put into the poſſeſſion of the heavenly inheritance in that day—they have now the inſuring ſeal and pledge of it, in the ſpirit of promiſe given to, and received by them, which confirms it with the greateſt certainty. We read once and again of chriſtians receiving "the ſpirit of promiſe," "the ſeal and earneſt of the Spirit," and are ſaid to be "ſealed to the day of redemption," (i.e.) until they are compleatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed and put into their final inheritance. We have adduced one, 2 Cor. 5.5. under the foregoing head. I will adduce but one paſſage more to prove by this medium they will certainly be put in poſſeſſion, in that day, viz. thoſe words, "in whom after ye believed, ye were ſealed with that holy Spirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, which is the earneſt of our inheritance, until the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the purchaſed poſſeſſion," Eph. 1.13, 14 verſes. This author admits "this inheritance." to be "the incurruptible, heavenly and eternal inheritance." And that the redemption here intended, is, the redemption and reſurrection of the body, in the glorious "adoption of the ſons of God," Rom. 8.23. p. 150, 3, 4; and the argument to our purpoſe, ſeems very eaſy, clear and ſtrong. The Spirit of promiſe is given to believers, as the earneſt and inſuring pledge of their being put into the poſſeſſion of this heavenly inheritance "at the appointed time:" "this time" is given and noted, the redemption of their bodies and glorious adoption in the great reſurrection and judgment day: the pledge and earneſt to anſwer the intention of it, will continue until they are actually put into poſſeſſion: but the
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:019737_0282_0FACA818E16C3A88"/>
pledge is only unto this redemption of the purchaſed poſſeſſion; and therefore they will infallibly be put into poſſeſſion of this inheritance, in that glorious day. This is of ſuch weight, that with me it would be ſufficient, if there were no futher confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. But we ſee the whole tenor of ſcripture teaches the ſame thing. And this author himſelf teaches, "the faithful ſervants of God will be immediately inſtated in eternal life, upon their reſurrection in the great day," p. 90. No one will diſpute he means eternal, in the ſtrict ſenſe. And from this ſingle point, their doctrine of the millennium is confuted and abſolutely excluded. It is not poſſible to be avoided by a pretence, that although they are "inſtated in eternal life," yet the enjoyment of that inheritance may be deferred, till after the millennium and thoſe ages are ended. For it is an abſurd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it amounts to this, "that they are put in and yet kept out of their inheritance at the ſame time," and becauſe all theſe forecited ſcriptures, and many others witneſs againſt it, and for another clear deciſive reaſon, which I ſhall proceed to illuſtrate, viz. "becauſe our Saviour expreſsly conſigns them to this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance in the kingdom of their heavenly Father, in that great day." Theſe are his words, "then ſhall the King ſay unto them on his right-hand, Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world," Mat. 25.34. This cannot be the new earth reſurrection king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, they tell of, for that is prepared at or after the judgment; but, by this ſentence, they are introduced to poſſeſs another kingdom "prepared for them before the foundation of the world." It is doubtleſs that kingdom they "now receive" by promiſe "which ſhall never be moved," Heb. 12.28. And if we compare this ſentence, with our Saviour's previous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to put them into the actual poſſeſſion of their heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's kingdom, in that day: it ſhould ſeem it muſt put it out of diſpute and doubt, in the chriſtian world. For he tells us, in the concluſion of the parable of the ſower, that when he ſhall ſettle the kingdom in the judgment day; then (at that very time) ſhall the righteous ſhine forth as the ſun, in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear it." Mat. 13.43. The kingdom is then changed. The final ſentence introduces the righteou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> into the heavenly inheritance; and
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:019737_0283_0FACA819A0CB2828"/>
with it, they are tranſlated out of the kingdom of Chriſt, into the kingdom of their Father, to ſhine as the ſun in that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in which "God is all in all." The kingdom is given up in that day, when they are put into actual poſſeſſion, to "inherit" the everlaſting kingdom of their Father. Where then is the new earth, millennium reſurrection kingdom? it is abſolutely excluded. By what authority? the higheſt in heaven and earth, the ſupreme Judge of all worlds. And let it be baniſhed the chriſtian world forever, to be no more a ſtumbling-block in it.</p>
                  <p>It remains to be ſhewn laſtly, That at that very time, when the righteous are tranſlated out of the kingdom of Chriſt, into the glorious kingdom of their Father, and the Son in fact gives up the kingdom to the Father; the wicked ſhall be ſhut out of that kingdom, and have no inheritance in it. And the words of our Lord are full and expreſs in point: "So ſhall it be in the end of the world. The Son of man ſhall ſend forth his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and they ſhall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them that do iniquity; and ſhall caſt them into a furnace of fire; there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth. Then (at that ſame time) ſhall the righteous ſhine forth as the ſun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear it," Mat. 13.40, 41, 42, 43. It ſeems very evident from theſe words, that Chriſt will reign no longer—and that this ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of his kingdom is final and for eternity: for all his good ſubjects are introduced "to inherit" the kingdom of the Father. And when caught up to meet the Lord in the air, and conducted by him into the everlaſting manſions of glory in this kingdom, after judgment, the kingdom is compleatly given up: and it is at this time all the wicked are caſt out, and conſigned to their future puniſhment. And all his parables upon this awful ſubject, are expreſs in their being caſt out at that period. And ſo is the exhibition of the ſentences of the laſt judgment, Mat. 25th; and when the righteous ſhall go into the poſſeſſion of eternal life in the kingdom of their Father, the wicked ſhall go away into everlaſting puniſhment, as in the laſt verſe. And he gives us one more deciſive evidence of it, where he repreſents the diſpenſation of mercy to be ended, and the door of mercy to be ſhut, at that awful period. When he will ſay to the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, "depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity, there ſhall be
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:019737_0284_0FACA81A610E18E0"/>
weeping and gnaſhing of teeth, when ye ſhall ſee Abraham, Iſaac and Jacob, and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, and you yourſelves thruſt out." And they ſhall come from the eaſt, and from the weſt, and from the north, and from the ſouth and ſhall ſit down in the kingdom of God," Luk. 13.26, 27, 28, 29. It is moſt plain, at that period, when all the righteous ſhall be tranſlated into that kingdom of God, prepared for them before the foundation of the world, and ſit down in the full poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of it, as their eternal inheritance, and ſhall ſhine as the ſun in it: then ſhall all the wicked be thruſt out of it, accurſed, devoted to miſery: for they cannot ſee them in that kingdom un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they are actually put into the poſſeſſion of it: and this is the date of their final miſery. And St. Paul is clear, repeated, and expreſs in teaching the ſame doctrine, that "the wicked ſhall not inherit the kingdom of God," 1 Cor. 9.10. and Gal. 5.21, before cited. And what expreſſions can be more ſtrong and pointed than thoſe, that "they have not any inheritance in the kingdom of Chriſt, and of God" the Father, when the righteous ſhall ſhine forth as the ſun in it? Eph. 5.5. Had this author found any texts, ſo clear and deciſive for his ſcheme, he would have rung it in both our ears, "what a poor, lean, low conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the common conſtruction, compared to his." As the reſult of the whole, the following grand points ſeem deciſively clear, viz. "that the deciſion of the laſt judgment is final and for eternity, both with reſpect to the righteous and wicked: that, at that period, the Son will give up the kingdom, and God will be all in all: that, Chriſt will reign no longer in the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and office of a Saviour and Judge: that their ſcheme of an intermediate, millennium kingdom, between the final judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and his giving up the kingdom, is a deluding fancy: that, the doctrine of retribution in the ſtrict ſenſe, as oppoſed to the idea of diſcipline is fully and firmly eſtabliſhed: and the doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine of the final ſalvation of all the finally diſobedient, upon every ſcheme that hath been or can be advanced, is fully refuted and overthrown. This author admits (p. 8, 10, 11.) if the next ſtate is final, as we have before ſhewn and now more fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, "that it is impoſſible that all men ſhould be finally ſaved." But it will not follow, as is ſuggeſted, that we muſt give a low ſenſe "to Chriſt's reigning forever and ever:" for
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:019737_0285_0FACA81B20832E60"/>
he will be adored "as king of ſaints forever," and as the divine "Logos," who was with God and was God before creation; he will reign jointly with the Father and the Holy Ghoſt in that kingdom wherein "God is all in all," to eternity. The main point being fully proved and ſettled, "that the next ſtate is final," we become agreed, "it is impoſſible that all men ſhould be finally ſaved." I ſhall cloſe this diſcuſſion, with this remark. It is evident, that our Saviour and his apoſtles not only taught theſe great articles of the chriſtian faith in their connexion, with great plainneſs, but alſo laboured to impreſs a near, lively, realizing and governing belief of theſe inviſible and eternal things upon the hearts and conſciences of men, as of the laſt importance to them, to induce them to believe, to live and walk by the faith of them, that they might be ſaved: theſe were "the mighty weapons of their warfare." Now, if they were divinely taught of God, the moſt wiſe and effectual way to deal with the hearts and conſciences of men, to direct their views, to controul and ſubdue their paſſions, to form their choice, their tempers and effectual purſuit of the bleſſings of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, and to make them good men and chriſtians: the ſenſible reader will judge, whether the counter inſtructions, to unhinge and unſettle the minds of men, and render them ſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical about thoſe great articles of the chriſtian faith; and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, about the great and precious goſpel promiſes of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly inheritance, and withal to remove inviſible and eternal things, at an almoſt immenſe diſtance, to ſome unknown period, ages of ages after the laſt judgment, be not of very pernicious conſequence to the great intereſt of the kingdom of God and to the ſouls of men: and he will eaſily judge, from the ſpirit and doctrines of the inſpired teachers, which of the two doctrines is the truth: and by the nature and tendency of them, which of the two ſchemes is moſt for the glory of God, for the honour of Chriſt, and is beſt fitted to promote the beſt intereſt of mankind in this world and world to come.</p>
                  <p>His cloſing proof is, Gen. 3.15. "And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy ſeed and her ſeed: it ſhall bruiſe thy head, and thou ſhalt bruiſe his heel." It is ſaid, "by the ſeed of the woman," Chriſt is principally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; and by the bruiſing the ſerpent's head, is ſignified his
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:019737_0286_0FACA81BEAEBA3F0"/>
compleat victory over the devil, under the emblem of a ſerpent. Agreed. But how will he accompliſh this victory, is the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? he tells us "the words are an alluſion to the way of kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſerpents, by ſtriking at the head." We doubt it: "that it is expreſſive of the ſame thing with killing a ſerpent." Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently it means, "that he ſhall deſtroy the devil," not "his being," but "that kingdom of ſin," which as a tempter he had introduced into the world, accompanied with "ſorrow and death," p. 232, 3. To my underſtanding, this ſtating is not clear; it ſeems too looſe: and ambiguous, by mixing things which come under a diſtinct, different conſtruction. Sin is the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience and rebellion of the creature againſt God: but ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and death is the puniſhment of this iniquity, appointed, not by the tempter, but, by God the righteous governor and judge, in vindication of his own injured honour, authority and government, and for the beſt good of it. Therefore, the blen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſin, ſorrow and death together, as one work and kingdom, according to the argumentative intention of the author, ſeems confuſion. The truth of fact, I take to be this: the devil was now ſetting up his kingdom, in oppoſition to that of the Moſt High, by ſeducing his ſubjects; with deſign to ſubvert the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and moral government of God, and deſtroy the whole world of mankind. Now, "the kingdom of ſin" doth not to me, comprehend and convey the idea of this kingdom, clearly. And the deſign of the promiſe, as explained by ſubſequent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, I take to be this—that Chriſt ſhould entirely deſtroy the kingdom of the devil, as it is oppoſed to the honour, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and government of God, and deſigned for the ſubverſion of it; and likewiſe defeat his deſign to deſtroy the whole hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man race, by opening a way of ſalvation to mankind, and ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a glorious innumerable ſeed out of them, and finally deſtroy him and his inimical adhering ſeed, in utter ruin. From the other ſtating of this kingdom it is inferred, "this firſt promiſe fairly leads us to look for the time, when ſin ſhall be totally and abſolutely deſtroyed by him who was born of a woman," and this is called the moſt ſimple conſtruction of it, p. 234, 5. to me it appears the very reverſe. If ſin, is the kingdom to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, and it ſhall be totally and abſolutely deſtroyed, then it ſeems it will be deſtroyed in the devil and his angels, and they
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:019737_0287_0FACA81CA1596A20"/>
ſhall be ſaved, as well as mankind. For if ſin be a kingdom, it cannot be totally and abſolutely deſtroyed, while there is any ſin in the univerſe. And it concludes as ſtrongly for the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the fallen angels, as the finally diſobedient of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: and ſo do ſeveral others of their arguments. If the happineſs of the creature be the ultimate end of the creation, and "if all enemies without exception ſhall be ſubdued, and they cannot be ſubdued without deſtroying their characters as rebels, and by their reduction to willing ſubjection to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of God," theſe with other arguments, conclude as forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly for the final happineſs of the devil and his angels, as the finally impenitent of mankind. And this I take to be their true ſcheme, nor can they be conſiſtent with themſelves, without it. Will this text bear ſuch a conſtruction? The connexion with the foregoing verſe ſhews it announced, as a curſe upon the devil and his inimical ſeed; a curſe of final remedilous deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; like that of bruiſing a ſerpent's head with an incurable, deadly wound. But in their conſtruction, we are taught to read it, as a bleſſing, and the higheſt that could be pronounced upon them. As a curſe, it is written, "I will put enmity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thee and the woman," but in their conſtruction of the kingdom of ſin totally and abſolutely deſtroyed, it muſt be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal friendſhip between them: as a curſe it is written, "and between thy ſeed and her ſeed," "the ſeed of evil doers," "the children of diſobedience in whom he reigns," "the generation of vipers," "the born after the fleſh who perſecute them that are born after the ſpirit," deſcribed in ſcripture as his ſeed, and Chriſt, and them that are his, his willing and obedient ſubjects; but in the other conſtruction, inſtead of perpetual enmity, it is I will put away all enmity, between the two ſeeds, and introduce an everlaſting reconciliation, harmony, healing and peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. Again, the "bruiſing of the head" in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of a curſe, teaches the final overthrow of the devil, his inimical ſeed and kingdom, in a remedilous deſtruction: but if this "bruiſing" fall not upon "the being of the devil" and his inimical ſeed, but upon the kingdom of ſin, and deſtroys it totally and abſolutely; it ſpeeks to the devil and his ſeed an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal exemption from bruiſing and puniſhment: as another author expreſſes it, "by exterminating both natural and moral
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:019737_0288_0FACA81D60D8B100"/>
evil, and introducing univerſal happineſs," "final, univerſal happineſs." Now can any text be more directly oppoſed in the letter and ſpirit of it, and be more effectually deſtroyed by any expoſition, than is effected in this text, in ſuch a conſtruction?<note n="‖" place="bottom">The ſenſe given to this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Whereas, there is not perhaps an object on earth, of greater natural horror and contempt to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, than a vnenomous ſerpent deeply and mortally wounded in the head, ſo as to be utterly diſabled from hurting, and yet wreathing and agonizing in pain. A fit emblem to exhibit the impotent rage and everlaſting ſhame and pain of final enemies to God. At any rate, the word "bruiſing" muſt have a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilar ſenſe, when applied to the heel and head in the ſame ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. Now we know the ſeed of the woman, "the Meſſiah," was "bruiſed in the heel," in the way of reproach and ſufferings. Muſt not the bruiſing of the head be likewiſe, in a way of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed ſufferings to him and his inimical ſeed, ſufferings, that are capital, final, without remedy and without end? Surely, the ſame word, cannot have an oppoſite meaning, in the ſame ſentence: in one part, mean reproach and ſufferings; and in the other part, unſpeakably the greater "bruiſing," mean, an eternal exemption from reproach and ſufferings, in everlaſting peace and happineſs. This would be to confound language utterly, and render it impoſſible to fix the meaning of words. Their conſtruction then is impoſſible to be true. It is to be noted, the promiſes and predictions of God, (and this text par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes of both) are beſt underſtood in their eventual illuſtration. And indeed this is the only key where we can have it, by which we can have full ſatisfaction of their meaning. Now, if we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the eventual illuſtration given by inſpiration, the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral meaning becomes clear and beyond doubt. The text
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:019737_0289_0FACA81E22446278"/>
doth indeed contain a promiſe of the adorable Meſſiah, that he ſhall have a ſeed and generation to ſerve him more numerous than the ſtars of heaven—that he will ſet up his kingdom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, to the ſubverſion and overthrow of that of the wicked one—that it ſhall prevail, become exceeding great and laſt forever—it ſhall ſpread over all the nations of the whole world, and innumerable multitudes out of all nations ſhall be gathered into it, be reſcued from the power of ſin and ſatan, become his willing ſubjects, be made free by the Son of God, and be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franchiſed in the glorious liberties and happineſs of the children of God in this world, in heaven and eternity. That however there may and will be a ſeed of the old ſerpent, from Cain thro' many generations, of them that are born after the fleſh, who perſecute them that are born after the Spirit, "a ſeed of evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doers and generation of vipers, children of diſobedience, in whom he reigns, as deſcribed in ſacred record, who are led captive to do his will and ſupport his kingdom; yet the ſubjects of Chriſt, and followers of the Lamb ſhall overcome all their ſpiritual enemies, through the blood, power and grace of the Lamb, (ſatan ſhall be bruiſed under their feet) and having ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and ſuffered with Chriſt, ſhall alſo reign with him in eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal glory and triumph, in that kingdom of God, which will be eternally triumphant. And when Chriſt ſhall have fully effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his great deſigns in this world, and put his people in the compleat poſſeſſion of the great ſalvation, he will then "bruiſe the head of the ſerpent" with a moſt tremendous capital puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, deſtroying his kingdom and conſigning the devil and his angels, and all his inimical ſeed, who will not have Chriſt to rule over them; in the everlaſting fire, originally prepared for the devil and his angels. This in ſubſtance, is the expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and illuſtration of this text as a promiſe and prediction, which is evidently exhibited, throughout the revelations of God. And it is ſo far from teaching the doctrine of univerſal ſalvation, that the contrary doctrine is implicitly taught in the bruiſing in the text, for the puniſhment will certainly fall upon the inimical ſeed, the workers of iniquity, as well as upon the devil and his angels. But it is objected, ſin the work of the devil muſt be deſtroyed, or the Saviour hath not done his work; and how "in any propriety of ſenſe, can it be deſtroyed, while
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:019737_0290_0FACA81EE20C9D20"/>
millions live in enmity to God?" to which we reply: ſin is in fact deſtroyed, according to the meaning of this and other ſcriptures, in the manner already explained. It is totally and abſolutely in all the redeemed and ſaved. And as to its malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity againſt God, his government and good ſubjects, it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe effectually deſtroyed in them that periſh. It can never operate diſhonour to God, to his authority, laws and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; nor temptation or any injury to his good ſubjects; under an eternal puniſhment, according to its full deſert. In this puniſhment, divine juſtice is ſatisfied, holineſs illuſtrared, the law is magnified, and the divine authority and government are as firmly eſtabliſhed, as though ſin had never come into exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. And ſurely, it can operate no temptation to his good ſubjects, under ſuch a full and eternal illuſtration of the infinite ill-demerit and malignity of it. And the conſigned to this puniſhment, are put under an abſolute impoſſibility of giving any diſturbance to the divine government, or doing any injury to the good and happy ſubjects of it. So that as it is an object of divine governmental concern (principally regarded in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of Chriſt) it is abſolutely deſtroyed; and the Saviour has compleated his work, in abſolute perfection and glory. As in the governments of this world, when a murderer is appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, convicted, condemned and executed, by the hand of public juſtice: law and juſtice is ſatisfied, and authority and government are as firmly eſtabliſhed, and the good ſubjects are as effectually ſecured, as though the murder had not been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. And in ſcripture ſtile, "the land is purged and clean from blood." But that it is the deſign of God and a work aſſigned to the Saviour, totally and abſolutely to deſtroy ſin and the puniſhment of it out of exiſtence, we certainly no where read in ſcripture. Contrarywiſe, that ſin will forever exiſt, not as tempter, or a pleaſure, but as a tormentor in whom it reigns, is abundantly taught us. That the wicked "ſhall receive the fruit of their doings," "be filled with miſchief," "with their own devices and their own ways," and that "their worm ſhall never die," &amp;c. theſe things are as plainly taught, as words can teach them. It is likewiſe objected as inconceivable, how the devil's kingdom can be deſtroyed, while millions in hell, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining their characters as rebels againſt God, remain the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:019737_0291_0FACA81FA077DBF0"/>
of it. The whole force of the objection reſts on this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, a ſuppoſition, that there is but one way to deſtroy it; which is a miſtake in fact. The objection ſuppoſes, it can only be deſtroyed by reſcuing the ſubjects of it from ſin and miſery, and bringing them to ſubjection and ſalvation, in God. So in fact it is deſtroyed in reſpect to all the ſanctified, redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſaved out of this ſinful world. But there is another way alſo, in which it is deſtroyed, clearly taught us in divine revelation, wherein "the bruiſing the head" in this text, will have a final illuſtration and fulfilment. It is particularly poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out Rev. 20. 10th and 15th, as hath been before explained. It ſeems ſelf-evident, his kingdom is in abſolute ruin, when the devil and his angels and all workers of iniquity, are conſigned to the future puniſhment, and overwhelmed in ruin everlaſting. All rule, authority and power oppoſing the kingdom of God and Chriſt, and upholding the devil's kingdom, are eternally put down. It is hell as will as death without order,—without ſuperiority or inferiority among the wretched: all are reduced to a level, held and puniſhed as the criminals, of the divine juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. Juſt as a kingdom or province in rebellion may be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by their willing ſubjection, or by force of arms and juſtice. The whole may be captivated, reduced and impriſoned; the king, princes, nobles and ſubjects, all in one ſtate of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and puniſhment. The victory is compleat: all authority, power and rule which ſubſiſted in the rebellion is put down; and all without diſtinction upon a level in puniſhment. The kingdom is, as totally in ruin, in this laſt way, as in that of wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſubjection. As to the reduced, in the one way and the other, there is a moſt eſſential difference: but none as to the deſtruction and extinction of the kingdom itſelf. Both ways of deſtroying the kingdom of the wicked one, are clearly and fully taught in ſcripture; and the latter as clearly and fully as the former. In this view this text gives moſt important inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and warning to all men: it teacheth us to believe in the adorable Saviour here promiſed and become his willing and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient people, that we periſh not, put have everlaſting life, in him. And it warns us to renounce the devil and all his works and ways, in a faithful ſerving the living God: for if we conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue the ſervants of ſin and ſatan, the time is certainly coming,
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:019737_0292_0FACA8208B740990"/>
when this promiſed Meſſiah, will deſtroy the devil's kingdom in an eternal deſtruction, and in ſuch a manner as to compleat the everlaſting ruin of him and all his ſubjects.</p>
                  <p>PROPOSITION VI. "The ſcripture language, concerning the reduced or reſtored<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in conſequence of the mediatory inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Jeſus Chriſt, is ſuch as to lead us into the thought that they are comprehenſive of mankind univerſally."</p>
                  <p>"There is one text he will venture to ſay is fully comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of this idea, that the redeemed by Chriſt are comprehenſive of mankind univerſally." It is Rev. 5.13. "And every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which is in heaven, and on earth, and under the earth, and ſuch as are in the ſea, and all that are in them, heard I ſaying, Bleſſing, and honour, and glory and power be unto him that ſitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb forever and ever."</p>
                  <p>Upon which he argues, "theſe words evidently look forward to the completion of the ſcheme of God with reference to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, or to the time of God's being all in all; bringing in the ſinleſs intelligences above, as uniting with the whole race of Adam, in giving the glory of their redemption to God, who contrived it, and to Chriſt that carried it into execution." "And that mankind univerſally are the perſons ſinging this hymn of praiſe, in concert with the holy angels, he ſays, is evident from the enumeration here made, which is in the fulleſt and moſt extenſive terms:" "for it is the creatures in heaven, on earth, under the earth, and in the ſeas, and all things in them." And adds, "the whole human kind are found in the places ſpecified, and the ſpecification of the places which contains them all, is a ſure argument he intended to comprehend them all." And he quotes the deſcription in the 20th chapter as parallel to confirm it. "And I ſaw the dead, ſmall and great, ſtand before God," that is Chriſt the Judge, v. 12. "and the ſea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and hell delivered the dead which were in them," v. 13. He adds, the creatures ſpoken of in the 5th chapter as under the earth, are thoſe very ones, of whom it is ſaid in this place "death and hell gave up the dead in them," (the text doth not ſay ſo, it is without any proof) and "the creatures in the ſea" he ſays, "are the dead that the ſea is here ſaid to give up," (all without proof) whence he concludes, as the enumeration of creatures in the 5th, is more particular and
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:019737_0293_0FACA8215076D800"/>
ſtronger than "of the dead" in the 20th, mankind univerſally muſt be comprehended in it." The more natural inference is, the apoſtle doth not mean the ſame creatures preciſely in the two deſcriptions. "He is pretty confident, no other ſenſe can be given of this text, allowing the words their due natural force and a conſiſtent meaning," p. 238, 9, 40, 41. To me it is clear, this conſtruction cannot be ſupported by any juſt, known rule of expoſition whatever. He takes for granted the text looks forward to the time when the ſcheme of God will be compleated, and he will be all in all. If allowed, this cannot help him: for we have proved this will take place at the period of the laſt judgment when the wicked will be excluded ſalvation, and conſequently, from taking part in this ſong. Beſides, the text is immediately connected with "Chriſt's receiving the book and opening the ſeals" to unfold the grand ſcenes of providence to take place, to the future judgment, when the wicked, ſo far from joining with the redeemed in the celebration of this divine ſong, "ſhall be caſt into the lake of fire," Rev. 20.15. Again, he takes for granted, that "every creature" in this text, means mankind, them only, and univerſally; without any ſupport from the text, the context and connexion; and when it is never ſo uſed in the new teſtament, as we have before ſhewn; and when we have proved from 1 Tim. 4.4. this very phraſe is uſed for the inferior part of the creation, only. He likewiſe takes for granted, this deſcription and that in the 20th chapter are parallel; whereas, it is clear they are not ſo in expreſſion or deſign. The deſign, in the 5th chapter is to illuſtrate the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries due and to be paid to God and Chriſt in his ſtate of exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; not only for the benefits of his redemption, but for his ſupreme powers of government, and the benefits of his divine adminiſtration; of which every creature in all this lower crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in earth and ſeas partake, and therefore may all naturally and literally be taken in with mankind as ſubſerving his praiſe. But the 20th hath reſpect to the final judgment, and therefore to mankind only. And the deſcription of all the dead raiſed in earth and ſeas, "of all the dead ſmall and great ſtanding before God" is ſo particular and appropriate to mankind, as cannot poſſibly be miſtaken. "Every creature" is not found, in this latter deſcription. To ſettle the meaning of the text, the words
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:019737_0294_0FACA821E0DD25A0"/>
muſt be taken either literally or figuratively; in both ways I conceive his conſtruction muſt fail of ſupport. If the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion "ſaying" be taken figuratively, "that his adorable admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration opening upon the world, would be ſo glorious and extenſively beneficial, that all creatures in earth and ſeas as well as mankind ſhould partake of the benefits; and all in fact be made to ſubſerve the glory and praiſe of him that ſits upon the throne and of the Lamb, in concert with the holy part of the creation: agreeable to other prophetick deſcriptions "all thy works ſhall praiſe thee, O Lord, and thy ſaints ſhall bleſs thee," Pſa. 145.10. And as the idea of the glory of his adminiſtration was taught the prophet Iſaiah by the ſeraphims, when he ſaw Chriſt's glory; "the whole earth is full of his glory," Iſa. 6.1, 2, 3. and John 12.41. If this be the true meaning of this text, as ſeems moſt probable, it takes away the whole ground of the other conſtruction: and if the text be taken literally, and the word creature be limited to mankind and the praiſe be vocal only, for which no one hath any warrant, yet I conceive his conſtruction muſt fail: for the text had doubtleſs a literal ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filment in the time of the viſion; or which is the ſame thing, in the ſenſe intended, it was at that time true, in fact. The diction in the text ſpeaks it plainly. Conſequently, if it looks forward to another fulfilment, it will doubtleſs be of the ſame kind eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially. This is the general ſcripture rule, where a twofold lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral accompliſhment is deſigned: of which the forecited in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, Acts 11. is a deciſive illuſtration. The future pouring out of the Spirit, will be eſſentially the ſame, and for the ſame grand purpoſe, of ſanctifying and ſaving men; as in that day. Now in the time of the viſion, there was none of the wicked raiſed from the dead, out of the earth or ſeas to join in this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ſong; and we infer there never will be, in any future period. They are excluded the text. Again, if taken literally, all that are or ever will be in hell, are excluded. They are excluded in the diction in the text, which limits it to creature, in heaven, on earth, under the earth and in the ſeas. Hell is left out of the deſcription: and there is not a text in ſcripture, that extends the benefit of Chriſt's adminiſtration to any, after they are ſent into that place of torment. Further, it ſeems it cannot be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled after the future judgment, in which the wicked will be
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:019737_0295_0FACA822A09EB928"/>
condemned; for then the earth and ſeas will be burnt up, and be no more. And it ſeems a groſs abſurdity to predicate ſight and hearing upon "creatures on earth, under the earth, and in the ſeas," when in fact there is no earth, no ſeas nor any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in them, to be ſeen. Conſequently, the condemned in that day muſt be forever excluded a part in this divine ſong, by the literal deſcription in the text. And it is to be noted, it cannot be fulfilled in the new earth; for it is expreſsly inſerted in it, "there was no more ſea," Rev. 21.1. Upon the literal conſtruction, this muſt be taken literally. And as there is no ſea there for creatures to be in, the diction of the text excludes a fulfilment of it, there. Moreover, if the creature muſt be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited to mankind, and the conſtruction ſtrictly literal; it ſeems the ſight and hearing muſt be ſo, likewiſe. And upon this ſcheme, what a ſtrange ſight and hearing muſt this be extended to ſee and hear creatures on the earth and under the earth and in the ſeas, ages of ages after the future judgment; and as many ages, after there has had been in fact, no earth, nor ſeas, nor creatures to be ſeen in them. Surely, this ſight and hearing muſt be figurative with a witneſs: for it figures away the earth and ſeas and creatures in them, the very foundation of the viſion itſelf: it is ſuch a figure as is not to be found in revelation, nor in any of the good rhetoricions of this world. Now by all this, it ſeems evident that his expoſition which includes all the finally wicked in this deſcription, cannot be ſupported, but is every way confuted, by the ſtrict, literal conſtruction of the text.— Whereas, the ſenſe we have given of it, is eaſy and important, and well comports with the deſign of the prophecy. I will only add, ſhould we admit the "creature" here, means rational creature only, it will not follow that it means the whole race of mankind; or more, than the holy and obedient part of it, only. For two reaſons: one is, that it is common to find a greater licence in heightening deſcriptions in poetic, hieroglypic and prophetic writings, than in thoſe that are didactic, narrative or argumentative: and we are not bound to the ſame ſtrict rule of literal conſtruction, nor will they often bear it. And this limitation of it, to the holy part of the creation, will very well accord in the connexion of the viſion: for it is the holy ones in heaven, and elders from our world only, that are employed in
<pb n="277" facs="unknown:019737_0296_0FACA82361E3FAC8"/>
this glorious chorus, in the preceeding part. From whence it is rational to ſuppoſe, this deſcription to be a prophetic repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of "every creature" of the ſame character, heavenly ſpirit and temper, on earth and in the ſeas, that in due time ſhall be brought to bear a part in this divine ſong; and this, revelation very clearly teaches, will be the truth of fact. The other reaſon is, that it is agreeable to the ſpirit of the prophetic writings, to uſe ſuch a ſtrong manner of deſcription when the friends of God and his people, only, are intended. Of this we have a deciſive example in the univerſal ſong of praiſe of all in heaven and earth in the deſtruction of old Babylon, Jer. 51.48. "Then the heaven and the earth, and <hi>all that is therein,</hi> ſhall ſing for Babylon: for the ſpoiler ſhall come unto her, from the north, ſaith the Lord." Now a man of ingenuity, who had a ſcheme to ſupport by it, would make it very plauſible, that mankind univerſally were concerned in this ſong. He would ſay, by "heaven and earth" are meant the intelligent inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants of both worlds; by earth is intended earth and ſeas, as Col. 1.16; and by "all that is therein" is included and intended all that have ever lived, and died and been buried in earth and ſeas, which comprehends all mankind. Whereas, what is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by this ſtrong deſcription is the friends of God, of juſtice and of the people of God, the jews who were to have deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance by it. The many millions in the foregoing ages, who were gone off the ſtage, could have no concern in it. The numerous Babylonians who were ruined by the judgment, muſt certainly be excepted, notwithſtanding "the all that is therein:" they could not chant the ſong of their own deſtruction againſt the force of ſelf-love, the natural deſire of life and good, and the moſt deep-rooted affections of nature; the ſuppoſition, is the greateſt abſurdity. Again, their vaſtly numerous connexions, by affinity, commerce, friendſhip and the like, conſiſting of many thouſands, perhaps millions, muſt be exempted and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, on the ſame ground. Now I ſee not but the text in diſpute may juſt as well have the ſame limited conſtruction. The context clearly leads to it, and it is the ſanctified in this world only ſhall have part in the ſalvation on which the ſong is ſuppoſedly founded. "The every creature" as applied to all of that diſtinctive character, is highly proper. And it is full as
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:019737_0297_0FACA82420BE6A70"/>
abſurd to ſuppoſe thoſe who periſh from the ſalvation of God, ſhould bear a part in this divine ſong, as that thoſe who periſhed in Babylon ſhould take a part in that which was ſung on that occaſion. Now either this, or the expoſition we have before given, I apprehend, "will allow the words their natural due force, and a conſiſtent meaning."</p>
                  <p>We have now conſidered, and I hope fully anſwered all his principal proofs; but there are ſeveral other texts which he, and others in that ſentiment, lay weight upon, which require our notice. Such as the predictions and promiſes to Abraham, Gen. 12.2, 3. "And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bleſs thee, and make thy name great, and thou ſhalt be a bleſſing. And I will bleſs them that bleſs thee, and curſe him that curſeth thee: and in thee ſhall all the families of the earth be bleſſed." And chap. 18.18. "And all the nations of the earth ſhall be bleſſed in him." And chap. 22.18. "In thy ſeed ſhall all the nations of the earth be bleſſed." Chap. 15.5. "Look now toward heaven, and tell the ſtars, if thou be able to number them: and he ſaid unto him, ſo ſhall thy ſeed be." Upon theſe texts, it is ſaid, "that all nations and all the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of the earth" is naturally expreſſive of all mankind; and ſo uſed in ſcripture. That the words conſidered in themſelves, and much more in connexion with the other texts he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, very readily offer this ſenſe: and that none other fully comes up to the number expreſſed in the laſt:<note n="‖" place="bottom">P. 241, 2, 3, 4.</note> and enquires, what conſtruction can be more honourable? &amp;c. We reply, that which is true, and agreeable to fact. This deſcant we judge too ſuperficial, to form a deciſive or probable concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon. So likewiſe, is his general deſcant upon ſimilar pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies and promiſes, couched in general terms and ſtrong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions. He ſays, the partial events, to which they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied commonly, by no means come up to the full meaning of the ſtrong and extenſively benevolent terms, in which they are expreſſed, "and by ſuch conſtructions, there is danger of expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the oracles of God to contempt," p. 251. And I find other writers lay great ſtreſs upon the univerſal terms, "all the ends of the earth," "all people," "nations" "kingdoms" "all fleſh," &amp;c. in which theſe predictions are delivered. It may
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:019737_0298_0FACA824E1092F10"/>
not therefore be improper in this place, to diſcuſs the ſubject generally, to remove the force of theſe arguments, at once. And it ſeems the more proper and requiſite, becauſe theſe others are chiefly ſummary repetitions, or more particular illuſtrations of theſe grand predictions and promiſes made to Abraham; referring to the ſame grand deſign and work of God. The diſcuſſion of the ſubject in two points of view, perhaps may ſet it in a clear and convincing light. (1.) By ſhewing, it is not the deſign of theſe or any other texts of ſcripture, to indicate and aſcertain the preciſe number of mankind that ſhall finally be ſaved. (2dly.) That neither theſe or any other predictions will bear their conſtruction, which is confuted by reaſon, ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and fact. In the firſt place, it ſeems evident, it is not the deſign of revelation, to aſcertain the numbers that ſhall finally be ſaved: it is a ſecret with God, which he hath never revealed. It is a curioſity, could do us no good; and is wiſely concealed from u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>: the whole tenor of revelation teaches, it turns upon the characters formed by his grace in this world; and therefore cannot be known by men, only in the day of judgment, when the characters and ſtates of all men will be diſcloſed and finally ſettled. Had this been the deſign of God, why a repetition of promiſes, which, in the expreſſions and connexions of them by no means carry this ſentiment in them? when one promiſe plainly expreſſing all mankind, would have decided the matter? It is not given, and certainly was not deſigned. When the queſtion was moved to our Saviour, "Are there few that be ſaved?" Luke 13.23. our Lord had the faireſt occaſion in the world, to ſettle this matter deciſively, by his own authority, as to the full extent of the plan of mercy and the preciſe numbers to be ſaved. He hath not done it in their favour. Why not? If it was a fit object of revelation, why did not he, who taught the way of God perfectly, reveal it? If it is the very glory of the goſpel, how can we acquit him, as to wiſdom and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, in not publiſhing it, upon ſo inviting an occaſion? Again, if taught of God, to Abraham, and to the church by Moſes and the prophets, and was in fact a peculiar glory of their doctrine; why did not he, who embraced all occaſions to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the doctrine of Moſes and the prophets, at leaſt refer us to theſe promiſes to Abraham, as a deciſion of the queſtion? an
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:019737_0299_0FACA758E1809960"/>
univerſaliſt would have done it; would have been glad of the occaſion: for they do it without any occaſion given. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour did it not, neither do the apoſtles (tho' often refering to them) once refer to them, in this view. Why did not our Lord do it? Was it becauſe "this doctrine that all men ſhould be ſaved, was unfit to be publiſhed to the world? If ſo, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns them of preſumption and audacity, in adventuring to publiſh to the world, a doctrine, that the wiſdom of our Saviour judged unfit to be taught. Or was it becauſe, there is no truth in this doctrine? this appears the reaſon, in our Lord's reply: that all men will not be finally ſaved, as is conceded, if the next ſtate be final, as hath been proved. And doth not this condemn them, for deluding the world with groſs error, under the garb of a glorious goſpel truth? It is evident in the reply of Chriſt, v. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28. "that many will not ſo ſeek and ſtrive as to enter into life: that in the great day, all workers of iniquity will be conſigned to future miſery; and the door of divine mercy will be ſhut againſt them, that they cannot be ſaved. And it ſeems evident from what hath been ſaid, that the preciſe number that ſhall be ſaved is not an object of divine revelation; and that it cannot be deſigned in theſe promiſes, that all mankind ſhould be the ſubjects of the bleſſings promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; becauſe, the promiſes are never ſo referred to and applied by our Saviour and his apoſtles upon the moſt inviting occaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; as they certainly would have been, if this was their grand intention. Their conſtruction is certainly, beſide and againſt the intention of them. And this will be more clear, while we ſhew ſecondly, their conſtruction is confuted by the concurrent teſtimony of reaſon, ſcripture and fact.—Reaſon and common ſenſe teaches us, if they are bleſſed as families and nations, in Abraham and his ſeed, it muſt be during their exiſtence in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily and national ſtate: and therefore it cannot look back to the pre-exiſtent ungodly families and nations who had a long time periſhed before, and in the flood, and in ſucceſſive gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations after it, to that period. For it ſeems an impoſſibility in nature, that they ſhould be the ſubjects of this bleſſing accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the diction of the text, that is, "be bleſſed as families and nations;" when they then had not, nor ever would have exiſtence more, in family and national ſtate. And beſides,
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:019737_0300_0FACA759B1F89270"/>
predictions never look backwards, it is againſt the nature of them, they always look forward to ſome future period of time for their fulfilment. Neither can it extend beyond the end of the world and the laſt judgment, for then the wicked will never exiſt any more in family and national ſtate, to be in a capacity for theſe bleſſings, according to the diction of the text. Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, the ungodly who periſhed before Abraham, and all the wicked that are condemned in the day of judgment, are cut off from all hope of theſe bleſſings promiſed, by the very language in which it is expreſſed. Again, it cannot be exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to all the families and nations cotemporary with Abraham. The diction is not in the paſt, nor preſent, but in the future tenſe, and points to ſome memorable future period, wherein all the families and nations of the earth then living, ſhall be bleſſed. Beſides, the annexed curſe to his enemies, ſhews, that his enemies did not belong to the families and nations that ſhould be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in him: his friends ſhould be bleſſed, his enemies ſhould be curſed: but that his enemies ſhould be curſed and yet bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in him; the ſame perſons at the ſame time, is repugnant to common ſenſe, and a manifeſt contradiction. By the ſame rule, the families and nations who were accurſed of God, and as ſuch devoted to utter deſtruction, could not be the objects of theſe bleſſings: ſuch as the nations of Canaan, the Amalakites, &amp;c. who were devoted to utter deſtruction and extirpation: to ſuppoſe the God of Abraham ſhould bleſs them with the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings promiſed to Abraham, and curſe, devote and execute utter deſtruction on them, as families and nations, is repugnant to all reaſon. And it is alike certain, that theſe promiſed bleſſings hath not come upon all the families and nations of the natural poſterity of Abraham. Is it true of the Edomites? or of the poſterity of Iſhmael? Is it according to their character and ſtate as predicted by the Spirit of truth? "and he will be a wild man; his hand will be againſt every man, and every man's hand againſt him: and he ſhall dwell in the preſence of all his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren," Gen. 16.22? Is it true of this nation "that all things are reconciled in him," that they all bow to the authority of God, have the faith of Chriſt, and the genuine ſpirit of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel in love and peace and all goſpel obedience, as will be the caſe, when theſe promiſed bleſſings come upon all the nations
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:019737_0301_0FACA75A632C0B28"/>
of the earth? Who, that is acquainted with the hiſtory of the Arabians, and knows their character and manners, living by rapine, robbery, theft and murder from generation to generation, can think they are bleſſed with the diſtinguiſhed bleſſings of Abraham, as families and as a nation? And St. Paul was ſo far from admitting their unlimited ſenſe, that in direct oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to it, he ſhews us plainly, theſe bleſſings were not to take place, in all the families of Abraham's natural poſterity. Not in his poſterity by Keturah, nor by Hagar in the line of Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael, "but in Iſaac ſhall thy ſeed be called," Rom. 9.6, 7, 8. and in the line of Iſaac, in Jacob not Eſau, v. 13. And it is very evident, that theſe bleſſings have not in fact, come upon all the families, in the line of Iſaac and Jacob. Were the families of Corah, Dathan and Abiram and their wicked ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents, who periſhed in terrible wrath, bleſſed with the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar bleſſings of Abraham? Are the Jews now as a nation, in the enjoyment of this bleſſing? when for more than ſeventeen hundred years they have been and now are diſperſed, a hiſſing, curſe and execration among all nations, as predicted by Moſes? Do all their families in this exiled ſtate, enjoy the bleſſings promiſed to Abraham, while the vail is on their hearts, and they remain in blindneſs, unbelief and diſobedience, caſt out of the kingdom of God and become an execration? Such a conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe promiſes as extended to all nations, and all families, to all mankind in all paſt, preſent and future generations, ſeems extravagant in the higheſt degree. When it is ſo notorious in fact, it never was, nor now is, true of any one nation on earth in this extent; no, not of the moſt favoured of Abraham's poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity. Moreover, their conſtruction ſuppoſes, the bleſſings promiſed to the nations and families of the earth, are promiſes of the heavenly inheritance to all, to whom they appertain. But upon what grounds? the ſcripture every where connects this inheritance, not with a family or national character and ſtate, but always with a diſtinctive, diſtinguiſhing, perſonal character, in this life. The promiſes of it are to them, that "believe," repent, who do his commandments, to the pure in heart—in a word, to thoſe who are bleſſed with the faith and piety of Abraham: theſe only by ſcripture account, are ſubjects and heirs of the heavenly inheritance. But ſhould weadmit

theſe promiſes deſigned of the heavenly inheritance, ſtill, their cauſe is in ruins: for the curſe to the enemies of Abraham, and to the accurſed nations and families, muſt be underſtood in the ſame way of conſtruction, to be an eternal excluſion from this inheritance and conſignment to deſtruction: for ſurely, the curſed, ſhall not inherit with the bleſſed. It is clearly, not neceſſary to ſuppoſe, that all the members of the families and nations on whom this bleſſing comes, are the children of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham by that faith whereby "the juſt do live" and ſhall poſſeſs the heavenly inheritance. Eli's family were under this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and yet his ſons were ſons of belial, and cut off in wrath. David's family were ſurely under this bleſſing; and yet his ſons Amnon and Abſalom, were children of ſorrow to him: their wicked lives and violent deaths diveſted him of all hope for them, beyond the grave; and produced a wound in his ſoul in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable by all the world—by every thing, but the grace of the covenant, wherein he had perſonal ſafety; whence he drew his comfort and ſupport, as "all his ſalvation and all his deſire," 2 Sam. 23.5. Well inſtructed and regulated families, profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the chriſtian faith and godlineſs and in covenant with God, are under this bleſſing of Abraham: to ſuch, the apoſtles apply theſe promiſes, as Acts 2.38, 39. Gal. 3.9, 27, 28, 29. and Gal. 4.28. and yet, no judicious perſon will ſay, all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of ſuch families are, of courſe, heirs of the heavenly inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance. So likewiſe nations, bleſſed with the goſpel and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of the kingdom of God, and profeſſing chriſtianity; favoured with happy civil and religious privileges, and all deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable advantages for obtaining the heavenly inheritance, may be called bleſſed: although there may be thouſands of miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſubjects in them, who make themſelves ſo, by their own folly and wickedneſs, running their own ruin, for time and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. In this ſenſe Balaam, by the ſpirit of inſpiration, repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly pronounced Iſrael, a nation bleſſed, and that ſhould be bleſſed: in Numb. 23d and 24th chapters. So ſays our Lord, "Bleſſed are your eyes, for they ſee, and your ears, for they hear: for verily I ſay unto you, that many prophets and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous men have deſired to ſee thoſe things which ye ſee, and have not ſeen them; and to hear thoſe things which ye hear, and have not heard them," Mat. 13.16, 17. and yet he repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly

tells us, many unbelieving, impenitent ſinners under that bleſſed diſpenſation, would be condemned with the workers of iniquity. Theſe things ſerve to expoſe the fallacy of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. But the grand intention of theſe promiſes expreſsly revealed, it ſhould ſeem, muſt clear the ſubject of all difficulty and diſpute. Thus, we are deſignedly taught in them, that God would make Abraham the father of the faithful and ſaved, of all families, ages and generations; as an example to them of ſalvation by faith; or of that faith and piety, whereby they might be ſaved: as Paul teaches us, Rom. 4.11, 12, 13, 16. Their conſtruction is a direct contradiction to it, by extending the promiſe to them, whom our Lord ſays are of their father the devil, who live and die without the faith, piety and works of Abraham. Another thing intended is, that the covenant made with Abraham, whereby his own family were bleſſed with ſpiritual bleſſings and privileges in him, ſhould be extended to all believing families of all nations and ages under the goſpel; in which ſenſe all thoſe families ſhould be bleſſed in him; as in the texts forecited in Acts and Galatians. But "the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to you and your children," is limited to the called and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in this world; and is no where extended to the wicked in the future ſtate. This condemns their conſtruction, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the promiſe to the wicked in the future ſtate, beſide and contrary to the intention of it, for they are excluded out of it. Theſe texts teach us, the adorable Meſſiah, ſhould be of his ſeed, in and by whom, all the nations have all their bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings; and all the believing and ſaved of all nations, ſhould be forever bleſſed. And what is directly to our purpoſe is, we are deſignedly taught in them, that "true believers of all other nations, as well as of the jews, ſhall be juſtified and ſaved in him," this infallible meaning is given us, Gal. 3.7, 8, 9. "Know ye therefore, that they which are of faith, the ſame are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Abraham. And the ſcripture foreſeeing that God would juſtify the heathen through faith, preached the goſpel before unto Abraham, ſaying, "in thee ſhall all nations be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. So then they which be of faith, (of whatever nation) are bleſſed with faithful Abraham." Their conſtruction muſt be thus; the ſcripture foreſeeing that God would juſtify and ſave all nations, the unbelieving as well as believing, preached be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

                     </gap>believing, "they that are of faith" they and they only in the intendment of the promiſe, are children and bleſſed with faithful Abraham. A man muſt want eye ſight who doth not ſee their conſtruction in extending it to all the believing, is in direct contradiction to the apoſtle, and to the intendment of the promiſe, as explained and aſcertained by him. And he is very expreſs in point, in aſcertaining the true intendment of theſe promiſes to Abraham. He tells us expreſsly, the ſeed intended in this great promiſe, is Chriſt, v. 16. and confirms both the extent and limitation of the bleſſings to them who believe, v. 22. "but the ſcripture hath concluded all under ſin, that the promiſe by faith of Jeſus Chriſt might be given to them who believe; and illuſtrates it to the end of the chapter. And this extenſion of theſe bleſſings promiſed, to the believing of all nations without difference, and limitation of them to the believing only; is a doctrine that runs through the ſcripture, and particularly, all the epiſtles of St. Paul. And he hath taught and illuſtrated at large, this limitation of the bleſſings to the believing only, in the caſe of the unbelieving jews, the natural poſterity of Abraham in the line of Iſaac and Jacob, in Rom. 9th, 10th, 11th chapters; ſhewing, they have cut them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves off from theſe bleſſings, by their unbelief; and will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main cut off from them, till the glorious period of the recal of that nation and their ingrafting in again, by faith. What can be more deciſively clear, than the limitation of theſe bleſſings to the believing only? and their conſtruction is as directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the grand practical, as doctrinal intendment of theſe promiſes: they are deſigned to carry a moſt powerful encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement and motive to ſinners of all nations, to look unto Chriſt and turn to God and become his willing people, that they may become the happy ſubjects and heirs of the promiſes. But by extending them to all the unbelieving and diſobedient, the force of this grand motive is annulled, and the great deſign of their reduction in this world, becomes defeated. It is impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant to add, theſe promiſes are deſigned to teach and point us to a moſt memorable future time, in which, all the nations of the earth then exiſting, ſhall literally and remarkably be bleſſed in Chriſt, with the bleſſings of his kingdom and grace, with
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:019737_0305_0FACA75D62F68BD8"/>
family and providential bleſſings, and that for a long and very glorious period. So that all the preceding ſucceſs of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel with jews and gentiles, is but as the firſt fruits to the full harveſt, compared with the fulneſs of the gentiles in all the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of them, and fulneſs of the jews then to be brought into the kingdom of God. So that an innumerable multitude out of all nations and languages, ſhall be ſaved, Rev. 7. But two things intirely overthrow their conſtruction: one is, that theſe bleſſings are appropriate to believing nations, and to all believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in them; and are limited to them deciſively, by the rule of expoſition given us, as hath been ſhewn. They are converted to the faith of Chriſt, and ſo enjoy theſe bleſſings in him. The other is, that however great and extenſive theſe bleſſings are, they come upon all, who ſhall ever participate in them, in this ſtate, before the end of the world. It is while they are in family and national ſtate, as the diction of the text plainly teacheth. And the ſummary repetitions and illuſtrations of the bleſſings promiſed, by the prophets, confirms it. It is promiſed the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour "he ſhould have the heathen for an inheritance and the uttermoſt part of the earth for a poſſeſſion."<note n="†" place="bottom">Pſal. 2.8.</note> But not a ſoul from hell. All the ends of the world ſhall remember and turn unto the Lord; and all the kindred of the nations ſhall worſhip before thee. For the kingdom is the Lord's and he is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour among the nations. A ſeed ſhall ſerve him, and it ſhall be accounted to the Lord for a generation. They ſhall come and declare his righteouſneſs "unto a people that ſhould be born, that he hath done this."<note n="‡" place="bottom">Pſal. 22.27, 28, 30, 31.</note> Here the converſion of all nations is ſtrongly expreſſed, but as effected in this world, while the ſucceſſions of mankind continue, or they could not declare it "to a people that ſhould be born." "He ſhall have domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion "from ſea to ſea" and from the river to the ends of the earth. All kings ſhall fall down before him; all nations ſhall ſerve him."<note n="§" place="bottom">Pſal. 72.8, 11.</note> The whole deſcription is in this world: it cannot be in the "new earth" "there is no ſea" there. In that day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> "kings ſhall be nurſing fathers and queens nurſing mothers to the church of God:" ſervices peculiar to this ſtate, Iſa. 49.23, and 60th chapter throughout. And the call of God, which will be made effectual to bring all the then nations of the earth
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:019737_0306_0FACA75E21F86D28"/>
to a happy participation of theſe bleſſings, is, "look unto me and be ye ſaved all the ends of the earth," (including all the nations of the gentiles then living upon earth, but not a ſoul in future miſery; they are left out excluded, and have no part in it) "for I am God and there is none elſe. I have ſworn by myſelf, the word is gone out of my mouth in righteouſneſs, and ſhall not return, that unto me every knee ſhall bow, every tongue ſhall ſwear. Surely, ſhall one ſay, in the Lord have I righteouſneſs and ſtrength; even to him ſhall men come, and all that are incenſed againſt him ſhall be aſhamed." (This clauſe and ſome parallel texts ſeem to intimate, that there might remain ſome individuals, unreconciled enemies, but they ſhould be ſo few and feeble, as to be aſhamed and confounded, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of offence and diſturbance in all God's holy mountain.") And the jewiſh nation in all its fulneſs, at that time, ſhall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in theſe bleſſings. "In the Lord ſhall all the ſeed of Iſrael be juſtified and glory," Iſa. 45.22, 3, 4, 5. and this work of God, is ſo particularly and deciſively ſet forth as to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed in this world, in Iſai. 66.19, 20, 21, 22, 23 verſes, and parallel texts, as that the evidence cannot be evaded. Verſe 23. "And it ſhall come to paſs, that from one new moon to another, and from one ſabbath to another ſhall all fleſh come to worſhip before me, ſaith the Lord." Then, "the glad tid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of great joy unto all people" announced by the angel at the birth of our Saviour, will be literally verified, to all people, nations and languages upon earth. Then, "the Spirit will be poured out upon all fleſh."<note n="‖" place="bottom">Joel 2.28.</note> "All fleſh ſhall come to him, who heareth prayer."<note n="†" place="bottom">Pſa. 65.2.</note> "The glory of the Lord ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, and all fleſh ſhall ſee it together; for the mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it:"<note n="*" place="bottom">Iſa. 40.5.</note> and all fleſh ſhall ſee the ſalvation of God."<note n="‡" place="bottom">Luk. 3.6.</note> But when? the prophet tells us, it will be during the continuance of the preſent planetary ſyſtem and revolutions of days and months, before the earth is burnt up: when it ſhall come to paſs "that all fleſh ſhall come and worſhip before the Lord, from one new moon and ſabbath to another." So that if theſe texts teach that all men ſhall be ſaved; the alſo teach they will all be believers and true worſhipers of God; and will ſee andenjoy the beginings of this ſalvation, in this world;
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:019737_0307_0FACA75EE1CF1338"/>
before the laſt judgment and final conflagration. And when this call of God, ſhall have its full effect, in the ingathering of the fulneſs of jews and gentiles (while they exiſt as nations in this world) into the kingdom of God; then, theſe great promiſes to Abraham, will have their full accompliſhment: and ſo, as that "all the Iſrael of God" deſigned in them (including the natural and ſpiritual ſeed of Abraham, as expounded by Paul) "ſhall be ſaved." Conſequently, all the unbelieving and ungodly, who are condemned in the day of judgment, are excluded theſe promiſes, and muſt remain forever excluded the bleſſings of them. And fanciful theoriſts, may as well imagine the whole of this divine work of ingathering and bleſſing the nations, ſhall be effected not on this earth, but in the moon; as that any part of it ſhall be effected for the wicked, after the day of judgment. There is no time, or place found and allotted in ſcripture, for ſuch a purpoſe. Then "time ſhall be no longer" no more. And there is no place in the univerſe revealed, in which this great change in nature, character and ſtate can be effected, in them. Not in heaven, for the change muſt be wrought before, any can enter there: not in hell, for that is a place and ſtate of wrath without mercy, of weeping and miſery, and not of joy and ſalvation. Not in the new earth, for the bleſſings of it are the inheritance of them that overcome—and the wicked have another inheritance aſſigned them—" their portion is in the lake of fire," Rev. 21.1, 7, 8. And to ſuppoſe it to be effected in ſome new created tranſmutation world, is a ſpecies of infidelity, and ſuch an unſcriptural romantic creature of imagination, as is unworthy any regard by any ſober, judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious chriſtian, whoſe faith is bounded by revelation. So that their conſtruction of theſe glorious predictions and promiſes, ſtands every way confuted in ſcripture. But thoſe words are cited Rom. 11.32. "God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all:" it is ſaid this may have reference, to a more full admiſſion of jews and gentiles in the collective ſenſe into Chriſt's kingdom on earth; but may not be the principal meaning: that it is capable of a more exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſenſe, and to extend it to mankind univerſally, is thought the moſt noble and ſignificant, p. 247, 8. This text ſeems de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to exhibit the riches, ſovereignty and glory of God's
<pb n="289" facs="unknown:019737_0309_0FACA75FAB76B198"/>
mercy in the ſalvation of both jews and gentiles; inaſmuch as when it is diſplayed efficaciouſly for their reſtoration and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it finds them, all, in a ſtate of unbelief. And there are two rules in the deſcription of this divine work (to name no more) that make it evident, it is wrought in this world, and cannot be extended to all mankind. As (1.) this great work of mercy in the reſtoration of both, is by "graffing," and there is but one way of "graffing," by faith in Chriſt, which is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to this ſtate. "The jews were broken off by unbelief," "the gentiles were graffed by faith" "and ſtand by faith," v. 20. and "the jews ſhall be graffed in again, v. 24. as a nation they ſhall be converted to the faith of Chriſt;" ſhall look to him whom they have pierced and mourn," &amp;c. ſo, ſhall their iniquities be pardoned, and they be bleſſed with the bleſſings of Abraham, and of Chriſt, and with the joys of his ſalvation. This method of mercy in ſaving ſinners whether jew or gentile the apoſtle teaches expreſsly, and profeſſedly in this chapter, in this great work of mercy in the reſtoration of the fulneſs of jews and gentiles: and he teacheth none other method, nor doth the ſcripture; and therefore, this "mercy upon all" muſt be "the believing," of all nations without difference; and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not extend to the ungraffed, unbelieving part of mankind. Which conſtruction is a moſt noble and ſignificant, that which falls in with the profeſſed deſign of the apoſtle, and ſupports the goſpel conſtitution of "graffing" and ſalvation by faith; or that which contradicts and annuls it, is eaſy to determine. (2dly.) this great work of mercy, in the reſtoration of the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the jews and gentiles will be effected in this world; while they remain diſtinct nations, retaining their national cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters. This ſeems very clear in the ſeveral parts of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription: particularly, in the great benefits that ſhall redound to other nations, by the converſion and recall of the jews into the kingdom of God. "If through their fall ſalvation came to the gentiles, to provoke them to jealouſy," v. 11. that they might return." "If their fall, was the riches of the world, how much more their fulneſs," v. 12. Again, "If their caſting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way be the reconciling of the world, what ſhall the receiving them be" (in their converſion) "but life from the dead," v. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. This plainly beſpeaks them, to be at that time diſtinct
<pb n="290" facs="unknown:019737_0308_0FACA760716A8340"/>
nations, and retaining their well known national characters. Otherwiſe, how is it poſſible, that their converſion and "ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs" ſhould more abound "to the reconciling of the world," and their reſtoration be as "life from the dead" to the reſt of the world." And again, how is it poſſible, that the fulneſs of the jews and gentiles coming in as nations, can be ſeen as co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary events, as taught, v. 25, unleſs they remain diſtinct nations? And this is a note of its accompliſhment in this world, taught by our Saviour, and repeatedly by the prophets, <note n="‖" place="bottom">It may not be improper here to notice one text, that hath been much miſtaken by ſome, Ezek. 16.53. "When I ſhall bring again their cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria and her daughters, then will I bring again the captivity of thy cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives in the midſt of them." It cannot be meant of the land or lake of Sodom, which it ſeems will continue a monument of warning to all ages and generations. Nor can it be meant of the Sodomites, that periſhed; that they ſhould be recovered at the reſtoration of the Jews; for it ſeems they will be condemned in the day of judgment, Mark 6.11. But it muſt be the Gentiles, figuratively "Sodom," whom the Jews in pride and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt looked upon, unleſs they became Jews, as abandoned to deſtruction, as the Sodomites. In reproof, they are here taught, in the time of their mercy and reſtoration, the gentiles ſhould partake of the ſame glorious mercy, and in equal extent and fulneſs. I know ſome have taken it as a threatning of utter ruin to the Jews, like that of Sodom; but conſidering the ſubſequent promiſes to the Jews, I prefer the ſenſe already given.</note> as well as by the apoſtle here. And this point is further confirmed in the following context. For upon the coming in of the fulneſs of jews and gentiles, is immediately added, v. 26, "and ſo all Iſrael ſhall be ſaved." And this work of mercy is confirmed in that and the three following verſes: and then illuſtrated v. 30, 31. "For as ye in times paſt have not believed, yet now have obtained mercy through their unbelief: even ſo have theſe alſo not now believed, that through your mercy, they alſo may obtain mercy." As ſure as the one had obtained the mercy to be ingraffed, by faith, ſo ſurely ſhould the other obtain the like mercy, in this preſent world. Now if the whole of this work of mercy treated of, reſpecting jews and gentiles, is in fact compleated in this world, it ſeems evidently, againſt the deſign of the apoſtle, to extend this mercy to all the wicked in the future world. I would notice one objection againſt what hath been offered:—it is by ſome inferred, from this deſcription of the apoſtle, "that the non-elect reprobate jews of that time,
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:019737_0310_0FACA76122A12C60"/>
who were broken off by unbelief, enemies for the ſake of the gentiles, will be brought in, "in the fulneſs of the jews," and that literally all the ſeed of Iſrael in all generations, will be comprized in this grand reſtoration, and be ſaved." But in the objection, it is forgotten, that nations live and are perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated on earth, in ſucceſſive generations, only. Thoſe that die off, are never reſtored, to make a conſtituent part of the nation any more; to be the ſubjects of its future bleſſings or judgments. And conſequently, the predictions of bleſſings or judgments to nations, have their accompliſhment in the generations living in the time of their completion, and not in any foregoing ones. This ſtrikes off the foundation of the objection. Beſides, the ſuppoſition that predictions look back to foregoing generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is contrary to the nature of them: the grand deſign of prophecies, is to diſcloſe the deſigns and future events of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to take place in this world: the fates of mankind, the bleſſings or judgments to come upon nations, while they exiſt as nations, before the end of the world. The ſtate of all men, for the future and eternal world, are to be ſettled in the day of judgment, by the great promiſes and threatnings reſpecting that world; and not by prophecy, but by the ſcripture rule of retribution. Again, it is not remembered by the objector, that the prophets predicting this glorious reſtoration of the jewiſh nation, do once and again ſtile them a "remnant," Though this "remnant" will include all the fulneſs of the nation in all their diſperſions through the world, living, in that period. Thus are they ſtiled, Micah 5.7, 8. and ch. 7. 18. and Zep. 3.13, &amp;c. They are a "remnant" a precious reſidue of that nation reſerved in infinite mercy, for the unſpeakable bleſſings of that grand period, diſtinguiſhed in glory, by all the prophets, above all others, in the annals of time. Moreover, the method of their reſtoration, is likewiſe forgotten, viz. "by graffing in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain." And there is but one doctrine of graffing for jew and gentile, and that is "by the faith of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt," while they continue nations its this world, as hath been ſhewn. Conſequently, the reſtoration plead for in the objection, is an impoſſibility in nature, without a reſurrection of the unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead, previous to the general reſurrection; which is confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by our Saviour and the current doctrine of revelation. So
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:019737_0311_0FACA761E24E6CC8"/>
that the objection is wholly an antiſcriptural, groundleſs miſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ake, in fact, On the whole, it ſeems evident, in this diſcuſſion, that the predictions and promiſes of bleſſings to families and nations, and of the works of God's grace, and recovering mercy deſignated in them, to be wrought for mankind, will certainly have their full accompliſhment in this world. And the marks and characters of their certain completion, while they exiſt in families and nations in this world, are ſo interſperſed and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven in the deſcriptions themſelves, as that they can hardly eſcape an attentive reader. It is clearly, the moſt obvious and popular conſtruction, beſt adapted to the good of men, and which perhaps hath not been miſtaken by one of a million, of thoſe who have read them. So that there is not a ſhadow of evidence, in ſupport of their doctrine carried in the general terms in which they are expreſſed; nor a fig-leaf of hope to be derived from them, to thoſe who die in their ſins, but it is wholly cut off in their certain completion in this world. Neither is there any danger of diſcredit to ſcripture, by aſcertaining their general intendment, when we certainly fall in with their grand deſign; which is, the inſtruction and beſt good of mankind in this world, which is beſt ſubſerved in the conſtruction given. But it is that conſtruction, which renders them perfectly looſe and ambiguous, that is, diſreputable; that renders them ſo du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious and ſceptical, that we cannot know, who they reſpect and belong to, whether to the living or the dead; nor to what world of ſubjects, whether to this or the future; whether one already created, or to ſome one or more, yet to be created; and forces us, to Vulcan's forge for a meaning to them: I mean "a creature of fancy" made by the hammer of invention, on the anvil of imagination. This muſt be contemptible in the eyes of judicious chriſtians, and tend to expoſe the ſacred oracles to contempt. We have obviated his argument from Pſa. 68.18. in what hath been ſaid upon Eph. 4.10. where it is cited, and applied to gifts and goſpel means, for the recovery of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in this world, only. Another text is Joh. 12.32. "And I, if I be lifted up will draw all men to me." Here it is ſaid, is no exception of any individual of the human race; nor have any one a right to limit the merciful effect of Chriſt's death. But we have certainly a right to take the meaning from our

                     </gap>r, himſelf: and that he meant all ſorts and nations of men living, jews or gentiles, is evident from his after explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory commiſſion given to the apoſtles, to preach the goſpel to all the living nations, and "to every creature." But he has in effect abſolutely prohibited us, from extending it to final un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers, in the parable of dives, and by teaching us "they ſhall not ſee life" nor "taſte of his ſupper," and in the great day the door of mercy ſhall be ſhut againſt them, &amp;c. Another text cited, is Joh. 17.2. "As thou haſt given him power over all fleſh, that he might give eternal life to as many as thou haſt given him." This he explains, "that he might give eternal life, to theſe all men he had ſubjected to him," p. 246, 7. That our Saviour did not mean, "all that were ſubjected to him" by "all that were given to him," is very evident from his own explanation "of thoſe who were given to him" in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent context and other places. In the 6th and following verſes he ſpeaks of theſe "given ones" as "given him out of the world," "who had received and kept his word"— as "thoſe who believe" "for whom" he prays, in diſtinction from the reſt of the world: and in a parallel paſſage he plainly teaches, he had this power over all things given him, for the purpoſe of giving eternal life, "to the believing" and not to the unbelieving of mankind: as Joh. 3.35. in connexion with v. 36. "The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand"—and the purpoſe follows, "he that believeth on the Son, hath everlaſting life: and he that believeth not the Son, ſhall not ſee life; but the wrath of God abideth on him." And he further tells us, John 5.37. "All that the Father giveth me, ſhall come to me:" they ſhall become believers on him in this world. So that according to the explanation of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, he intends "by thoſe that are given him," not all that are ſubjected to him, but thoſe who become believers on him in this world, and no more. If any one thinks this ingenious writer underſtands the meaning better than our Saviour, he will give him credit. Tit. 11.11. is cited, p. 248. "For the grace of God, that bringeth ſalvation, hath appeared to all men." He ſays it may be rendered, "the grace of God, which bringeth ſalvation to all men, hath appeared." Still the queſtion is, how the grace of God brings ſalvation to all ſorts and nations
<pb n="294" facs="unknown:019737_0313_0FACA76362F708D8"/>
of men? the next words anſwers the queſtion, and aſcertains the ſenſe of theſe words, by pointing out the way, and only way in which it brings ſalvation to them, "teaching us, that deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all ungodlineſs, and worldly luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly righteouſly and godly in this preſent world;" "looking for that bleſſed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt." While this is the only way in which this grace ſaves all men, who will ever be ſaved: by ſanctifying them in "this preſent world," render it how you will, theſe texts in connexion, will be directly in the face of their doctrine and conſtruction. And I ſhould think, no man in his right mind, can think, the apoſtle intended to extend this grace to ſave men, in ſome future tranſmutation worlds; when he ſo plainly and deciſively deſcribes its efficacy in the ſalvation, of men, in their ſanctification, in this preſent world, only. It is ſaid 1 Tim. 4.10. "God is the ſaviour of all men; eſpecially of them that believe." The connexion ſhews, this text has ſpecial reference to God's providential protection and ſalvation, and not that which is ſpiritual: and ſo hath been underſtood by the moſt judicious: in this ſenſe, it hath no concern with the point in diſpute. But if it refer to Chriſt our Saviour, he may with great propriety, be termed the Saviour of all men, as he is the creator and preſerver of all men, and they owe all their mercies and bleſſings to his divine mediation and government; and as he hath opened a way by his death, that all ſorts, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters and nations of men may be ſaved, by faith in him; and it is becauſe they will not come unto him, they are not finally ſaved: and he is eſpecially the ſaviour of them that believe, as he ſaves them in fact with an eternal ſalvation. No more, with force, can be argued from this text. Our Saviour ſays, John 10.16. "And other ſheep I have, which are not of this fold: them alſo muſt I bring, and they ſhall hear my voice: and there ſhall be one fold, and one ſhepherd." From whence is argued, the wicked in the future world may be theſe other ſheep, ſo as that the whole human race ſhall make one fold, and have one ſhepherd," p. 229. It ſeems nothing can be more arbitrary and groundleſs, than this conſtruction: for our Saviour in all his diſcourſes, ſays not a word of their recovery; but many things deciſively againſt it, as hath been ſhewn. By ſheep in
<pb n="295" facs="unknown:019737_0314_0FACA76423074518"/>
the foregoing part of this chapter, are meant thoſe of a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing character in this world; it is moſt natural therefore to ſuppoſe in this text, is intended thoſe who ſhould be called and formed into the ſame divine character, in this ſtate. I have no doubt the calling in of the gentiles, is what is meant, by the other ſheep to be brought in. Hitherto, he had miniſtred and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected his ſheep, from the houſe of Iſrael: but he would bring in believing jews and gentiles into one fold, and they ſhould have one ſhepherd: which is a work appropriated to this, and not the future world. And this is confirmed in the language of the text itſelf, "and they ſhall hear his voice," that is, they ſhould believe and obey his goſpel, which is the conſtant mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it; and this is the ſpecial work of men, in this ſtate: there is nothing ſaid of it in the place of torment. Whoever be meant by "the other ſheep," the text and context confirms it, that they will be brought in, in this world: the very reverſe of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. As to "the good tidings of great joy ſpoken of, at the birth of our Saviour, Luk. 11.10. we have ſhewn it will be literally verified, when the fulneſs of jews and gentiles are brought in: and inſtead of "a few people" as is ſuggeſted, an innumerable multitude will be collected out of all nations and ſaved. And as to thoſe that periſh, it is in their own default; and it would be impious to reproach the grace of God and the Saviour, for the fault of the creature. And as to the contempt ſhewn to the common conſtruction, "as poor and low," here as uſual—if it be the true, ſcriptural ſenſe, it is certainly the moſt important and uſeful to men; and we doubt not, in the grand arrangement of the divine government, it is as far more honourable to God and our Saviour, as it is beneficial to men.</p>
                  <p>We paſs to his general references, to texts which ſpeak of God as "not keeping anger forever," as not "contending for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever," "not chiding always," and "not being always wroth." The ſenſe given in their ſcheme, is tho't the moſt full and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant, p. 249. But if it is fitted only to delude men, it is the moſt contemptible. I find not theſe expreſſions uſed, but in reference to the temporary correction of "the broken hearted, and them that fear God"—and in reference to the temporary correction of the jewiſh nation—to inſure their national reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this world, according to God's gracious promiſes, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="296" facs="unknown:019737_0315_0FACA764E20843D8"/>
the previous viſitations of his wrath: and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to ſinners who turn from their wickedneſs by repentance, in this world. I find not an inſtance, where it reſpects thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to the future puniſhment; and therefore they are all no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the point in diſpute. How great ſoever the encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement to faith, hope, repentance, &amp;c. they give to men in this world, they give none to the damned. The next general reference is, to texts which repreſent the bleſſed God "as plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and abundant in mercy; whoſe mercy endureth forever, is everlaſting, and from everlaſting to everlaſting, and is over all his works." It is ſaid that a far more emphatically great and benevolent ſenſe is given to theſe expreſſions, upon the ſcheme of univerſal ſalvation than the common one; and that upon the common one they can ſcarce have any meaning at all, &amp;c. p. 250. In reply, it is ſufficient to obſerve; the bleſſed God is thus gloriouſly characteriſed, for theſe two purpoſes, (1) to exhibit what he is to our ſinful world, under a diſpenſation of mercy; and (2dly) to exhibit what he is and will be to all, who comply with the goſpel terms of mercy, and become his penitent faithful ſervants, and meet veſſels of everlaſting mercy. To them, he is literally and in the ſtrongeſt ſenſe of the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, "plenteous" and abundant in mercy, and "his mercy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth forever," and is from everlaſting to everlaſting, &amp;c. And in the firſt ſenſe and view of the ſubject, there needs "the help of no art or figure," nothing but eye-ſight and attention, to ſee, his mercy extendeth over all his works, and creatures in our world, "the whole earth is full of his goodneſs and riches." And conſidering the innumerable and aggravated provocations of ſinful men, it is fully and gloriouſly manifeſt, that he is lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally plenteous and abundant in mercy to them, in the plenteous and abundant mercies actually beſtowed on them in this world, and in his officers of pardon and eternal life to them, upon the moſt condeſcending terms of mercy: and 'tis their fault they do not become the ſubjects of his mercy, ſtrictly everlaſting. And this exhibition of his glorious character and mercy is moſt wiſely fitted, to draw and win ſinners to repentance; and for the ſupport and comfort of good men, and the promotion of true godlineſs, which is the grand deſign of it. But this mercy of God, is not to be extended to the devil and his angels, or to
<pb n="297" facs="unknown:019737_0316_0FACA765A1890988"/>
ſinners, that are veſſels of wrath, in a ſtate of wrath and retribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: ſo to extend and apply it, is antiſcriptural. In the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition given, the mercy of God, in the ſcripture characters of it, ſhines forth, in full glory. Nor is it any diminution or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation of it, to ſuppoſe, it will never be exerciſed to unmeet ſubjects; nor, in any way of interference with the rights of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and the ſupport of the authority and government of God. But to ſuppoſe ſuch an exerciſe of it, would reflect diſhonour upon divine wiſdom and mercy itſelf. But their plan of mercy is eſſentially different from that of ſcripture; and is ſubverſive of the goſpel conſtitution, and the authority and government of God in this world; by emboldening men to ſin and neglect the great ſalvation, to their ruin in this world, and world to come: and is as reproachful to God, as it is miſchievous to mankind, as hath been repeatedly ſhewn.</p>
                  <p>We have now conſidered the paragraphs, ſingle texts and general references in ſupport of the univerſal ſalvation of all men; and find no collective or ſingle proof of any force, in the whole: ſo far from it, that the bigger part of the paragraphs and ſingle texts when reſtored to their genuine meaning, are deciſive refutations of it. And the palliating concluding ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, why it is not more clearly revealed, carries as little force in it, as the other proofs. Certainly a doctrine of ſuch magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, if true, and deſigned to be taught and believed in our world, would have been ſome where deciſively taught; which we clearly ſee, this, is not. When the ſcripture is ſo plain and repeated in teaching other doctrines of far leſs importance than this, if true; and not a ſingle deciſive proof of this tenet given: when the tenor of revelation is, prima facie, directly againſt this tenet: and when it is excluded and confuted in almoſt every poſſible way, in which the falſity of an error can be expoſed and demonſtrated: in ſuch a circumſtance, if any man will venture his precious ſoul upon ſuch a detected, manifeſt deluſion; one would think he muſt be ſtrangely inconſiderate, or infatuated.</p>

                  <p>Several plauſible things are offered under the firſt objection, to evade the force of thoſe texts, which plainly repreſent the future puniſhment to be eternal: as "everlaſting fire," "ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
<pb n="298" facs="unknown:019737_0317_0FACA76664212928"/>
puniſhment," "everlaſting deſtruction," &amp;c. I ſhall not purſue his mode of diſcuſſion, but ſelect the ſeveral evaſions contained in it. Evaſion (1.) It is argued from the nature and effects of the fire, by which, it is ſaid, this puniſhment is effected: that it will have an end, and cannot be ſtrictly, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. It is ſaid, to be as abſurd, to ſuppoſe fire to be ſtrictly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting, as the hills and mountains: for it tends to an end, and will have an end according to the eſtabliſhed laws of nature. Therefore from the nature of the ſubject, the term "everlaſting" applied to it muſt have a limited conſtruction. And alſo, it tends to deſtroy whatever is caſt into it, and we know of no bodies that can ſo endure the force of it, but it will effect their diſſolution, in time. Whence it is inferred, the future fire and puniſhment will not be eternal, p. 273, 4, 5, 6. To me this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing, proves nothing, but how egregiouſly, great men can trifle upon the moſt awful ſubjects, when they ſet themſelves about it. For it is admitted, p. 278. "that it cannot be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, with any certainty, whether the fire of hell is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood literally or figuratively." If ſo, why doth he plead ſo much, and reſt all the force of his arguings, upon the "literal ſenſe?" when if it be underſtood "figuratively" there is not the leaſt force in it. The figurative fire intended, may be ſtrictly everlaſting, and the epithets joined to it, aſcertain it to be ſo. He argues, "the epithet everlaſting is joined to the puniſhment, on account of the fire that will occaſion it:" whereas, it is more natural to underſtand the puniſhment, as exegetical of the fire. And ſays of another text, "it is called eternal judgment, becauſe the effect of it will be departing into everlaſting fire." Whereas the obvious reaſon is, becauſe, the effect and puniſhment of that judgment will be ſtrictly eternal; without any reference to fire or any other figure. Again, he ſays, everlaſting deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord, is evidently termed everlaſting on account of the fire that is to bring on this deſtruction, p. 285. Whereas, there is no evidence of it in the connexion, as he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes: but it is more probably ſo deſcribed, to give us the true idea of the future puniſhment, it is an eternal ſeparation from the life-giving preſence and glory of the Lord, in a ſtate of miſery: this is "everlaſting deſtruction." Where are we taught the future puniſhment will be effected by the material
<pb n="299" facs="unknown:019737_0318_0FACA7675CA26DD8"/>
fire of this world, that by the laws of nature will have an end? Not in ſcripture. Contrariwiſe, our Lord teaches it, the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting fire prepared for the devil and his angels: and how the material temporary fire of this world ſhould be a proper pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment for ſuch unembodied ſpirits as the devil and his angels is unexplained, and inconceivable by us. Such entirely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded arguing, carries no force in it. If the predication had been expreſsly made of the material fire of this world, there would be an appearance of weight in it: but as the "everlaſting" is expreſsly predicated of the fire of hell; the fire of that inviſible world, where Paul teaches us, "the things of it (without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception) are eternal; there is not a ſhadow of force in it, or ground for ſuch a criticiſm. Beſides, if we are to argue the duration, from this nature of fire, and the bodies thrown into it, "chaff," "tares," and dry "branches," it is fatal to their doctrine. They ſay, the puniſhment will laſt an "age," and to ſome for "ages of ages," but it is impoſſible by the laws of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, this ſhort lived fire, upon ſuch fuel ſhould laſt but a very little while; it can't laſt an age, and for ages of ages. And it is abſolute deſtruction to their doctrine of reſtoration likewiſe. So that they are ſelf-condemned in their arguing, from ſuch an abſurd view, of the nature of the ſubject. It is not from the nature of the figure "fire" but the epithets and properties aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to it, that we are deſignedly taught the duration of this puniſhment. It is "unquenchable" "everlaſting fire," and a "fire that never ſhall be quenched," theſe are the properties aſcribed to it. And if theſe do not teach it "unceaſing" and "endleſs" there is no language that can do it. And it is ſo forcibly taught, that it cannot be avoided, without direct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction. For to ſay it is temporary and will come to an end, when we are taught it is unquenchable and cannot have an end, and it ſhall never be quenched, ceaſe and have an end; is a moſt palpable contradiction. Nor is it to the purpoſe to ſay, it will not have an end, till it hath effected the diſſolution of thoſe who ſuffer it: for we are never taught the duration of it, by any ſuch ſuppoſed effect of it; but by the properties and epithets aſcribed to it. So that it is juſt as certain, that it will be unceaſing and endleſs, as that theſe inſpired teachers by theſe deſcriptions, have taught us the duration of this puniſhment,
<pb n="300" facs="unknown:019737_0319_0FACA767E3754D10"/>
truly. I will only add, the ſubject of "this fire" would be plain and eaſy, if men would give an impartial attention to the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture repreſentation of it, in its connexions. "This fire" is firſt taught by Moſes, Deut. 32.22. "For a fire is kindled in mine anger" (that is, by the ſins of the diſobedient Iſraelites) "and ſhall burn to the loweſt hell."<note n="‖" place="bottom">It is well known "the loweſt ſchool" always ſignifies "the hell," that is, the place of the future puniſhment of the wicked.</note> This can't be the fire of this world, that by the laws of nature will come to an end. There is no difficulty in ſuppoſing "this fire" of wrath may be eternal; as everlaſting as the immortal objects of it. Yea, it muſt be eternal, if the holineſs, juſtice and power of God be eternal, and devils and wicked men continue the immortal ſubjects of this indignation. This is the fire of "wrath revealed from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven againſt all ungodlineſs and wickedneſs of men," "that is poured out without mixture" upon the wicked. This is the unquenchable, everlaſting fire prepared for the devil and his angels and their wicked aſſociates. And there is no abſurdity, no impropriety in ſuppoſing this fire to be everlaſting. And conſequently, there is not a ſhadow of force, in their arguing from the nature of material fire in this world, and of chaff, tares, &amp;c. againſt the everlaſting duration of the future puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The ſacred texts, and arguments from them, ſtand in their full force, this evaſion notwithſtanding. They ſeem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of this, and therefore adduce, Evaſion II. viz. That the fire and puniſhment may be ſtrictly "everlaſting," and yet the ſubjects conſigned to that puniſhment, may not continue ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly in it. Several things are ſaid to render the ſuppoſition plauſible: "that the puniſhment may be ſaid to be everlaſting, becauſe the fire is ſo, although all the ſubjects of it, may not endure it forever:" and God may continue this fire a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual monument of his juſtice, becauſe in ſo large a ſyſtem of rational beings, there may be a ſucceſſion of rebellious ſubjects, to endure this puniſhment: and ſome may endure it for a ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and others for a longer duration; and ſome and ſo many will endure it for ages of ages, as that in a collective ſenſe, the conſigned to it may be ſaid, to be tormented day and night forever and ever," &amp;c. this is ſtrenuouſly argued by Mr. Scot and this author, "as a ſuppoſable caſe," and as certainly "a
<pb n="301" facs="unknown:019737_0320_0FACA768A1DB5BC0"/>
poſſible ſuppoſition:" as p. 272, 284, 5, and 304, 5. thence it is inferred, the received doctrine of the future puniſhment can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be maintained. Upon which I would juſt obſerve, this evaſion and the foregoing one are not mates and conſiſtent, but contradict and ſubvert each other. Under the firſt we were told, that from the nature of fire, the word "eternal" muſt have a limited conſtruction, becauſe by the laws of nature, it would have an end; and that it is as abſurd to apply the word "ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting" in the ſtrict ſenſe, to it, as to the hills and mountains. But now we are told it is a ſuppoſable caſe, that it may be ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, and yet the ſubjects not everlaſtingly puniſhed in it. This I am ſure, ſays he, is a poſſible ſuppoſition, p. 285. If this laſt ſtands, the firſt evaſion is given up, and all the reaſonings upon it, ſtand for nothing. Such contradictions, it ſeems doth not diſconcert theſe writers, and they are too frequent to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize us: we are ſeaſoned to them. But in reply to this ſecond evaſion, I would ſay, as it is entirely unſcriptural, ſo it is an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely unſuppoſable caſe, that the puniſhment ſhould be ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, and yet the ſubjects of it ſhould not endure it through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that duration. For theſe reaſons, (1) becauſe, it is an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity or contradiction, in ſuppoſition. Puniſhment and the ſubjects of puniſhment, are ſuch correlates, that the one cannot exiſt without, nor, any longer, than the other: no more, than accidents can exiſt without their ſubject: no more, than life or death, happineſs or miſery can exiſt, without a ſubject of the one, or the other. I deny it (2dly) becauſe, this ſuppoſition, would deſtroy the force and grand intention of this threatned puniſhment, to men in this world. The duration, is the great terror of this puniſhment. And if it be revealed to be ſtrictly "eternal," as is conceded in this evaſion, it is certainly deſigned that the whole of this endleſs duration, ſhould have force to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm ſinful men, to repentance and life. But if it be once ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſable and known, that the ſubjects conſigned to it, will not endure it, throughout the endleſs duration of it: from that moment, the endleſs duration of it, ceaſes to be an object of fear, and has no force. And conſequently, the grand practical intention of the revelation of it, is defeated. The duration of a puniſhment for ages of ages, in the ſucceſſive ſubjects of it, hath not the leaſt force of terror in it, any farther than each ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="302" facs="unknown:019737_0321_0FACA76962264B58"/>
himſelf perſonally, ſhall endure it. Suppoſe it, the moſt terrible in nature or poſſible, if it were to be but of one or two hours continuance to us; that duration and its conſequences to us, would be the whole terror of it. What others have ſuffered before, or may do after us, would give not the leaſt additional weight to it. This we all do, or may know, by a moment's reflection. To exemplify it in the puniſhment of murther. A violent death, is the puniſhment to the murtherer, by the laws of God and man. God announced it to Noah, and the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is indiſpenſibly required. The convicted murderer "muſt go to the pit, and no man may ſtay him." This puniſhment hath already exiſted in ſucceſſive ſubjects, for ſome thouſands of ages and generations, according to the notion we implead: and will continue if there be ſubjects of it, in ſucceſſive ages, to the end of the world. And yet the long duration of this puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in ages paſt, and ages to come, hath not the leaſt influence upon any man, to reſtrain him from the crime. It is the pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment with its conſequences to himſelf, in this world and world to come, and its conſequences to his relations and friends, gives its whole and full force. Our Lord perfectly knew this, the inſpired prophets and apoſtles knew it, and therefore they never would have denounced the future puniſhment to be everlaſting, and with an intention to awaken ſinful men to repentance and life, by the endleſs duration of it: if this was not in fact to be the portion of all the individual ſubjects of it; the intention of the threatning could not poſſibly be anſwered in any other view of it. Surely, that conſtruction and ſuppoſition, that would deſtroy the force and grand intention of this threatened puniſhment to men, in this world; can never be true or admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. (3dly.) We deny it, becauſe the ſubjects of this puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and their continuance in it, throughout this duration, are ſo deſcribed, as will not endure ſuch a conſtruction and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. Thus, our Lord not only deſcribes the duration of it, but points out the ſubjects that ſhall ſuffer it, in its full du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. It is prepared for the devil and his angels, and they muſt ſuffer it. And he conſigns the finally wicked, to the ſame puniſhment and ſame duration. And again, he deciſively fixes the endleſs duration of the ſubjects of this puniſhment, in that awful declaration "where their worm dieth not." The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noun
<pb n="303" facs="unknown:019737_0322_0FACA76A234338C0"/>
"their" in this connexion, fixes the endleſs duration of the ſubject, as truly as of the worm: for it cannot be "their worm" if they ceaſe to exiſt; nor any longer, than they continue to be the ſubjects of the tormenting worm. Their endleſs coexiſtence with the never-dying worm, is the very inſtruction intended, and it is ſo ſtrongly and deciſively fixed and aſcertained, that it will bear no other conſtruction. If their worm ſhall never die, they ſhall never ceaſe to be the ſubjects of it. This arguing goes upon the ſame general principle adopted by our Saviour, in reaſoning againſt the ſadduces, to infer and inſure the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and immortal happineſs of Abraham, Iſaac and Jacob, from God's being "their God." It is grounded on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected relation in both caſes, that infers the concluſion; and in both alike. And why doth our Saviour give this deſcription of the never-dying worm? and what intention can it anſwer, but ſtrongly to convey this ſentiment of the ſubject of it? Moreover (4thly.) the ſubjects of the everlaſting puniſhment in hell, are as particularly deſcribed and marked out, as thoſe who ſhall enjoy the everlaſting happineſs of heaven: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the conſtruction and ſuppoſition we implead, cannot be admitted, without introducing abſolute ſcepticiſm, with reſpect to the future and eternal ſtate. It is as certain in ſcripture, that hell is the portion of all the wicked, as that heaven is, of all the righteous. And the threatnings are as pointed and perſonal, to all the wicked, as the promiſes are to all the righteous; and the u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>leſs duration of the puniſhment is as much aſcertained to all the wicked in the threatnings, as the endleſs duration of the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of heaven, is to all the righteous, in the promiſes. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, if the impleaded ſuppoſition be admitted with reſpect to the wicked, it muſt be alſo with reſpect to the righteous; for certainly, the promiſes and threatnings of that God who cannot lie, and impoſe upon his creatures, muſt have one rule of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: and if ſo, the happineſs of heaven may be everlaſting, in the ſame ſenſe, as this future puniſhment. That is, to be enjoyed in ſucceſſion, in the large ſyſtem of the univerſe: and by the righteous in the collective ſenſe; not by all of them, but by ſome only, and who and how many of them ſhall in fact en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy it everlaſtingly, an abſolute uncertainty. And this will make way for a diverſity in the reward, as well as puniſhment.
<pb n="304" facs="unknown:019737_0323_0FACA76AE8186F50"/>
So that notwithſtanding the clearneſs, certainty and infallibility of theſe promiſes and threatnings, to all the ſubjects of them, reſpectively, as they ſtand in divine revelation: yet, on this ſuppoſition, we are every one plunged into abſolute ſcepticiſm how it will fare with us perſonally and individually, to eternity; whether we be the ſubjects of the one or the other. True, if heirs of the promiſes, we may by ſome of the promiſes, be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured of a happy immortality; but not in the enjoyment of the everlaſting happineſs of heaven; for this is a portion to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed by the righteous, not all of them individually, but in the collective ſenſe only: and no one can know, it ſeems, by the promiſes, how that will terminate in reſpect to himſelf. What deſtruction this ſceptick concluſion carries in it, to the moral character of God, to the force of theſe threatnings and promiſes, to the ſalutory fears, hopes and joys deſigned to be awakened and put in exerciſe by the one and the other, and to the intereſt of religion and the kingdom of God, is too plain to need point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out. And how horrible muſt be the impoſition upon all the rational univerſe, in the ſolemn ſcene and ſentences of the laſt judgment, upon this impleaded ſuppoſition? a concluſion ſo abhorrent and pernicious in every view, together with the principle and ſuppoſition which produces it, muſt ſurely be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected with indignation. I will add once more, the ſupreme unerring Judge, will certainly ſentence the wicked to this ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting puniſhment: and it cannot be ſuppoſed, but every ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, ſo conſigned to it, muſt ſuffer it, in its full duration. For it muſt be juſt, and the very puniſhment threatned to them, or they would not be ſentenced to it. And to ſuppoſe it will not be executed upon all the condemned to it, is directly to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach the truth of the Judge, and the veracity of his infallible ſentence. And again, it would be the higheſt reproach to his character as Judge, to ſuppoſe him to uſe ſuch a prevaricating ambiguity in a final, deciſive ſentence, as this evaſion muſt imply; as hath been before ſhewn. In a word, a chriſtian may as conſiſtently, doubt and diſpute his own being, as the veracity and everlaſting force of the final ſentence, of the ſupreme and infallible Judge. And therefore there is not, nor can be, any foundation for, or truth in the ſuppoſition, that the puniſhment may be everlaſting, and yet the ſubjects conſigned to it, not be
<pb n="305" facs="unknown:019737_0324_0FACA76BA29EF210"/>
everlaſtingly puniſhed. But the ſacred texts, that teach the endleſs duration of this puniſhment, do at the ſame time and with the ſame force teach, the ſubjects of it, ſhall everlaſtingly ſuffer it. Such ungrounded, evaſive criticiſms (and we meet with too many of them in theſe ingenuous, fanciful authors) are not the genuine product of the noble art of true criticiſm. This brings to view the genuine ſenſe of ſcripture, with peculiar clearneſs and force: but this degenerate kind, ſerves only to cut up and mangle, ſacred texts and doctrines.</p>
                  <p>Evaſion (III.) is this, there is not the ſame reaſon to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the word "everlaſting" in the ſame ſtrict ſenſe, when ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the wicked as to the righteous; becauſe there are other texts, which fix the endleſs ſenſe, as applied to the righteous: as thus, "that they can die no more," are equal to the angels, are "incorruptible," "ſhall be ever with the Lord," "receive a kingdom which cannot be moved," "an incorruptible inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance which fadeth not away," &amp;c. Whereas "it is not ſaid of the wicked, they ſhall always live in torment without dying," or "that their bodies ſhall be immortal and incorruptible," but on the contrary, it is declared, "the wicked ſhall reap corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion," <note n="§" place="bottom">Gal. 6.8.</note> "ſhall be deſtroyed,"<note n="‡" place="bottom">Mat. 7.13.10.28.</note> "that they ſhall periſh,"<note n="‖" place="bottom">Joh. 10.28.</note> "ſhall ſuffer death, the ſecond death;"<note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. 21.23.

                        </gap>.</note> and it is ſaid to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable this ſecond death is ſpoken of as effected by the fire of hell. This is a miſtake, the puniſhment of hell in the whole duration of it, "is the ſecond death," p. 277, 8, and 286, 7.</p>
                  <p>In reply, I would firſt take off the argument from theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular texts, and then more particularly point out the invalidity of the evaſion. The firſt text is, Gal. 6.8. "He that ſoweth to the fleſh, ſhall of the fleſh reap corruption." By which is underſtood, ſuch a diſſolution of ſoul and body as is effected by natural death. But the ſcripture teaches no ſuch doctrine of the future world. "Corruption" is uſed figuratively, "for ſin and the puniſhment of it," which gives the true meaning of this text. "Evil communication," it is written, "corrupts good manners." Here is no diſſolution of parts, it morally <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ars and ruins good manners. And it is uſed for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſin, as when it is ſaid "they ſhall utterly periſh in their own corruption," in their ſins and the puniſhment due to them.
<pb n="306" facs="unknown:019737_0325_0FACA76C63392A88"/>
And this figurative is much the moſt natural ſenſe in this place, "they ſhall reap the fruit and wages of their iniquity, aſſigned to them by the word and juſtice of God. Neither doth the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing of the wicked, by any means, carry the idea of diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in it; as in the text quoted, John 10.28. "And I give them eternal life, and they ſhall never periſh." The periſhing of the wicked here, is oppoſed to the eternal life enjoyed by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers; and intends, they will periſh from the ſalvation of God. This they may ſurely do, in a ſtate of endleſs miſery. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys no idea of diſſolution or end, in any way whatever. Nor can "their diſſolution" be argued from the word "deſtroyed." For this deſtruction is not of their beings, but of their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by continuing in a ſtate of miſery, only. And this idea, with the endleſs duration of it, is plainly pointed out by Paul, in theſe words, "who ſhall be puniſhed with an everlaſting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, from the preſence of the Lord, and the glory of his power," 2 Theſ. 1.9. It is ſo far from carrying the idea of diſſolution, that the contrary is evidently implied, viz. an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting ſeparation from the life-giving, happifying preſence of God, in endleſs miſery. It is certain, deſtruction cannot mean diſſolution, as ſpoken of the devils, "unembodied ſpirits," as, "art thou come to deſtroy us before the time?" Mark 1.24. and Luke 4.34. it is explained by St. Matthew, as he puts the queſtion, to mean "torment," only: "Art thou come to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment us before the time?" Mat. 8.29. It is evident, in the underſtanding of the ſacred writers, "their deſtruction," and their future puniſhment and torment, means preciſely one and the ſame thing. Nor, can deſtruction in the future world, mean diſſolution, as applied to the wicked, any more than to the devil and his angels. Becauſe, "the fire and puniſhment is the ſame, and the ſame duration to both; as hath been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore proved, from the words of our Saviour and St. John. Yea more, their own witneſs is clearly againſt them, Mat. 10.28. "And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the ſoul: but rather fear him which is able to deſtroy both ſoul and body in hell." Deſtruction in hell, is not diſſolution; the idea and doctrine of it is deſignedly excluded by our Saviour in this text. And if there was none other of the ſame import in the bible, this alone is a full and ſtanding confutation of it.
<pb n="307" facs="unknown:019737_0326_0FACA76D21C366F0"/>
"Diſſolution," is a killing of the body, whether in earth or hell, and no more: this, ſays our Saviour, men may do, and no more. But purpoſely to exclude this notion, and bring to view an infinitely more terrible puniſhment, that God can and will inflict, he tells us, "the deſtruction" of hell falls upon ſoul and body both. It will not admit the diſſolution of the body, for that is the idea directly oppoſed and contraſted: and diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution applied to the ſoul, an "immaterial ſpirit," is inconceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and a palpable abſurdity. Deſtruction here then, will bear no other ſenſe than that we have given, "not of being, but of happineſs," and that is plain and eaſy. From all which, it ſeems clear, deſtruction in the future world, as underſtood and taught by our Saviour and his apoſtles, doth not mean "diſſolution;" but that conſtruction is fully and deciſively confuted, in ſeveral texts. This prepares the way to ſhew, the "diſſolution" of the wicked, cannot be proved by the word "death" and "ſecond death" as applied to them in the future world: for we ſee this notion is excluded, in the doctrine of their deſtruction taught us; and it is particularly rejected and confuted by our Saviour, in the laſt text conſidered. And it cannot be introduced and ſupported by the word "death" or by any texts whatever, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the force of ſuch a deciſive authority. And if we take, not imagination, but the ſcripture for our guide and rule, it ſeems the meaning may become plain and eaſy. For "death," denoting the puniſhment of the future world, muſt have a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent conſtruction, from natural death; according to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent conſtitution of the two worlds: the one "temporary," the other "eternal." 2 Cor. 4.18. This to me appears an obvious and certain rule of conſtruction. "Death" then, as applied to the future world, is ſo far from carrying the idea of diſſolution in it, as that it is incompatible with it. It is "dying thou ſhalt die" without end, according to the firſt threatning. It is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, as all things pertaining to that conſtitution, are. And this rule of conſtruction ought to govern the meaning of all theſe texts, in the ſame manner. But in direct contradiction to this rule, this author carries the idea of natural death into the future world; and affixes it to the ſecond death. He gives us an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary deſcription of it, too long to be inſerted, concluding in this, "that upon this diſſolution, they have no more concern
<pb n="308" facs="unknown:019737_0327_0FACA76DE2534310"/>
with that world, than the dead have with this," as before noted. This is purely the work of imagination. Doth the ſcripture teach us ſo; that there is a time when they will have no more concern with that world? no, it gives not the leaſt countenance to this pernicious fancy, but teaches the contrary, "their worm ſhall never die." The firſt threatning, "dying thou ſhalt die," being oppoſed to life and happineſs, imports a perpetual exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from life and happineſs, in miſery as laſting as their exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as before noted. And it is obſervable, no more of this threatning is included in the judicial ſentence of natural death, than to anſwer there two grand purpoſes, viz. to exhibit a ſtrong teſtimony to mankind of the exceeding evil of ſin, and God's holy indignation againſt it: and yet, be conſiſtent with a new and further ſtate of trial to Adam and his poſterity, upon the ground of the promiſed ſeed and ſaviour. The ſentence is not in the words of the threatning: the word death, is not in it. But "duſt thou art, and unto duſt ſhalt thou return." This ſentence, and the execution of it, in natural death, were not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to teach us the full demerit of ſin, or the full puniſhment in the threatning. Nor is the term ſecond death, deſigned to teach us a diſſolution of the ſame kind with natural death, in the future world; and that ſuch a diſſolution is the whole pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment due to ſin, and contained in the divine threatnings. For the contrary idea and doctrine of it, is clearly and ſtrongly held forth to us, in the deſcriptions of it, throughout the new teſtament: and particularly by Paul, Rom. 6. 21, 22. where "this death" is contraſted with the "everlaſting life" that is the end of the faithful ſervants of God: and in v. 23, it is contraſted again, with that "eternal life" that is the gift of God to them: "for the wages of ſin is death: but the gift of God is eternal life, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord." "This death" ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly and directly contraſted with eternal life, as given of God and enjoyed by the faithful, is evidently "eternal death." So, his friend Dr. Taylor underſtands it truly. Now take this declaration of the apoſtle in connexion with the words of the firſt threatning "dying thou ſhalt die," without end or eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, and it gives the true ſentiment of this death, as oppoſite to that of a temporary diſſolution, as can be. And again, this idea and ſentiment, as contrary to a temporary diſſolution, as
<pb n="309" facs="unknown:019737_0328_0FACA76EA20F92F0"/>
poſſible, is carried in all the literal deſcriptions of this death and puniſhment, as everlaſting, as "everlaſting puniſhment," "everlaſting deſtruction," &amp;c. Moreover, to me it ſeems clear, the apoſtle deſignedly excludes this idea of the mortality of the wicked, and purpoſely introduces &amp; teaches that of their immortality in their reſurrection. In Rev. 20.14. "Death and hell, hades, were caſt into the lake of fire, this is the ſecond death." The obvious meaning ſeems to be this, "the wicked in the general reſurrection, which he had been deſcribing, ſhall be raiſed in a ſtate of immortality." There ſhall be no more natural death to them—no more diſſolution and ſuch a ſtate of ſeparation between ſoul and body, as hades. Theſe temporary puniſhments are abſolutely deſtroyed, and are ſucceeded by the ſecond death, which is without diſſolution, and without end. To this conſtruction "death ſhall be no more," "there ſhall be no more hades," this author oppoſes two which he calls inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable objections, p. 397. (1.) "It is not true in fact, he ſays, for the wicked after they are raiſed from the dead, ſhall die again, as we have repeatedly ſhewn." It is true, he aſſerts and repeats the doctrine of their diſſolution, once and again: but this is no proof. He neither hath nor can prove it. The argument then, amounts to this, "it is not agreeable to his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent and conſtruction, and therefore cannot be true." It carries all the force it can, it ſpeaks for itſelf, without a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. His 2d. reaſon is, "if the total deſtruction of death and hades be meant, how comes it to paſs that total deſtruction is not the thing meant, when the wicked are ſaid in the ſame words "to be caſt into the lake of fire?" The reaſon ſeems obvious, it reſpects two eſſentially different ſubjects: the one reſpects tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral death and hades, a kind of puniſhment, which ſhall be no more: the other, reſpects the wicked now in a ſtate of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, conſigned to another kind of puniſhment, the ſecond death, without end. Theſe things are clearly conſiſtent. And this conſtruction ſeems confirmed by ver. 8th of the next chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; where it is affirmed of the wicked "they ſhall have their part (or "portion" a the word is rendered Mat. 24.51. and Luke 12.46.) in the lake which burneth with fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone: which is the ſecond death." The meaning ſeems this, "the puniſhment repreſented by the lake of fire and brimſtone
<pb n="310" facs="unknown:019737_0329_0FACA76F61A455D0"/>
(dreadful and endleſs as it is) is the future "portion of the wicked:" this portion and puniſhment, and not diſſolution, is preciſely the thing intended, in the phraſe "ſecond death." The evaſion tells us, it is not ſaid of the wicked they ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways live in torment without dying:" but their immortality, unceaſing, endleſs miſery is literally taught in thoſe words "they ſhall be tormented day and night forever and ever," Rev. 20.10. the amount is the ſame. And our Saviour taught it, not only in the deſtruction of ſoul and body in hell; but in ſuch a plain, ſtrong and deciſive manner, as cannot be evaded, in his aſcription of immortality to their worm: which deſignates the immortality of the ſubject, the correlate of the worm, as truly as of the worm itſelf; and this muſt be his intention, as hath been ſhewn. It is very true, that immortality, incorruptibility joined with life, is not taught of the wicked in the future world, as it is of the righteous: and it is with wiſe, good reaſon, and the greateſt propriety: becauſe, it is aſcribed to the righteous as their crowning bleſſing and reward: whereas, the immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the wicked, is the reverſe. A ſimilar deſcription would only have ſerved to intangle and embarraſs, if not confound the ſubject; by making the ſenſe ambiguous, as applied to the one and the other. Neither is there any reaſon to think, it would have ſtopped the mouths of critical cavaillers; but would rather have given them more advantage to perplex, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſs the ſubject. An unbiaſſed mind, finds the immortality of the wicked, clearly taught in the texts which have been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced: and notwithſtanding the idea of a temporary diſſolution is ſo plainly, repeatedly and ſtrongly excluded; yet, they will adhere to it. Another inſtance perhaps may ſatisfy the reader, Notwithſtanding the apoſtle has deſcribed a glorious reſurrect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion and happy immortality, as the appropriate privilege of the righteous, in the moſt deciſive manner, 1 Cor. 15th chap. yet we find they will have "death deſtroyed" to be death ſwallowed up in the victory of the wicked, as well as the righteous; againſt the tenor of ſcripture and the whole force of the connexion, in the context. So that all his pains and clearneſs, doth not prevent this wrong application. Doubtleſs, theſe great ſubjects are taught and left to us in the beſt manner, to prevent miſtakes, to avoid confuſion, and preclude objections. And to me there
<pb n="311"
                         facs="unknown:019737_0330_0FACA770239D62C8"

appears a diſplay of divine wiſdom in the different manner, in which the immortality of the righteous and wicked taught unto us.—I will add, if theſe critical gentlemen, inſtead of exerting the whole force of genius, upon the impracticable, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible attempt to transfer the ſame ideas from a temporary, to an eternal conſtitution and ſtate of things; had entered upon the ſubject, in a true ſpirit of criticiſm, upon the ground of this clear diſtinction between the two worlds, they would have found two things of great weight: one is, they would have found the immortality of the ſubject, in all the everlaſting promiſes and threatnings of the goſpel. For it is impoſſible, everlaſting life ſhould be enjoyed, but by a ſubject that is immortal; or that everlaſting puniſhment ſhould be ſuffered, without the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of the ſubject of it. And therefore, in all theſe promiſes and threatnings, the immortality of the ſubject of the one and the other, is as fully and deſignedly taught us, as the endleſs bleſſing or curſe itſelf. It is ſo neceſſarily included, that it is impoſſible to ſeparate it in thought, or conceive of the fulfilment in truth, and fact, without the immortality of the ſubject. The other thing they would have found and told us is, that the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of the righteous, as well as the wicked, is far oftener taught us, perhaps four times to one more, in this way, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of life, that carry it neceſſarily in them; than, in direct aſſertions of it. From all which it appears, the evaſion avails nothing; for although the immortality of the wicked, be not taught improperly, as the objection ſeems to require: yet their mortality and diſſolution is denied once and again; and their immortality is repeatedly aſſerted in ſtrong terms, "in their worm that dieth not," which is equivalent to their living always in torment without dying, and "in death and hades caſt into the lake of fire," and other texts that have been cited: and it is likewiſe taught, in all the deſcriptions of their "death," "de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction" and "puniſhment" as "eternal" and "everlaſting;" in the ſame way and with the ſame force, as the immortality of the righteous, is the moſt commonly taught in the promiſes. In a word, all the threatnings of damnation and the future pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment, and promiſes of ſalvation, throughout revelation, are without end; and conſequently, all the promiſes and threatnings of the future world, implicitly teach, the immortality of the
<pb n="312" facs="unknown:019737_0331_0FACA77116CE9B98"/>
ſubjects of them: and therefore, what is ſuggeſted in the eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion can be no objection, to applying the word "everlaſting" in the ſame endleſs ſenſe, to the wicked as to the righteous. And the argument, eſpecially from the ſame word in the final ſentence, conſidered in all the connexions aforementioned, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in its full force. And I am miſtaken if the truth and weight of this argument doth not appear with clear and ſtronger force, the more cloſely it is examined. I would ſubjoin one argument more to fix the endleſs ſenſe, as applied to the wicked, which I have not ſeen noticed by any of theſe criticks, which ſeems to be weighty, viz. the wicked will be ſentenced to the ſame everlaſting puniſhment, with the devil and his angels. And the word "everlaſting" in this ſentence, carries the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of the wicked, and the endleſs duration of their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in it; as clearly and fully, as that of the devil and his angels. And it is an implied, full confutation of the notion of their diſſolution; as alſo, of their conſtruction of the word "age and diſpenſation" in the laſt ſentence. For where do we find mortality aſcribed to them; or, the word eternal, in this limited conſtruction, applied to ſet forth the future puniſhment of the devil and his angels? they make not the vain attempt to prove it. And yet without this, the argument for the endleſs ſenſe of the word continues in full force. For our Lord doubtleſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to teach the ſame duration of puniſhment, to the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as to them; in this emphatick deſcription "the fire," "the everlaſting one" prepared for the devil and his angels." If ſo, and the word "eternal" as applied to them, is always taken in the endleſs ſenſe; it deciſively fixes the ſame ſenſe, in reſpect to the wicked. There are two ſcripture texts cited to ſupport this evaſion, which will as properly be conſidered under the next, to which we paſs.</p>
                  <p>The 4th and capital evaſion is, "that the word aion and ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onios, tranſlated forever and eternal, are ſo far from being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined in their meaning to an endleſs duration, that they really ſignify nothing more than an age, diſpenſation or period of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, either longer or ſhorter:" and are moſt commonly uſed in this ſenſe, both in the old and new teſtament. And therefore the preciſe duration intended in any place cannot be known, but by the previouſly known nature of the ſubject, or
<pb n="313" facs="unknown:019737_0332_0FACA771A2088640"/>
other paſſages of ſcripture which explain it. P. 224, 264, and 8.</p>
                  <p>That if we confine ourſelves to the mere force of the word, it more probably means a limited than endleſs duration, becauſe, this is the moſt frequent uſe of it in the ſacred writings," p. 260. And to give the objection the utmoſt advantage, and that be ſuppoſed (which it is ſaid, can never be proved) "that the word aionios, eternal, ſignifies duration without end; and when uſed in a limited ſenſe, it is in a lax, leſs proper way of ſpeaking: yet as the ſcripture has taught us this lax ſenſe; it may be ſo applied to the future puniſhment of the wicked, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently it cannot by the force of theſe words uſed to deſcribe it, be proved to be without end, p. 270, 271. In reply to this evaſion, I would remark ſome things generally, upon the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral matters contained in it; and then in a more direct way e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, the invalidity of it.</p>
                  <p>I would firſt obſerve, the uſe of theſe words ſometimes in the lax, limited ſenſe, is no new diſcovery of theſe ingenuous gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen; it hath been known by learned men of all ages: but that it is moſt commonly uſed in this ſenſe in the new teſtament, cannot be admitted. For, it is allowed, p. 284. that it is uſed more than forty times for the future ſtate and life of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: whereas, the whole liſt of texts for the limited ſenſe, are a little more than thirty, and ſome of them diſputable. And when the numerous texts are added, which characterize the bleſſed God as eternal and everlaſting, and which deſcribe his being, throne, kingdom, power, truth, word and glory, as for ever and forever and ever—and in the doxologes, it will produce a large ſurpluſſage, in the endleſs ſenſe. Nor do I believe it true in fact, in reſpect to the old teſtament. The texts, that celebrate the mercy of God only, as enduring forever, are more in number than all they have produced for a limited conſtruction. And the texts that teach us, God is everlaſting, that his arm, truth, righteouſneſs, his throne, dominion, kingdom, glory and word are everlaſting and endure forever, are numerous; exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of the promiſed, everlaſting rewards of the righteous. But I have given no great attention to this, for with me the frequent uſe of the words in the lax ſenſe, is not weighty: we muſt have more ſolid ground, and a more deciſive rule of conſtruction, for a judicious mind to reſt upon, in matters of eternal concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="314" facs="unknown:019737_0333_0FACA7726312F160"/>
Which leads to another remark, viz. that the frequent uſe of a word in ſcripture, is at beſt but a precarious rule—and that we muſt previouſly know the ſpecific nature of a ſubject, before we can know the ſenſe of a word applied to it, to me appears abſurd. Frequency of uſe is evidently precarious, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, if the ſame word do not reſpect the ſame ſubject and world, as when moſt commonly uſed; it is abſolutely no rule at all, or becomes a falſe one. The word "God" frequently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes him who is God by nature, and it is frequently uſed of thoſe who are not god by nature, and ſometimes applied to men as gods by office, by delegation of authority and power. To determine the meaning of the word, in any particular text, we never turn a thought in which ſenſe it is moſt commonly uſed, but by the connexion, we ſee which is intended by the ſacred writer, and that determines us in a moment, without any refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to frequency of uſe. Juſt ſo, ſhould the evident inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſacred writers determine us to the limited or endleſs ſenſe of theſe words in diſpute. The ſenſe of the ſame words, always uſed in a limited conſtruction, when applied to things and ſubjects of this world; is abſolutely changed, when applied to ſubjects in the future world, into endleſs. This we ſee in their own example, of aionios "eternal" joined with zoes, life: For the word "life" is moſt commonly uſed in ſcripture for this natural, mortal life "which is of few days and full of trouble." And they tell us, the word aionios moſt commonly ſignifies an age or diſpenſation, and it hath always a limited conſtruction when applied to the ſubjects of this world. By this rule then, both theſe words ought to have a limited conſtruction when joined and applied to ſubjects in the future world; becauſe moſt commonly ſo uſed and it is their invariable ſenſe as applied to the ſubjects of this world: whereas, when joined and applied to ſubjects in the future world, "everlaſting life," they are certainly both endleſs. And it is equally true of the words, "death," "deſtruction" and "puniſhment," when applied to ſubjects in the future world; as of life, their ſenſe is changed in the ſame manner. This in point, ſhews the falſity of their r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>le of applying the ſame ſenſe of words as moſt commonly uſed of ſubjects of this world, to the ſubjects of the future world. In regard to the "previouſly known nature of the ſubject," it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

true, we muſt be appriſed of the general ſubject treated of, whether it be God or the creature, a ſubject of this world or the future, in order to underſtand it. But that the ſpecial na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and properties of the ſubject, muſt be firſt known; as that God is eternal, the fire of hell endleſs, the immortality of the righteous and wicked, and the reward and puniſhment of the future world is endleſs, before we can know and fix the endleſs ſenſe of the words, by which, the whole of this ſubject is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignedly taught us; to me is abſurd. Becauſe it ſuperſedes the need of teaching, if the ſpecial nature and properties of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject be already known. Beſides, upon this plan, matters of pure revelation can never be taught, if we cannot know the ſenſe and force of the words, by which, it is to be communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us, without a previous knowledge of the ſpecial nature and properties of the ſubject. For by ſuppoſition the ſubject is before, wholly unknown to us. Now a rule to explain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, that renders teaching needleſs, and by which matters of pure revelation (and ſuch are the eternal concernments of the future world) cannot be taught; is abſurd in a high degree. Surely, the inſpired teachers did not impoſe this impoſſible taſk upon jews and gentiles, that they muſt previouſly <hi>know</hi> the ſpecific nature and properties of the ſubjects they taught them, as a prerequiſite to their underſtanding the meaning of the words they make uſe of, in teaching them. So that theſe lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned criticks, it ſeems, have involved the ſubject in ſevenfold more darkneſs, than when they took it up. For we are told, "the ſenſe of theſe words cannot be known with certainty," but by their rules, and theſe we ſee to be evidently falſe and abſurd: and conſequently, they have thrown and left the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, in a labyrinth of ſcepticiſm.—Another remark, which may tend to break the force of this objection, is this, "that we always fix the endleſs ſenſe to the word "forever" when applied to the ſubjects of the future world; and yet it is probably as frequently uſed in the lax ſenſe with us, when applied to the things of this world, as it was in the days of inſpiration: and we have no reaſon to believe but that the limited ſenſe as appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the things of this world, and the endleſs ſenſe as applied <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> thoſe of the future world, was as clear, fixed and certain then, in the mind of the inſpired teachers and of them who were taught
<pb n="316" facs="unknown:019737_0335_0FACA773E20F7798"/>
by them, as it hath been with the chriſtian church ever ſince. The word "forever" is frequently and abundantly uſed in the lax, limited ſenſe, in the courſe of buſineſs in this world. It is ſo uſed, commonly, in all abſolute gifts, grants, conveyances and ſecurities; as in bills of ſale, warrantee-deeds, in abſolute grants by will, of lands and chattels and the like; they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by the word "forever." Now, the word thus applied, is ſo limited by the general nature of the ſubject, that no one takes it in the ſtrict endleſs ſenſe; or to mean any more than that the grantee ſhould hold the premiſes as long as can be by the force of this tenure, according to the nature of the thing and courſe of this world: and yet this frequent uſe of the word in this lax ſenſe; and always ſo when applied to the ſubjects of this world, introduces no embarraſſment or difficulty in our minds, in affixing the endleſs ſenſe to the ſubjects of the future inviſible world. Nor can I ſee a ſhadow of reaſon to ſuppoſe that this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction was not as clear to men in the days of inſpiration, as it is to us: or that the lax ſenſe applied to ſubjects of this, and the endleſs ſenſe when applied to ſubjects of the future world, was not as clear and fixed with him, as it hath been with the body of the chriſtian world, ever ſince. It is abſurd &amp; incredible to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, they underſtood the word as applied to the covenant with Noah and every living creature, and to the temporary ſtatutes of the Moſaic conſtitution, to their inheritance in Canaan, to the hills and mountains, and to the ſervant whoſe ears was bored, that "muſt ſerve forever," Exod. 21. 6. in the ſame ſenſe: as, when applied to the everlaſting God, to the inheritance of the ſaint<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> in heaven, and other ſubjects of the future world, where there is nothing to limit it, and the endleſs ſenſe, is by far the moſt natural and rational. Let us ſuppoſe a man to riſe up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, to diſpute the public known faith of the people in this land, from the firſt ſettlement to this day; on this ground. He argues, you cannot prove they uſed the word "forever" in the endleſs ſenſe, when applied to the ſubjects of the inviſible world; unleſs, "they always uſed it in this ſenſe, only." But they certainly uſed it ſometimes (that is when applied to the things of this world) in a limited ſenſe: and if they uſed it ſo, in the ſingular number, the plural "forever and ever" cannot eſſentially alter the ſignification of the word. Again, they
<pb n="317" facs="unknown:019737_0336_0FACA774A161CE90"/>
certainly uſed it very commonly, in the limited ſenſe, in the courſe of their worldly tranſactions. Look into the probate records, you find abſolute gifts and deviſes of goods, chattels and lands expreſſed by the word "forever." And in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon regiſters, you find abſolute conveyances of lands by deeds of gift or ſale, "to them and their heirs forever." Thence it appears, their moſt common and frequent uſe of the word "for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever" was in the limited ſenſe, not ſtrictly eternal. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as they have taught us the uſe of the word in the lax ſenſe, and that more commonly than in the ſtrict and proper ſenſe, (if the endleſs ſenſe be ſo) it cannot be thought hard or unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to ſuppoſe they affixed the limited ſenſe to it, when ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the ſubjects of the future world. Certainly, a ſtring of ſuch arguments as long as one's arm, would carry no force of conviction to any judicious perſon, who knew it to be their common faith; that in the endleſs ſenſe, the righteous would be forever happy, and the wicked forever miſerable. And the ſame fallacy attends the reaſoning from the lax ſenſe, and its being frequently ſo uſed in ſcripture, when applied to things in this world; it carries not a ſhadow of proof, that the endleſs ſenſe was not always fixed to all the ſubjects of the future world. This, if I miſtake not, breaks the force of this grand argument and manner of arguing. The different ſubjects to which theſe words were to be applied in the limited and endleſs ſenſe, was no doubt a matter as clear as day, to the inſpired teachers; and they taught it clearly, and not in the perplexed, embarraſſing manner, as is pretended. Therefore, if we can happily find their due, and the ground they went upon, the ſubject muſt be deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively clear to us, and the whole foundation of the objection muſt be removed. Wherefore, for a more direct reply, let it be noted, that the word "aion" in the etymology of it, is naturally and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly expreſſive of "endleſs duration." It is well known to be a compound of ai, always, and on, exiſting; and the idea clearly conveyed by it, is "endleſs exiſtence." It is further to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the inſpired teachers, certainly uſed this noun and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective abundantly, in the endleſs ſenſe; according to its natural <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>port. For by theſe words they abundantly taught the things of the eternal world; uſing the word adaios but twice in the new teſtament, as before obſerved. Again, by the force of
<pb n="318" facs="unknown:019737_0337_0FACA77562B7A648"/>
theſe words, they taught eternal things, plainly, properly, prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically and forcibly; with an intention, that they ſhould have a governing influence over the hearts and lives of men, learned and unlearned. So did our Lord, "labour not for the meat that periſheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life," "he that believeth hath everlaſting life," "the water that I ſhall give him, ſhall be in him, a well of water ſpringing up unto everlaſting life," "he that eateth of this bread ſhall live forever." So Paul taught "the houſe not made with hands, eternal in the heavens," &amp;c. And it is obvious, that all theſe inſpired teachers intended, that jew and gentile, ſcythian, bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barian, bond and free, children and ſervants, ſhould underſtand eternal things by the force of theſe words, whereby they taught them; even thoſe who could not determine the ſenſe of the words by any previous knowledge of the nature of the ſubject; and that by the knowledge of them ſo conveyed, they ſhould be induced to live by the faith of them; and endure through the ſervices and trials of this life, "by looking to things unſeen and "eternal." Now in the whole of this doctrine they could not uſe the words, for "a diſpenſation," "age and period," but in the endleſs ſenſe only. For they could not teach eternal things in any other ſenſe of the words; and they certainly ſo uſed them properly and forcibly. For it is abſurd to ſay, they uſed impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per word or words, whoſe force was inadequate to their intention. I will add, more than all this, they have taught us, the eſſential difference between the conſtitution of things in this and the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture world; ſo as deciſively to fix the limited and endleſs ſenſe of theſe words, perpetually, in the uſe of them: as in two point to name no more, viz. one is, by divine conſtitution the things of this world are temporary, and the things of the inviſible world are "eternal." The other is, the preſent is a ſtate of diſcipline, the future a ſtate of retribution, of rewards and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhments, only. This is fully ſufficient for our purpoſe. For theſe doctrines fix the limited ſenſe, to all things of this world and ſtate, to which they are applied: and the endleſs ſenſe, to all things in the inviſible world, with eaſe and abſolute certainty. Upon this ground, their perpetual uſe of the words, as appli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> to theſe eſſentually different ſubject, is very clear; and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject eaſily taken up by learned and unlearned, jew and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

ſcythian, barbarian, bond and free. And their doctrines of the inviſible world as "eternal" would come with certainty and force upon thoſe, who could not poſſibly underſtand their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious nature as ſuch, but as they taught it to them. Thus it was doubtleſs taken up in the days of inſpiration, as it hath been by the chriſtian church ever ſince, a handful only excepted. Theſe things are too obvious, to need enlargement. And two things ſeem plainly to follow from this ſtating, viz. (1.) That the endleſs and everlaſting ſenſe, is the primary, moſt proper, and moſt important ſenſe of theſe words and phraſes. And that when they are applied to the things of time in a limited man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, it is always in a figurative, l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

There being no reaſon in ſuch caſe, to limit, but every reaſon for the endleſs ſenſe. And this rule of reaſon, is confirmed by this argument, "the inſpired teachers have in fact, themſelves limited the conſtruction, in every inſtance, where it is deſigned <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="320" facs="unknown:019737_0339_0FACA7770A74BE18"/>
have affixed no note of limitation to any of the things of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible world, theſe words ſo applied, ought always to be taken in the endleſs ſenſe. And I ſee not that any man can have any more right to put a limited conſtruction to them, when ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, than by interpolation, to inſert a new text in revelation, contrary to the general import of it. This makes way for an eaſy anſwer to the argument from two texts of ſcripture, to prove that the ſame words in the laſt ſentence may have a different conſtruction as applied to the righteous and wicked. The texts are Rom. 16. part of the 25th and 26th verſes, "According to the miſtery which was kept ſecret (chronois aioniois) ſince the world began; but now is made manifeſt, according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment (tou aioniou Theou) of the everlaſting God." And Tit. 1.2. In hope (zoes aioniou) of eternal life, which God that cannot lie, promiſed (pro cronon aionion) before the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan. Here it is ſaid the "adjective" as applied "to God and life" upon the principles of the objectors, is to be taken in the endleſs ſenſe; but in both verſes where it is joined with "chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non" it hath a limited conſtruction. The concluſion drawn from it is this, that we cannot complain of the conſtruction they put upon Mat. 25. in affixing the endleſs ſenſe of the word in the ſame ſentence to the righteous, and a limited one to the wicked, as being hard or unreaſonable, without condemning ourſelves, p. 289, 90. The anſwer is eaſy, the adjective as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to God, and to life in the future world, hath nothing to limit it; and where inſpiration doth not limit it, no man hath a right to do it; and we therefore receive it in the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſenſe. But in the other part, there is a note of time and limitation expreſsly ſet forth; and we accordingly give it a limited conſtruction; and herein we are clearly ſelf-conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. But there is no note of limitation, as it is applied to the wicked in the 25th of Mat. or any where elſe, any more than to the righteous; and therefore the ground of complaint re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in full force, againſt them. And inaſmuch as the ſentence to both, is on the ground of the ſame divine conſtitution, which is everlaſting, and by the ſame rule and doctrine of retribution; of neceſſity, the word muſt be taken in the ſame ſenſe, as car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying the ſame duration to the righteous and wicked: and for other reaſons which have been aſſigned. Theſe adduced texts
<pb n="321" facs="unknown:019737_0340_0FACA777CFD081F8"/>
afford no parallel; they do not touch the force of the argument, which remains in its full ſtrength. But it is ſtrongly objected, if the endleſs ſenſe of theſe words be admited as the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; yet as they are often uſed for an age, and diſpenſation, and in a lax, limited ſenſe, and the ſcripture has taught us this uſe of them, it cannot be thought hard and unreaſonable ſo to apply them to the ſubjects of the inviſible world, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to the future puniſhment of the wicked, p. 271, 279. The foundation of this objection is ſubverted, by what hath been already ſaid: but for a more direct anſwer, let it be noted (1.) they have never taught us this lax ſenſe, but when the words are applied to the things of this world, to things which we know to be temporary in their nature; or know it by their affixing ſome note of time in their deſcription: they have never taught us the lax ſenſe of theſe words when applied to the ſubjects of the inviſible world: we have no inſtance, example or warrant for it; and therefore, ſo to apply them, may well be thought Unwarrantable, and unreaſonable. (2dly.) So to apply the words, is contrary to their manifeſt intention. The inſpired teachers certainly intend to teach us the things of the inviſible world, as "eternal" by the force of theſe words: and to teach them plainly, forcibly and practically, as of the utmoſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to mankind, as before obſerved. And in this teaching, they infallibly uſe the words in the never-ending ſenſe; for they cannot be taught in any other. It is of no weight to ſay, they are often uſed in the lax ſenſe as applied to the things of this world; and when ſo applied, they have not the ſame force as the word "eternal." For let them be ever ſo often uſed in the lax ſenſe applied to temporary things, yet when improved to teach us "eternal things," the never-ending ſenſe muſt be fixed. For in the lax, limited ſenſe, eternal things can no more be taught of the inviſible, than preſent world. The moment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they intend to teach us eternal things, the limited ſenſe is dropped, and the never-ending ſenſe is infallibly fixed. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as they plainly and abundantly teach us the things of the inviſible world, as "eternal;" and by that view of them, to form us to practical godlineſs: and as we know nothing in the nature of thoſe things to limit the ſenſe, and they have given us <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> note of limitation to any of the ſubjects of the future world,
<pb n="322" facs="unknown:019737_0341_0FACA77861BA3760"/>
as they doubtleſs would had they been temporary (for it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible we ſhould know it, without ſuch direction): we are therefore neceſſitated, always to take theſe words in the never-ending ſenſe, as applied to the ſubjects of that world. And to apply the limited ſenſe, to any of the ſubjects of that world, in an arbitrary way, without warrant and againſt their manifeſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, is unreaſonable and abſurd. Again, (3dly,) ſo to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the words, is contrary to the nature of the ſubject and to the conſtitution of things in the inviſible world, which is "eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal." We know all things in this world ſtand upon a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary conſtitution; but the things of the inviſible world are upon one that is "eternal." This difference of conſtitution between the two worlds, is taught generally, throughout revelation; but expreſsly by Paul, 2 Cor. 4. 18. "for the things that are ſeen are temporal (temporary), but the things which are not ſeen, are "eternal." Here he deſignedly teaches us, the grand diſtinction in the nature and conſtitution of things, in this and the future inviſible world, in point of duration; the one tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary, and the other eternal. And this fixes the ſenſe of theſe words as applied to the things of each world, with eaſe and certainty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the limited ſenſe to all things in this world, and the never-ending ſenſe to all things infallibly, in the inviſible world. Now to transfer limited, temporary ideas to things, upon an eternal conſtitution, is directly contrary to the nature of the ſubject. It ſinks our apprehenſions of them, infinitely below their true nature, weight and importance; and it is abſolute confuſion, in the nature of the thing: as truly ſo, as it would be in treating of colours, to ſay, a blue-red, a crow-white and a ſnow-black: as much confuſion in nature and far worſe, than "the yoking an ox and aſs together," forbidden by the law of Moſes. Certainly, the inſpired teachers from God, never taught the grand doctrines of the inviſible world, the moſt important and influencing in all chriſtianity, in ſuch ſceptic confuſion, as to leave every man to fix what ſenſe upon their words, they fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied: no, they taught them as eternal, with great diſtinctneſs and clearneſs, as we ſee in this inſtance, that they might be ſo received with undoubted certainty; and have a commanding influence over the hearts and lives of men. It is abſurd another way, becauſe (4thly.) the annexing ages and diſpenſations to
<pb n="323" facs="unknown:019737_0342_0FACA77921A6EDE0"/>
the terms, applied to the things of the future world can anſwer no purpoſe, but to embarraſs and perplex the ſubject; for except the impropriety of it, the ſubject is as abſolutely ſecure on the ground of that conſtruction, as in that which is moſt common, rational and proper. It can avail them nothing, becauſe the ſtate of the ſubjects and the character of the diſpenſations, are ſo infallibly fixed; that the never-ending ſenſe of theſe ages and diſpenſations, both to the righteous and wicked, in the future world, is abſolutely unavoidable. We know by the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the goſpel, and the final ſentence, that the ſtate of the righteous and wicked in that world, is abſolutely fixed: the one in happineſs, the other in torment. And the character of the diſpenſations are likewiſe fixed; to the one, reward and happineſs; to the other, wrath and puniſhment: and theſe ages and diſpenſations are without end to both; as laſting as their immortality. For there is nothing in the conſtitution of that world, as there is in this, to limit them: and there is no note of limitation affixed to any of the things of that world; but we are expreſsly taught, they are "eternal." And the ſtate of the ſubjects and character of theſe diſpenſations being infallibly fixed, in ſcripture—the never-ending ſenſe of theſe ages and diſpenſations becomes abſolutely unavoidable. The "forever," "forever and ever," "eternal," and everlaſting of that world, applied to the righteous and wicked, to the happineſs of the one and miſery of the other; if you will improperly expreſs it by ages and diſpenſations, is without change or end. Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath put no bounds or end to it, nor may any creature in heaven, earth or hell, preſume to do it. The idea of ages and diſpenſations in this connexion, can make no alteration in the nature of the ſubject; nor infer and make any change in the character and ſtate of the righteous or wicked: the character of the diſpenſation to the one and the other, remains preciſely and abſolutely the ſame, from the firſt, throughout their endleſs exiſtence. Certainly, when the ſcripture hath ſo deciſively fixed the future ſtate of the wicked, in torment; the words ages and diſpenſations applied to it, doth not make the leaſt advance towards the idea of mercy and reſtoration: for it is ages and diſpenſations of darkneſs, wrath and torment ſtill, without end, as it is emphatically deſcribed, "and ſhall be tormented day
<pb n="324" facs="unknown:019737_0343_0FACA779E16C6198"/>
and night forever and ever" without limitation. Yea, the idea of mercy and reſtoration is abſolutely excluded, in the ages and diſpenſations applied to ſubjects, whoſe ſtate is thus fixed in torment, by an everlaſting conſtitution and the irreverſible ſentence of the ſupreme Judge. Nor can it be introduced and ſuppoſed, but againſt the nature of the ſubject, and force of all the deſcriptions of the future puniſhment throughout revelation. For in all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> deſcriptions, the ſtate of the ſubject and charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the diſpenſation is fixed, and without end. This infers theſe ages and diſpenſations to be without end: and their never-ending ſenſe is hereby ſo aſcertained, as cannot be avoided, but by affixing to them an arbitrary ſuppoſed ſenſe, in direct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to the doctrine taught and imported throughout re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation. Their conſtruction cannot be admitted, becauſe (5thly.) it is contrary to the great doctrine retribution, taught us throughout revelation; which aſcertains the limited ſenſe, to all things whatever in this world; and the never-ending ſenſe to thoſe of the future world. We have before proved the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture judgment will be final, the ſentences of the great day irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſible, and the ſtate of the righteous and wicked will be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterably fixed by them, in the future world. This doctrine aſcertains the limited ſenſe of theſe words, how often ſoever they be applied to the things of this world; and the endleſs ſenſe, to thoſe of the future world. The doctrine of future retribution, which is inſeparably connected with that of the final judgment, doth with the ſame eaſe and certainty determine the ſenſe of theſe words invariably, as applied to the things of this, and the future world. The ſcripture teaches us but of two worlds, in which mankind have concern; this preſent, and the future, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible world. And it abundantly teacheth us, the preſent world is a ſtate of probation, trial and diſcipline for mankind, and the future world is a ſtate of retribution, of rewards and puniſhments, only. Perhaps there is no doctrine more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant to the kingdom of God, and of greater influence for the good of mankind, for this world and the future, than the doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine of future retribution, in its connexions: nor do I know any doctrine more clearly, deciſively and frequently taught in ſcripture. Our Saviour taught it moſt plainly, and in a variety of parables, moſt forcibly: the prophets taught it, and the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
<pb n="325" facs="unknown:019737_0344_0FACA77AA15FF9D0"/>
more abundantly: and in truth, this doctrine runs throughout revelation, from the firſt prophecy of Enoch, to the laſt chapter of revelation. Indeed, it ſeems to be a doctrine of nature, written upon the hearts of all men, the future hopes and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>rs of men without, as well as with revelation, bear witneſs to it: and perhaps, there is no one doctrine in religion, in which men of all religions, and of the chriſtian in particular, have been more unanimouſly agreed, than in this; that the future ſtates will be a ſtate of retribution. Catholicks and proteſtants, lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans, calveniſts, arminians, and in general chriſtians of all denominations, have unanimouſly believed, the future ſtate after the final judgment, would be a ſtate of retribution. Now this important ſcripture doctrine of retribution, gives us an eaſy due with certainty to determine the ſenſe of theſe words, as applied to things of this, or the future ſtate and world. It in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>allibly fixes a limited ſenſe to them, when uſed to ſignify an age, or ages, and diſpenſations in this world; and ſo when ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the hills and mountains, and to the earth itſelf: in ſhort in every caſe, where applied to the things of this ſtate and world. Becauſe, from the nature of the thing, this ſtate of probation and diſcipline muſt and will come to an end; to make way for a future judgment, and to give place to a ſtate of retribution. And all things pertaining to it will come to a period in the end of the world; and the ſtates of all men be ſettled for retribution, in the day of judgment. On the other hand, this doctrine of retribution, fixes the never-ending ſenſe as clearly and certainly, for the inviſible world to come: it determines the final ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to be irreverſible, the ſtate of the righteous and wicked to be unalterably fixed by them; and the rewards and puniſhments to be as everlaſting as the conſtitution, by which they are awar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and as the immortality of the ſubjects of them. For, in that world, both good and bad receive in retribution according to the things done in the body in this life, and not according to what may be done in that ſtate, in reference to any future one, which would confound and deſtroy the doctrine, as taught in revelation. A ſtate of retribution that is final, is in the nature of the thing as fixed and endleſs as the ſubjects of it. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſuppoſition, is a flat contradiction to the nature of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, nor can be admitted but by excluding the idea &amp; doctrine
<pb n="326" facs="unknown:019737_0345_0FACA77B61685A58"/>
of retribution, and ſubſtituting ſome other eſſentially different, in the room of it. So that the limited ſenſe of theſe words when applied to things of this, and the endleſs ſenſe when applied to thoſe of the future world, is juſt as clear and certain, as the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of retribution; than which, I find none more ſo, in all revelation. With this key and the other expreſsly given by the apoſtle, "the things that are ſeen are temporary; and the things that are unſeen are eternal," the ſubject is as eaſy as it is important to all men, the unlearned as well as learned. And thus it was undoubtedly taught and received in the days of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration: with which argument I ſhall cloſe this part of the diſpute. But previouſly I would obſerve, that what hath been offered, will afford a ſufficient anſwer to the ſeveral embarraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing difficulties ſuggeſted upon this ſubject. It is repreſented as a matter of ſurprize "the word eternal and everlaſting" is ſo ſeldom applied to the ſuture puniſhment. It is ſaid to be but five times uſed in all the new teſtament," p. 259. What then? the final deſtruction, death, damnation and perdition of the wicked, is abundantly taught, and always without end: and it is taught in ſuch forcible deſcriptions, literal and figurative, by exemplification, by connexion and contraſt, as to exclude all hope and poſſibility of ſalvation to them, as hath been ſhewn. And the doctrine of retribution, fixes the endleſs ſenſe of the words ſo applied, and fixes their ſtate unalterable, and their puniſhment as laſting as their immortality. Nor doth there appear any heſitancy or diſpute about it in that age, among thoſe who believed in a future ſtate. It is alſo ſaid, there is a very wide difference between happineſs and miſery, reward and puniſhment, which makes it proper to underſtand the word e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting, in different ſenſes, as applied to the righteous and wicked; according to the different natures of the ſubjects, to which they are applied. An everlaſting reward, which is the gift of grace, is agreeable to our natural notions of infinite, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect benevolence; but everlaſting puniſhment is with great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty to be reconciled, if at all reconcilable with it. And upon this gronnd we may well admit the endleſs ſenſe to the one, and a limited ſenſe to the other, p. 285, 6. This idea of the nature of the ſubject, ſeems no ſolid ground, of forcible argument.— If the award to the righteous and wicked, ſtands upon the ſame
<pb n="327" facs="unknown:019737_0346_0FACA77C22947E48"/>
everlaſting conſtitution, and is predicated upon the ſame ground, the things done in the body," and is by force of the ſame un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring rule of retribution, and the ſentence be given by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring Judge, to a ſtate of retribution, in the ſame words to both; of neceſſity, the ſame duration muſt be intended and carried in them. Theſe things together ought to govern the conſtruction, and not the nature of the ſubject in that very looſe ſenſe of it. It is alſo to be noted, the idea of benevolence is not ſuch a correlate with miſery and puniſhment, whereby alone, the wiſdom and righteouſneſs of it can be determined. It is juſtice, and the wiſe, great and good ends of government, are the natural correlates with puniſhment, by which to determine the nature, degree, and duration of it, with propriety. And our ideas of infinite, immutable holineſs, truth and juſtice are as natural, as thoſe of infinite benevolence and grace. And the everlaſting diſplay of the one in the divine adminiſtration, is as natural and rational an apprehenſion and expectation, as that of the other. Conſequently, if the wiſe ends of government re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it, it is no more inconſiſtent with our natural and juſt apprehenſions of the true character of God, that he ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play everlaſting righteouſneſs, in the puniſhment of the wicked, than everlaſting grace, in rewarding the righteous. And it may be further noted, that examples of final capital puniſhment to the diſobedient, may be as neceſſary in the government of God, as in thoſe of mankind. This ſeems conceded and argued by the Dr. in his treatiſe upon the benevolence of the deity, p. 244, 5, 6. and it is fully proved in the many terrible retributions of providence in this world. And no man with force of reaſon, nor without great preſumption can pretend to ſet bounds to the duration of thoſe examples, in the everlaſting kingdom of God and in the future ſtate of retribution. So that this argument is of no force, and ſeems impertinently urged againſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conſtruction and doctrine. The argument againſt the infinite ill-demerit of ſin, "becauſe the act of a finite creature and from finite paſſions," &amp;c. has in general been ſufficiently anſwered, in the firſt part. But it is argued, if ſin be an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite evil, becauſe committed againſt an infinite God; then all ſinners muſt ſuffer to the utmoſt degree, as well as duration. This doth by no means follow. It may on that ground, require
<pb n="328" facs="unknown:019737_0347_0FACA77CE1CFF1E0"/>
an eternal excluſion from life and heaven and duration of pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment; and yet the degrees of ſufferings may be very various, throughout this duration. As we know the natural reproaches and horrors of conſcience will be greater in ſome than others, and are taught in revelation it will be more tolerable for ſome, than others. But there is no difference intimated, in point of duration. Another thing urged is, the ſmall difference in character between ſome of the wicked and ſome of the good, which is undiſcernable by men, and cannot lay a foundation for ſuch an amazing difference between them in the future world, p. 320, 321. to which I would reply: there is certainly an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential and infinitely important difference between accepting and rejecting the goſpel terms of life; or otherwiſe ſalvation and damnation would not be made to depend, upon it. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we, judging by outward appearance cannot determine it, God who ſearches the heart can, and doth do it. The rule and terms are unalterably fixed, and the final ſentence will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemn all who refuſe life, and neglect ſo great ſalvation. And God the righteous Judge, knows infinitely better than we, and his rules are certainly, everlaſting righteouſneſs. This objection ſeems to go rather to the conſtitution itſelf, than to the duration of the puniſhment. It faults the conſtitution for condemning thoſe, this author judges ought not to be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. For if by conſtitution they ought to be condemned, it is righteous it ſhould be according to their deſert, and to the puniſhment declared, in the conſtitution. Is is added, "a very great part of thoſe, who will be miſerable in the other world, were not, that we know of, incurably ſinful in this."
<q>And it cannot be ſuppoſed they ſhould be conſigned to endleſs tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without another trial,</q>
&amp;c. p. 321. Why not? If they ſinned away their day of grace, they may righteouſly be fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver excluded mercy. And if the goſpel conſtitution be ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, it is clear they muſt be ſo. To which I would add, incurableneſs in wickedneſs is not the ground and rule of final, capital puniſhment, in the government of God, or of mankind; but it is the ill-deſert of the criminals, and the wiſe ends of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to be anſwered, in ſuch executions. Among men, ſome that are ſo far from irrecoverable, as to be actually reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by repentance, muſt yet ſuffer capital puniſhment, by the
<pb n="329" facs="unknown:019737_0348_0FACA77DA1A86CB0"/>
law of the land. The penitent thief on the croſs, is an inſtance of this kind. He muſt ſuffer death, juſtly, by his own confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and yet a true penitent. And it would be hard to ſuppoſe there are none penitent, among thoſe who ſhed innocent blood; and yet by the laws of God and man, they muſt die a violent death. So that it is evident among men, incurableneſs is not the ground of capital execution, but the ill-deſert of the crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals; and becauſe law and juſtice muſt have their courſe upon ſuch offenders, and the good ends of government, require it. And the ſcripture rule of retribution fixes it altogether upon ill-demerit, "the evil deeds done in the body," and no where reſpecting the future world, upon the ſtate of the mind, as cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able or incurable. Incurableneſs in the ſenſe objected, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, not the ground of the future puniſhment: for if it was, why were the fallen angels, for the firſt offence, without further trial, caſt out of heaven and conſigned to puniſhment? All we read is, "they kept not their firſt eſtate, but left their own ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation," upon which they were baniſhed heaven and the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pifying preſence of God, in a ſtate of puniſhment: in which, they have continued almoſt ſix thouſand years; and are now reſerved in everlaſting chains, to the judgment day: then to be condemned and deſtroyed in the everlaſting fire prepared for them. This objection ſeems plainly ill founded, and of no force.</p>
                  <p>It is further added, "the ſmallneſs of the number of thoſe who ſhall be ſaved in the next ſtate, ought to be eſteemed a weighty argument againſt interpreting any texts of ſcripture, ſo as to mean abſolutely, eternal miſery. It is ſaid, if the next ſtate be final, but few of mankind comparitively, will be ſaved. For proof, is cited, Mat. 7.14. "Strait is the gate, and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it." And the few of mankind that appear to have the ſcripture cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of life upon them from one age to another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is urged as proof, that few will be ſaved, if the next ſtate be final. And if but few be ſaved in final iſſue, then he declaims, "what a ſtrange idea muſt we have of the mercy of the chriſtian diſpenſation, ſo celebrated for its unſearchable riches and glory?" The birth of the Saviour is ſpoken of "as glad tidings of great joy to all people," and we ſay with great propriety, if it opens a door of ſalvation to all people of all nations, upon the ſame gracious
<pb n="330" facs="unknown:019737_0349_0FACA77E634C77F0"/>
terms, in compliance with which, they may be ſaved: and if they periſh it is in their own default. "An anthem of praiſe was ſung by the heavenly hoſts to God, for his good-will to men." And we ſay with the greateſt propriety "if God ſo loved the world as to give his only begotten Son, that whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth in him ſhould not periſh, but have eternal life." Nor is it the leſs to be celebrated, altho' the unbelieving, in rejecting the terms of life, periſh in their iniquity. But, he ſays, the total ruin of ſuch multitudes appears to him a palpable incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency, with the grace of God exhibited in the goſpel. How ſo? when this grace is exhibited as bringing ſalvation to men, only, in the way of their compliance with goſpel terms, in this ſtate. He adds, "it is incredible that God ſhould conſtitute his Son the ſaviour of men, and the bulk of them be finally and eternally damned." But why is it more incredible than for God to appear in his glory as the redeemer of Iſrael out of Egypt, and yet the bulk of that people periſh afterwards in wrath, for their murmurings and rebellion? It is ſurely credible, "if God hath conſtituted faith in Chriſt the only way of life for ſinful man," that he ſhould put his ſanction of infallibility and immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability upon it: and it is an incredible contradiction to ſuppoſe final unbelievers will be ſaved out of "the only way of life." It is alſo ſaid to be a groſs reflection upon the Saviour, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they ſhould periſh, p. 322, 3, 4. This hath been anſwered in a note in the ſecond part: and the reader may find it obvia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Dr's anſwer to an objection of the like import. See his note, ſermons, p. 27, 28. Further, can it be any reflection on the Saviour that he doth not ſave thoſe who will not come unto him for life; and who cannot be ſaved conſiſtently with the goſpel conſtitution? ſurely it cannot. And this author maintains, p. 342, "that their abuſe of what is well deſigned and adapted for their good, cannot be conſtrued as an argument againſt the diſplay of God's grace towards them." And it is equally true, that their conſequent ſufferings for this abuſe, can reflect no diſhonour upon the grace of God, nor upon the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. But more effectually to relieve and remove this diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, let theſe few things be conſidered. When "the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtars ſang together, and the ſons of God ſhouted for joy," to celebrate the glories of creation, was there not good ground
<pb n="331" facs="unknown:019737_0350_0FACA77F2EB2AA88"/>
for it? and ſhall this celebration be reflected on as groundleſs, becauſe the devil and his angels fell, and will periſh eternally, in the fire of divine wrath, prepared for them? In no wiſe. God's redemption of Iſrael out of Egypt, is a work much cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated in ſcripture: Did they ſing God's praiſes for it, at the red ſea, without grounds? Doth his cutting off the bulk of the nation in wrath, for their after unbelief and diſobedience, reflect diſhonour upon his character as their redeemer, and upon the glory of this work? By no means. No more doth the future puniſhment of the wicked. Again, did God conſtitute his Son a Saviour, to ſave men in their ſins, and without their believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on him and coming to him for life? or did Chriſt undertake to ſave men out of the goſpel conſtitution and way of life? If not, the final perdition of the unbelieving and diſobedient can reflect no diſhonour upon the character of God and the Saviour. Moreover, we have rational, firm ground to hope from ſcripture prophecies, that in the millennium ſtate, by the ingathering of jews and gentiles of all nations for ſo many generations, and ſo long a period, that a very great, if not the greater part of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, will finally be ſaved. But whether the greater part or not—we are poſitively taught in the 7th chapter of Revelations, it will be "an innumerable multitude out of all nations, which no man can number." And the ſalvation of ſuch a numberleſs multitude, will ſurely illuſtrate the ſcheme of redemption, as worthy of God and his Son. Beſides, thoſe that periſh, tho' loſt in themſelves, are not loſt to the divine government: for, in their ſufferings they will miniſter to the ſupport of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and government of God: and may ſerve an important purpoſe of everlaſting inſtruction, to the grand moral ſyſtem of the creation; and in that way, promote the great good of it. And further, the few comparatively, that are ſaved in the ages foregoing the millennium; may ſerve to illuſtrate, with pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar luſtre, the ſovereignty, riches, glory and efficacy of the grace of God, with the all-ſufficiency of the Saviour, in ſaving them, in the midſt of ſuch a world of corruption, ſnares and dangers, by which multitudes periſh. This may be tho't a ſufficient vindication. But there is another way to anſwer and remove the difficulty. If the conſtitution and adminiſtration of the divine government be abſolutely perfect: particularly, if
<pb n="332" facs="unknown:019737_0351_0FACA77FE1D934F8"/>
God hath formed an inſtitution and opened a diſpenſation, in his infinite wiſdom and grace, well fitted to ſave a periſhing world, and worthy of all acceptation: and it is in fact conducted with infinite wiſdom and propriety, in all ages &amp; diſpenſations; and all that comply with the terms of life and become his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient ſervants, ſhall receive ſalvation, with eternal glory: and the puniſhment of the rebellious, ſhall ſerve important purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in the divine government: ſo that in the ſettlement of his kingdom in the great day, glory will redound to God in the higheſt: which facts, no believer in revelation can deny; then the character of God, of the Saviour, and of the divine govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is fully vindicated and exalted in honour; be the ſaved and loſt in the proportion of it, as it may. It depends not upon this laſt circumſtance, but a higher view of the ſubject, viz. the nature and ends of divine government ſubſerved; and as being accordingly contrived and conducted, with abſolute perfection. Will any avow, that the wiſe legiſlators and adminiſtrators of a wiſe, righteous and good government among men; are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable for all the rebellion, miſchiefs and ſubſequent puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and miſery of diſobedient ſubjects under it? Shall the diſhonour be reflected on the wiſe managers, and not on the criminals? no one will affirm it. The foundation of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation then, is ſand. Or, will any affirm, that criminal ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, may not, conſiſtently with the higheſt wiſdom and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence, be puniſhed adequate to the demerit of their crimes? if they do, the foundation of all government of God and man is overthrown: and if this cannot be maintained, this declama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath no rational foundation, to ſtand upon.</p>
                  <p>Let not the wicked dare to encourage themſelves from their numbers, that it will avail to open another diſpenſation of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, in the future world. Solomon hath precluded ſuch a vain hope: "Though hand join in hand (be their confederacy in wickedneſs ever ſo ſtrong, and their numbers ever ſo great) the wicked ſhall not go unpuniſhed." The righteous God, who hath declared it, is able, is reſolved, and will put them down in final puniſhment. He hath exemplified it again and again in retributions, already put in execution. Did the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, "legions" of angels that fell, open a new trial, to them? Did the numbers of ſinners in the old world, and in
<pb n="333" facs="unknown:019737_0352_0FACA780A23CD0F8"/>
Sodom, open a new diſpenſation of mercy and further trial to them? by no means. And an unbeliever in the threatnings of Noah, againſt the old world; and of thoſe by the angels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Sodom, might have argued as ſhrewdly, and in ſome reſpects more forcibly, againſt their execution: he might have argued, it is incredible, the infinitely benevolent and good God ſhould deſtroy a whole world of his children, rational finite creatures, acting upon finite principles; and ſave but a handful in the family of Noah: and when it doth not appear they were all incurably wicked, and might not be recovered by ſome means within the compaſs of infinite wiſdom, power and mercy. So in the other inſtance, that he ſhould conſume ſuch famous cities and plains, with ſuch numerous inhabitants; and ſave ſo few in Lot's family only, may be ſaid to be incredible. And in both inſtances it might be further urged, they were in fact in a ſtate of diſcipline, and under a diſpenſation of mercy, and the time of general retribution not yet come; and therefore it exceeded belief. But ſuch abſurd reaſonings againſt the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the God of truth, and the wiſe maxims and ends of his government, which are above us and render the execution ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, are vanity. And in truth, their numbers and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous ſecurity in wickedneſs, was ſo far from ſcreening them, that it haſtened their righteous deſtruction; by rendering it the more neceſſary, for the vindication and ſupport of the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, authority and government of God, to ſet them forth as an everlaſting example, of inſtruction and warning. Now, if the greater part of mankind be not finally ſaved, which many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve will be the effect of the great in gathering in the millen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium ſtate; it is paſt doubt, a far greater proportion of mankind will be ſaved final iſſue, than were found in the above inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: and yet the argument there from numbers, we ſee avails nothing: no more can it in the inſtance pleaded for.— The ſubject ſeems to be taken up, upon too ſhallow grounds, to have force in it. And it is beyond me to conceive any wiſe purpoſe to be anſwered, by ſuch an arreignment of the divine character and government to the bar of our feeble reaſon, and condemning it upon ſuch ſlender grounds and partial views of it: and in truth, appears to have more evil in it, than I chuſe to expreſs. "The wiſdom of this world, is fooliſhneſs with
<pb n="334" facs="unknown:019737_0353_0FACA781634E5C50"/>
God." In fine, it is plead, "the proper cauſe and tendency of evils and ſufferings in the preſent ſtate, is to do men good in a natural or moral ſenſe, or both: and therefore it is rational to ſuppoſe it to be the object of the future ſufferings of the wicked." This is argued from the character of God "as the Father of Mercies," and from this, "a change of the mode and manner of wicked men's exiſtence" doth not infer a change in the nature of God, "who is the ſame yeſterday, to-day and forever." And 'tis the language of mankind, and of all ages, and of the ſcripture, to ſpeak of God as the univerſal Father as well as Governour of men. Whence, it is inferred, he will be a Father to the wicked in the future world, and puniſh them, to do them good. And it is ſaid, no good reaſon can be aſſigned why it ſhould not be ſo, p. 325, 6, 7, 8. The force of this arguing hath been already obviated, in the firſt part, and in the ſecond where this doctrine of diſcipline is confuted. And it may be further remarked, that this ſtating is partly true and partly falſe, that is, ſome of the ſufferings of men in this ſtate, are for their good, but others are not ſo; and the concluſion will not follow:— for (1.) it is not true in fact, in diſpenſations of retribution in this world, that the good of the ſufferers is the object, but the contrary. And theſe are the only inſtances wherein, from the parity of the caſes, there can be force in the argument. The inhabitants of the old world were not drowned for their good: nor were the inhabitants of Sodom conſumed by fire from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, for their good: nor were the unbelieving Iſraelites con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed in wrath, and excluded the reſt in Canaan, by the oath of God, for their good. And theſe examples are purpoſely ſet forth to teach us, that the ſufferings of the wicked in the future ſtate, will not be for their good; but for the ſupport of the divine authority and government, and for the good of others. So that theſe examples are in point, and do in fact, ſubvert the ground and take away the force of all theſe reaſonings. I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve (2dly.) it is not merely a change of the mode and manner of wicked men's exiſtence in that ſtate, that is the ſubject in diſpute; but they are changed into an eſſentially different ſtate, under an eſſentially different conſtitution, and to anſwer a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent intention in the government of God, in that world, from what is their ſtate in this. This is a ſtate of probation and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,
<pb n="335" facs="unknown:019737_0354_0FACA78222B25300"/>
wiſely adapted for their good; that of retribution. And we know that diſcipline is abſolutely at an end, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that retribution and capital puniſhment takes place. It is ſo in this world, and muſt be ſo in the future. The nature of the ſubject teaches it: Why ſhould it be confounded? there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, there is no arguing in their manner, from the one ſtate to the other. They may as well argue, that in the next ſtate, the righteous and wicked will live promiſcuouſly together, and in a mixed ſtate of good and evil to both; and will live in families, &amp;c. as they do, and becauſe they do ſo, in this; as to argue on that ground, the ſufferings of the wicked will be for their good. For the ſcripture is not more poſitive, that by the conſtitution of that world, the righteous ſhall be ſeparated from all evil, to all good; and the wicked ſhall be ſeparated from all good, to all evil; nor our Saviour more expreſs, that after the reſurrection there is no marrying and giving in marriage; than the inſpired teachers are "that there is no more ſacrifice for ſin to the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed," and "the death of Chriſt ſhall profit them nothing," "and that they have not any inheritance in the kingdom of God," and therefore, that their future ſufferings cannot be for their good and ſalvation, as they may be in this world.</p>
                  <p>It is very true, that the nature of God is not changed, by this change of ſtate to the wicked; but it is as true, that he will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct towards them according to the nature and purſuant to the intention of a ſtate of retribution; and therefore not in the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a father, but of a righteous revenger of their diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. And becauſe he is a God that changeth not, he will be the ſame in execution, that he is in threatning. And when he executes their threatned puniſhment, they ſhall have "judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without mercy, and wrath without mixture." And it is his immutability, with their conſignment to a ſtate of retributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by the force of an unchangeable conſtitution and ſentence, that ſeals their deſtruction, as unalterable and everlaſting. I might add, paternal diſcipline and government, certainly is not an adequate inſtitution and means for the governments, ſtates and kingdoms of this world: and why ſhould it be thought ſo for the infinitely more important kingdom of God? It certainly is not. And this is demonſtrated to be fact, by the many and terrible retributions of providence in this, as well as the future
<pb n="336" facs="unknown:019737_0355_0FACA782E1768740"/>
world: many inſtances of it that are executed by men; and many, and thoſe the moſt terrible, executed by the more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate hand of God. Beſides, paternal diſcipline extended to the future world, is directly contrary to the ſcripture exhibition of the moral character of God, as righteous governor and judge: and of his moral government, by wiſe laws and conſtitutions, inforced with the higheſt ſanctions and penalties; and to be ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled in a final ſtate of retribution, in connexion with the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely wiſe, holy and good ends of it, taught us. It degrades and ſinks the immenſe Majeſty of God, the infinity of his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, the evil of ſin, the neceſſity and importance of goſpel duty and obedience, with the dignity and glory of his everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kingdom, infinitely below the ſcripture exhibition of this grand ſubject. I might further notice, it is repeatedly ſuggeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as a ſtrange thing, that the common conſtruction of theſe words and the common doctrine ſhould have been ſo generally received in the chriſtian world, and by the learned as well as others; when as Mr. Whiſton tells us, by ſearching to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom it is found to have no foundation in revelation; and bears ſo hard upon the character of God, as infinitely good. They aſcribe it to education, to prejudicate notions, &amp;c. but this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not account for the reception of it in the ages of inſpiration, by the jewiſh and chriſtian church; it muſt come from heaven to them; they were taught it by God. As wiſe, learned, pious and penetrating men as the chriſtian world can boaſt, have been in the common ſentiment: they ſaw the uſe of theſe words ſometimes in the limited, as well as endleſs ſenſe; and were as much concerned to know the truth, as theſe writers can be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be. And it is irrational to ſuppoſe, that theſe greateſt and beſt of men, and the whole body of the chriſtian church, learned and unlearned (a few ſocinians &amp; univerſaliſts excepted) perhaps as much as ninety-nine of a hundred of all denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the ſeveral ages of chriſtianity, ſhould receive the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conſtruction and doctrine, upon prejudicate notions, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps what hath been offered, may ſhew us the ſolid grounds and convincing evidence upon which it hath been ſo generally received. It is manifeſtly the deſign of the inſpired teachers, to teach us the things of the future and inviſible world as "eternal," and to teach them as ſuch plainly, deciſively and
<pb n="337" facs="unknown:019737_0356_0FACA783A2FBB810"/>
practically; and it is principally by the uſe of theſe words they do this. And common ſenſe teaches us, that in this uſe of them, the never-ending ſenſe muſt be intended by them: for multiply limited ages and diſpenſations with what numbers you pleaſe, they are limited ſtill; and it is impoſſible that the idea of "endleſs and eternal" can be conveyed by them, but in the never-ending ſenſe. No ſooner therefore do we enter into the ſpirit and views of inſpired men, upon this grand ſubject, but we ſee the never-ending ſenſe affixed to their words: and this is alike plain to the unlearned as learned. Beſides, St. Paul has taught us the eſſentially different conſtitution of the two worlds, and given us a deciſive rule for affixing the never-dying ſenſe, to all things in the future inviſible world. "For the things that are ſeen are temporary; but the things that are unſeen are eternal." Inſpired men, have not notified us of any ſingle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, as they doubtleſs would have done, had there been any exemption and limitation to any of the things of that world. Yea more, they are ſo far from excepting the future puniſhment of the wicked, that all their deſcriptions of it, literal and figur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ative, by connexion and by contraſt, &amp;c. are uniformly and deciſively, without end, as before ſhewn. Add to all this, they have clearly and abundantly taught us the future general judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will be final; and the ſubſequent future ſtate of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous &amp; wicked, will be a ſtate of retribution. Theſe doctrines have appeared moſt indiſputably clear and certain, to the body of the chriſtian church, in the ſeveral ages of chriſtianity. And theſe fix the never-ending ſenſe of theſe words in the laſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and as applied to the future ſtate of the righteous and wicked, with eaſe, preciſion, and certainty. For it is ſelf-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, the final ſentence of the great Judge muſt be perpetual; and a final ſtate of retribution, from the nature of it, muſt be unalterable—the ſame from the firſt moment it commences, during the whole exiſtence of the ſubjects of it, or throughout their immortality. And wherever theſe moſt important doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines are taught in the ſimplicity and force, in which they are taught in revelation, they will perpetually inculcate and ſupport the common conſtruction and doctrine we contend for, in an inſeparable connexion, through all ages of the world. So that in reality there is no wonder in it, that the common conſtruction
<pb n="338" facs="unknown:019737_0357_0FACA7846275FDB0"/>
and doctrine hath been ſo very generally received by the chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian world, upon theſe and ſuch like plain ſcripture grounds. They could do no otherwiſe, conſiſtent with ſcripture, with reaſon, and with themſelves, in the other important articles of the chriſtian faith embraced by them. But the ſurprize is the other way, how learned men could overlook the moſt eſſential diſtinctions ſet forth in ſcripture; and the moſt important doctrines in their neceſſary connexions; and ſo bewilder them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and followers in a ſubject that ſtands plain and clear in revelation, in the manner in which it is moſt naturally to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up. Perhaps the judicious reader may judge, that Mr. Whiſton and his followers, have been ſo far from examining the foundation of the common notion to the bottom, as to have been inattentive to the moſt neceſſary diſtinctions to clear the ſubject; and ſo as to overlook the true ſcripture foundation on which the common doctrine doth ſecurely and firmly ſtand. And I can ſee no more ground to rely upon Mr. Whiſton's pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netration and diſcretion in this caſe, than in his taking into his creed and cannon of revelation, a number of meer human com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, which have been ſteadily rejected by the chriſtian world, catholic and proteſtant. Fanciful men will have their ſingularities, but it is ſad when they indulge to them in matters of moment, ſo as to be groſsly miſled by them.</p>
                  <p>I paſs to the laſt argument, to fix the meaning of theſe words, viz. the inſpired teachers and church of God inſtructed by them, underſtood the words in the ſame ſenſe as we do, and not in theirs; and could do no otherwiſe: for it is admitted in their own conceſſion, their doctrine of reſtitution was unknown to them. I truſt it hath been clearly already proved, that the Apoſtles and primitive chriſtians were in the common ſentiment with us in theſe great doctrines, and I take it to be admitted in the note, p. 253. This author adopts the words of Dr. Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, "poſſibly the writers of the old and new teſtament did not ſee the full meaning of the glorious declarations, which the holy Spirit has delivered to us by their means; juſt as Daniel, and the other prophets, were ignorant of the full and preciſe import of their prophecies, relating to Chriſt. Or perhaps they did, but thought it expedient, or were commanded, not to be more explicit. The chriſtian religion, in converting the various
<pb n="339" facs="unknown:019737_0358_0FACA7852125B7C0"/>
pagan nations of the world, was to be corrupted by them; and the ſuperſtitious fear of God, which is one of thoſe corruptions, may have been neceſſary hitherto on account of the reſt. But now the corruptions of the true religion begin to be diſcovered and removed, by the earneſt endeavours of good men of all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ſects, in theſe latter times, by their comparing "ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things with ſpiritual," He adds, "and as knowledge, in other reſpects, has been greatly increaſed, it may now be proper that more ſhould be underſtood with reference to the extenſive benevolence of God towards mankind, through Jeſus Chriſt, than was neceſſary in former ages: the ſupport of chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity may be connected herewith. Perhaps, the amiable light in which it is placed by the above repreſentation of it, is the moſt effectual antidote againſt infidelity."</p>
                  <p>By "the full meaning of the glorious declarations" I take to be intended their doctrine of the reſtoration and ſalvation of all men, which it is admitted might be unknown to the ſacred writers: if ſo, they could not underſtand the words in diſpute of a limited age or diſpenſation, but in the never-ending ſenſe. So that the evaſion given to the laſt ſentence, and to our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's words, Mark 9th, and other ſcriptures, hath no manner of foundation: for the inſpired teachers and writers knew no other "next ſtate" but that which is eternal. Nor could they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand "the miſtery hid from ages" in the ſenſe of theſe men: nor heaven and hell in the new earth, as this author doth. That heaven, which is the glorious reſidence of God, of the holy an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and the ſpirits of the juſt made perfect, into which Chriſt was received at his aſcention, and where he will reſide till the reſtitution of all things; where he hath directed us to lay up our treaſures, and where the hope, the incorruptible inheritance and crown of good men is laid up and reſerved for them, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly can neither be the aerial heavens which ſurround this earth—nor a heaven in an earth to be created, after the ſecond coming of Chriſt. And by the phraſe "forever and ever," in the revelations of St. John, he could not mean ages and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations of diſcipline, in the reſurrection world: nor could Paul have any reference to it in the 15th chapter to the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inthians; for this is all invention to ſupport the ſcheme of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal reſtoration of which, it is admitted the ſacred writers
<pb n="340" facs="unknown:019737_0359_0FACA785E7CCEF30"/>
were ignorant. And certainly, they muſt underſtand the laſt judgment as final, and the doctrine of retribution in the ſame ſenſe, as it hath been commonly received in the chriſtian world: and this infallibly fixes the ſenſe of theſe words for this and the future world, as before ſhewn. In a word, this conceſſion e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very way confirms the common conſtruction and doctrine; and refutes theirs, as unſcriptural and deluſive, And were the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles now alive, with the ſame inſpired ſentiments and faith, which they embraced and taught, and with which they went down to the grave; could they, in any conſiſtency with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but reprobate this ſtrange doctrine, as groſsly erroneous and heretical? The argument as it ſtands with this conceſſion, forms a curious ſoleciſm in logic, and oddity in argumentation. The amount is this, the received conſtruction and doctrine of the chriſtian world upon this ſubject, is truly the meaning of the inſpired writers; but yet it is not the true ſenſe and meaning of the texts; for the ſacred writers themſelves miſtook, and did not ſee into the glory of their declarations; but theſe ſharpſighted, uninſpired men have penetrated beyond them, into the arcana of revelation, and have found out the miſtical meaning, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes neceſſary to be publiſhed in this enlightened age, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert infidels. The argument from prophecy ſeems a ſlimſy buſineſs, as there is not a parity in the caſes to ſupport the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. The prophecies of Chriſt were deſigned to be beſt and moſt clearly known in their accompliſhment. And there were inſpired men then, and living after Chriſt to point out their application to him and fulfilment in him, and aſcertain their meaning with infallibility. (Is this the caſe in this ſtrange doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine?) But the plan and true doctrine of ſalvation, was as neceſſary to be clearly underſtood and taught in that age, when chriſtianity was planting in the world, as it can be in this, or any future age. It was as requiſite then, as now, for the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men and the ſupport of chriſtianity, that it ſhould be taught with undiſguiſed ſimplicity and incorrupt integrity, and ſo that the internal contents of the doctrine, ſhould render it worthy of all acceptation: (and was certainly ſo taught by them), for there were "ſcribes, wiſe men and diſputers of this world" in that age as well as this, who had as "ſceptical a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity of examining the doctrines of the bible, and of chriſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity,
<pb n="341" facs="unknown:019737_0360_0FACA786A1772380"/>
in order to diſcover any flaws and impoſitions therein." ſo that if ever this exotick doctrine was neceſſary to be expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly taught, it was then; which it is conceded, it was not. And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>f all doctrine, this, which ſacrifices the doctrine of the croſs, and renders all chriſtianity unneceſſary in this world, to final ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, cannot ſupport chriſtianity, but abſurdly betrays and ſubverts it. This ſeems but a vain, ſham pretence, for undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly inſpired teachers were taught the beſt method to ſupport chriſtianity, and their hearts were fully engaged in it. And it is certain they taught the future puniſhment, "he that believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not ſhall be damned" in ſupport of chriſtianity: and it ſeems here conceded, that it was in the ſenſe commonly received, and "was neceſſary hitherto." Who then can have a warrant to contradict them, and condemn this puniſhment "as unjuſt both in the threatning and execution?" or, who hath any right to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>raign this inſpired meaſure to ſupport chriſtianity, of impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety and inefficacy, and to ſay that it is proper and needful "as a moſt effectual antidote againſt infidelity" to be added, that infidels dying in a ſtate of infidelity ſhall yet be ſaved? Hitherto, we have been taught, that the true art of criticiſing ſcripture, conſiſts in finding out and exhibiting the inſpired meaning of it, and ſenſe of the inſpired writers, with clearneſs and force: and when this is once effected, the chriſtian world were abſolutely concluded by it. But it ſeems we are now taught a new kind of criticiſm, in ſupport of this exotick doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, viz. it is to diſcard the plain, inſpired meaning, and find out a miſtical more glorious one, than the inſpired writers were taught or had any knowledge of. Is not this to make the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a precarious, uncertain rule? May not the worſt of errors and hereſies be fathered upon ſcripture, by deluded men, "as the moſt glorious ſenſe," without a poſſibility of detection and confutation? for the evaſion is eaſy, "the plain meaning of the inſpired writer "may be one thing intended, but it may not be the moſt glorious ſenſe," &amp;c. and if the ſenſe and meaning of the inſpired writers doth not conclude us, we are without rule and guide. Is not this new art of criticiſing or wreſting ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to a purpoſe undeſigned by the ſacred writers, in effect, teaching ſcepticiſm by rule? Can this be connected with the ſupport of chriſtianity? or is this "the moſt effectual antidote

againſt infidelity? Doth it not directly tend to ſubvert chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity and expoſe divine revelation to contempt? for certainly the God of truth, "all whoſe ways and works are perfect," could never give a revelation to men, the inſpired meaning of which, when found, ſhould be precarious, fallible and uncertain.</p>
                  <p>This note gives riſe to theſe additional queries:—Is it not abſurd to ſuppoſe the inſpired teachers and writers did not know the plan and doctrine of ſalvation in the true and moſt import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant ſenſe of it; which they were authoriſed, and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily furniſhed to teach the world? Doth not the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition carry a reflection of diſhonour upon them, and him that ſent them? Is it not an impious preſumption and reflection of diſhonour, to ſuppoſe, the fear of God taught and encouraged by our Saviour and his apoſtles, was a ſuperſtitious, (i.e.) a groundleſs fear? If they have not taught us the true fear of God, by whom or when ſhall it be ever taught us? Is not ſuch a ſuggeſtion an indirect attack upon the ſpirit of inſpiration, and upon their characters as diſhoneſt; "doing evil that good may come of it," and too much to countenance the deiſtical, ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs cry of prieſtcraft? Is it not an abſurd preſumption to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, uninſpired men in this day know the ſcripture plan and doctrine of ſalvation, better than thoſe who were taught it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately by the inſpiration of God; and better how to time the publication of it to the world, than the inſpired writers? Are they wiſer in the great things of the kingdom of God, than Moſes, Samuel, Solomon and all the prophets; with our Saviour and all the apoſtles? Are they warranted on the ground of this ſuppoſed extraordinary penetration and inſight into the arcana of revelation, to throw out this exotick doctrine in an age ſo degenerate, unprincipled and ſceptical? Will any judicious chriſtian give credit to ſuch unſcriptural, enormous claims? Is it not an audacious attempt in ſuch "Reformers" to undertake to correct and reform the faith of the inſpired writers, and their meaſures and motives to ſupport chriſtianity; and to give us "more effectual" ones? Again, is it not admitted in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, at leaſt implicitly, that we are embracing and defending (in the commonly received conſtruction and doctrine) the true chriſtian and apoſtolical doctrine and "faith once delivered to the ſaints" which we are commanded "earneſtly to contend
<pb n="343" facs="unknown:019737_0362_0FACA788230A6DB0"/>
for;" and that our opponents are oppoſing and ſubverting of it with all the ingenuity, art and force they can? conſequently, are they not ſelf-condemned in fathering their doctrine upon the inſpired teachers and writers, when it is conceded it was unknown and undeſigned by them; and in fact, they taught the contrary doctrine? And can they, conſiſtently with this conceſſion, either teach, write or defend their doctrine, without being ſelf-condemned? In a word, this note carries in it an antidote againſt the reception of their doctrine; as being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the inſpired teachers and writers—certainly beſide their intention—and when they in fact intended and taught the contrary doctrine, which was neceſſary hitherto:" and if neceſſary hitherto, it will remain neceſſary through all ages of the world. The conceſſion in this note, doth by neceſſary conſequence, every way confirm, the commonly received con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and doctrine we contend for, as the faith of the inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red writers, which "they once delivered to the ſaints, which they commanded us to keep, hold faſt, defend and earneſtly contend for; and which will be confirmed in the great day, when all contrary error and wickedneſs will be condemned. Should any therefore, after this notification, caveat and warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given by our opponents themſelves, embrace and hold faſt their unſcriptural doctrine; will they not ſin with their eyes open, and be altogether blameable and inexcuſable in it? If any ſhould think there is any thing hard bearing in theſe queries and deductions—to adopt the language of this author on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occaſion—I truſt he will acquit me of all blame, on this head—for if there be any juſt reaſon for blame, he muſt blame the authors of this note; for I only exhibit the true contents, and genuine deductions and conſequences of it: <note n="†" place="bottom">It may not be amiſs to notice, according to the true ſpirit of this note, Mr. Whiſton's injudicious cant, upon the topically orthodox, falls with equal force upon the inſpired teachers and writers. And it ſeems this author's charge upon the proteſtant world in general (on the ground of their reception of this doctrine of the future puniſhment, and ſome others in connexion with it) as receiving for ſacred truths groſs abſurdities, and palpably wrong and diſhonourable ideas of God; falls alike heavy upon the inſpired writers themſelves. If ſo, doth not this evince the faith of theſe gentlemen in the matter in diſpute to be widely different from that of the inſpired teachers? And it ſeems ſtrange they were not ſelf-convinced of it. For, it is obvious, our Saviour and his apoſtles had no more difficulty of preaching this doctrine of the future puniſhment, with freedom, bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and pathos, than thoſe he ſtiles topically orthodox: and yet this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical ſcheme was unknown to them; and theſe ſubterfuges and double in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders now thrown out, are inventions which are many centuries too late, to qualify or have any influence upon the preaching of inſpired men.— Whence then, the great difficulty of theſe men about it, but from miſtaken apprehenſions, or an actual abberration from the true ſcripture faith? and whence doth this ariſe, but from prejudicate notions, falſe maxims, reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and "vain deceit?" if men, from a prejudicate notion, that this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine is hardly reconcilable with divine benevolence or is unjuſt, will ſet themſelves to turn and twiſt ſcripture texts every way, to ſet aſide the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine; inſtead of looking into the true foundation on which it is aſcertained in ſcripture, and into the rationale of it, whereby it may ſtand approved to the reaſon of man; error is unavoidable.—Upon peruſing this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous note, I was at no loſs where I ſhould find our opponents. When the obvious meaning of the ſacred writers is ſet aſide, in queſt of the ignis fatuus of a more glorious meaning; which, in fact ſubverts it, they neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily err: juſt as a man that leaves a right path, neceſſarily takes a wrong one; and the further he goes, the greater the error.</note> which I am

clear comprizes and amounts to thus much, if any thing at all.</p>
                  <p>The argument againſt univerſal ſalvation from the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment denounced againſt Judas, ſtands in full force, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the evaſions here offered, to invalidate it. It is ſaid to be ſufficient to abſolve the meaning of thoſe words "good were it for that man if he had never been born," into an aggravated puniſhment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without going into a more particular interpretation of them, p. 328, 29. But they are too ſtrong, pointed, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatical, to admit of ſuch a ſolution. At this rate, the moſt deſcriptive and pointed threatnings of God may be eluded, ſo as never to be literally executed. As well might it be ſaid, the unbelieving Iſraelites might enter into Canaan, notwithſtanding God ſwore they ſhould never enter into his reſt. For altho' the puniſhment be ſo deſcriptively ſpecified, it may be ſufficient to abſolve the meaning of the oath into a heavy puniſhment. Can ſuch a conſtruction be warranted and honourable to the God of truth? But the chief evaſion is this, the words may be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as "a prophecy" foretelling that Judas ſhould practically declare, "by hanging himſelf," that to him, in his apprehenſion, it were good he had not been born, had not been brought into being," p. 330, 31. This invented conſtruction, labours of two difficulties; one is, it hath no countenance in ſcripture; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it ſtands actually confuted by our Saviour and the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
<pb n="345" facs="unknown:019737_0364_0FACA789A1C7EB30"/>
Peter. The puniſhment denounced in thoſe awful words, is not <hi>ſuicide,</hi> but one that Judas ſhould ſuffer, in the future world. For after his deceaſe, our Saviour ſpeaks of him as "the ſon of perdition that was loſt," "loſt" to ſalvation and hope," as underſtood in that age, John 17.12. And St. Peter, after the account of his hanging himſelf, ſpeaks of him as gone to his own place, no doubt to ſuffer the puniſhment intended by our Saviour in this awful ſentence upon him, Acts 1.18, 25.</p>
                  <p>This writer labours hard to make out "the unpardonable ſin" is pardonable, and that thoſe who are guilty of it, may be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned and ſaved. This is a hard taſk, to falſify the teſtimony of the faithful and true witneſs, and reconcile palpable contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions. Few men would be hardy enough to attempt it, and if it can be done, we expect to ſee it effected by thoſe who know the glorious meaning of ſcripture texts, better than the whole chriſtian world, and even the ſacred writers themſelves. Our Lord hath declared in the moſt peremptory and abſolute terms, that "blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt ſhall not be forgiven," "hath never forgiveneſs," "ſhall not be forgiven unto men;" and again, "it ſhall not be forgiven him neither in this world, neither in the world to come." Did not our Lord, by theſe ſtrong, abſolute, peremptory declarations, deſign to put it out of doubt, that ſuch ſinners ſhould never be pardoned and ſaved? Certainly. And a chriſtian may I think, as conſiſtently attempt to evade and falſify the truth of the ſun's ſhining, when it ſhines full in his face, as to falſify theſe declarations of Chriſt, and maintain that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>heſe very ſinners may yet be pardoned and ſaved. There is no art, quibbling, evaſion of ſubterfuge whatever, that can elude and falſify this plain, ſtrong teſtimony of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour "that ſuch ſinners ſhall never be pardoned and ſaved." And this, if I miſtake not, appears in the conceſſions of this writer. He concedes, they cannot be pardoned in this world and eſcape hell, but muſt undergo the torment of the future world. But it is clear, our Saviour's meaning is not to be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited to a pardon in this world; it extends equally to the future world: elſe, why doth he expreſsly ſo extend it, and ſay, "it ſhall not be forgiven him neither in this world, nor the world to come?" If ever they can be pardoned and ſaved in the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture world, it falſifies the declaration of Chriſt as truly, as tho'
<pb n="346" facs="unknown:019737_0365_0FACA78A62A8D168"/>
they received an intervening pardon, in this world. Beſides, by goſpel conſtitution there is no forgiveneſs and ſalvation to any that go to that place of torment, and by theſe ſtrong ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions our Saviour deſigned at once to cut off all hope of it, to theſe blaſphemers. The ſcriptures teach us plainly the way to heaven, and in it we eſcape hell: but where do they teach us, that the way to it is through hell; and that theſe blaſphem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers or any others, ſhall paſs through the torments of it, into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? it is as contrary to the tenor of revelation, as any doctrine that can be named. Again, it is conceded, that theſe blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers are "excluded from the goſpel privilege of forgiveneſs," and that "they have no hope from the goſpel promiſe of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, becauſe they are excepted perſons," p. 335, 6. If ſo, by goſpel conſtitution they can never inherit heaven; for this inheritance is given, and limited to thoſe, who have "goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel forgiveneſs," and by "goſpel promiſe." And if this conſtitution be the only way of life for ſinful man," infallibly theſe "excepted perſons" can never be ſaved. To ſay, they may yet be ſaved without goſpel forgiveneſs and promiſe, what is it better than infidelity? And is it not a contradiction to ſay this ſcheme of ſaving men without goſpel forgiveneſs and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, is proved by the goſpel, to be the goſpel plan of mercy? they ſeem to be groſsly bewildered and entangled by their own ſubtlety and ſophiſtry.</p>
                  <p>It is further conceded, "that this mode of ſpeech was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbial in our Saviour's day: and that when it is ſaid, "a thing ſhall not be, neither in this world, neither in the world to come," it was the ſame thing with ſaying, "it ſhall never be," p. 338. The ground and force of this proverb with the jews, ſeems to be this: they believed in but two worlds, this, and a future one which is "eternal," in which mankind are concerned: and therefore they could not more forcibly expreſs it, "that a thing ſhould never be, no, not to eternity; than, in this phraſe, "it ſhall not be, neither in this world, nor in the world to come." And doubtleſs our Saviour intended it in this very ſenſe, in this application of it. And ſo the inſpired writers underſtood it; for they knew nothing of this doctrine of their ſuppoſed reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. And to ſuppoſe, theſe very ſinners were intruſted to our Saviour to be pardoned and ſaved; and that he knew and
<pb n="347" facs="unknown:019737_0366_0FACA78B21C62228"/>
intended they ſhould all be finally pardoned and ſaved; it ſeems he could not have applied this proverbial ſaying to them, but in the way of direct impoſition; which is a blaſphemy every chriſtian muſt reject with horror. We are neceſſitated therefore, to take theſe ſolemn declarations of Chriſt in the common, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, popular ſenſe; and they will remain a perpetual and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable confutation of the doctrine of univerſal ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>Several things are offered, to ſet aſide the argument againſt this impleaded doctrine "from the pernicious bad tendency of it;" ſome of which we ſhall briefly notice. It is ſaid, "it muſt be plainly ſhown, that theſe doctrines do naturally and directly tend to encourage men in vicious practice," p. 341. Agreed, And this I conceive, hath been clearly and ſufficiently ſhewn, in a variety of ways, in the foregoing pages. It is ſo obvious at firſt view, that a man needs no ſmall practice upon himſelf, by falſe reaſonings, to overcome and ſtiffle the conviction and ſenſibility of it. It is ſo obvious, that ſome of his notable wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, as Origen, Dr. Burnet, &amp;c. had no ſmall conviction and ſenſibility of it. And it is a wonder, they had not purſued their inquiries into the nature and tendency of it, until they were fully convinced it was a doctrine of ungodlineſs, and could not be of God. The ſuggeſtion, that this doctrine hath not a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural bad tendency, is as unphiloſophical, as it is unſcriptural and contrary to the evidence of fact. For ſuch is the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of human nature in this ſtate, that the uſe of threatning and fear was a requiſite ſafeguard to man in innocency. And in this degenerate ſtate, wherein the paſſions of men are ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate and exorbitant, it is abſolutely neceſſary, for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of mankind. Thence it is ſelf-evident, the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening the motive of fear, by taking out the ſting and terror of the threatning, and by adding the encouragement of life, to the refractory and diſobedient, hath both ways, a natural and moſt pernicious tendency to promote vicious practice. And it was a well grounded fear ariſing hence, founded in the nature of things (and not a ſuperſtitious one) that made Origen, Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net and others who were deluded into the doctrine, afraid to open it to the world, on account of the pernicious conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of it. And it is a plain fact, that the ſupplanting the belief of the threatning, accompanied with an encouragement of life
<pb n="348" facs="unknown:019737_0367_0FACA78BE2F01398"/>
to the diſobedient, ſeduced our firſt parents into rebellion: and a preſumptuous hope of future peace encourages and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens men in ſin, and is many ways of moſt pernicious conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, as already ſhewn. I conceive, the bad tendency of the doctrine every way, hath been abundantly proved; and the argument is forcible and concluſive. It is alſo argued, the common doctrine is not ſo likely to reſtrain men from ſin, as this impleaded doctrine.<note n="‖" place="bottom">P. 352, 3.</note> Why not? If believed and realiſed, in its importance, it muſt have the greateſt influence; for the weight of the motive in the common view, exceeds the other, as eternity doth time. And unleſs motives are realized, they cannot have influence, on any ſcheme. And this is the true reaſon, why the great goſpel motives of life and death both, have no more influence upon many who aſſent to them as the truths of God; becauſe they do not realize them, in their infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite importance. It is ſaid, "the natural notions they enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the goodneſs and mercy of God, riſe up in oppoſition to it, and ſtrongly operate to obſtruct its influence." If by "natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral" be meant "juſt and true ſentiments of the goodneſs and mercy of God," it muſt be miſtake; for theſe are regulated by ſcripture: and it is certain, that ſcriptural apprehenſions of the mercy of God, cannot riſe up in oppoſition, and obſtruct the influence of the divine threatnings. It muſt then be falſe and preſumptuous notions of the divine mercy, unſupported by any ſcripture promiſe, and ſupplanted by many divine threatnings, that hath this obſtructing influence. And whether the drawing the moſt awful ſcripture threatnings into diſpute, and denying them, in the moſt plain and obvious ſenſe of them, doth not tend to confirm and harden men in theſe preſumptuous notions, and thereby to obſtruct the ſalutary influence of the threatnings of God, may not be unworthy the attention of our opponents. —It is likewiſe ſaid, upon their ſcheme "there is nothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible in the torments of another world." To me it appears the very reverſe. This ſcheme of diſcipline, purgatory, new-created worlds, tranſmutation ſtates, means of ſalvation more effectual than the goſpel, &amp;c. &amp;c. appears wholly antiſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and pregnant with the groſſeſt of abſurdities: and this I truſt hath been fully evinced. What are the objected difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to the common ſcheme, compared with the numerous pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable,
<pb n="349" facs="unknown:019737_0368_0FACA78CA14E5248"/>
horrible abſurdities of this? they are light as a feather. What if we, ſhort-ſighted creatures, cannot ſee how this pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment is conſiſtent with the mercy and juſtice of God? It is certain no man can prove it inconſiſtent with the one or the other, notwithſtanding the confident declamation of Mr. Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton and ſome others. And what mighty difficulty is there in acknowledging "God is incomprehenſible in his ways and works?" Are there not a thouſand difficulties that we cannot ſee through in the kingdom of nature and providence and in revelation, where the evidence of truth and facts arreſts and commands our belief? What if we cannot ſee and exhibit the rationale of this doctrine to ſatisfaction, perhaps others can? And what if no man either hath or can do it? yet, as God is incomprehenſible, and his ways and thoughts not as ours, but infinitely above them: and as we know by reaſon and revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion all the affairs of his everlaſting kingdom will be adjuſted in abſolute wiſdom and perfection, with the concurring har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of all his perfections: ſince, he hath deciſively revealed this doctrine of the future puniſhment, his authority ought ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely to command and conclude our belief. And unleſs it doth ſo conclude us in the articles of the chriſtian faith, what claim have we to be chriſtians and proteſtants? It is added, "the future torments, conſidered in the light of this impleaded ſcheme, are more ſuitably adapted, in the nature of the thing, to work upon rational and intelligent agents, than in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon point of view," p. 357. I ſhould be ſorry if it was true in fact, that motives ſuggeſted by uninſpired men, ſhould be better adapted "in the nature of the thing" to excite ſinners to faith and repentance, than thoſe taught us by inſpired men of God: becauſe it tends directly to bring divine revelation and the doctrine of inſpiration into contempt. And to father this doctrine upon the inſpired writers, when it is conceded they were ignorant of it, affords no relief in the caſe, but makes bad worſe: whence ariſes a violent preſumption, previous to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular examination, that this is of a piece with the reſt of the ſcheme, "but vain deceit." It is ſaid, "the end propoſed by them perfectly coincides with benevolence; for they are the chaſtiſements of a father, as well as judge, and principally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for the reformation, and conſequent good, of the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders

themſelves, and when they are taught thus to think; and that theſe corrections ſhall be heavy in proportion to their ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornneſs in ſin, and continued till they are humbled and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued; and that they ſhall have no mercy till this end is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed:" upon which it is aſked, "What can be wanting, in a motive thus circumſtanced, to operate in a moral way upon reaſonable minds? it ſhould ſeem to be as well calculated to the purpoſe, as it poſſibly can be."<note n="†" place="bottom">P. 357.</note> One remark, before we return a more direct anſwer to this queſtion. The remark is this, the true and full force of this motive is, upon the common ſcheme, uſed with ſinners in this world. They are warned of this place of torment, and warned of it by their Father and compaſſionate Redeemer, and it is for their repentance and conſequent good: and they are taught, this puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will be in proportion to their deſert, and that they cannot eſcape it and have mercy, till they are humbled and ſubdued; and the end propoſed, perfectly coincides with benevolence: and yet this "beſt calculated motive poſſible," proves ineffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual to thouſands and millions. What is the conſequence, but deſtruction to their ſcheme? two ways: one is, it fully confutes their doctrine of more effectual future means: for if the beſt calculated poſſible motives, to operate upon them in a rational moral way, be uſed with them in this world, it is a contradiction to ſay, better and more effectual ones will be uſed with them in the future. The other way is, the force of diſcipline is tried upon them in vain, in this world; and therefore their reſtoration in a future one is a hopeleſs, deſperate affair. For if they are to be recovered in a rational, moral way, and the beſt calculated motives to operate this way, poſſible in the nature of things, have ſpent their force on them in vain; their recovery by any means and motives whatever becomes abſolutely hopeleſs. So that their new created, reſurrection world, ages of ages of diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, tranſmutation ſtates, and more effectual means for the reſtoration of the wicked, turn out again, it ſeems, upon their own ſcheme, to be but invented fancies, and deceitful deluſions. Men are eaſily enſnared and confounded in their own devices and works, when they attempt to correct the faith of inſpired writers, and new model the doctrine of the goſpel as they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine to greater conſiſtency and force. "The fooliſhneſs of

                     </gap> upon their ſcheme? I ſhould ſay, it wants every thing, for it wants credibility and a foundation; and hath none in ſcripture or reaſon. It wants three things of moment, to name no more. (1.) It wants the authority of God to enforce it upon the heart and conſcience. He hath never taught us, the wicked ſhall be damned for their good: it is moſt contrary to the tenor of ſcripture, and abſurd to the reaſon of man. It wants, (2dly.) and cannot bring with it, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent heart-felt neceſſity to turn and live, which is requiſite to ſpring the effectual exertions of habituated ſinners; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, they will never be exerted. The neceſſity I mean, ariſes from this double conjoint view of their caſe, viz. they have no other alternative of choice before them, but life or death, everlaſting life or damnation; infallibly following their choice and exertions of good or evil: and that they have no other chance of opportunity, of this choice, but the preſent life. To impreſs the conviction and ſenſibility of this abſolute neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of a preſent turning for life, this only alternative of choice of life or death, in this only ſeaſon of opportunity, are abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly taught and urged by the inſpired teachers and writers; and with a view to excite and ſtimulate preſent choice and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual exertions. Here the queſtion comes with an irreſiſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble force of conviction, what complex motive can poſſibly be better adapted or more forcible to the purpoſe? for the higheſt, ſtrongeſt motives in nature, and eternity, are conjoined with this ſhort, uncertain, only ſeaſon of opportunity;<note n="‖" place="bottom">The attentive reader will obſerve, this writer labours the point, page 344, 5, 6, to prove, that although the diſcouragement to ſin, and motives were much greater upon the common ſcheme, than his; yet, the argument would not be forcible—but in the two laſt inſtances, the motives being more ſuitably adapted, and even "in the nature of the thing" to operate with greater force, is uſed as an argument to ſupport and recommend his ſcheme. Conſequently the foregoing arguings, are in effect given up and ſet aſide, as impertinent—and the argument from the weight of motives, is in full force, for the ſupport of the common faith. For, if it be of no force, why doth he labour ſo much for the advantage of it, in ſupport of his own ſcheme?</note> to enforce a preſent choice of life, and effectual exertions to attain it. The texts that addreſs to us this motive, this only alternative, to impreſs this abſolute neceſſity of a preſent turning for life, with <pb n="352" facs="unknown:019737_0371_0FACA78EF25861C8"/>
the choice and effectual exertions connected with it, are by far too numerous to be referred to. We have this only alternative of choice, in the addreſs of Moſes, "I have ſet life and death before you, chooſe life that ye may live:" and again, "it is not a vain thing to ſerve the Lord, it is your life." And repeatedly in the prophets, "turn and live," "turn ye, turn ye, why will you die?" And in the goſpel commiſſion, the miniſters of Chriſt muſt addreſs this only alternative, to enforce the reception of the goſpel. "He that believeth ſhall be ſaved, he that believeth not ſhall be damned." "He that believeth hath everlaſting life, but he that believeth not ſhall not ſee life." "Except ye repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh," &amp;c. And the only ſeaſon of opportunity in this life, is plainly and forcibly taught, in divers parables of our Saviour, in the argument of Solomon, "Whatever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might, for there is no work, device or knowledge in the grave whether thou goeſt." And in the words of Chriſt, "the night cometh, wherein no man can work."—In the addreſs of the apoſtle, "Behold now is the accepted time, now is the day of ſalvation." "While it is ſaid, "to day, if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, &amp;c. And it is inforced by the terrible, remedilous fate of the diſobedient in the days of Noah—of ſinners in So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom —of the unbelieving Iſraelites, and of Eſau, who having ſinned away his bleſſing and only opportunity, "found no place for repentance," and could never regain the bleſſing, "though he ſaught it carefully with tears," Heb. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.16, 17. And this only alternative of choice, is no where inculcated with greater force, than by our Saviour in the diſputed paſſage in Mark 9th, to impreſs the abſolute neceſſity of a preſent cutting off darling luſts—this muſt be done in this life, or their fate is inevitable, —What is it? they cannot enter into the kingdom of God, but muſt "be caſt into hell, where the fire will never be quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and their worm ſhall never die." The turn they give to this text, to elude the doctrine and alternative taught in it, doth directly contradict, oppoſe, and defeat the force of the motive, as deſigned by our Saviour. Now, let the reader judge, is not the motive in this light, incomparably better adapted in nature and of ſtronger force, to arreſt the attention of ſinful men, and to ind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

eſcape hell and attain everlaſting life, than in their point of view? it would be an impoſition upon any reader, to ſuppoſe him ſo defective in underſtanding, and in mental and moral feelings, as to heſitate, in ſo plain a caſe. And in truth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the ſtrong bias there is in degenerate nature, to put off the work of repentance to a future ſeaſon, I ſee no ground of hope that ſinners accuſtomed to do evil "would ever be wrought up to effectual exertions by their motive, of perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating their opportunity in a ſtate of damnation, for ages of ages after the judgment, without any known period. There is the ſtrongeſt probability, the hope of future opportunity and a better ſeaſon, would perpetually elude, obſtruct and prevent effectual exertions even to eternity, were not the doctrine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe groſsly abſurd. And undoubtedly the motive in all its force in the common point of view, is highly neceſſary; or it would not have been ſo ſtrongly inculcated in ſcripture, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by our Saviour, and by him made the ſpecial duty of his miniſters to inculcate this moſt alarming alternative, in all ages of the world.</p>
                  <p>Their motive hath a third defect, full as great as the others, viz. it wants the great encouragement of the bleſſing and effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual grace of God to attend it, and render it effectual. By the bleſſing of God, his goſpel is the power of God to the ſalvation of men. And we have abundant encouragement, from the promiſe of Chriſt, the gracious deſign of the inſtitution itſelf, and the method of ſalvation plainly revealed in the goſpel, that where the doctrines of it are preached in their genuine purity and ſimplicity, and the motives of it in their true force; an effectual bleſſing will attend it, for the good and ſalvation of men. For the great bleſſing of ſalvation, comes by faith, and faith by the word of God, and the word of God by them that are ſent, Mark 16.16. and Rom. 10.14, 15, 17. But can any man rationally expect the bleſſing of God to attend this muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, perverted goſpel? where the main force of the promiſes and threatnings, and of the doctrine of retribution and of the laſt judgment are extracted and taken away, by ill-grounded, deadening criticiſms? where the ſpirit and force of the goſpel commiſſion, in the expreſs language of it, is eluded, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and puniſhments are cut ſhort from everlaſting, to an
<pb n="354" facs="unknown:019737_0373_0FACA790613BF710"/>
age or limited ages in the laſt ſentence? Will God ſet his holy ſeal and give his bleſſing to ſuch a doctrine of corruption and diſhonour, that caſts infinite contempt upon the true goſpel; by teaching, in effect and true conſtruction, that "the blackneſs of darkneſs forever" is more effectual for the good and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men, than all the light and grace of the goſpel of Chriſt? It ſurely "exceeds all belief," however the motive may be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dified "by the wiſdom of man." So that "the motive circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced as in their ſcheme" cannot be ſteadily and firmly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, to give it operation and efficacy; for the firſt reaſon— becauſe there is no firm foundation for faith to reſt upon:—it is inadequate in force, for the ſecond—and no good can be expected from it—nothing but evil, for the third reaſon.— This may ſerve in part, for an anſwer to another argument ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted to recommend this impleaded doctrine and excuſe its publication to the world, viz. "the public officers of religion might be more free and full in urging the doctrine of the future puniſhment, on their ſcheme, than the common one, and be likely to do a great deal more good," p. 354, 5, 6. There can be no force in this ſuggeſtion, if what we have argued be true, that their notion wants credibility and force, and no good can be expected from it, either from the adapted force of the motive itſelf, nor from the bleſſing of God. It is plead, thoſe who do not believe the common doctrine, might upon their plan, teach the future torment to good purpoſe. Not, if their plan was unknown to the ſacred writers, and is but a mutilated pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed goſpel; the teaching it muſt do hurt and no good. What good can be done by teaching the wicked ſhall ſuffer an age of torment, then die the ſecond death, and then if ſtubborn, may die again and again? By what law, can this death again and again (after the ſecond death) be ſentenced and executed upon them? by no known law of God, of reaſon, or revelation, for this teaches only the firſt and ſecond death: it muſt be then a romantic, ſceptical fancy; and can the teaching this to the world, do good? a man of good ſenſe, unperverted by theory, may as well ſwallow fire, as to take ſuch an antiſcriptural, ſcepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, abſurd notion into his creed. Beſides, what right hath any man to take upon him a commiſſion, which he cannot execute with a good conſcience, according to the true ſpirit, language,
<pb n="355" facs="unknown:019737_0374_0FACA79122DBFEF8"/>
import and intention of it? Can a man honeſtly accept the commiſſion of ſupreme judge, in capital caſes of life and death, whoſe mind is perverted by the doctrine of paternal diſcipline into a full belief, that no capital executions by men whatever, are lawful? when he muſt either violate his conſcience in the execution of his office; or, diſappoint the righteous expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God and man from him, by refuſing to paſs the ſentence of death, upon every murderer that ſtands convicted before him? Can a man with any more honeſty, undertake to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the goſpel commiſſion, who cannot pronounce that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in it "he that believeth not ſhall be damned," without this eſſential alteration and addition to it, viz. "and yet he may and ſhall be ſaved?" If it be demanded, who hath requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red this alteration and addition at your hands? will it ſatisfy a judicious chriſtian, or avail with the Judge in the great day, to ſay, we thought it a more glorious meaning than our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our meant when he gave it, and than the apoſtles underſtood when they received it, and therefore ventured to add it? Nor hath this plain point in morality yet been proved, that a man may honeſtly and rightfully eat the bread of <hi>orthodoxy,</hi> and yet lay waſte the faith it is given him to ſupport and enforce. It ſeems requiſite in the nature of the thing, that theſe difficulties ſhould firſt be removed, before this argument can be urged upon us with propriety and force.<note n="‖" place="bottom">The Dr. in his "Seaſonable thoughts," hath given his ſentiments very different from this writer. In p. 245, he tells us, "Men viſibly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found in the faith, ſhould, upon no terms, be admitted into the miniſtry:" and if it appeared afterwards, "they ought to be turned out of it." And page 337, 8, it is the ſpecial duty of miniſters to guard their people againſt the bad influence of all error, in principle and practice. And when it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, "now is the time they are particularly called to ſtand up for the good old way," and bear a faithful teſtimony againſt every thing that may tend to caſt a blemiſh on true primitive chriſtianity." And again, p. 349, "to be ſure, thoſe ought to do ſo, in a particular manner, who inſtead of guarding people againſt error and evil practice, have unhappily been the inſtruments of leading them into it." This counſel of the Dr. appears to me incomparably ſafer and better than to encourage the fatal attempt of "doing a great deal of good" upon a plan of doctrine unknown to the ſacred writers: and of a viſible pernicious tendency.</note>

                  <p>As to the argument from the pious good tendency of this impleaded doctrine; the contrary hath been repeatedly ſhewn. As to that page 336, that it is ſingularly forcible to induce

meekneſs, patience, contentment and reſignation under the trials of this life—it is unſcriptural—it is far fetched—and far better adapted arguments may be deduced from ſcripture upon the common ſcheme: and indeed the argument as there ſtated, ſeems rather calculated to fortify and harden men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the fear of future deſtruction, than to do them any real ſervice in the preſent life.</p>
                  <p>I have now done with the evaſions and additional arguments to ſupport and commend the impleaded ſcheme; and truſt they are ſufficiently confuted. And it is alſo plainly ſhewn, that "it tends to deceive unwary ſouls, and turn them aſide from the ſimplicity of the goſpel;" on which ground we have the concurring wiſh of the author himſelf, with our own, "that it may meet with no acceptance in the world."<note n="*" place="bottom">See Preface, p. 16.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>To conclude, notwithſtanding all "the good words and fair ſpeeches," ſubtle criticiſms, inſinuations and plauſible preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of every kind, employed upon the ſubject, upon a careful examination, we find not a ſingle rational argument to induce any man to credit this doctrine, and much leſs to inculcate it, but very many againſt it. It is certain, the common faith of the chriſtian world, in the age of inſpiration and ever ſince, is incomparably better fitted and more forcible (than this ſtrange tenet) to ſupport the authority and government of God, to inforce the requiſitions of the law and goſpel, to advance the Redeemer's intereſt in the world, to promote the beſt welfare of church and ſtate, of families and individuals, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to reſtrain ſinners from ſin, and ſtimulate them to repentance, and to edify, ſupport and animate good men in the chriſtian life. And therefore is far more worthy of God, and of all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation of men. Whence were the tranſporting, unſpeakable joys of the martyrs, from Saint Stephen through all the ages of martyrdom, but from a near, lively view of the things of the inviſible world, "as eternal," without any reference to the temporary things of the new earth world, as now taught? It is certain, this impleaded doctrine, in ſubverting the common faith, can do no good, for reaſons already aſſigned: and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be not more likely to be followed with a blaſting curſe, than proſperous bleſſing, the reader will judge. Again, it is certain, the common faith can do us no hurt: we run no riſquo
<pb n="357"
                         facs="unknown:019737_0376_0FACA792A14BF8B8"
                         rendition="simple:additions"/>
in receiving it, and practiſing agreeable to it. For if all men ſhall be ſaved, we are as ſafe, and ſhall be ſaved, as well as they. On the other hand, the hazzard is certainly infinitely great: for if the common faith delivered to the ſaints, by inſpired men of God, be confirmed in the great day, as undoubtedly it will; and yet we truſt to this impleaded faith, and neglect the great ſalvation, we are unavoidably and everlaſting ruined. Now, can any man, who is not loſt to reaſon and mental ſenſibility, heſitate, which is the better faith, and which is the wiſeſt and ſafeſt courſe? Muſt not men act "in defiance of all reaſon and intereſt" to credit and rely upon this impleaded faith, in this contraſted view? But if this impleaded doctrine be no good to us, nor as taught to the chriſtian world, yet it hath another argument to recommend it which is repeatedly urged, "that it is well adapted and may be requiſite, to convert deiſts. If ſo, I ſhould think it muſt be on ſuppoſition, of a prediſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the deiſts to believe in all unbelief; and therefore the more ſubtle and abſurd, the more credible. For this plan is ſo abſurd, romantick and inconſiſtent in the parts, that I ſee not how they could be taken in, any other way. The argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment goes on the ſuppoſition; they want more forcible addreſs of reaſon, than they have yet had; which I take to be a miſtake in fact. The excellency of the doctrines and inſtitutions of chriſtianity, have been repreſented to them, in an amiable and engaging view; and the external evidences to confirm it, hath been ſet in a clear light before them, as noon-day, by the many able defenders of it, clergy and laity, within a century paſt: they can't therefore want addreſs to reaſon, and yet they are unreduced. Why? It is the doctrine of the croſs, is their grand difficulty. They are ſo addicted to their vain amuſements, and infatuated with worldly and ſenſual pleaſures, that they cannot part with theſe, for treaſures in heaven. What is the true remedy? This plan ſays, complement them with the giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of the croſs to them, as unneceſſary in this world, to their final ſalvation. They may indulge their pleaſures, be purged by fire in the future ſtate, and be ſaved. This labours of great difficulty: the doctrine of the croſs is committed in truſt to us, to believe, practiſe, teach and enforce. To give it up, is a ſpecies of treaſon in us, againſt the great Lord of the <pb n="358" facs="unknown:019737_0377_0FACA79362E92A10"/>
kingdom. After this treachery, they cannot truſt in any plan, as a ſubſtitute, that we can offer them. Beſides, it can do them no good: for if they become nominal chriſtians, without taking up the croſs, which they are ſo taught to be unneceſſary, they muſt ſuffer damnation, as ſurely, as if they had remained deiſts. And what is worſt of all, is, we put into their hands and furniſh them with a ſtronger argument againſt revelation, than all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity ever hath, or can produce. They would certainly turn the argument upon us, thus—if by goſpel conſtitution, faith in Chriſt, repentance towards God, and the taking up the croſs and following Chriſt in goſpel holineſs, in this life, be not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary to the ſalvation of men; there is no certainty in any thing, in the goſpel revelation. And it is certainly, inconſiſtent with all our ideas of the perfections of God, that he ſhould give a revelation to men, that cannot be depended on. The conſequence is, revelation is deſtroyed, and infidelity confirmed, on this plan. The reaſoning is juſt, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion unavoidable. So that this device for the converſion of deiſts, turns out ſelf-ſubverſive, and "vain deceit." What then is the true remedy? The wiſdom of God and Judge of the world hath taught it, in the goſpel commiſſion. Inſpire, animate their hopes, that if they become cordial believers, their reward is great, ſure, and eternal: and aſſure them by his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, "that he that believeth ſhall be ſaved;" and by the ſame authority, with equal plainneſs, ſolemnity and pathos, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the other part of the alternative of choice, "he that believeth not ſhall be damned." This do, to alarm their fears to purpoſe, becauſe their higheſt concernments to eternity, are immediately at ſtake. So that the exerciſe of theſe hopes and fears may arreſt their reaſon and attention, to examine the divine credentials of the goſpel; that they may believe and be ſaved. Theſe are the moſt rational, beſt adapted and forcible means and motives, for the converſion of infidels; the unerring Judge of the world, being judge. 'Tis theſe that prevailed and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed over all oppoſition in the miniſtry of the apoſtles, and have prevailed in ſucceſſive ages ever ſince; and which only, we can rationally expect to prevail, to the end of the world. And theſe writers, though undeſignedly, have yet very unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily been barring, inſtead of opening, the way for the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="359" facs="unknown:019737_0378_0FACA79422B3AEA8"/>
of infidels, by weakening and diſcrediting the means and motives to it, appointed by Chriſt. Is there not a ſingle rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal argument for the reception of this impleaded doctrine? Then, let all, both writers and readers, join in the benevolent with of this author "that it might meet with no acceptance in the world," but be baniſhed forever. Would we perſuade men to believe, to the ſaving of the ſoul; it muſt be, by urging the motives in the ſacred commiſſion, in their full force. And would we obtain an eternal weight of glory, we are expreſsly taught the way to it, "by looking to things inviſible" as "eternal." AMEN.</p>
