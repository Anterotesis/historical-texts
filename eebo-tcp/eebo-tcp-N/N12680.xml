            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <head>PREFACE</head>
                  <p>SINCE the firſt publication of the late Earl of Cheſterfield's Letters, to the preſent time, the arrows of Cenſure have been levelled at the doctrine they inculcate, from every quarter: the wit hath had his joke, the verſifier his parody, the moraliſt his oppoſing ſentiment, and the divine his grave diſſertation. Very ingenious men have taken the pen in hand to confront his Lordſhip: his Graces have been ſmartly ridiculed; his etiquette humorouſly expoſed; and Mr. Hunter,<note n="*" place="bottom">Author of ſome much admired Remarks on Lord Boling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke's poſthumous Writings.</note> with an elegance and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundity far beyond the reſt of his remarkers, hath penetrated into the very bottom of his maxims, traverſed him through every double, and examined his whole ſyſtem with an analy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical acuteneſs.</p>
                  <p>It is matter of real amazement that amongſt all thoſe who have expreſſed themſelves loudly and diametrically againſt the doctrine of Lord Cheſterfield's correſpondence, none ſhould have yet thought of the only method that was moſt likely to manifeſt their tendency. The general ſtigma upon theſe Letters has been, that they are calculated to recommend deceit, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:016020_0004_0F9B25593906D4C8"/>
the moſt deſtructive hypocriſy, under the ſmiling aſpect, plauſible exterior, fair-ſeeming ſentiments, and a complacent flexibility.</p>
                  <p>In an age of voluptuouſneſs, it is moſt obvious to apprehenſion, that maxims, like theſe, would have moſt weight with the young and diſſipated. The man of faſhion would find them ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with his plan of ſecurity, that there would be little doubt but he would adopt them; and the man of expedient and broken fortunes would as eagerly catch at a mode of conduct which, without either danger of his neck, or character, might repair his purſe, promote his pleaſures, and ſave him from a thouſand ſhocks that poverty is heir to.</p>
                  <p>The eſſence of my Lord Cheſterfield's ſyſtem ſeems to be neither more nor leſs than this: Secure yourſelf from being blaſted, as he terms it, and do whatever you think proper; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever fancy, paſſion, whim, or wickedneſs, ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt, only command your countenance, check your temper, and throw before your heart and boſom the ſhield of Diſſimulation, and ſnatch it—ſeize it—enjoy it.</p>
                  <p>In regard to women—never ſurely iſſued from the preſs a collection of hints ſo capable of being turned to their deſtruction: and the
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:016020_0005_0F9B2559F8B9CA20"/>
ſex ought to be more alarmed at this publication (which, however, one of their own ſex has uſhered into the world) than at any thing that ever was pointed at their peace of mind, or purity of character.</p>
                  <p>How, then, hath it happened, that no perſon hath yet put the volumes of the Earl of Cheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfield into the hand of a hero, who, with a natural aptitude to enjoy every thing within his obſervation, might increaſe his felicity very conſiderably, by the aſſiſtance of ſentiments ſo admirably ſuited to multiply miſchief, and to enſure his victory over that ſimplicity, that beauty, and that ſoftneſs, which would, thence, be, ſo much the more eaſily, <hi>thrown off their guard.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As nothing of this kind, however, has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, I have ventured to preſent to the public, the adventures of a man of birth, rank, figure, and character, ardent in the purſuit of pleaſures, and much delighted <hi>with,</hi> and attracted <hi>by,</hi> the theory of Lord Cheſterfield. He purchaſes the books, finds them agreeable to his palate, ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies them paragraph by paragraph, thrives un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his application, piques himſelf upon his progreſs; and in the end, a maſter of his ſcience, invokes the genius of his noble preceptor, puts
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:016020_0006_0F9B255AC040A6C8"/>
money in his purſe, the ineſtimable volumes in his portmanteau, and ſallies into the gay world, armed at all points, the PUPIL OF PLEASURE.</p>
                  <p>Every ingenious precept laid down by the noble Lord, this high-bred young gentleman reduces to practice, who, taking the ſummer before him, makes his attacks at a place of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhionable reſort; where (fixing with commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and pre-inſtructed acuteneſs upon proper objects) he begins to exemplify, and is as ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful as the politeſt caſuiſt could poſſibly wiſh.</p>
                  <p>In the courſe of this hiſtorical illuſtration—this biographical commentary on the text of Cheſterfield—ample ſcope has been allowed for the diſplay of various characters, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly ſuch as more immediately promoted the main deſign of the work, which is, to ſhew the aggravated evils in ſociety ariſing from the practice of ſuch <hi>perniciouſly-pleaſing precepts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this end, I have made great uſe of the noble Lord's maxims, rules, and admonitions, upon various ſubjects. The incidents, it is conceived, ariſe, naturally, out of the principles that produce them; the contraſt in the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, eſpecially of HOMESPUN, SEDLEY, THORNTON, Lieutenant VERNON, and Sir HENRY DELMORT, I have endeavoured to
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:016020_0007_0F9B255B7A7CF238"/>
render eminent and conſpicuous; and although, ſome may think the cataſtrophe, and a few of the circumſtances, carried too far into the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetic, yet, I am perſuaded, thoſe who weigh deeply the <hi>precepts</hi> of Lord Cheſterfield will agree with me in thinking, that, if puſhed into <hi>practice</hi> by an adventurer, like that which his Lordſhip <hi>would</hi> have formed out of Mr. Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hope, ſimilar or even greater ſorrows, and vices, would invade the community. In ſhort, this hiſtory is calculated ſtrongly to prove the truth of Lord Cheſterfield's <hi>own</hi> obſervation, namely, "That the adoption of vice is likely to ruin ten times more young men, than natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination."</p>

                  <p>THE whirl of wheels, a fine flow of ſpirits, the elyſium of expectation, and the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of freſh horſes at ever ſtage, brought me, in leſs than twenty hours, from Cavendiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſquare to the place of date.

THORNTON, no; the Earl is, as it were, my tutor; his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents are ſuch, as I have long <hi>felt,</hi> but ſuch as, till now, I was cautious to <hi>avow.</hi> The idle modes of the world ſtood as a bar, betwixt the precept and the practice. Hitherto, I have been reſtrained in my actions, and loſt half the joy of voluptuouſneſs, becauſe, forſooth, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body had either reputation, ingenuity, or taſte enough to keep me in countenance. I ſwam the common current of pleaſure, but was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways afraid of going out of my depth. The
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:016020_0012_0F9B255F393A48A8"/>
herd are contented to be libertines in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, ſhallow, ſhadowy way, and, before the appearance of theſe <hi>enchanting Letters,</hi> which, like the ſun, broke out upon our groſsneſs, we wanted the imprimatur of a man of celebrity,—of ſuch a ſoul as Cheſterfield's, to give credit and eclat to the efforts of an enterprizing ſpirit. But <hi>now</hi> the impediment is removed,—the avenue is opened,—the ice that cuſtom had frozen about the heart is thawed, and the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of pleaſure is palpable. The repoſitory of STANHOPE, the cabinet of CHESTERFIELD, the Earl's arcanum, are all diſcloſed:—EUGENIA—bear, bear the name, ye roſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing'd deities of joy, in gratitude to heaven!—EUGENIA has given to mankind the invaluable remains of her father,—remains which—(Oh, THORNTON, echo EUGENIA!)—have diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, to every elegant character, fleſh roads to the temple of felicity; virgin reſources of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal extacy; and treaſuries of bliſs as yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſted, and unexplored.</p>
                  <p>My deſign then, is to indulge my principles, by improving upon thoſe maxims which his poliſh'd pen hath made <hi>faſhionable.</hi> Let duller ſouls content themſelves with <hi>vulgar</hi> happineſs; with yielding beauty, entrapt ſimplicity, and
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:016020_0013_0F9B255FFB3BBA10"/>
the mere defloration of female youth.—I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be circumſcribed by ſuch common, <hi>animal</hi> ſenſations: no, James!—give me delicacy, difficulty, refinement,—give me innovation,—or take from me exiſtence.</p>
                  <p>"To beat the beaten track,—to taſte the taſted."—Oh, ſhocking!—inſupportable! I am above it. I ſcorn it.</p>
                  <p>In a word then, THORNTON, what our GARRICK is to SHAKESPEARE, I am reſolved to be to CHESTERFIELD,—the living com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, upon the dead text. The youth to whom the Earl's Letters were originally ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed, thou knoweſt, is dead; and he wanted a <hi>ſoul</hi> to reliſh, and a taſte to improve, had he continued amongſt us. Such a cool creature is better in its coffin. Peace to his uncongenial manes! But ſhall STANHOPE be therefore without an heir? No,—I claim the inheritance, THORNTON, and deſire you will henceforth conſider <hi>me</hi> as his ſon, by the adoption of his <hi>ſentiment.</hi> Nay, had theſe veins been filled with the rich ſtream that fed the heart of STANHOPE, I could not have been more like himſelf—God forgive me! but, were it not ſaid, and ſaid ſolemnly, that my mother was the Diana of her day, I ſhould ſuſpect ſhe played

my father the Alderman falſe, and threw her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the conquering and accompliſhed arms of CHESTERFIELD.—Earth and ſkies! Mr. THORNTON, canſt thou think I was the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of a plethoric Alderman, and that that Alderman could be a dealer I hops?—Baſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize me, dear friend, in pity to my feelings; and rather than ſuppoſe me the offſpring of <hi>ſuch</hi> a conjunction, make me the by-blow of ſome deity in diſguiſe, and let me catch a ray of comfort from illegitimacy.</p>
                  <p>So much for the introduction to our corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence. Of preface no more—Prepare for immediate action—Ha!

                  <p>THE Earl's abſent man has already exhibited himſelf. He is of the name of HOME<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SPUN, and is the butt of the bath. His ſoul is
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:016020_0015_0F9B2562933E7F98"/>
contemplative, and his body pedantic. Never ſaw I ſo perpendicular, or profound a figure: a very walking ſoliloquy; a moving meditation! and his wife, or, at leaſt, the beautiful She who hangs upon his arm as ſuch—O THORN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON! THORNTON!—I have an object before me already, young, elegant, graceful, and (I warmly hope) a <hi>wife</hi>—If ſhe ſhould prove <hi>indeed</hi> the property of this pedant—if the ſtars ſhould have thrown a <hi>hoop of gold</hi> in my way, my fortune is made.—Soft a little—enter my landlord; I like the lines of his face—his eye looks communication—intelligence plays the goſſip in every feature. He will prove the <hi>Daily Advertiſer</hi> of the bath. In half an hour the budget of Buxton will be open.</p>
                  <p>Pray, Mr.—I forgot your name—('twas an aukward overſight, not to have learn'd his name, James)—Mr.—Wyngood is my name, Sir.—Pray, Mr. Wyngood, what <hi>fine</hi> young lady is that now walking with the <hi>ſtraight, well made</hi> gentleman in raven-grey?</p>

come to bathe for the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> diſorder. There's a <hi>vaſt</hi> deal of company, Sir, in town, and I think you are extremely lucky in taking my lodgings. My lodgings are the beſt lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in all BUXTON, and ſome of the beſt peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple lodge in my lodgings at this moment. Why now, Sir, you would not think it, but I can ſhew you ſuch things as will ſurprize you—Here he ſet off, and I followed him into a bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber, where, without any ceremony, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the drawers of his lodgers, he took out a riding-hat with a blue feather and a ſpangled button.—"Lookee, Sir, did you ever ſee the like? Theſe are the things of the gentry who lodge at my lodgings.—Then here is ſilks upon ſattins, and ſattins upon ſilks; and they're the <hi>kindeſt</hi> people in the world. They live as cheap as poſſible. Why I don't ſuppoſe, now, one day with another, they ſpend a guinea: there is reaſon in every thing: they pay only eight-pence a-piece for the breakfaſt, a ſhilling a head for dinner, eight-pence for tea in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon, a ſhilling for ſupper, and fourteen ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings for lodging; beſides waſhing, coals, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, and wines,—<hi>a mere nothing,</hi> a wet of the little finger, as I may ſay, for a watering-place.

worthy gentleman, and I will go mention you under the name of—of—pray, <hi>what</hi> name muſt I ſay, Sir?"—I look'd a mild negative to his queſtion—Very true, very true, no matter, no matter; I will tell Mr. HOME<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SPUN that a new lodger wiſhes to do as he does. Sir your ſervant; I will be with you again pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently. I ſee you are a worthy gentleman plain enough.</p>
                  <p>The fellow had it all his own way, THORN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON. I interrupted him not, and am this very night to ſup with Maſter Miniſter HOMESPUN. I have walked down to the <hi>Well,</hi> and drank a glaſs at this Helicon of health. I was to be, in this ramble, the man of faſhion, juſt ſtept out of the chaiſe, and elegantly diſordered in my dreſs. Exteriors, as they always ſhould, corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponded. My hair was tied with negligence, my curls looſe, in the <hi>ton</hi> of confuſion, and my frock diſcovered a genteel ſhape, and the cut of a capital taylor.</p>
                  <p>A miſcellaneous group were paſſing away the intermediate hours betwixt tea-time and ſupper: the lame and the lazy, the merry and the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, were all upon the ſaunter: HOMESPUN was fondly ruminating with his angelic conſort in the ſhade; and <hi>ſomething,</hi> that had the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance

                  <p>Nothing, however, could induce me to ſtay a moment at ſo dull a place, but the <hi>practice</hi> of <hi>precepts</hi> which will convert <hi>all</hi> places into pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe, and make even a <hi>watering place</hi> delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.—The ſupper-bell ſummons me.—Mrs. HOMESPUN—Oh! what a name for ſuch a creature!—Mrs. HOMESPUN is tripping it, towards the ſound, and HOMESPUN himſelf ſeems to forget his primitive uprightneſs of back, and ſteps briſkly forward.</p>

                     <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>YOU remember, I preſume, the jaunt I took in the laſt year to SOUTHAMPTON, the particulars of which, at the requeſt of ſome friends, I ſuffered to be printed in the WEST<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MINSTER MAGAZINE, in two ſeveral letters addreſſed to the publiſher, Mr. THOMAS WRIGHT, of Eſſex-ſtreet, in the Strand, Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. I there told you, that I was not quite ſo highly intereſted in, or entertained by, the ſcenes in a hurry before me, as my <hi>then</hi> patron, the Baronet, would flatter my imagination with upon the road; and (as I find thoſe letters from the Weſtminſter Magazine were reprinted into various <hi>other</hi> monthly publications) I have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſuppoſe my excurſion afforded ſome amuſement to a certain claſs of readers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="23" facs="unknown:016020_0022_0F9B25677A3CD810"/>
Albeit, having, ſince then, been yoked to a damſel who hath a paſſion for theſe watering places, and who (bringing along with her a decent dower) hath a right to indulge herſelf in ſuch amuſements as ſeem beſt unto her, I have now a <hi>ſecond</hi> opportunity to ſurvey the cuſtoms and manners of water-drinkers and duckers; and can give you, my friend, many curious particulars by way of ſupplement to the accounts I have already publiſhed.</p>
                  <p>As my preſent cure is ſituated about thirty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeven poſt miles and a quarter, more or leſs (one cannot be claſſically correct to a yard) from the waters of BUXTON, amidſt the wonders of the Peake, Mrs. HOMESPUN choſe to paſs a week at that place, for the benefit of a pain in the ancle, which pain became grievous about ſix minutes before ſhe ſuggeſted to me the neceſſity of ſuch an excurſion. Very ſudden, to be ſure. But humanity is frail; and women are whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical.</p>
                  <p>That the cure of her ancle might be perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compleated, I contrived it ſo, as to perſuade the curate of a neighbouring pariſh, to do duty at home in my abſence, and reſolved to tarry a fortnight. Of this fortnight, only four days are yet expired; and though I never underwent the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:016020_0023_0F9B2568383D8D70"/>
ſame degree of parade, of fatigue, and of imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence, in any former <hi>fourteen</hi> years of my life,—not even when I preached thrice on the Sunday, and fairly footed it to two of the cures,—yet HARRIET ſeems ſo happy in <hi>doing as others do,</hi> and finds ſuch real felicity in the dull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſpot I ever beheld, becauſe, ſhe ſays, it is the <hi>Ton,</hi> that I am in doubt whether even the long reſidue of the fortnight will ſatiſfy her; or whether ſhe will by that time have had <hi>Ton</hi> enough to return home to peace, privacy and the parſonage-houſe, without murmurings and repinings.</p>
                  <p>Oh! Doctor, ſee the outlines of my ſituation, and pity me. I am amongſt a number of both ſexes whoſe pleaſures are my averſions, and whoſe amuſements I cannot reliſh. Quietude and the ſhade of life emparadiſe me, and yet the houſe, wherein I lodge, is as public as an inn at a fair. I admire rural ornaments, and ſcenes of ſummer verdure beyond imagination; I rejoice to ſee the bud broaden, and the bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms expand before the ſun, yet the mountains of Arabia Deſerta exhibit not a proſpect more barren and unblooming, than that by which this BUXTON is bounded. I love moreover to ſtroll into the ſhop of an intelligent bookſeller, and there converſe with him upon the topic of
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:016020_0024_0F9B2568F88E12B8"/>
recent publications;—alas! the bookſeller of BUXTON has nothing in his ſhop but the traſh that circulates at a watering-place amongſt the women. I ran my eye over his catalogue, and never did I ſee ſuch a collection: Clelia, Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandra, Pamela, the Adventures of Cleopatra, Amuſements at the German Spa, and the Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of an Actreſs, were the beſt in this bad bundle. But though I ſaw folly, I made bold to aſk for ſenſe: at leaſt, what paſſes as ſuch.</p>
                  <p>I mentioned the Reviews—no-body called for <hi>them.</hi> It is not the <hi>Ton</hi> to be critical. I talked of the Magazines—none were ordered; Magazines are too multiplied, and too common to be the <hi>Ton.</hi> I rummaged every row for <hi>philoſophy</hi>—no-body reads philoſophy at a watering-place. The Philoſophy of Fools might ſurely have found a place. I criticiſed the ſhelves for <hi>morals,</hi> but found them not. I ventured to aſk, but with ſome little heſitation, for Secker's Lectures—I ſeemed to have taken away the bookſeller's breath: he never heard of them. I took a turn round the ſhop, and (having forgot to bring any books with me, although very bookiſh) would have taken up with almoſt any thing <hi>approximating</hi> to the rational; but, in my progreſs, I had well-nigh
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:016020_0025_0F9B2569B872A348"/>
overſet a glaſs-caſe of toothpicks, gold huſſies, embroidered pincuſhions, and emboſſed ſnuff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boxes.</p>
                  <p>And now it appeared, that this harlequin trader was rather a haberdaſher, than a book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller; or rather an ambiguous multiform mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, who dealt in the apparatus both of the ſoul and the body.</p>
                  <p>On caſting my eyes towards a perſon at the other end of the ſhop, I ſaw her bending wire, to form, what is, in this merry age, facetiouſly called, a cap; over this perſon's head in fair arrangement, was to be ſeen a goodly ſhow of bandboxes; and acroſs the window near which ſhe ſat, were ribbons variouſly and ridiculouſly twiſted, with ſeveral ſpecimens of her ſkill in decorating that part of the human body, which is <hi>now</hi> more prepoſterous than any other. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch preparations for the <hi>outſide</hi> of the head, I gave up the idea of finding any <hi>internal</hi> furniture; ſo walking out of the ſhop, I aſked pardon for having ſo groſsly miſtaken a milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's and toyman's for a vender of matters in the literary way.—Juſt as I got to the door, a party of mighty pretty women, and my wife amongſt the reſt (not the leaſt amiable, and who, already knew every body) came ruſtling
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:016020_0026_0F9B256A7AD45168"/>
into the ſhop, and in a liſping accent (it is not <hi>toniſh</hi> to ſpeak plain, or do the vowels juſtice) attuned to the articulation of a watering-place, deſired the haberdaſhery-millinery bookſeller to look for JULIA MANDEVILLE—Julia Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deville was not to be had, being, as ſaid the dealer, very much run upon. Then let us have SIDNEY BIDDULPH, ſaid the ladies—Sidney Biddulph was out, being likewiſe a lady in conſtant requeſt. I'm for, THE MISTAKES OF THE HEART, cried a very grave-looking woman; who ſurely made a ſmall miſtake in the choice of her reading. I wiſh, my dear, (ſaid my wife to me, with a very well-bred ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, taking leſs notice of me than uſual—it is <hi>quite</hi> out of the <hi>Ton</hi> to be tender, Doctor,) you had brought JOSEPH ANDREWS along with you—Oh la! Ma'am, replied another, how can you poſſibly read ſuch <hi>low</hi> ſtuff—the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures of a footman, a kitchen-wench, and a ſtrolling parſon—Nay, Madam, ſaid HAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIET, don't ſay any thing againſt the parſons, pray; remember I'm a clergyman's wife, and there he ſtands—an ABRAHAM ADAMS every inch of him—a'nt you, my dear?</p>
                  <p>This was too much; I attempted to go forth, but HARRIET caught me by the coat (it is
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:016020_0027_0F9B256B4400D378"/>
preciſely the <hi>Ton</hi> to teaſe a huſband, Doctor.) The poor ladies were in great anxiety to find THESE MISTAKES OF THE HEART had been carried off laſt ſeaſon, by a perſon who took the road to GRETNA GREEN—the Scotch mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying village—with her footman, in her way to London; though ſome (ſaid the haberdaſher archly) may think <hi>that</hi> was going a round-about way too. If we can't get THE MISTAKES, ſuppoſe, rejoined the ladies, we have a flight to the PARADISE OF FOOLS? or ſuppoſe we make a ſhift, till we can get ſomething <hi>better,</hi> with TOM JONES?—Aye, TOM JONES is tolerable enough, (ſaid a pale languid lady) if he would but ſay more about the ſeraphic SOPHIA, and give us leſs nonſenſe about the old vulgar fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the fuſty aunt, and thoſe unertertaining horrid creatures THWACKUM and SQUARE. He is ſhockingly tedious about thoſe fellows. As to his Introductory Chapters, as he calls them, I always ſkip'em. Aye, Madam, ſaid another, and if he was a little plainer in telling us what we were really to expect, at the top of his chapters, it would be as well; in which caſe I really think it would be a <hi>goodiſh, prettyiſh</hi> ſort of a novel, to <hi>read once.</hi> Tom Jones, it ſeems, was now in reading by Lady Sallow's coachman.—The haberdaſher recommended
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:016020_0028_0F9B256BF96AE210"/>

                  <p>They were about to depart without any books at all, when the haberdaſher mentioned ſome old volumes of the Spectator.

                  <head>LETTER IX. SEDLEY to THORNTON.</head>
                  <p>OH! for the genius of old HORATIUS FLAC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CUS, to compreſs a volume of facts within the foldings of a ſingle ſheet of paper!—Hear,—ſee,—be convinced,—congratulate me, and ſing a <hi>Te Deum</hi> to thy friend, and to the immortal memory of STANHOPE.</p>
                  <p>The party, of which I was made one, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of maſter miniſter HOMESPUN, his lady, an animal who burleſqued the coxcomb, and a fourth perſon who departed before the entrance of ſupper, ſo that of him I ſhall ſay nothing at preſent.—HOMESPUN and his wife are oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites, and therefore the better ſuited to the <hi>trial of ſkill.</hi> At firſt, I ſaid no more than juſt to
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:016020_0031_0F9B256FBAA62900"/>
ſhew my breeding, and inclination to be happy in their ſociety. I let them ſhew off <hi>themſelves</hi> as much as poſſible, that I might accurately learn their tempers, before I ventured to attack them. This is one of the very firſt elementary principles of my ſyſtem. HOMESPUN ſoon diſcovered himſelf to be a grubber in books, and his lady a grubber in the faſhions; in her tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, gay, giddy, good-natured, unſuſpicious and uninformed. The coxcomb was of the neutral kind, but wiſhed to be flattered, for his taſte in perſonal ornaments; and of courſe, was flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Never was there a more curious trio. The converſation turned at firſt, as it uſually does among the Engliſh, upon weather, then upon books, then upon dreſs, then upon the virtue of certain characters of the books, and laſt, upon the virtue of the BUXTON waters. I accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated myſelf to the ſeveral changes with to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable felicity. You muſt conſider me, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, but as a beginner;—note my progreſs.</p>
                  <p>And, firſt, to touch the tender part of our book-worm, I obſerved, that the public ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a great loſs in the death of ſeveral literary or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments of the age. I ſpoke critically, as to the ſatiric powers of CHARLES CHURCHIL; and poetically, as to the Pindaric flights of
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:016020_0032_0F9B257079C152F8"/>
GRAY. I entered into the intricacies of the epic, and drew the line betwixt the original HOMER and the imitator VIRGIL. I ſpoke of eaſe, in the ſtyle of TILLOTSON, of grace in ADDISON, and of the pathetic, in the periods of YORICK. I affected even to diſcountenance the inuendo of TRISTRAM SHANDY, and I compared his licentious ſpirit with the voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous OVID. I pretended to diſcover an oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious diſplay of talents in the Orations and Epiſtles of CICERO; and I took care to ſuit eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry opinion to the <hi>taſte</hi> of the perſon I addreſſed, who had his ſhare in the converſation too, and who (as I have ſince heard) mentions me to his friends as a paragon of learning. Take this, THORNTON, as a receipt to make a ſcholar a ſimpleton!</p>
                  <p>I muſt not forget to tell thee, that, when I was talking upon books, and mentioned the ELEMENTS OF CRITICISM Mrs. HOMESPUN (though <hi>no</hi> ſimpleton) aſked me, with great ſimplicity, if that ſame criticiſm was a <hi>novel;</hi> to which the fop anſwered, <hi>Yes,</hi> it came out laſt year, and was written by an intimate friend of his; but that, though <hi>he</hi> puſhed it with all his intereſt, it did not <hi>take,</hi> and was now totally buried in oblivion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="34" facs="unknown:016020_0033_0F9B257138E18218"/>
I contradicted this with all poſſible politeneſs—<hi>I imagined he might be miſtaken;</hi> (never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear aſſured, THORNTON) that work, <hi>I believed,</hi> was attributed to Lord KAIMES—a writer, with whom I did <hi>not doubt</hi> but he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, Poſſibly he might confound the title a little, with others ſimilar to it; which might very eaſily be done. I had caught <hi>myſelf</hi> in ſuch errors a thouſand times. Mr. HOMESPUN chuckled at my candour. Mrs. HOMESPUN (I know by her eyes, I read every body's eyes) ſaid ſomething to her huſband, in a low voice, in my favour; and the fop himſelf, with a ſmile of complacence, but without any confuſion at detected ignorance,—he wants the taſte to bluſh—(ſuch, THORNTON, is the force of <hi>manner!)</hi>—ſaid, it was very likely he might be miſled by the title; that there were three or four <hi>elements,</hi> and he was moſt ſuperlatively obliged to me for ſetting him right.</p>
                  <p>Upon the topic of <hi>dreſs,</hi> a fruitful theme, I took care to agree with Mrs. HOMESPUN in every particular; except that, now and then, I affected, in a gentle tone of voice, and ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſmile of countenance, to differ from her, on purpoſe to throw the triumph on <hi>her</hi> ſide, make her happy in an ideal ſuperiority, the
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:016020_0034_0F9B2571FAB557B8"/>
better to impreſs her with a proper notion of my good manners, in yielding to conviction.</p>
                  <p>About twelve o'clock, the fop hopped out, and took me by the hand in token of ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Honeſt HORACE (that is his right claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical and Chriſtian name) conſiders me as his comforter, and declares, that, he hopes for ſome happineſs now, even in a watering place; while Mrs. HOMESPUN, or, as I ſhall call her here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, (to uſe as little as poſſible that vulgar name) HARRIET, makes no ſcruple of ſaying, I am the moſt chatty, agreeable man at the bath.</p>
                  <p>I caught her, THRONTON, twice meaſuring me from top to bottom, and then ſhe gave HORACE a ſurvey.—By the ſoft, half-ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed ſigh ſhe gave at the end of it, it is eaſy to ſee—whoſe dimenſions ſhe likes beſt.</p>
                  <l>"Thus far we run before the wind."</l>
                  <p>Oh! THORNTON, if I can once bring her to be diſcontented with her ſituation,—if ſhe once begins to repent of her bargain, the day is my own! I never ſaw a pair of eyes more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to fail in love than hers; they turn with a caſt of concupiſcence to the azure corners. The eyes of HORACE are grey, and without
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:016020_0035_0F9B2572B9466250"/>
luſtre. She hath the right lips of invitation: the vulgar HORACE ſmackt them at ſomething ſhe ſaid, but methinks the impreſſion he made, was only <hi>ſkin deep.</hi> She is in full health, and in the hey-day of female youth!</p>
                  <p>Oh! THORNTON! THORNTON! Pray ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, that ſhe may be miſerable, and that the deſpair of her heart may be removed, only by thy friend.</p>

Dare not, on thy life, THORNTON, dare not again attempt to make me an apoſtate to PLEASURE. Half-bred man, be ſilent and attentive. I have a ſcene to paint to thee that might ſhaw the frigid feelings of an Anchorite.</p>
                  <p>About one o'clock in the morning, the eyes of HORACE began to twinkle—what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore dull became duller, till at laſt the four eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſhes met together, and covered the balls of ſight. HARRIET continued loquacious and lively, and reſolved not to go to bed till it was a more <hi>modiſh</hi> hour, inſiſting, that I ſhould keep her company. I humoured her vivacity till HORACE began to ſnore, and then ſhifted the converſation to ſomething leſs ſpirited, but to ſomething more attaching.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="38" facs="unknown:016020_0037_0F9B257439A95658"/>
                     <hi>Sentiment,</hi> THORNTON, when enforced at a proper criſis, is a better weapon for a man of pleaſure, than downright <hi>licentiouſneſs.</hi> I began to ſing forth the happineſs of Mr. HOMESPUN; ſaid many things in praiſe of his learning, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, and hoſpitable turn of thinking—then ſhifted again, told a tale of diſappointed paſſion—deſcanted on the difficulties often attending reciprocal attractions—placed two young peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in ſeveral affecting ſituations. I altered the tone of my voice, and ſuited it to the ſtillneſs of the night—ſighed in whiſper—corrected myſelf—hem'd—heſitated—called a tear into my eye—aſſumed a ſoftened felxibility of feature—and, now and then, took my eye from viewing her, as if ſenſibly ſtruck with my danger.</p>
                  <p>Part of the flowers with which ſhe had been ſome time playing, fell on the floor—I took them up with a trembling hand, and put them into hers, with a preſſure ſcarcely perceptible. A ſudden bluſh came over her face in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I took no notice of it; but, catching up a myrtle ſprig, kept it, ſportingly, as if to conceal a new ſigh—preſented it to her as the freſheſt on the table, and roſe to take my leave.</p>
                  <p>It was the exact moment of departure. She
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:016020_0038_0F9B2574F8F75408"/>
was viſibly agitated, and I would not ſee it. She took the ſprig, and the leaves ſhook. I went ſoftly to the door—left with her the compliments of the night, in a gentleneſs of the tones perfectly pathetic—lingered at the door a moment—complained that I could not open it haſtily for fear of diſturbing her huſband—at laſt, I <hi>almoſt</hi> ſhut it—half opened it again—played with the handle—ſtood the third of a minute, in a finely-diſſembled ſtate of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſment—once more bade her farewel, and indeed departed.</p>

                  <p>I REALLY begin to think, I ſhall find ſome ſatisfaction at BUXTON bath, amidſt a cluſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of inſignificant characters, one gentleman has diſtinguiſhed himſelf ſo much above the reſt, that I have at once gratified my pride, and curioſity, in obtaining his acquaintance.</p>
                  <p>He is intimately ſkilled in polite and elegant learning; perfectly well mannered, and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove converſing upon ſubjects of divinity, and ethics, even at a watering-place. My wife
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:016020_0044_0F9B25799041FCC0"/>
ſays, he underſtands to a nicety, what, ſome of the waterers call, the ETIQUETTE of dreſs; ſo that, with the arts of a ſcholar, he has, it ſeems, the invention and taſte of a courtier, without any thing of courtly inſincerity.</p>
                  <p>In truth, I am apt to think very favourably of him, eſpecially, as his exterior does not ſeem more frank and open, than his interior is inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous and undiſguiſed. <hi>One</hi> ſuch character will atone for the ſtupidity of the <hi>reſt.</hi> As I am fond of, now and then, what I call a wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walk, or a ramble by myſelf, I can now take <hi>this</hi> without a breach of good manners; for I can leave this accompliſhed gentleman with HARRIET, who is fond enough of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to accept of him in <hi>my</hi> abſence.</p>
                  <p>I am half inclined to forgive watering-places, becauſe they have, in the end, after much prior diſappointment, produced a companion, whoſe ſentiments, of life, and maxims of <hi>moral</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, do credit to himſelf, and honour to the ſpecies.</p>

                  <head>LETTER XIX. Mrs. HOMESPUN to Mrs. LA MOTTE.</head>
                  <p>OH! that I could live to BUXTON for ever!—We have, ſince I laſt wrote to you, got acquainted with the handſomeſt man in the world; and though he is as good a ſcholar as HORACE, yet he underſtands as well as I do, all the prettineſſes of <hi>dreſs,</hi> of which, you know, HORACE is entirely ignorant. Then he is ſo polite, ſo unaffected, he contradicts with ſuch gentleneſs—he is ſo open to conviction!—You know my averſion to filthy <hi>cheeſe.</hi> I happened only to <hi>hint</hi> this, and he ordered it never to be brought again to the table, while I was at the bath; though Mr. HOMESPUN ſaid, I ought to ſuffer what was offenſive to <hi>myſelf,</hi> out of good manners to the <hi>company.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis hardly worth attending to, and perhaps you'll laugh at my <hi>noticing</hi> ſuch a trifle, but he ſits in a chair, eats his victuals, cuts it into ſlices, and holds his knife and fork as different from HORACE as poſſible, who, you know, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſeems ſo over head and years in thought, that he forgets the dinner is before him, picks his teeth, and ſits ſilent, till the cloth is ready to be taken away. Then again, as to carving,
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:016020_0046_0F9B257AF968F1F8"/>
HORACE can no more do the honours of the table than a baby: he <hi>miſſes the joint,</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſcatters the ſauce in ones face;—where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>this</hi> gentleman hits the mark as dexterouſly as a ſurgeon, helps the ladies to the grateſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacies, with ſuch a gentle manner, and with a countenance ſo ſmiling, that it is impoſſible to refuſe what he offers.</p>
                  <p>At ſupper laſt night, HORACE was in one of his thoughtful moods, and diſguſted me hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridly.</p>
                  <p>There was a roaſted fowl; and HORACE, perceiving my plate empty, muſt needs fill it with one of the wings, which he made ſhift to mangle off with the knife with which he had been eating, though another for the purpoſe was lying on the other ſide the diſh. Then he muſt needs make my wing ſwim with the gravy, and, in awkwardly tilting the diſh, ſeveral drops flew upon the gentleman's waiſtcoat. Mr. SEDLEY—that is his name—ſaid, it was no matter; it was not eaſy to help ſuch accidents; and begged he would conſider it as of no ſort of conſequence.—Sweet fellow!—Oh, that HORACE would imitate him! He is now walking towards our lodgings, and HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RACE ſlouching by the ſide of him. HORACE
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:016020_0047_0F9B257BBB7B2C40"/>
is, to be ſure, upright enough, but then he looks as ſtiff and uncomfortable as an over-ſtarched ſhirt.—SEDLEY moves as if he was quite happy: Mr. HOMESPUN ſtruts as if he was in miſery. They are both at the door.</p>

                  <p>THE proverb is verified: It cannot rain, but it pours!—Pardon the vulgarity of a proverb, which is too a-propos to omit—The Cheribim I mentioned to thee in my laſt, is a cherub of an inferior order, when compared with the SERAPH who came with her.

HENRY. The very firſt trial I made to reduce my favourite precepts to practice, was upon the heart of this very girl, then glowing with all the graces of health, and endowed with all the enchantments of a <hi>pathetic</hi> temper. I ſoon pretended to loſe <hi>my</hi> vivacity, and became the ſofteſt ſon of ſentiment that ever was born. The net of ſilk, which I had diligently woven, became ſucceſsful; and I had certainly caught in it the faireſt prize in the creation, had not a cruel neceſſity called me from the bath.</p>
                  <p>Several tranſient tete-a-tetes I had with her there, gave me the opportunities I wiſhed. Her paſſion was imaginary, but pleaſing—ſhe fixed high the ſtandard of domeſtic felicity, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonably loved to refine.</p>
                  <p>To accommodate myſelf to <hi>this,</hi> was, at firſt, not eaſy; but before I quitted SCARBOROUGH, I was ſo diſtinguiſhed for the <hi>penſeroſo,</hi> that even Sir HENRY himſelf began to think I was falling into a hypochondriac diſorder, and uſed every effort to divert me.</p>
                  <p>Though I was then but a novice in the the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory of joy, I had read enough of CHESTER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FIELD to know the potency of <hi>diſſimulation;</hi> and, had it been in my power to have ſtaid <hi>another week,</hi> ſhould have, even <hi>then,</hi> added an il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious

example, to corroborate that glorious precept, which adviſes, "to adopt the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and converſation to the company."</p>
                  <p>Since theſe tranſactions, ſhe is altered, THORNTON,—altered in every part of her ſituation: ſhe is married, and in a conſumption; and yet, like certain fruits, ſhe is delicious in decay. I was pleaſed to ſee her diſordered at the firſt interview; the little blood that painted her cheek, diſappeared, her knees ſhook, and her hands trembled, at the recollection. And this, too, was in a public breakfaſting room. Judge how her agitation muſt alarm the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and operate amongſt the women in my favour. Who knows, THORNTON, but the beautiful invalid may have brought herſelf to this ſtate, upon <hi>my</hi> account? If ſo, ought not I to pity her?—and ought not <hi>ſhe</hi> to thank the gods, that I again "am come to comfort her?" At all events, you ought to congratulate me, and once again ſing <hi>Io Paeon,</hi> to the canonized bones of CHESTERFIELD.</p>

                  <p>THE HOMESPUNS are ſecured; I have them by the <hi>heart,</hi> and enjoy, in an equal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, the <hi>confidence</hi> of the wife and huſband.</p>
                  <p>HORACE has many <hi>oddities,</hi> of which his wife is lately become ſenſible; and it has been <hi>my</hi> buſineſs to excuſe them to her. He is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to catch hold of the button, and, in the ardour of philoſophical and ſyſtematic conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, tugs at it moſt immoderately. Laſt night, in ſupporting a favourite opinion, which was oppoſed ſtoutly by the fopling, he ſeized the wrought button, and tore his fingers againſt the raiſed work on the ſurface, till the blood fairly guſhed cut in a ſtream, and ſpotted his ſables. The fop ſwore,—I checked him with <hi>temper:</hi> the parſon cooled in his <hi>argument,</hi>—and I applied an handkerchief to the wound, and thus ſaved them both from <hi>looking ſilly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>HORACE'S nails are not quite ſo <hi>accurately clean</hi> as they might be; and, as I obſerved Mrs. HOMESPUN comparing them with <hi>mine,</hi> I ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly cloſed my hand, as <hi>if</hi> out of tenderneſs, leſt the compariſon ſhould turn to HORACE'S diſadvantage; yet this <hi>very</hi> tenderneſs, <hi>ſo mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,</hi>

anſwered the deſign compleatly; and I can ſee plainly, HARRIET thinks hardly of HORACE for neglecting to pick the dirt from under his nails: while, on the other hand, when he and I are <hi>together,</hi> we laugh at the ſopperies of the times, and ſeem mutually to deſpiſe all its DELICATESSE.</p>

                  <p>And ſo, becauſe I have an eye upon <hi>three,</hi> thou ſuppoſeſt I muſt needs be inconſiſtent and irregular! Doſt thou not know, that the ſame Oracle adviſes, a quickneſs of attention, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obſerved obſervation, the art of ſeeing all the people in the room without appearing to look <hi>critically?</hi> Is there not, according to that Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, pretty nearly the ſame degree of deception in every character; and are we not to turn all this hypocriſy to <hi>our</hi> advantage, even while we <hi>ſeem</hi> to think every body <hi>honeſt?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The great nicety, in my preſent ſituation, <hi>thou</hi> doſt not ſee; nor will <hi>I</hi> be at the pains to develop it to ſo awkward an arguer.</p>
                  <p>What a concluſion haſt thou drawn, indeed, from my having <hi>three</hi> objects in view! not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering, that I am as cool and collected as if I had but <hi>one;</hi> and that I have a capacity, equal to the conqueſt of thirty times three.</p>
                  <p>Learn to know me better.</p>

precipitate, or to hazard the mortification of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſappointed, by raſhly ſeizing that which I perceive can only be obtained gradually, by the ſucceſsful efforts of reſiſtleſs inſinuation</p>
                  <p>The Maſter of my art ſays, very truly,—<q>Little minds are in a hurry, when the object proves too big for them: they run, they puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zle, confound, and perplex themſelves; they want to do every thing at once, and never do it at all. But a man of ſenſe takes the time for doing the thing he is about, well; and his haſte to diſpatch a buſineſs, only appears by the continuity of his application to it: he purſues it with a cool ſteadineſs, and finiſhes it before he begins any other.</q>

                  <p>This laſt ſentence, THORNTON, thou mayſt think, claſhes with my preſent attack upon the three beauties of BUXTON.</p>

                  <p>I am not in a hurry to be happy, as to the <hi>ultimatum</hi> of female favours. Like a man of reſolution, I can watch the progreſs of a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite purſuit, and ſee it proſper under my eye, without ſeizing the final recompence of my labour, till it is the proper <hi>criſis</hi> of fruition.</p>
                  <p>To bring theſe arguments home to the points
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:016020_0055_0F9B2581B9D19ED8"/>
in queſtion, thou muſt underſtand, that, had only HARRIET HOMESPUN been at the bath, I ſhould have been contented till <hi>her finiſhing;</hi> but, as the Fates have thrown two <hi>ſiſters</hi> in my way, of which one happens to be an old ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, but whom accident permitted to ſlip through my fingers <hi>unconquered,</hi> or, at leaſt, without beſtowing upon her victor the <hi>rewards</hi> of conqueſt, I muſt ſuit myſelf to the triple tie, that chance hath laid upon me, with as much adroitneſs as I am able. And <hi>this</hi> is the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy in my ſituation, to which, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this letter, I alluded.</p>
                  <p>One great part of my ſyſtem is, to make peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who are to give <hi>me</hi> happineſs, happy in themſelves. I muſt, to this end, take care to avoid making any of theſe dear creatures <hi>rivals</hi> to each other:—to <hi>boaſt</hi> of amours, thou knoweſt, is utterly repugnant to the STANHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PEAN principle. <hi>Preſs</hi> for the favour, <hi>read</hi> the <hi>eyes, ſix the heart,</hi> and revel over the <hi>yielded</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>ad eternitatem;</hi> but keep the joy to <hi>thyſelf;</hi> nor ever, with raſcal loquacity, betray the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity of her, whoſe indulgence has given thee the firſt of felicities.</p>

                  <p>No more, I pr'ythee, as to plurality of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
                  <p>The CHESTERFIELD ſyſtem admits not the fearful and filthy intercourſe of <hi>venal</hi> women. <hi>He</hi> could not allow the horrid and vulgar ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards of c—s and p—s.

                  </p>
                  <p>Hence, THORNTON, it is evident, that a man is juſtified (provided he keeps the ſecret) to ſearch the circle of the earth for thoſe favours, and elevated connexions, that bring along with them the honey without the ſting.

I ſipped too <hi>loud</hi> from the <hi>ſaucer,</hi> when it would, I find, have been <hi>genteeler</hi> to apply a <hi>ſilent</hi> lip to the <hi>cup.</hi> Nay, what is worſe than all this, I had the misfortune to fold the bread and butter <hi>inelegantly;</hi> and it would have been better there too, if I had put the <hi>end,</hi> rather than the <hi>ſide</hi> of it, to my mouth firſt.</p>
                  <p>But that which moſt aſtoniſhed me, was her objection to the good old cuſtom of <hi>turning down</hi> my cup, which ſhe ſaid was out of the TON, and that it would give her great pleaſure, if, in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I would lay the <hi>ſpoon acroſs</hi> the cup.</p>
                  <p>I was perfectly petrified, and yet <q>held my tongue, and ſpake nothing.</q>—She propoſed walking, and, as I really thought the air might do the poor creature's head good, I drew on my gloves, and attended her towards the well-walk.
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:016020_0059_0F9B2585A2E0BDD0"/>
—Alas! Doctor, nothing, I fear, can bring her about; for ſhe grew ten times worſe than ever, and if I was aſtoniſhed before, I was now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſtruck dead with the hugeneſs of my a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement.</p>
                  <p>I had not the happineſs to hit her fancy even in my walk, which ſhe very fairly told me, was <hi>ridiculous;</hi> and that I held up my head too high, turned <hi>in</hi> my toes too much, and wanted the <hi>Graces</hi> in my arms.</p>
                  <p>She actually made an objection to the <hi>manner</hi> in which my wig was powdered, ſaid it was all patches, and had not the regular ſprinkling of a man of faſhion.</p>
                  <p>Upon this, I ventured gently to tell her, that I was but a country curate, that I had no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions to <hi>faſhion</hi>—that I had, for my own part, nothing to do at a watering-place, but to oblige her—that I was very ſorry for the lof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs of my head, which, for the time to come, ſhould be carried with more humility—that, if it would give her any pleaſure, I would take care to ſtoop till I bent neck and ſhoulders to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether—that, as to inverſion of the toes, I would learn to dance, late in the day as it was for me, and inconſiſtent as ſuch a part might
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:016020_0060_0F9B258639AAAA30"/>
be thought to the clerical character—in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to my arms, that I had hitherto only uſed them in the ordinary offices of life, and found they performed very well for a plain man; but that, if ſhe had any favourite attitudes, or wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to exhibit in any poſtures to which ſhe was particularly partial, I would practice vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly at the looking-glaſs, and, rather than want the <hi>Graces</hi> ſhe ſpoke of, would abſolutely learn the exerciſe, and go through all the forms and ceremonies of legs, arms, head, and hands, like a young recruit. At the ſame time I beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged her to conſider that, as we had, ſicne the day of our union, lived harmoniouſly, I warmly hoped we ſhould not be put of tune by trifles, which are in themſelves inſignificant, even if we admitted them to be eſſential to the <hi>etiquette</hi> of a watering-place. I, moreover, told her to remember, that I was at leaſt a <hi>faithful</hi> huſband, and made her happineſs the ſtudy, practice, and contrivance, of my whole life; and that, ſurely, where the cardinal duties were obſerved, it mattered little, whether the toes were the breadth of a barley corn too much in or out, or the head half an inch too lofty, or half an inch too low. I would have proceeded in my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, but that my good friend Mr. SEDLEY at that inſtant came to my relief, told us, <hi>as he
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:016020_0061_0F9B2586FA00D8B0"/>
advanced with warmth, vivacity, and a chearful countenance, that, </hi>

                        <hi>if we did juſtice to his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to us, we might judge of the joy he felt in ſeeing us ſo frequently chooſe a private path, which was to him a certain indication of matrimonial felicity.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>There was ſomething ſo pretty in his ſpeech, that it made an impreſſion on my memory, and I have copied it <hi>verbatim.</hi> In leſs than half an hour Mrs. HOMESPUN recovered her reaſon; her late lunacy was never hinted at, and hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to continue her good-nature, I invited this moſt agreeable gentleman to take another bit of ſupper with us.</p>
                  <p>The manner in which he accepted the invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation trebled the ſenſe of the favour he did me by his company. What a gratification it is to have ſo ſenſible and entertaining a friend at a watering-place!</p>

                  <head>LETTER XXIV. SEDLEY to THORNTON.</head>
                  <p>A MAN, THORNTON, who is <hi>true</hi> to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh of pleaſure, can extract extacy even from diſappointment. The <hi>bliſs of bliſſes</hi> alone could have made me happier than I was an hour ago.</p>
                  <p>Hear the ſtory.</p>
                  <p>Since the firſt moment I caſt my eye upon the bewitching HARRIET, I marked her for my own; and <hi>ſhe</hi> hath ſince been the <hi>grand</hi> point of all my inſinuation and ingenuity. Not a ſingle article hath been neglected that could touch her imagination, move her heart, and catch her <hi>favourite weakneſſes.</hi> I paid court to her fancy, to her feelings, to her foibles. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant attendance hath done the buſineſs I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected it would, and I have but one effort more, to be maſter of <hi>all</hi> that the fineſt woman in the world has to beſtow.</p>
                  <p>Laſt night, my THORNTON, was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious period that yielded up every tranſport but <hi>the one.</hi> HORACE was requeſted to perform the funeral-ſervice over the corpſe of a fellow who died by a dropſy; (as the parſon of the
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:016020_0063_0F9B25888068A8F8"/>
pariſh was indiſpoſed;) and, it ſeems, he was to be buried at a town a mile diſtant from our lodgings.</p>
                  <p>He went.—The opportunity was not to be omitted. I exerted myſelf. I ſparkled in the luſtre of STANHOPEAN ſentiments—I became eloquent, and ſoon communicated a part of <hi>my</hi> ardour to the troubled boſom of HARRIET. I hit her, ſoft upon the heart. Our eyes met—<hi>they</hi> confirmed our <hi>ſentiments</hi>—our voices grew ſoft as the ſummer breezes—there was no intruder—I laid my cheek cloſe to hers—they were both upon the glow—for the firſt time in my life, I kiſſed her lips—I repeated the preſſure—ſhe repulſed me—I dropped upon my knee, and in that attitude repeated the offence—Nature was ſtirred to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt—I continued to ſuck the delicious poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and unawares ſhe returned the ſalutation. The dalliance was no longer to be borne; ſhe begged me, for God's ſake, to deſiſt. The fluſh of deſire and modeſty were at war in her cheek—her boſom palpitated—I plied her with my precious maxims in a whiſper, that gave them additional graces—I laid my hand upon her heart: the throb was violent; and, as I caught her eagerly in my arms, her head ſunk
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:016020_0064_0F9B258938915A90"/>
in unreſiſting ſoftneſs on my ſhoulder, and, worked to the extreme betwixt ſentiment and ſenſation, ſhe burſt into tears.</p>
                  <p>I compoſed her cheek—drew her handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief gently over her eye, fixed her again without offering to diſtreſs her, in her chair; and to this moment ſhe thinks I ſacrificed, to love, reſpect, delicacy, and friendſhip, a paſſion that is tearing me to pieces.</p>
                  <p>In a few minutes HOMESPUN returned; he is no reader of looks, and I took my leave for the night with that <hi>eaſy intrepid aſſurance,</hi> which belongs to the great character I have adopted.</p>
                  <p>And now, THORNTON, am I not a tolerable proficient in the ſcience of diſſimulation? Does any-thing come amiſs to me? Can I not <hi>aſſume with eaſe, and wear with chearfulneſs, every ſhape?</hi> Are not heat, cold, luxury, abſtinence, gravity, gaiety, ceremony, eaſineſs, learning, trifling, buſineſs, and pleaſure, modes which, according to my Preceptor's advice, I am able to take, lay aſide, or change occaſionally, with as much eaſe as I would take and lay aſide my hat.—But you may expect nobler illuſtrations of this hereafter. I am yet in the outſet of my adventures—ſporting (by way of trial) with
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:016020_0065_0F9B2589FA719028"/>
jejune experiments. The next time I can ſend THEE out of the way, HORACE HOMESPUN, beware! Thou haſt juſt eſcaped a fore evil. A little while ago, thou wert within an inch of cuckoldom.</p>

                  <p>SUCH a night as the laſt, I never paſſed. My poor wife has had a relapſe, Doctor. It returned at midnight upon her, and raged with the moſt frightful violence for above two hours. She is abſolutely delirious, and I am the moſt wretched of men.</p>
                  <p>About an hour after we were in bed, ſhe complained that there was no bearing the heat; though, in truth, this is one of the coldeſt places in England, and it had rained all the preceding evening. I felt her pulſe, and it was immoderately full, tumultuous, and rapid. I kiſſed her with all the tenderneſs of a ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiſing
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:016020_0066_0F9B258AB92D15C0"/>
huſband;—ſhe aſked me, how I could poſſibly be <hi>ſo cruel?</hi> I offered to lay her dear head upon my boſom, as upon the pillow of affection, judging that ſhe would be pleaſed with my aſſiduities. Her eyes were ſtreaming in tears—her face was on fire—the ſighs came from her, palpably againſt her conſent. I preſſed to know the cauſe of this; at leaſt, to what ſhe attributed it; and offered to throw on my cloaths, and procure a Doctor. Her cure, ſhe told me, was out of the reach of a Doctor; but that, if I would not ſuffer her to be quiet without fretting her by my officiouſneſs, ſhe ſhould be under the neceſſity of getting out of bed, and ſit till the morning in a chair. A little time after this, ſhe changed her manner, and with a kinder tone of the voice, aſked me, if I would conſent to return home as ſoon as it was light. She caught my hand, begged my pardon, wetted it with her tears, and begged I would excuſe her infirmity. I drew her, fond and cloſe to my heart; and I felt <hi>hers,</hi> at that moment, leap with agony. In the next mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhe requeſted me to leave her, covered herſelf haſtily head over ears with the bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloaths, and, ſaying that ſhe wiſhed I was wrapping her in the ſhroud, ſunk ſobbing upon her pillow. Oh! Doctor, what ſhall I do?
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:016020_0067_0F9B258B7AEB0200"/>
What can be the matter? I am really uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of offence. She is now in bed—per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, ſleep may alleviate her diſorder. The worſt of it is, ſhe will not allow me to ſpeak to any third perſon; and, as I myſelf know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of either maladies, or their proper medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, I am dreadfully alarmed, and tremble for the conſequence.</p>

                  <p>CERTAINLY, Mr. SEDLEY is the beſt young man in England. When he came to pay me the compliments of the morning, he found me in a very dejected ſituation; and though he was far from inquiſitive, yet I could not conceal from his aſking eye the nature of my calamity. Poor young Gentleman! it was evident that he <hi>felt</hi> for me: his countenance loſt, in a moment, all that fine glow that is natural to it; and, if my fancy does not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive

me, he had ſome difficulty to prevent a tear from ſtarting. He aſſured me, that words were never made to do juſtice to the feelings of wounded friendſhip; that he was more intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in every-thing that concerned me and my wife, than he could expreſs; and that, if I would ſuggeſt ſome little pretence, either of buſineſs or of invitation, to leave him with Mrs. HOMESPUN in the evening, he would certainly either comfort her by every miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſincereſt friendſhip, or, at worſt, he would find out the reaſons for her anxiety, and the nature of her complaint; after which, he very well obſerved, the remedy would be eaſy; At this generous propoſal, in which his worthy diſpoſition was manifeſt, I was ready to weep; and, as we embraced each other at parting, our voices became of no uſe to us, and we could only ſhew, by our ſympathiſing enfold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that we had a ſincere and Chriſtian regard for each other.</p>

                  <head>LETTER XXVII. Mrs. HOMESPUN to Mrs. LA MOTTE.</head>
                  <p>OH, CHARLOTTE! CHARLOTTE! what a perplexity am I thrown into, by this ſcheme of pleaſure! Accurſed be the hour in which I ſet my ſoot upon the confines of BUX<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON! Unconſcious of any violent partialities, I was contented while I was ignorant. In the dreary village, where our parſonage is a <hi>palace,</hi> I was ſufficiently happy, becauſe I ſaw nobody ſuperior to Mr. HOMESPUN. I was the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's lady, and the wives and daughters of the neighbourhood paid me the compliment of their beſt curtſey. My HORACE really looked handſome in his Sunday canonicals, and I viewed him in the pulpit with pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>But, alas! my CHARLOTTE, the ſcene is changed. I have been ſeveral days in a place of politeneſs, where HORACE is the moſt awkward of the circle. My eyes are now opened to his imperfections—I <hi>ſee</hi> them, I <hi>feel</hi> them, I <hi>deteſt</hi> them. He is a lump of learning, without ductility, without ſoftneſs, without—what Mr. SEDLEY calls, <hi>the Graces.</hi> I am ſometimes obliged to aſk ſeveral times before I can obtain an anſwer to the moſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:016020_0070_0F9B258DB893C7A8"/>
queſtion, and then, at laſt, he burſts from his reverie, and pretends not to have heard me ſpeak to him. Can any thing be ſo diſguſting? His converſation is unlike that of the reſt of the company; and, inſtead of bearing a part, in little, ſocial, and endearing <hi>chit-chat,</hi> he talks eternally about Locke, and Livy, and Cicero, the Elements of Criticiſm, the Prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lems of Euclid, and ſuch fellows—and many a time, when I have wanted him to put a pin in my handkerchief, or ſuch little offices of endearment, he has been wrapt up in medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and then ſtared me full in the face with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing I was in the room.</p>
                  <p>Then, he actually has a ſtrange ſhy manner of treating me as a wife. There is no delicacy in his air, when he takes my hand: he ſhakes it indeed HEARTILY, but then he has the fat fiſt of a graſier, even, though in other reſpects he is diſagreeably thin. He kiſſes, with a ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony perfectly claſſical, as Mr. SEDLEY calls it. There is a pretty method, methinks, even in the management of the lips. By <hi>accident,</hi> Mr. SEDLEY ſtole a kiſs the other day, and he placed it, ſo directly, ſo gently, and ſo patheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally in the <hi>center,</hi> that I never felt ſuch a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation! I proteſt, CHARLOTTE, it ran thrilling
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:016020_0071_0F9B258F4F641FE0"/>
through every vein of me, warmed my very heart, and almoſt took away my breath.</p>
                  <p>We were, I remember, playing at queſtions and commands, the day being ſhowery, ſo that we could not ſtir out. The forfeit came round at laſt to HORACE, and he ſmackt me, as uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, in his round-about manner. Heaven par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me, CHARLOTTE, but I was obliged to draw my pocket-handkerchief acroſs my mouth, and had ſome difficulty to avoid making a wry face. If you was once in the company of Mr. SEDLEY—he is called the <hi>handſome</hi> SEDLEY here—you would never forget—gentle, graceful, elegant, ſoft, genteel, and eloquent.—Heigho!—Why, CHARLOTTE, why did I marry, before I had ſeen ſomething of the world? Or, rather, Why, after I <hi>was</hi> married, why did I ever ſtray from carts and cottages, to the delightful dangers of a watering place?—But I muſt hide my letter; Mr. HOME<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SPUN is coming towards the houſe, as erect as a walking-ſtick.</p>

                  <p>FANNY is much diſordered, my dear LUCY; the fainting with which ſhe was ſeized at the breakfaſt-rooms, has preyed on her ever ſince. Her ſpirits are greatly agitated. Her huſband attends her, with the diligence of a nurſe, and cannot be perſuaded to leave her chamber. The poor girl often drops the tear of gratitude, but ſpeaks leſs than uſual, as, ſhe ſays, talking exhauſts her. She has twice hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her wiſhes to be removed from hence, either to my father's, or to SCARBOROUGH, as we thought proper: and begs her removal may be pretty late at night, for company, ſhe ſays, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſturbs her, ſicne her laſt accident. Poor MORTIMER, her huſband, ſees her dying by inches before his face, and his unavailing offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs appears now and then, to go too near the heart of the ſinking FANNY. She is too indiſpoſed to remove at preſent: for my part, I have not been able to ſet my foot yet in the ſtreet: I love my ſiſter too tenderly, to leave her with a ſtrange woman, in a ſtrange place, eſpecially with one, who is merely paid for her attention, and who, conſequently, can have none of thoſe charming thoughts that enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:016020_0073_0F9B2590BB505380"/>
to the heart of a tender relation. Sometimes, my dear, the changing a poſture, ſometimes he ſhifting a pillow, or fixing a chair, does more by the <hi>method</hi> of doing it, than all the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laborate efforts of an avowed nurſe. A Mr. SEDLEY—who is ſaid to be the beauty of the bath, and was the perſon that handed FANNY down ſtairs, and was very obliging during her illneſs,—ſends every day, very reſpectfully, to know how the ſick lady improves in her health. As many of both ſexes were witneſs to poor FANNY's diſtreſs, and as people <hi>ſhould</hi> have a fellow-feeling, in places of general re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort for cures, as well as faſhions, I wonder <hi>others</hi> have not paid this ſweet girl the ſame compliment.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>manner</hi> in which this gentleman makes the enquiry, is pretty: he does not preſume upon the privilege of a public place, and ſend a blundering foot-boy with a meſſage, nor does he come, intruding, <hi>himſelf,</hi> but he uſually writes a little billet, (every day varied, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a new turn,) in which his expreſſions diſcover at once accompliſhment and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breeding; and, what puts it out of any body's power to miſconſtrue it into deſign, he always addreſſes his cards to Mr. MORTIMER.—As my brother was reading one of theſe this
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:016020_0074_0F9B25917B5BF7F8"/>
morning to his wife, ſhe deſired to look at the hand, but had ſcarce held it to her eye, before ſhe dropt the paper, and, letting her arm fall languidly on the pillow, ſaid, very ſoftly, that ſhe could not manage it, and was weaker than ſhe imagined.</p>
                  <p>She is now in a gentle doſe, and I took the opportunity it gave, to inform my dear LUCY of our preſent melancholy ſituation. Sir HEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RY, and my mother are expected hourly. If FANNY really dies, my mother will certainly go diſtracted. Heaven bleſs you, and yours.</p>

ſtep is too apparent to be mentioned; you are very gay, very young, very inexperienced: there is but one way left to prevent your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and <hi>that</hi> is, to return home directly, and make any excuſe to HORACE for the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptneſs of your departure. I know nothing of the SEDLEY you mention, nor do I wiſh to know him. Better had it been, on all hands, if <hi>you</hi> were as ignorant of him as I am. It is plain he hath pleaſed you <hi>too well;</hi> ſince the pleaſure is bought at the dear price of hatred to the beſt of huſbands. Yes, HARRIET, your HORACE is the beſt of huſbands. He is an <hi>honeſt</hi> man, if he is not a <hi>brilliant</hi> man; and, if he does not ſhine in ſociety, he hath an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent heart, and a ſimplicity of manners, truly amiable. The little points of objection you have made, are, when weighed againſt his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious virtues, light, and of no account; while, on the other hand SEDLEY has, very probably, nothing but an <hi>elegance in trifling</hi> to ſet him off.</p>
                  <p>Waving, however, theſe points, my dear, let us come to others more ſtartling.

this inſtant to the door. The matter does not admit of a moment's debate. I haſten to ſeal up my letter, and I beg, for God's ſake, for your own ſake, and for that of all that <hi>love you,</hi> or that <hi>you love,</hi> that you will delvier your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer by word of mouth.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall catch you to my breaſt, as a dear friend, juſt eſcaped from a precipice,—as a treaſure I have luckily reſcued, in the minute of deſpair, from the ſurrounding flames. Adieu: Adieu. I enjoin you to be expeditious!</p>

                  <p>YOUR HARRIET is ſomething happier than when ſhe laſt ſat down to addreſs you. Mr. SEDLEY has pleaded the cauſe of poor HORACE ſo perſuaſively, and <hi>that</hi> behind his back, (there's a generous man for you!) that I have been induced to aſk his pardon, and I am reſolved to treat him with more politeneſs, which I find is indiſpenſible in the conduct of a married woman to her huſband, even though he were indifferent to her.</p>

                  <p>THE firſt blow is not yet finally given. Opportunity hath not ſufficiently favoured temptation. My ſyſtem, not only demands that I ſhould preſerve the charming fact, <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,</hi> but the reputation of both the man and the woman, <hi>unſuſpected.</hi> I am not to be a harum-ſcarum rake, who, brutiſhly as boyiſhly, boaſts of his ſucceſſes, but a poliſhed man of
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:016020_0078_0F9B25947924D478"/>
pleaſure; one, who is to bathe the ſenſes in bliſs, and revel in the richeſt luxuries of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with conſenting elegance <hi>under the roſe,</hi> while <hi>(in public)</hi> he is to ſuſtain a fair character, and <hi>paſs upon men</hi> (who only look upon the ſurface) as a pattern of purity, and a model for morals.</p>
                  <p>HARRIET is a bewitching, illiterate, ſweet piece of unpractiſed Nature. Her paſſions are ardent, and I have ſufficiently ſet them afloat; but I muſt take care to guard againſt working up <hi>my own</hi> paſſions. All the power of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering diſſimulation is over, when once DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIRE ſeizes the helm from the cautious hand of cool and deliberate REASON. <hi>"Vigour and ſpirit"</hi> are mere madneſſes, without <hi>verſatility</hi> and <hi>complacence.</hi> Upon this principle, I muſt walk without deviation, like a faithful pupil, in the path that is chalkt out for me. It is my buſineſs to <q>lead right reaſon in the trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant fetters and ſhackles of the heart and the paſſions.</q> In order to accompliſh this, THORNTON, I muſt keep <hi>myſelf</hi> collected, and never ſtrike, till I have fully thrown every body about me off <hi>their</hi> guard, and till I can, then, gratify, conquer, triumph, and enjoy in full ſecurity. My blood, THORNTON, ſhall

                  <p>I HAVE appeared in public. I dined this day at the ordinary. <hi>Ordinary</hi> indeed! ſuch a room full of emptineſs I never beheld: citizens apeing the men of mode, women of fallow countenances, and frippery fops, who would be thought witty and elegant, when they are merely ſaucy, dull, and affected. Alas! THORNTON, what a pity, what a mortification! I have not a ſingle competitor,—I mean not in point of <hi>gallantry,</hi> for that militates againſt my ſyſtem of pleaſure,—but, horrid to tell, there is no one of <hi>my</hi> ſex from whom I can gain any real honour in the compariſon. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, as even blockheads are worth gaining, and their hearts worth miſleading; as they have all foibles to flatter, and weakneſſes that may

be for our intereſt to work upon; I began to ſhew off, and brought the whole company over, as my admirers. I practiſed all the charming converſation rules of DORMER, with as much facility as if I had been their authors and, indeed, they are ſo ſuited to my own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſentiments, that I only conſider <hi>him</hi> as having <hi>written,</hi> what I long ago <hi>thought,</hi> and what, indeed, I will hence forward invariably practiſe, till I am incapable of further enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I had the happineſs to ſit parallel to the very fop, already recorded in my correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; and he was <hi>over-dreſſed</hi> to all the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance of the <hi>Ton;</hi> while <hi>I,</hi> had the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, of not in any ſort, invading the modeſty of Nature. The fool lookt as if he piqued himſelf upon his gaudineſs; he ſtroked his ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles, diſplayed the baubles of his watch, perkt up his head to gaze in the pier-glaſſes, pulled his decorated watch in and out of his fob ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times, eyed himſelf aſkance, and figited up and down in his chair, with all the <hi>inſignificant whiffling agility</hi> of the monkey in the fable, who had ſeen the world.</p>
                  <p>Cloſe to the ſide of this powdered popinjay, ſat an unwieldly animal, who, to the ill man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of a bear, united the uncouthneſs of an
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:016020_0081_0F9B2596B8E932D8"/>
elephant, without half its ſagacity; and who, in feeding, ſcattered his offals around, to the utter diſmay of the coxcomb, who, fearful of complaining, and alarmed at the ſize of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſt, took ſhelter at a ſmall table, or rather ſide-board, and fluttered himſelf clean, while the monſter enjoyed his embarraſſment. I am happy to tell thee, that, though this piece of pleaſantry ſet the unpoliſhed table in a roar, I commanded my features, and did not give way to ridicule. Hitherto I have <hi>never laught out</hi> ſince I came to BUXTON, and I ſolemnly hope (with the grace of THE Lord before my eyes) I ſhall never be booriſh, or boiſterous enough to laugh <hi>out</hi> again, while I have being.</p>
                  <p>Know, moreover, THORNTON, that I ate elegantly, and drank diſcreetly. I <hi>ſmiled</hi> at a thouſand <hi>dull</hi> ſtories, and only told <hi>one</hi> myſelf, and that inconceivably <hi>a-propos.</hi> I heard long talkers, without appearing to be tired, and I looked every perſon whom I addreſſed <hi>full in the face.</hi> I dreſſed my countenance in ſoftneſs, and gave the <hi>douceur</hi> to all my motions. I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted no man, contradicted cautiouſly, pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liated tenderly, decided a diſpute betwixt the fop and the glutton with a <hi>good-humoured plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantry,</hi> caught the habits of the company,
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:016020_0082_0F9B2597807B8130"/>
ſwore not at all, and adapted my converſation to every ſpeaker. The conſequence was, THORNTON, that I was immediately known to be <hi>ſomebody,</hi> and roſe in my conſequence till I was the admiration of <hi>every body:</hi> my company was cheriſhed, my abſence was regretted, and at my going out of the room, a buz of univerſal approbation—Oh the exquiſite murmur!—followed me down ſtairs. In a word, THORN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON, the fops were annihilated, the prattlers ſilenced; every creſt was fallen; and I went off in the compleateſt triumph of unconteſted ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance. SEDLEY—only SEDLEY was the burden of the ſong.</p>
                  <p>And thus, having ſettled my reputation, and eſtabliſhed myſelf PUBLICLY, it only remains that I enjoy my popularity by <hi>appearing</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it; and then I may bid defiance to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and then—WELCOME VOLUPTUOUSNESS!</p>

                  <p>RECEIVE, TIMOTHY, the greeting of THOMAS.</p>
                  <p>I, and my maſter—we never diſpute the point of precedence—arrived on the evening of the day we ſet out, at this execrable place, where I have, as yet, done little more than ſtick a pin in SEDLEY'S hair, and peruſe a page of his CHESTERFIELD after dinner.</p>
                  <p>Of theſe books we are, <hi>both,</hi> exceſſively fond, and, as he always leaves them in the chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>window—a little careleſs that,—I take them <hi>up</hi> when he lays them <hi>down;</hi> by which means, we make pretty nearly the ſame progreſs. If anything, I believe, I am half a volume before hand with him, and, in the opinion of the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious, am the finer gentleman of the two. But, you know, all men are not born with na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural genius alike.</p>
                  <p>Not that <hi>my</hi> maſter, like your common cox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combs, ever mentions his amours, or his ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, to his ſervant, any more than I diſcover mine to him; we are both <hi>better bred;</hi> but I
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:016020_0084_0F9B2598F8DBF438"/>
have heard too much of the charming CHES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TERFIELD, at table, at tea, and every where elſe, not to have had, long ago, a reliſh for his writings; and I ſcruple not to tell thee, TIMO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THY, that I have formed myſelf, <hi>what</hi> you now know me to be, entirely on his Lordſhip's model.</p>
                  <p>He had, beyond compariſon, the prettieſt pen, at an epiſtle, in Europe, and is at once ſo neat, ſo poliſhed, and ſo plain, that it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to miſunderſtand him. I once—with ſhame be it ſpoken,—was as vulgar a dog my choice of books and beauties, as any in the kingdom;—I had no more taſte, TIMOTHY, than thyſelf; no more <hi>Ton</hi> than a teacher of the table of multiplication. I thought—ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleton that I was—the luſcious love-<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                  <p>No, TIM. Stanhope has brought me round; he teaches, that "the very ſhoe has power to "wound;" and I am by God's grace, and his Lordſhip's graces, as gracefully graceleſs a raſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and as pretty a fellow, as any in Britain.</p>

                     <pb n="86" facs="unknown:016020_0085_0F9B2599B881AED8"/>
I expect, by the Earl's aſſiſtance, to do an <hi>infinite deal of miſchief</hi> at this watering-place;—my eye (though no ſettler) points at a bath-maid, who attracted me in the handing a tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler of Spa water. Nauſeous, as all minerals are, I took it, and toſt it off, without ſkrewing up a muſcle, becauſe, I find, to refuſe is <hi>ungen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teel.</hi> I ſhall ſubdue this damſel, at my leiſure, having, for my more ſerious <hi>ſimulations,</hi> as his Lordſhip calls them, a nobler object in view; of whom you will hear more explicitly in my next.</p>
                  <p>SEDLEY is upon ſome project, but as I ſcorn to be guilty of impertinent curioſity, ſo he is as much above making either a confident or a pimp of his ſervant (I ſhould with more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety have ſaid his <hi>gentleman)</hi> as his gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is of wearing a livery of worſted lace. God and the Graces ſpeed him in all his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings! Every man has a right in this world to follow the bent of his fancy, to <q>ſtrew the way over with flowers,</q> as the ſong ſays; aye, and to be as happy, both up and <hi>a-bed,</hi> as he poſſibly can.</p>

A young crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſcarce two-and-twenty, bred upon a barren mountain, little read in the ways of any part of the world, but the ways of a circumſcribed village—a farmer to your father, and an honeſt wholeſome dairy-woman for your mother—a little modicum of money to the tune of five hundred pounds, the ſavings of twenty pains<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking years of your poor grandam—and, and—to turn <hi>fine lady</hi> all of ſudden!—to trip to BUXTON bath, in the height of the ſeaſon, forget all your country friends, and country <hi>feelings</hi>—all in a <hi>week</hi>—a <hi>little</hi> week! Upon my honour, you are no common character, and I congratulate you on reconciling all this, to your capacious conſcience. Down to the very earth, I drop my curteſey, faſhionable Mrs. HOMESPUN!</p>
                  <p>But, gracious God! can it be poſſible? Is not the laſt letter, marked with your name, a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery? Can the character be Mrs. HOMESPUN'S? Can it be written by <hi>her,</hi> whom I have ſo often
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:016020_0090_0F9B259E4C490CD0"/>
diſtinguiſhed for innocence in the midſt of gaiety, and modeſty in the very boſom of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſement?</p>
                  <p>Is it practicable, in ſo ſhort a ſpace of time, to loſe all that's valuable, all that's feminine, all that's truly endearing; and to ſubſtitute the moſt deſpicable, deteſted contraries? Ah! HARRIET, HARRIET, how art thou fallen! Thoughtleſs, ingrateful creature! Poor HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RACE, what is become of him? If he is yet in ignorance, in mercy to his merit, <hi>keep</hi> him ſo: At leaſt, have the generoſity—the <hi>humanity,</hi> to keep from his knowledge, <hi>that,</hi> which would cut his honeſt heart to atoms.</p>
                  <p>But what is the BOOK you allude to, as the panacea, of a perſon polluted, and a heart ſet againſt the venerable maxims of morality? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las! Madam, be not every way deluded: nor books, nor tongues, nor caſuiſtry, nor all the chicane of eloquence miſapplied, can poſſibly overturn the ſober ſingle ſyſtem of unentangled innocency. I <hi>yet</hi> hope you are not in that wretched ſtate, which, deſpairing of forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, hunts about for apology, nor, rather than ſeem <hi>deſtitute,</hi> condeſcend to take up with one, that, in effect, plunges you deeper in crimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. A drowning creature catches at the ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt

twig: and a guilty woman is fain to ſupport herſelf from falling in her own eſteem, againſt a tottering pillar.</p>
                  <p>Books, HARRIET!—find a refuge from the keenneſs of your own reflections in BOOKS! Periſh the volume, and may the name of its author deſcend ignominiouſly to poſterity, in which the error that you have, under your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetic circumſtances, been guilty of, is not <hi>pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pably diſcountenanced!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mention, however, the name of that book from which you receive comfort, and, woman as I am, I will undertake to baffle its boaſted ſyſtem, and ſhew, that the only way to genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine pleaſure, is through the paths of purity, integrity, and ſingleneſs. I am, and have continued a widow five years upon principle: the man I have loſt, was even leſs ſplendid than Mr. HOMESPUN, nor had his perſon any peculiar attractions. What of that? He was good, he was great, and he was tender as Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. I wanted not temptation, while he was living, to indulge indelicacies, but I valued both his honour and my own; and though I pretend to no gifts of preternatural continency, I defy either <hi>books</hi> or <hi>men</hi> to make me act in diametrical oppoſition to common ſenſe and Chriſtianity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="93" facs="unknown:016020_0092_0F9B259FB8B6C898"/>
But, juſt at the preſent criſis, you are, of all women in the world, the moſt inexcuſeable! Oh, heavens! HARRIET, reflect a moment, More than three parts gone with child—<hi>that</hi> child your firſt-born—the father an honour to his profeſſion—his profeſſion the <hi>Church!</hi>—I will ſay no more, for if you had <hi>my</hi> heart, enough has been ſaid already to move you to add to your preſent errors, the crime of ſuicide.</p>

                  <p>ALL goes on to the utmoſt content of my heart. Oh, THORNTON! STANHOPE is infallible. His maxims are perfect anodynes againſt diſappointment, and I ſhall (I do really think) render him more celebrated than ever, by practically illuſtration every precept in every period!—I have played the ſecond part of the ſame tune with <hi>HARRIET,</hi> and I half believe I ſhall make her a proſelyte; for ſhe hath got <hi>volume the firſt,</hi> and I have taken care to pencil the places at which I would have her ſtop: a mark in the margin always attracts.

                  <p>I will give thee, however, an inſtance or two of my proficiency in the arts of pleaſing. When all was over, I paid my reſpects to HARRIET and her Lord, at the accuſtomed hour, without the leaſt viſible embarraſſment, or alteration of countenance. The poor wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, indeed, made but a bungling piece of work of it, bluſhed, ſtammered, and ſtopt ſhrot; while I took care to preſerve every muſcle and lineament ſteady and unmoved. I ſee the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of this moſt materially, for, had I not practiſed this preſence of mind, I do verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve even the unſagacious HOMESPUN would have ſuſpected what had happened. I took him by the hand, with the uſual cordiality, and we walked to FAIRFIELD, a neighbouring vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, (whither by the bye he was walking while the deed was doing) like inſeparable friends. So that there is, as thou perceiveſt, freſh reaſon for thy congratulation.</p>

                  <p>CURSE upon it, TIMOTHY! SEDLEY hath caught me in the fact—the very fact of conſulting his oracle. He came home acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally, when I thought him ſafe for at leaſt an hour, and I was juſt enjoying the ſweet ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent, and had delv'd into the pith and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of the dear Earl's epiſtle upon dreſs; when this indiſcreet maſter of mine, abſolutely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting his good-breeding, kicked me on the breech, took the book out of my hand, and led me down ſtairs by the noſe: for which, if I forgive him,</p>

                     <salute>Dear Doctor,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>THINGS are ſo pleaſingly altered, that I have been over-ruled as to my deſign of
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:016020_0097_0F9B25A379D79A18"/>
going away even at the end of the fortnight, and I have contrived to procure another week's receſs, in order to extend my HARRIET'S hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and enjoy myſelf the ſpirited, yet moral and engaging conduct of Mr. SEDLEY, who, every day, becomes more agreeable, and who, I do truly believe, has been not a little inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in bringing about my poor wife to a proper ſenſe of her duty and right reaſon. If any-thing, ſhe is more cordial to me than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my departure from the curacy, and is at once lively and obliging.</p>
                  <p>I take it for granted, the ſtrange conduct I tranſmitted you an account of in my late letters, was only a tranſient giddineſs, not very infre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, as I have obſerved. Doctor, to the fair ſex, about HARRIET'S age, which is very well called, in one of Shakeſpeare's tragedies that I read formerly, the "heyday of youthful blood." We grave folks, you know, my dear DIGGORY, ought to allow for all this. Poor thing, I pity her, and am half angry with myſelf that I ſhould have treated the overflowing, efferveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent emanations, as I may ſtile them, of a juve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nile mind, as a ſerious delirium.</p>
                  <p>But, thank God, it is not gone abroad to any perſon who is capable of circulating the whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:016020_0098_0F9B25A4399A98E8"/>
of the day to the detriment of a fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creature. Mr. SEDLEY, who, I can eaſily ſee, is to be truſted with every thing, and my old friend, and brother-collegian, Doctor DIGGO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RY, are the only perſons informed of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſo all is well. But do not, I charge you think too hardly of her for what hath been ſaid. It was all a miſrepreſentation, and you ſhould admire your heavenly HARRIET, as you uſed to call her, the <hi>more</hi> for having been <hi>injured.</hi> I can aſſure you, I am at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent more ſatiſfied with <hi>her</hi> than I am with <hi>myſelf:</hi> and, indeed, ſhe has the advantage of me; for ſhe appears in the light of a perſon <hi>calumniated,</hi> and I am only one in a ſtate of conſcious error, and <hi>probation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>However, a ſhort time will, I do not doubt, ſet us all as happy again as our hearts can wiſh.—But why, my worthy DIGGORY, do you not write: how is it that ſo ſcrupulous a man in point of equity is ſo unexact a correſpondent? You are deep in my debt, and though I am now rich in the ineſtimable treaſures of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, yet a line from you would add mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially to my fortune, and I ſhould have to thank Heaven for as full a meaſure of felicity, as it

few days longer at the bath, as a firſt inſtance of his repentance. In the raſhneſs of her heart, however, ſhe hath told all to a Mrs. LA MOTTE, who hath written a chiding epiſtle in the old ſcolding puritanical way; and to this I find, ſhe (HARRIET) hath replied (in the old way alſo) in juſtification of herſelf.

                  <p>THERE is nothing, ſaith my creed, <q>ſo delicate as a man's moral character, and nothing which it is ſo much his <hi>intereſt</hi> to preſerve pure.</q>—I have been at church, THORNTON, where HOMESPUN officiated as teacher. He hath a ſnuffle in his noſe; his voice is deſtitute of that harmonious variety, eſſential to all ſorts of eloquence; and his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of articulation appear conſiderably ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed.</p>

However, like a true Pupil of Pleaſure, I took him by the hand, upon his deſcending from the pulpit; returned him my ſincere thanks, in a well invented compliment, for the <hi>elegance</hi> of his diſcourſe; applauded his <hi>delivery;</hi> lamented that I had not <hi>often</hi> been made ſo happy; and almoſt brought the tears of <hi>virtuous vanity,</hi> into the good man's eyes, at the pathos of my concluſion.</p>

                  <p>"There is no living in the world," you know, THORNTON, <q>without a complaiſant indulgence for peoples weakneſſes.</q> In a ſhort time, I expect to reach the ſummit; for, after only an hour's practice, I found myſelf able to call out a palpable tear, only by placing a <hi>chair</hi> before my face, and, by the force of imagination, repreſenting <hi>it,</hi> poor thing! as a certain perſon in diſtreſs, which I had an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt</hi> in relieving.

<pb n="110" facs="unknown:016020_0109_0F9B28F6384AFED8"/>
week before laſt, I was the happieſt water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wench that ever dipt her glaſs in the well: all the <hi>qallety</hi> knew me, all the ladies loved me, and all the gentlemen quarrelled which ſhould drink firſt; but matters are now altered, and I am <hi>aſheamed</hi> to take my <hi>stand</hi> at the place, becauſe of the baſeneſs of your Honour's <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt</hi> Mr. THOMAS.</p>
                              <p>The arts he has uſed to tangle me, and take away my <hi>wartue,</hi> are monſtrous, and ſuch as would make the ſtouteſt <hi>ſhe</hi> in the country ſtumble. I am ſure, for my part, I ſtood it till I could ſtand it no longer. If your Honour will hear me out, and do me <hi>juſtis,</hi> ſeeing as my character is gone, and therewithal my wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and with that my bread, ſo that I have now neither bread <hi>nor</hi> water, I will unfold every thing, and let your Goodneſs ſee the affair from top to bottom.</p>
                              <p>Poor girl, ſit down, ſit down: I am ſorry for the loſs of your water, with all my heart, and ſhall very chearfully ſee as much of the affair as you think proper to ſhew me—Sit down, therefore, child, and ſhew away.</p>
                              <p>You muſt know, Sir, <hi>as how,</hi> when bathing and drinking the waters is over, and your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and ſuch-like fine folk are all buſy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancing;

we ſervant-people, ſometimes get to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to a <hi>leſſerrer</hi> room, and have a little hop of our own. This happened the very firſt night I ſaw Mr. THOMAS, who I obſerved, ſoon after he came into town, walk round the well, and then backwards and forwards; and to be ſure, there was ſomething in his putting his foot to the ground, taking it off again, ſwinging his arm, flouriſhing his ſwitch, and ſaluting the fellow-ſervants, that made him look a king to the reſt.</p>
                              <p>Well, Sir, he <hi>chus'd</hi> me for his partner; and, though I ſay it, I can ſhake a foot with my betters; nay, at a <hi>country</hi>-dance, I'll turn my back neither to gentle nor ſimple.</p>
                              <p>If your Honour had heard the <hi>highflyers</hi> he crammed my poor head with, all the while we were at it—the ſoft things he ſaid while we led out—the <hi>wows</hi> he made, as we handed up the middle—and the tender oaths and <hi>ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermuntadoes</hi> he ſwore, while we right and left<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handed it or caſt off, and joined hands again—while at the ſame time the muſic ſtruck up enough to melt one's heart—with candles lighted, and i' the ſummer-ſeaſon—your Honour would not blame me ſo much for giving away my ſoul and body to the moſt <hi>art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulleſt</hi> of his <hi>ſect.</hi>
                              </p>

In ſhort, Sir, he talkt me over ſo finely about <hi>this</hi> and <hi>that,</hi> that before I left the room, and we broke up, I did not know whether I ſtood upon my head or my heels.</p>
                              <p>After dancing was over, and Mr. THOMAS and I had made ourſelves all of a heat, or, as I remember <hi>he</hi> called it, all of an <hi>ardor,</hi> we took a walk in the grove by the hall, to cool our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And <hi>there</hi> he began to flouriſh it again—overpowered me with ſuch an ocean of love ſayings, and, in ſhort, talked ſo differently from my old ſweetheart ROGER DOUSIT, who is all dull and downright, as I may ſay, that I <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares</hi> to your Honour, he at laſt made me think it would be a ſin to refuſe him; and ſo—God forgive me!—and ſo—</p>

                  <p>Here the poor girl drew out her handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, and had ſincerely a very great occaſion for it.</p>
                  <p>She told me, in a tone, THORNTON, that touched me, that if, notwithſtanding what THOMAS ſaid, ſhe had been wicked, ſhe was a ruined woman, that was all—that it might do very well for <hi>gentlefolks</hi> to play falſe with one
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:016020_0112_0F9B28FAAE628300"/>
another, becauſe <hi>they</hi> had got <hi>wherewithal</hi> to waſh all white again; but that a black ſpot in a <hi>poor</hi> woman, who <hi>pended</hi> on her water—was never to be rubbed out:—that, moreover, the news had ſome-how got air, and ſhe was point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at by all the ill-natured fingers in the place. She ſaid, with aſtoniſhing ſimplicity, that the man fairly <hi>overſet</hi> her with his new-fangled <hi>gibberiſh</hi>—but that ſhe found 'twas all over with her. She added, that, for her own part, ſhe did not ſo much mind it, as ſhe could turn her hand to any thing, and would leave the town in a twinkle; but that ſhe had an old mother that had been bedridden theſe eight months, who lived at FAIRFIELD, and who muſt now want bread as well as herſelf. Nay, for that matter, ſaid the girl, ſhe'll ſoon be provided for, if ſhe hears of my ſlip, without troubling the pariſh; for I ſhall ſoon break her heart: I ſhall ſoon ſend my poor old mother out of the world; for ſhe is a <hi>good</hi> woman, Sir, and would ſooner bury me than ſee me what I am now. DOUSIT will turn up his noſe at me <hi>now;</hi> and without your Honour makes Mr. THOMAS do me <hi>juſtis,</hi> ſo as that I may become honeſt again, and do it in the lawful way,—God only knows what courſe I muſt take?</p>

                  <p>At this very moment THOMAS came in with a meſſage on which he had been diſpatched.</p>
                  <p>What is it, THORNTON, what curſed trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome thing is it, at once inviſible, and auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, that lodges in our boſoms beyond reach of our revenge, to make the ſtouteſt of us children and cowards?</p>
                  <p>Never did GARRICK exhibit, or SHAKE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SPEARE deſcribe, ſuch a look and attitude, as that of poor TOM at his entrance, on obſerving ſo unexpected an object.</p>
                  <p>He ſtammered, he ſtaggered, he turned white, and attempted to retreat.</p>
                  <p>I commanded him to ſtay; and, taking my ſword from the hook, gave him his choice, and one that might have puzzled a much wiſer man—either to die or marry. Fear operated even ſo ſtrong as to make him chuſe the latter.</p>
                  <p>He fell on his knees, and would have entered into explanations. I would not hear them.—The ceremony that HAMLET uſes with his
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:016020_0114_0F9B28FE6B0365F8"/>
quondam friends now paſſed between us, and I made them both ſwear upon my ſword.</p>
                  <p>I promiſed them a dower—the woman was in extacy, and paid me by ſuch a look of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, that, had REYNOLDS been there, he would have made the water-wench immortal by drawing it.</p>
                  <p>I am above altercation: of this THOMAS is aware. Nay, I believe he likes the girl.—They ſhall be united as ſoon as poſſible: and what the devil can be the reaſon that I am more happy in putting theſe two people toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than all the joys I ever taſted with the exquiſite and yielding HARRIET, I cannot tell.</p>
                  <p>Were it not that I have contrived, as uſual, to get HORACE out of the way, and that I never break an aſſignation, I ſhould certainly avoid ſeeing <hi>her,</hi> or any body <hi>elſe,</hi> this evening.—Is not this unaccountable? But <hi>ſo</hi> it is.</p>

                  <p>THE ſtory of thy bath-maid, though daſhed with double meanings, intereſted me ſtrangely; and I have felt the more pleaſure in giving it a tear, becauſe, I perceive, it hath penetrated even the almoſt invulnerable PHILIP SEDLEY.</p>
                  <p>But how thou art able to ſtand the ſhock of ſo many radiant eyes, and yielded charms,—wrapt round and round as thou art in the ely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſium of voluntary and voluptuous embraces—a young fellow of ſpirit too—is, to <hi>me,</hi> moſt unaccountably myſterious.—In defiance of all the cautionary precepts of thy divine DORMER—in defiance of all empiriciſm in gallantry, I ſhould certainly break out, and even at the riſque of overturning the whole well-woven web of intrigue, dwindle into a downright inamorato, and ſigh away ſubtle diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt ſimulation and laudable inſincerity. But thou art not a perfect Pupil of Pleaſure—Thou art but half converted.—Hadſt thou not the ſupreme of tranſport, in uniting the faithleſs footman to the beautiful bath-maid!</p>

                     <pb n="117" facs="unknown:016020_0116_0F9B28FF85BB9EF0"/>
I'll tell thee what, SEDLEY,—thou art—(if thou wilt allow me for once the coinage of a new word)—thou art but half CHESTER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FIELDIZ'D—The impreſſion made upon thee by the pale face of the conſcious THOMAS—the pleaſure thou haſt at wiping away the drops of penitence and perturbation from the cherry cheek of ſimplicity—and thy wiſhing to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liloquiſe, and be excuſed, even from the arms of the tempting and <hi>married</hi> HARRIET—are all ſymptoms totally <hi>unſtanhopean,</hi> (there's ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther word for thee.)</p>
                  <p>Take care, SEDLEY: thou art upon the eve of a relapſe—a relapſe in favour, not of DOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MER, but of a down-right DOUSIT'S ſingle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dealing.</p>
                  <p>And yet, my friend, ſhall I once again con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to you my infirmity—my uneſtabliſhment in the maxims of thy preceptor?—I cannot <hi>blame</hi> thy weakneſſes, nor can I—however deſtructive they may be to <hi>thy</hi> ſyſtem—avoid wiſhing thou mayſt <hi>continue</hi> thy preſent ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies, eſpecially as, by thy own honeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, thou haſt found more gratification in them, than in ſupporting the toilſome taſk of diſingenuity.</p>

<pb n="118" facs="unknown:016020_0117_0F9B2900C6309458"/>
If to be happy is the ultimatum of all earthly purſuits—if it is equally the effort of every different order of men, it aſſuredly follows, that <hi>that</hi> conduct is the moſt rational by which the greateſt ſhare of felicity is procured. The cloſeſt application of human wit and wiſdom can do no more than point out to thee the moſt ſolid degree of joy, and it matters not whether the joy is obtained by the practice of <hi>one</hi> ſyſtem or <hi>another.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The laſt action thou haſt recorded (I allude to the promiſed nuptials of thy bath-maid) was evidently agreeable to the ſentiments of SE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NECA, SOCRATES, and all the wiſe and good men both of the Eaſt and Weſt; and ſince the precepts of STANHOPE have been unable to give thee a ſuperior, or even an <hi>equal</hi> felicity, how proper and conſiſtent with right reaſon is it in me, to adviſe thee to walk in that path wherein thou haſt found the moſt pleaſure? Laugh not—ridicule not, I beſeech thee; thou art not, I hope, ſo much a tool to the taſte of the times—ſo much a dupe to prejudiced opinions—as to diſlike even the balance of bliſs which is now in thy favour, merely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſcale hath been turned by a worthy action—that would be inſanity.</p>

To love duplicity, and certain ſophiſtical di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions, merely for the ſake of double-deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and when plain, clear, clean, uncrooked honeſty will anſwer thy purpoſe much <hi>better,</hi> is at once ridiculous and diabolical.</p>
                  <p>On the whole, therefore, I adviſe thee, in the deliberation of my heart, to ſubſtitute the aforeſaid SENECA, or ſome other ſyſtematical moraliſt, inſtead of STANHOPE; and to lay <hi>him</hi> quickly aſide in a corner of thy trunk, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualified to confer the comfort he profeſſes to adminiſter.</p>
                  <p>And, indeed, SEDLEY, to open thy whole ſoul to thee, I muſt own to thee, that I very much ſuſpect his Lordſhip's ſentiments. Even in my occaſional dealings here in town, ſince thy departure, I have not been able to make them bear the teſt quite to my ſatisfaction; ſuch, eſpecially, as relate to the ſeduction of the tender ſex. I made a ſlight experiment, no longer ago than laſt night, of his moſt favourite maxim, namely, to taſte the joys of <hi>ſecurity,</hi> mingled in embraces; and yet, though I do not think I conducted myſelf unadroitly, it did not altogether anſwer the ſatisfaction he predicted to reſult from it.</p>
                  <p>Thou art not a ſtranger to the elegancies of
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:016020_0119_0F9B29024ADE5170"/>
SOPHIA VERNON, the new-married wife of the man whoſe promotion from enſign to lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant it was our joint endeavour, ſome time ago, to effect it: his gratitude is ſtill—<q>trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling alive all o'er;</q> and, by a natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, he is without the leaſt tincture of ſuſpicion, and eſteems every inſtance of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular enquiry after his wife, or friend, as a mark of generoſity in his benefactor.</p>
                  <p>This leaves the way to an intimacy with his SOPHIA fair and unobſtructed; and ſhe has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready caught ſo much of the Lieutenant's en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm, that ſhe pays me the tribute of a ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy-red bluſh of acknowledgment as often as I approach her. They have lately purchaſed a pretty cottage, amidſt the vernal beauties of SURRY: it is ſurrounded by gardens, not <hi>cittiſh,</hi> but genteel; there are no nudities, no mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous urns, no fantaſtical fountains, no chubby cherubims, no tip-toed Mercuries, ſmirking Venuſſes, nor ſpruce holly-hedges; 'tis all "true Nature to advantage dreſſed;" the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure is voluptuous, the flower-beds well weed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the ſhrubbery gratefully ſhaded, and the alcove ſmiles upon the Thames.</p>
                  <p>Within this alcove I yeſterday took the tea that was prepared by the hand of SOPHIA,
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:016020_0120_0F9B2902F6A0CD60"/>
whoſe huſband had invited me preſſingly; to make the ſolitude of his lady more ſocial by my company, as he was himſelf under the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of taking a journey into SUSSEX.</p>
                  <p>As you love brooks and books, hills and rills, my dear Mr. THORNTON, ſaid he, ſmilingly, you and SOPHY will be able to paſs away your time to your mutual ſatisfaction, till the return of your friend.</p>
                  <p>Poor unſuſpicious pair!</p>
                  <p>They united their entreaties, and prevailed: Lieutenant VERNON ſet out, and left to thy friend <hi>(in truſt)</hi> the moſt beautiful property upon the Thames. In a word, he began his journey in the fragrant coolneſs of yeſterday's evening, and I was left at full liberty to abuſe the confidence he placed in my integrity, and, in return for his hoſpitality, do my utmoſt to deſtroy the chaſtity of <hi>her,</hi> whom he doats upon with the ſincereſt tenderneſs.</p>
                  <p>The tear which ſhe dropt upon his hand as ſhe kiſſed it, at parting, drew from him <hi>another,</hi> accompanied by ſuch a look, as defies either tongue, pen, or pencil, and went at the time ſo cloſe to my heart, that I could not but imagine the paſſion betwixt two, was more exquiſite
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:016020_0121_0F9B2903AE508D58"/>
than if it were divided betwixt two-and-twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. One man and one woman, thought I, may certainly be happier than a Sultan; and I had rather poſſeſs the real, <hi>undiſſimulated</hi> love of a SOPHIA VERNON, than command the keys of the ſeraglio.</p>
                  <p>SOPHIA remained penſive, and ſighed after the travelling Lieutenant.</p>
                  <p>I examined the little library for a book to entertain her. CHESTERFIELD was there, but I did not think it a proper book to read, as I would wiſh to keep the maxims as far out of the ſight of a female as poſſible: for when a woman is <hi>told the ſecret</hi> of her ſeduction, ſhe will naturally be upon her guard againſt the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducer; and, really, STANHOPE unfolds the art with ſuch perſpicuity, that ſhe who runs may read; nay, even thy footman comprehends the whole ſyſtem, and hath, according to account, ruined his woman with a very <hi>tolerable addreſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By the bye, SEDLEY, I have to accuſe thee of two weak pieces of conduct. The firſt is, thy raſhneſs in truſting the epiſtles of thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptor to the flighty HARRIET, who might have heedleſsly ſhewn them to HORACE, by which means (as thou art a very ſtriking com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary upon the chapters of CHESTERFIELD)
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:016020_0122_0F9B2906E5D6AD10"/>
he would have had a clue to the original ſources of thy preſent conduct; and a detection of this kind would have been totally inſupportable. Thy other fault is, thy careleſſneſs, and, I might ſay, want of policy, in expoſing the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes which thou ſo pretendeſt to venerate, to the plebeian eyes of thy <hi>valet.</hi> Lock them up, I pray thee, for the time to come; and if thou art reſolved to proceed in reducing them to practice, do it <hi>privately.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In regard to SOPHIA, my endeavours to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert her thoughts <hi>from</hi> the beloved ſubject of their contemplation, were in vain: the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant mingled in every idea, and ſhe had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, ſighs, ſentiments, and ſenſations, only for Mr. VERNON. I recited to her an elegy from HAMMOND, and ſhe wept, in the ſincerity of her heart, over images ſo amiable, and ſo ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to thoſe now ſuggeſted by her <hi>own</hi> ſituation. I wiſhed to divert her, by reading to her the oddities of corporal <hi>Trim,</hi> and uncle <hi>Toby;</hi> but ſhe was in no diſpoſition to be delighted with the whimſical ſtrokes of a fine but irregular wit. I even adverted to the irreſiſtible ſallies of HARRY FIELDING, and diſplayed to her the maſter-piece of narrative, in the laughable ſcene of Parſon ADAMS purſued by the hounds and hunters. She was proof even againſt this, and
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:016020_0123_0F9B2909737E2CB8"/>
afforded it only a faint ſmile. She then tried what a walk in the garden would do: ſhe cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſed the colours of the tulips, and deſcanted with moral delicacy on the pleaſing progreſs of vegetable Nature; but, alas! even here a ſigh would break in upon her remark, and very e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently convince me, that Pope was not ſo ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantic in the paſtoral ſentiment, which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, <q>Abſence is ſurely death to thoſe who love.</q> In ſhort, SEDLEY, whatever might be the temptation before me, and however aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiduous I was to gratify it, it was not now the moment to begin the attack; and every thing I ſaid, only ſerved to ſhew me more plainly, that, if I would wiſh to pleaſe her, it muſt be by warmly talking of a man, whom it was my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to wean from her affections. Perceiving this, I gave way to ſympathy, and moſt cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally united <hi>my</hi> tears to <hi>hers,</hi> and joined in the moſt animated encomiums on her happy Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant. Theſe tears, however, SEDLEY, and thoſe praiſes, gave me a ſoothing ſoftneſs not to be deſcribed, and made me feel a thouſand times more agreeable than while I repreſſed them, in the hope of turning my thoughts to the huſband's diſhonour, and the wife's deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Is not this, SEDLEY, a parallel caſe to that of thine? If thou wert more happy at
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:016020_0124_0F9B290AD30D1340"/>
doing a <hi>juſt</hi> action to thy bath-maid, than an <hi>unjuſt</hi> one, by <hi>undoing</hi> the lively HARRIET; I am more happy at having conquered an incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which would have tormented my own fancy, tortured a "generous, truſting friend," and agonized the boſom of a woman, whoſe reputation is at preſent unſuſpected, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polluted.</p>
                  <p>Hence then, my dear SEDLEY, it appears, that we are now both exulting in the triumph of a ſimilar ſenſation—a ſenſation created by the ſocial virtues, and derived purely from the felicity of others. Upon this ſubject I have but one point to obſerve: it is, to <hi>continue</hi> the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph. Let us even cheriſh a tranſport, which is ſuperior to any that diſſimulation can give: let us throw away the perplexing maſk of the caſuiſtical CHESTERFIELD: let us walk in the <hi>right</hi> way: and, ſince it hath already <hi>rewarded</hi> us ſo well, let us prefer truth to falſhood, and honeſty to hypocriſy: for, believe me, my dear, dear SEDLEY, under whatever name we may diſtinguiſh vice and virtue, they remain eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally the ſame; and neither ſophiſtry, nor ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlety, nor faſhion, nor the ſanctified follies of the mode, can poſſibly palliate the atrociouſneſs of the one, or detract from the native excellence of the other. PENMEN may puzzle, PHILOSO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHERS
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:016020_0125_0F9B290B4428D1C0"/>
may refine, POETS may colour, and viſionaries may ſuggeſt as they pleaſe, but, while the traces of Nature remain, virtue will be fair, and vice deformed; and, in my opinion, that man's maxims are extremely contradictory and fallible, who, in the <hi>ſame volume,</hi> nay, ſometimes in the <hi>ſame epiſtle,</hi> inculcates a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate regard to <hi>moral</hi> character, and an attack upon thoſe human <hi>weakneſſes,</hi> from the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouring of which (aſſiſted by a proper mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of well applied flattery) we are to prey upon each other, to prepare ourſelves for deceit, and, if the ſyſtem were general, introduce, by theſe means, even while we ſanctify the moſt dangerous deluſions. For my part, SEDLEY, I tell thee again, and again, that I find a flaw in thy STANPHOPE, and ſhall read him, for the future, with the eye of a ſevere critic, and not an idolater—not a PHILIP SEDLEY.</p>

                  <head>LETTER LIII. SEDLEY to THORNTON.</head>
                  <head>(Prior to his Receipt of the laſt Letter.)</head>
                  <p>THE ceremony has been performed. I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on its being done in the face of the congregation: I gave THOMAS a purſe for his wedding dinner, and ſo the poor wench is again made a mighty honeſt woman.</p>
                  <p>Never heard I panegyrics more warm, or <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter circulated</hi> than thoſe reverberated from lip to lip upon this occaſion; and I could almoſt bleſs the fellow for a debauch, that hath added ſuch luſtre to my character. I am the very heroic ballad of the bath; and the negligence, which I <hi>ſeem</hi> to pay to the praiſes, only ſerves to encreaſe, and make me appear more deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them. But what a ſimpleton I was, to yield to the baby ſenſation which ſeized me, unawares, in my laſt. To do good is, indeed <hi>pleaſing,</hi> and I will on that principle <hi>continue</hi> to do it, as occaſion invites; but is there not an higher motive, thou wilt ſay, than this? Is there not religion? Pſhaw!—</p>
                  <p>Yes, pious THORNTON, there <hi>is</hi> a higher motive. I am determined to do as much good
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:016020_0127_0F9B290CB81F7E20"/>
as is neceſſary. It flatters the ſenſes, it gratifies vanity, it procures <hi>eclat,</hi> it promotes conqueſt, it extends our triumph over a ſex that was born for our amuſement.—The trifling action juſt recorded, backed by a few more that I have not patience to recite, hath made me ſo popular amongſt all ranks of people in this village, from my Lady in her bathing-ſhift, to her tawdry attendants of the towel, that defy any-thing but my own folly, to mark me down an object of ſuſpicion.</p>
                  <p>I have eſtabliſhed my reputation, THORN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON, upon the ſolid baſis of <hi>virtuous actions;</hi> I have decorated the ſuperſtructure, with the graces of conduct; and now, no man will <hi>dare</hi> to imagine this goodly edifice is but a <hi>whitened</hi> ſepulchre. If he doth, men, women, and children, ſhall defend me. Poſſibly thou mayſt imagine, that I have earned my pleaſures by <hi>difficult</hi> adoption of the STANHOPEAN ſyſtem. No, THORNTON, I have a taſte for them. I do not <q>inflict exceſſes upon myſelf, becauſe I think them genteel,</q> but I find theſe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits "guard me againſt frivolouſneſs," and prevent me <q>from throwing away upon tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles, that time, which only important things, deſerve.</q> In a word, I tell thee once more,
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:016020_0128_0F9B290DF9CC3FD8"/>
I view the Lord of my idolatry only as a man earlier ſkilled than myſelf, in the arts of being <hi>truly</hi> and triumphantly happy: and in this light he deſerves my everlaſting gratitude; for he hath taught me <q>to make every place I go to, the ſcene of quick and lively tranſports; to let every company I frequent, gratify my <hi>paſſions;</hi> to know the true value of time; and to ſnatch, to ſeize, and to <hi>enjoy,</hi> every moment.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of this enough: the remainder of my letter ſhall be dedicated to the delicious purpoſe of recording ſeveral events, which have fallen out, by the joint effort of deſtiny and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, ſince my laſt.</p>
                  <p>I have had a ſecond glance at the delicate but decaying features of FANNY. Tempted by the chearfulneſs of the morning, ſhe ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured, under the ſupporting arms of a huſband, and ſiſter,—fair, fragile creature,—to walk from her lodgings to the bathing-houſe. She ſaw me, but drew away her eye, and never di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected it towards me again. Her huſband bowed to me, as to the polite ſtranger, who had intereſted himſelf ſo in the welfare of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved: the ſiſter inclined her head, and curt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey'd <hi>more</hi> than civilly—it was the bend, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:016020_0129_0F9B290E354EAAE0"/>
of attention, than ceremony. It was, altogether, a ſhort, ſoft, ſilent ſcene, fit for a Deity to behold. But it was interrupted; for at this moment, many a lank-haired ſwain, yet humid with the bath, and a cluſter of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ſtill glowing from the immerſion, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in view. They were inſtantly attracted by the paſſing meteor, gazed, envied, and went on. Well, indeed, <hi>might</hi> they gaze—well might they envy, THORNTON: the roſe again emulates the lilly, in her cheek: the blue is like the blue of the elements: her arm, is ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated alabaſter; and the hand, to which it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs, is ſhaped, by the Divinity of woman, to <hi>inſpire,</hi> by its appearance, and ENFEVER by its touch.</p>
                  <p>[I defy Dictionaries, and will create words when I think proper—I ſay again—<hi>enfever.</hi>]</p>
                  <p>After this, as ſhe was preparing to return, a ſervant came haſtily to inform Mr. MORTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MER, that Sir HENRY DELMORE was arrived. They quickened their pace a little; the nerves of ſurpriſe were ſhaken; FANNY attempted to ſtep briſkly; but failed in the effort. The good Baronet, impatient, and eager to behold his children, came forward in his boots to meet them. They met. My heart bounded—I know not the reaſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="131" facs="unknown:016020_0130_0F9B290F12CCF918"/>
Oh, THORNTON, what a figure is the Knight! how noble!—how venerable!—how fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhionable!—But, alas! all ſurprizes, even thoſe of the moſt pleaſing kind, are too much for the feeble ſituation of FANNY. Her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſoon ſaw her confuſion, ſoftened it by a paternal kiſs, and aſſiſted in conducting her gently to her lodgings. In ſomething leſs than an hour, I received the incloſed; which is the luckieſt incident in the world to me, and which, by the time this reaches you, I hope to improve to <hi>ſome pleaſurable purpoſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Liſten, now, to ill-luck—HARRIET HOMESPUN is fonder of me, and better bred to Horace than ever. She has a wonderful apti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to learn, and will in time be, no doubt, a female STANHOPE. Yet ſhe muſt not be too fond—Paſſion, <hi>over-much,</hi> is treacherous. But what a lucky thing it is for us, that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race hath ſo great an appetite for a long walk by himſelf after dinner! and how infinitely <hi>is</hi> he, and indeed <hi>ought</hi> he to be, obliged to me, for adminiſtering ſo much conſolation to his wife in his abſence! But—I am determined to do all the <hi>good</hi> I poſſibly can.</p>
                  <p>Surely, THORNTON, there is nothing ſo

                  <p>But how ceremonious was it, Mr. SEDLEY, that you ſhould all this while have eſtranged yourſelf, and appeared only in the light of a perſon intereſted in the fate of the ſick, but not

complains of her ankle, and ſays the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of it is now got higher than her knee; and ſhe is, therefore, reſolved to undergo the operation of pumping upon the part affected, by which means I ſhall be obliged to leave her behind, or elſe bring her away much againſt her own choice; which, notwithſtanding my want of faith as to the knee and ankle, I do not think myſelf entitled to do, ſeeing that ſhe hath demeaned herſelf moſt cordially.—The fact is, ſhe is quite in love with the frivolous pleaſures of this puerile place, in which, were it not for the inſtructive and entertaining con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations of my friend SEDLEY, I ſhould not be able to ſupport its cuſtoms. As my wife, however, ſeems reſolved, I have thought of an expedient to ſupply my abſence for a few days longer. HARRIET hath a friend in our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood—a Mrs. LA MOTTE—who is a very diſcreet, ſenſible, and judicious widow-woman, and who, I am perſuaded, will not only do me the ſervice of paſſing a few days at the bath, but likewiſe urge all the arguments of which ſhe is miſtreſs, to wean the affections of her friend from this circle of vanity, and reduce her once more to the ſtandard of common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe, and the ſerene pleaſures of a country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>village.</p>

I want your council, my dear Doctor, on the following ſubject. Mr. SEDLEY has applied in my favour to the Biſhop of—, reſpecting the living of—, which is worth neat 2001. Per annum. Mr. SEDLEY is in hourly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of a reply to this, and I am already ſo overwhelmed with the kindneſſes of this worthy gentleman, (who hath done them in a manner peculiar to his character) that I am in doubt whether I ought to increaſe a debt it will be ever beyond my ability to diſcharge. HAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIET'S little fortunes, united to the profits of my curacy, are ſufficient to the purpoſes of a contented mind. My parſonage, you know, Doctor, is in the very boſom of a beautiful wood, through which I have been accuſtomed to ramble with a ſocial claſſic in my hand; my pariſhioners love me; the little garden is of my own cultivation; I turned the arch, and twiſted the woodbines around my bower with my own fingers; the birds are protected, and neſt with me in perfect ſecurity; and if I could but once make HARRIET in love with it again, I believe I ſhould not quit it without a ſigh. But one circumſtance weighs with me. I have the dear proſpect of a ſucceſſor: to <hi>it</hi> I owe an intereſt I ſhould not feel for myſelf. HARRIET is very far advanced in her pregnancy. A child, my

dear friend, enlarges the wiſhes of a father; a tear is ready to fall on my letter, as I <hi>think</hi> upon the increaſe of my family. To his off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring a man owes every thing.—Tell me, then, dear DIGGORY, what I muſt do.</p>

                  <p>THE plot begins to thicken, and the cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrophe only demands good contrivance to be made delightful. HORACE HOMESPUN goes away from the bath to-day, in order to mount the roſtrum, and preach up the good old cauſe to-morrow; HARRIET will be all this evening with me alone, left wholly to my kindneſs; and, to crown the whole, the ſcheme is at laſt laid to bring the haughty-hearted LA MOTTE within the reach of my machinations. If there needs any further addition to theſe fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licities, know, THORNTON, that I am hand and glove with Sir HENRY DELMORE, and hand and <hi>heart,</hi> I ſhall ſoon be, with FANNY MOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIMER; the enchanting DELIA looks not with

                  <p>WHAT an additional degree of happineſs do I feel, ſince I laſt wrote to my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Lady LUCY! My father is arrived, my ſiſter is recovering, and we are become ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with a man whoſe company is at once pleaſing, inſtructive, and various. The very gentleman, my dear LUCY, who hath ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:016020_0137_0F9B291434BFA598"/>
ſent his polite cards of enquiry con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning FANNY, proves to be a man of birth, rank, and character, and well known both to Sir HENRY, and Mr. MORTIMER, when they were laſt ſeaſon at the bath of SCARBOROUGH. He is the moſt well bred and complaiſant cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter in the world, and has, at the firſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view, all the eaſe, firmneſs, and unembarraſſed air of an old acquaintance. The aſſured, yet modeſt manner with which he preſents himſelf to a company, ſhews plainly that he has been long accuſtomed to faſhionable ſocieties, and would charm you. If FANNY continues to recover, we ſhall be once more a joyful family—my mother is alſo down with us.</p>
                  <p>We have taken part of a very elegant houſe, only a ſhort ride from the company, about three miles diſtant from BUXTON, and it ſtands upon a ſpot infinitely leſs bleak and barren than the uncomfortable looking mountains that ſurround the bath. I received the welcome epiſtle, dear LUCY, in which you enjoin me to fill up the interval of abſence, in a correſpondence of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, wit, ſentiment, and affection; but does not my fair friend forget that the requiſites to form and to continue ſuch an intercourſe, are not at the command of every ſcribbler, though the partiality of nature, and the poliſh of high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breeding,
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:016020_0138_0F9B2915755EB458"/>
may confer them on herſelf? How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſince you are ſo earneſt with me, I will pour out my ſoul imperfectly upon paper; and though I may be wanting in point of elegance or accuracy, the deficiencies will be compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſated by a frankneſs of mind, and an undiſguiſe of ſentiment, that will pay a better compliment to my LUCY'S candour, than all that could poſſibly be beſtowed by the flowers of rhetoric, or colourings of the imagination.</p>
                  <p>I the more readily yield to your urgencies, my LUCY, as my pen, at this period, can only be the intelligencer of a felicity at once virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and endearing.</p>
                  <p>It is ſaid, indeed, that mankind have always ſome fantaſtical and viſionary ſcheme in view. I declare to you, Lady SAXBY, that the perfect reſtoration of FANNY'S health is the only drop that could now be added to the cup of our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic joy. Judge yourſelf! for the viſible al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of Mrs. MORTIMER for the better, hath put me into ſuch ſpirits, that I cannot reſtrain my gratitude to the dear perſonage by which thoſe ſpirits are inſpired. Take then, my beloved LUCY, the ſketch of a family<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picture, drawn (and yet not partially) by the pencil of a relation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="140" facs="unknown:016020_0139_0F9B2915E306EB40"/>
The firſt, and principal figure in this group is, a father, whoſe mind is the repoſitory of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very virtue—a repoſitory in which he has been, from hour to hour in the career of almoſt threeſcore years, laying up ſomething valuable, till he hath at length ſtored it with every ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence; with all, LUCY, that can give worth to the huſband, ſoftneſs to the parent, ſolidity to the friend, benevolence to the neighbour, and humanity to the man: to which is added, a univerſal attention to the wants and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, the fortunes, and morals of that prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious body of men to which he is related only by ſameneſs of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> and the conſcious ties of the chriſtian and fellow-creature.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond leading object in the piece is a mother, the model of her huſband; and differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only, by adapting the manly virtues to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy more conſiſtent with the refinement and gentleneſs of the female character, and nature.</p>
                  <p>The third figure, to which I would direct your obſervation, is, the ſtill lovely FANNY MORTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MER,—a woman whom even the depredations of four lingering months, paſſed in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guors of ſickneſs, have not rendered unat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting. To a ſpirit at once wiſe and worthy, ſhe ſuperadds the fineſt politeneſs, gentleneſs uncommon, and meekneſs peculiar to her: and
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:016020_0140_0F9B291888854A28"/>
to theſe, again, are joined a taſte elegant and ſimple—an underſtanding enlarged and culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated,—and a face, in defiance of diſtemper, in which Heaven ſeems to have painted an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute in every feature: her eyes ſparkles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity, her lips are the temples of truth, her cheeks are the emblems of modeſty veiled in roſes, and her hands were formed by the Graces to the beſt of purpoſes—to charm, by their liberality, the wretched into peace, and to be (conſiſtently with their colour) the pure and beautiful ſtewards of a heart tender as a tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle's, yet ſolid as a ſage's.</p>
                  <p>The huſband of this enchanting creature, is the brother of Lady SAXBY, the very counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part of his ſiſter, and the very youth whom Sir HENRY DELMORE adopted as the child of his affection, undertook for ſeveral years the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of his education, ſupplied the loſs of a father, trained him up for his own, and at laſt gave him, all-accompliſhed, to the only wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that could deſerve him—his <hi>daughter.</hi> His character is recorded in moſt of the Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean courts; and it is but a mere reverberation of a familiar echo for <hi>me</hi> to ſay, that he has been every where diſtinguiſhed, for bravery without raſhneſs, honour without anceſtral
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:016020_0141_0F9B2918AF250FB0"/>
pride, elegance without vanity, affection with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out intereſtedneſs, and generoſity without o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtentation.</p>
                  <p>Such, LUCY, are the outlines of a picture now under the eye of your friend. Your ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, however, and FANNY's uncertain ſtate of health, are the two dark clouds that overcaſt my otherwiſe radiant horizon.</p>
                  <p>In ſome meaſure, however, to atone for theſe indiſpenſible draw backs, I can now promiſe an often-repeated intercourſe, in which, through the kind medium of the poſt, our pleaſures, with thoſe of our families, ſhall be reciprocated—But—in the name of extravagance, where am I a rambling—and what a metaphorical rhapſody am I going to ſend?

The DELMORES are removed at ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from BUXTON, by which means, I ſhall be able to prevent oppoſite intereſts from claſhing with each other.</p>
                  <p>I prithee, THORNTON, mark my policy, to which I have, even at the age of thirty, ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed my <hi>paſſion</hi>—paſſion which is equally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of pleaſure and buſineſs—I have put myſelf in training, and am as temperate as a ſaint—You ſhall judge. Knowing the little fugitive ſcandals and whiſpers of a watering<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place, I practiſed upon myſelf the STAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HOPEAN ſelf-denial, and have not been a ſingle minute <hi>alone</hi> with HARRIET ſince the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of HORACE. To prevent this I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive to call in, either the loquacious landlord, or chattering landlady; and have only converſed in their own way, upon topics, which, though important at the moment, are yet too trivial to ſend <hi>thee</hi> one hundred and ſixty miles: they anſwered very well my purpoſe—I ſay well: for ſtrange as it may ſeem to thee, I hold it not good policy, or right reaſon, nor conſonant to CHESTERFIELDISM, to have <hi>tete-a-tetes</hi> with a wife, when the huſband is known to have left the town; nor am I—mark the ſtroke—very well pleaſed with the incautious HAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIET,

for ſuffering herſelf to be deſerted, and expoſed to the report, and <hi>murder</hi> of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In theſe places detraction is a <hi>neceſſary</hi> filler-up of the vacuum;</p>

                  <p>The death of reputation is the death of my ſort of gallantry. I would not be thought a libertine, either in thought, word, or deed, for the univerſe. 'Tis expreſsly, and flagrantly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my SYSTEM, which places, thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, the very perfection of human nature, and the height of human abilities, in "being upon our <hi>own</hi> guard, and yet, by a <hi>ſeeming</hi> natural openneſs, to put people <hi>off theirs.</hi>" Oh, exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, exquiſite arguer!—"A ſecond DANIEL, THORNTON; a ſecond DANIEL!"</p>
                  <p>Now, in caſes of amour, it is, in conformity to this principle, abſolutely neceſſary, that, a huſband ſhould be upon the premiſes, though not upon the ſpot; otherwiſe there is no poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of avoiding myſtery; beware of that: myſtery occaſions ſuſpicion, ſuſpicion opens a door to detection, and detection ruins me for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.

                  <p>Theſe little effuſions that burſt ſpontaneouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the ſoul, thou muſt pardon, THORN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON: they are the fiats of the God—But I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend again to the mortal correſpondent.</p>
                  <p>I perceive the adroiteſt practice of the ſeveral points ſuggeſted by the matchleſs DORMER, will be ſhortly neceſſary; for never did I enter ſo ſagacious, or ſo uniformly amiable a family as that of the DELMORES. I muſt muſter all my forces. The whole family is a <hi>fortification</hi> againſt a Pupil of Pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>The principal of it (Sir HENRY) is ſo acute, ſo adorned, ſo read, and ſo experienced, that <hi>he</hi> muſt, I perceive, be deceived with a delicacy beyond the deceptions of Belial: and much wonder I opened not myſelf to his penetrating diſcovery when at SCARBOROUGH; at a time too, when I was a novice in the ways of STANHOPE, and could not be ſuppoſed to <hi>copy him liberally.</hi> But, my good genius preſerved

me, and I engaged, even in the nonage of my experiments, the hand of the father, while I ſtruck hard upon the tender heart of his daughter!</p>
                  <p>Lay down the paper a moment to bow in reverence to my greatneſs! Doſt thou not ſhrink in the compariſon? To proceed—There's a formidable huſband too in my way—no HORACE HOMESPUN—but a man of travel, experience, taſte,—a ſecond ſiſter too—the lively DELIA—a wit, a correſponder, a perfect pen-woman; ready, rapid, an aſker of whys and wherefores: and to cloſe the liſt, a venerable matron—wiſe—virtuous—ſedato—penetrating—the lady preſident of this bewitching aſſociation.</p>
                  <p>All theſe are in battle array againſt me—my ſingle ſelf—formidable PHALANX! Give me joy! If they are not verſed (as I <hi>believe</hi> they are not) in my maxims, I may be a match for all them; paſs like a meteor, through this difficult hemiſphere—kindle as I go—and dread no radiant competitor. But if thou falleſt, SED<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEY? Inſolent interrupter!—<hi>If</hi> I fall—What of that? Admitting the poſſibility—it will be like a fall from Heaven.

ſurvive detection—ſhould not bluſh to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge me in elyſium. Oblivion to your Ifs, for ever!</p>
                  <p>As to HARRIET—the affair is over: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is left even for the exerciſe of my talents: the precept by which I obtained her, has been <hi>ſucceſsful</hi> in practice: all that remains, is ITE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RATION. Paſſion hath not a ſingle provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, to keep the pulſe a-beating. Her fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs grows luxuriant, and ſhe may betray me. She muſt be checked. To confeſs the truth, THORNTON—I am indifferent to her, and I wiſh HORACE had her, locked in his arms to eternity, with all my ſoul.</p>
                  <p>Am not I the moſt generous man exiſting?</p>
                  <p>At all events, ſhe muſt not entertain ſuch ardent expectations—for—I am ſummoned <hi>elſewhere</hi>—a ſcene of greater difficulty, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er delicacy, and, therefore, of greater delight, expands itſelf before me.—The half-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered—half-expiring FANNY MORTIMER, who muſt not deſcend, unenjoyed by SEDLEY, to the earth—The worm, THORNTON, muſt not be ſuffered to riot in her beauties: 'twould be a pity—a profanation! The exquiſite and vivacious DELIA, alſo, attracts my notice. I
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:016020_0148_0F9B2921482C5C88"/>
am called to the combat—a combat, where the laurels will be trebly precious, ſince I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive they muſt be earned with all the artillery of manner, addreſs, aſſurance, and CHESTER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FIELDISM.</p>
                  <p>Every nerve muſt be exerted!</p>
                  <p>In purſuance of theſe objects, however, I ſhall probably, be often ſo animated as to <hi>wiſh</hi> enjoyments, that, it may be impolitic, to puſh <hi>too far:</hi> every thing is ripe for the <hi>coup de grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In ſuch exigencies, it is difficult to keep the tight rein in my hand: the warmth of imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,—that enemy to all political decorum,—and an acquaintance with objects, and ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, calculated to ſet it on fire, ſeem inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with the neceſſary coolneſs, collection, and command of one's temper. To provide, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, againſt theſe moments of ardour, I ſhall, if LA MOTTE comes down, retain the ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured HARRIET in my ſuit, as the agreeable <hi>reſource</hi> from agitations into which, it is likely, I ſhall be thrown by the charms, delays, or delicious impediments, of the DELMORES.</p>
                  <p>Poſſibly, too, ſomething may fall out to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce LA MOTTE, which, be her perſonal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments what they may, is deſirable; becauſe
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:016020_0149_0F9B292222A59548"/>
ſhe is <hi>prepared</hi> to ſuſpect my principles, and, therefore, will engage my more ſerious atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, till ſhe ſhall have little reaſon to ridicule; or laugh at her friend. That woman is worth ſubduing, THORNTON, though ſhe were a JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ZEBEL. Thy friend is an admirable leveller. I hate pride.</p>
                  <p>But, on the other hand, if this LA MOTTE does <hi>not</hi> move, at the injunction of HORACE, nor at the pretended penitence of the letter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loving HARRIET; and, by thoſe means, HAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIET ſhould be left to <hi>herſelf,</hi> ſhe muſt abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely return to the boſom of the poor pedant, and I will aſſuredly ſacrifice the poſſeſſion of her perſon, to the unblemiſhed ſecurity of <hi>my</hi> character, which, I am aware, muſt inevitably ſuffer, by being avowedly the ciciſbeo of a wife, little diſtinguiſhed amongſt the bathers and bibbers of faſhion.

all intents and purpoſes, requiſite, for the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of my SYSTEM, that there ſhould be ſome third perſon in a family, by the way of ſcreen; and rather than have our miſtreſſes alone, that is, <hi>unprotected</hi> by ſome oſtenſible he, or ſhe, that may be, or <hi>appear</hi> to be, anſwerable for them in the pariſh where they viſit, or where they reſide, it is better for <hi>our</hi> plan of action, that we be ſheltered, under the withered wing of a maiden couſin of a century's ſtanding, or even of the great grandmother herſelf.</p>
                  <p>And now, THORNTON, for a word or two on thy <hi>own</hi> affairs. If thou haſt not, by this time, ſurmounted the ticklings of thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and taken poſſeſſion of that tender te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement, which thy friend the Lieutenant left to thee, then deſerveſt thou to be for ever diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carded. A coward in love!—Oh, abomin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able!—Retrieve thyſelf, I charge thee!</p>
                  <p>What! Haſt thou an angel in "earth's mould?" Is ſhe in a wilderneſs of ſweets? Art thou invited by a bed of roſes? Art thou neither in fear of being blaſted by detection, nor of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring the prattle of a ſingle goſſip of either ſex, (ſeeing that thou art in a retirement per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſhaded by a ſhrubbery of perſumes, and apart from a ſecond houſe) and is the good
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:016020_0151_0F9B29234C67F6E0"/>
man of the houſe gone a long journey into a far country?—Is all this in the way of propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiating thy advances, maſked, as I preſume they would, or at leaſt as they ought to be, in the fine veil of modeſty, manner, and firmneſs, <hi>each</hi> (like co-partners, whoſe intereſt it is, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote common right in the ſame buſineſs) aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting the <hi>other?</hi> and doſt thou, after all, boggle at a ſhadow—a maukin—at conſcience?</p>
                  <p>Admitting even all thy wiſhes crowned with ſucceſs?—where's the miſchief? Thou doſt not deſpoil her: the Lieutenant is ignorant of what is granted, as of what was never attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The STANHOPE ſcheme of fruition ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers us not to do any <hi>real</hi> injury to individuals <hi>ſingly,</hi> or to the community collectively; (note me nicely, for I am about to argue) we are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to betray the wife, nor brand the huſband as the cuckold we have had the pleaſure to make him; we are not to breathe an accent that may lead to the remoteſt ſuſpicion. In ſome caſes, THORNTON, this ſyſtem is of the utmoſt ſervice (under the STANHOPEAN re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions, I mean) both to our King and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Doſt thou ſtart? Oh, ſhort of ſight! Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blind, puſillanimous JAMES!—Proceed to the proof—'Tis at the end of my pen.</p>

How many puny ſtriplings are there who cannot do the common rights of nuptial juſtice to the unhappy creatures whom either intereſt, or folly, or both, have chained them to, for life? In thoſe inſtances, it is <hi>ours</hi> to beſtow as a <hi>favour,</hi> what the huſbands cannot diſcharge as a <hi>duty.</hi> There is one illuſtration.</p>
                  <p>On the other hand, how many miſerable pairs are there, ſighing for an heir to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wieldy eſtate, which eſtate muſt, in default of iſſue, devolve to the next fool or driveller in deſcent? There, again, <hi>we</hi> are patriots of the firſt order: We provide a ſucceſſor, and create a being to inherit all the luxuries of life. It is beyond diſpute, CHESTERFIELDISM makes a man not more an ornamental, than a ſupporting pillar to his country.</p>
                  <p>Nay, even ſuppoſing the huſband enabled to provide for <hi>himſelf:</hi> while our ſyſtem dictates ſo inviolable a <hi>ſecrecy,</hi> while the joys of it are not invaded by <hi>diſtemper</hi> (and they can never be granted without the prior conſent of the wife—mark that—and ſuch conſent implies ſuch variety neceſſary to her happineſs)—no injury can, in effect, be incurred. His <hi>own</hi> offspring we cannot deſtroy; and <hi>ours</hi> will be conſidered as legitimate; he will have the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,

we ſhall have the pleaſure, and they, pretty ſouls, will not be expoſed, like the by blows of the rake, to the ſcorn, deſertion and ill-fortunes of baſtardy. So that, view the ſyſtem of our exquiſite Earl on which ſide ſoever you will, it is a ſyſtem of policy, prudence, pleaſure, good-fellowſhip, and right reaſon.</p>
                  <p>Art thou either poor-ſpirited or obſtinate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to cavil, or heſitate, another moment?</p>
                  <p>Great length of paper, and much time, have I ſtolen from more agreeable purſuits, to illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate this to thee—and if it move thee not, thou art altogether impenetrable, and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving ſo ſublime a friend as the <hi>immaculate</hi>

                  <p>I AM ſorry to refuſe the worthy Mr. Home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpun (who hath, I perceive, been obliged to return without his wife) a requeſt, which I very plainly ſee was made to me in the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his heart.</p>
                  <p>You do me but juſtice in ſuppoſing that I will keep your unhappy ſecret, as you very properly call it; for it is no ſmall infelicity to make a ſecret of any ſort neceſſary to the fame of a woman, and the peace of a whole family, whoſe connections would all be diſhonoured by a <hi>diſcloſure.</hi>
                  </p>

As far, therefore, as my ſilence can contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to your domeſtic tranquillity, you may depend upon me; though I cannot but think, ſhe who hath confidence enough to abuſe her huſband, ſhould have policy enough to conceal the particulars of her crime from a confidant; and I know not whether the very knowledge of ſuch circumſtances, is not an inſult to her virtue.</p>
                  <p>Your poor huſband gave us, yeſterday, as uſual, an admirable diſcourſe. There was in it ſome ſoftening ſentiments relating to the pure pleaſures of married felicity, which I could not but imagine were ſuggeſted by his own ſituation: he loves you, <hi>Harriet,</hi> moſt fondly, and I could not avoid giving to ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which I connected with certain others, the tribute of a tender tear. All the pariſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and eſpecially the talkative part of them, expreſs their aſtoniſhment, ſome by whiſpers, others by winks, and <hi>all</hi> by looks, or other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive geſtures, that Mrs. <hi>Homeſpun</hi> ſhould continue where ſhe has neither relations nor acquaintances. It is eaſy to ſee that Mr. <hi>Home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpun</hi> is the only unſuſpicious perſon in the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage; while <hi>he,</hi> wrapt up in the integrity of his ſoul, and guarded by his good opinion of
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:016020_0157_0F9B292B31248160"/>
                     <hi>you,</hi> ſuppoſes you will ſoon regret his abſence, and return to him.</p>
                  <p>After ſervice he drank tea with me, and with tears in his eyes, firſt urged my going to <hi>Bux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton;</hi> then, (finding my refuſal eſtabliſhed) beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged I ſhould, at leaſt, try the effect of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties to invite you back: he even went ſo far as to hint, with all a <hi>father's</hi> glow upon his cheek, at the little neceſſary preparations againſt the day in which you are expected to preſent him with a teſtimoy of your truth and tenderneſs. There are various maternal cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſaid he, you know, my dear Mrs. <hi>La Motte,</hi> to be taken in ſuch intereſting ſituations; and, perhaps, the conſtant buſtles of that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering place, may for a while, lull to ſleep, or rather agitate her into forgetfulneſs of thoſe cares that generally alarm the provident appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of <hi>her,</hi> who is in a <hi>very</hi> few weeks to be a mother.</p>
                  <p>The painting was too powerful. I roſe to conceal my ſympathy, he preſſed me by the hand, in viſible diſorder, and proteſting that he left his fate to my management, ſaluted me, in his honeſt way, and went to perform the laſt offices to a poor woman, <hi>(Alice Weldon)</hi> who
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:016020_0158_0F9B292B6E201B00"/>
died laſt Wedneſday in child-bed of the babe, <hi>whoſe father is not yet acknowledged.</hi> I told your huſband, <hi>Harriet,</hi> I would exert my pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, without telling him that I had long loſt my influence.</p>
                  <p>As you were not touched by <hi>my</hi> former let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, particularly <hi>one</hi> of them, I deſpair of mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you by the preſent, having no new argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to offer: nor ſhould I, indeed, have troubled you at all, but that I did it, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance to your much injured, and my ever eſteemed friend, Mr. <hi>Homeſpun,</hi> whom I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, chiefly, for the very ſimplicity, to which you made an objection. By the ardour with which he ſpeaks of that Mr. <hi>Sedley,</hi> upon all occaſions, I perceive you have not been ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by a novice, and yet, I cannot poſſibly imagine how he has contrived to make the huſband his friend, at the <hi>very</hi> time that he has betrayed the wife into the thorny paths of perſonal impurity. Be this at it may, he muſt be a very artful creature, and, excluſive of my not going into the ſame lodging with the polluted <hi>Harriet,</hi> I do not chooſe to lay myſelf liable to the inſult of being even the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule of a man, who, doubtleſs, <hi>aſperſes,</hi> even more than he <hi>deſtroys.</hi>

It may not, however, be amiſs to obſerve, in concluſion, that, if your return to this place is not ſpeedy, it will probably be attended with conſequences, for which no after-penitence can poſſibly atone.</p>

                  <p>MR. <hi>Homeſpun</hi> is extremely ill, and much diſtreſſed by your refuſal to return. I have turned the affair in my mind, and I ſee, if you come on receipt of this letter, very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably excuſes may yet be made, and all may be again happy.</p>
                  <p>You are ſtill dear to me, <hi>Harriet;</hi> I wiſh for nothing ſo warmly as to embrace you, and to go with you to our accuſtomed walk in the meadow, oppoſite your paradiſe of a cottage. I miſs you more and more every day, every hour. Come then, my dear, name the time,

                  <head>LETTER LXII. Miſs Delia Delmore to Lady Lucy Saxby.</head>
                  <p>FANNY is not worſe, and therefore my ſpirits, which always riſe and fall with the pains and pleaſures of my friends, are equal to the delightful taſk of correſponding with my dear Lady <hi>Lucy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In my laſt I only ſlightly, and in general terms, mentioned the patrons of my happineſs: let me now be more particular. My father has formed himſelf by ſuch a ſtandard, that his excellencies have a dignity peculiar to the dignity of his manners. He hath ever thought proper to include the friendly in the paternal character; and he inculcates, even to the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt domeſtics, a certain ſenſe of independency; a principle, he ſays, neceſſary to be maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed even amongſt the loweſt, and from which branches forth a thouſand virtues. In ſociety, ſays Sir <hi>Henry,</hi> ſubordination is certainly indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſible, according to the preſent ſyſtem; but then, it ſhould be conſidered, that the balance, of human affairs is oftener, if not always, much more level than <hi>we</hi> imagine. If <hi>we</hi> feed the poor, their labour accommodates <hi>us:</hi> if we
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:016020_0163_0F9B292F33120920"/>
pay them for their toil, to that <hi>very</hi> toil we are indebted for all the ſoftneſſes of proſperity: if we provide them with a defence againſt the ſeverity of ſeaſons, and a chamber ſo the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of repoſe, (after they have wearied out their vigour in <hi>our</hi> ſervice,) let it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered, that, in gratitude for our attention, to them we owe every thing which diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es riches from poverty: under their hands proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per the delicacies of the garden, and the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the field, the decorations of the manſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the table of plenty, the robe of luxury, and the bed of down.</p>
                  <p>Actuated by motives ſo ſingularly noble, Sir <hi>Henry,</hi> at a proper criſis, makes each of his children, in ſome ſort, independent, that is, my dear, he allots to each of us ſuch a ſhare of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune in our own hands as is ſufficient to the diſplay and ſhew-off of the natural diſpoſition. He eſteems it neceſſary to know the operation of the temper, when it has power to play; this, ſays he, is not to be known by the common mode of contracting, but of extending; it is impoſſible to diſcover any natural propenſity, until opportunity gives liberty to all the little paſſions of the ſtripling, and indulgence gives way to unſhackled inclination.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="12" facs="unknown:016020_0164_0F9B29301FC56858"/>
Educated under ſuch advantages, and the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner poliſhes of the ſchool given by a father ſo venerable and ſuperior; the youthful indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant will not turn to his honours, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious depoſit entruſted to him, to abuſe; and, if he does, even then there are many ways which Sir <hi>Henry</hi> has diſcovered to turn his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viating conduct into the proper channel. From kindneſs like this, Lady <hi>Lucy,</hi> we are enabled to do nameleſs occaſional little ſervices for the unfortunate; and by ſuch means learn, early, to form ourſelves into habits of ſympathy and tenderneſs of heart. I do not, ſaid he, put gold into your purſes, children, like ſome parents, who promiſe to double the ſum, if you ſhew it unbroken and undiminiſhed, at a future period: I do not give it you to board up like miſers, nor to diſſipate like little ſpendthrifts; but I give it you on purpoſe to change into ſmall ſilver; it is my deſire that you ſhould taſte ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the firſt of pleaſures: look about you: it is a world of miſery, as well as impoſition: mark your object to the beſt of your abilities, be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as little as poſſible, and double your trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure by decreaſing it; ſix-penny worth of ſilver may gain ſixty moments of fair reflection: for the banquet at ſo cheap a rate, provided to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, the bread and water of gratitude, take
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:016020_0165_0F9B2930AE273368"/>
in exchange the richer feaſt of a kind heart: and in this caſe, my dear children, which is the greateſt gainer? If you muſt be uſurers, put your money out to ſuch intereſt; be ambitious of laying it wiſely out in the purchaſe of virtue, and I will ſupply you chearfully with the means.</p>
                  <p>We were all walking, <hi>Lucy,</hi> the other morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by the ſide of the bath, when a ſhort, bold, ſturdy fellow accoſted us for charity. We looked at Sir <hi>Henry</hi> for our cue: Come along, children, ſaid he, that man is both impudent and able. As we paſſed by, the fellow drew up his mouth, and ſhaking a little dirty bag that he drew from his pouch, gingled it over his head, and triumphantly ſnapt his fingers. When we were at ſome diſtance: Take care, dea children, of ſuch impoſtors: beſtow not the moment you are ſupplicated: try the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the petitioner: he whom indigence, and the ſtrokes of ill fortune, have not at leaſt <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliated,</hi> is not <hi>yet</hi> an object of your generoſity. As we were going to our carriage, a decayed veteran, in tattered regimentals, reduced to the knees by the perils of his profeſſion, was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to ſweep our way with his hat: little <hi>Charles</hi> ran, without the leaſt heſitation,

                  <p>It is another happineſs peculiar to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat of Sir <hi>Henry Delmore,</hi> that none of its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents are fired by the envy of oppoſition, or the meanneſſes of jealouſy: ſo far the reverſe of this, that one is ſtudious to compliment the other on ſome excellence freſh acquired, or more perfected: ſome diſplay of the heart, newly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, or ſome additional grace of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that blooms in the bluſh, ſparkles in the eye, or dimples in the ſmile.</p>

I am truly glad to hear Mrs. <hi>Mortimer</hi> is likely to recover, and that you have found ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat as is agreeable to your family, contigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the bath.</p>
                  <p>Ah! Miſs <hi>Delmore,</hi> what pictures have you drawn, happy friend, enviable <hi>Delia!</hi> and yet,

ſtill, methinks, is there wanting one article, one principal figure, to compleat your fine and high-coloured family-piece. Why, my dear girl, ſo forgetful of yourſelf? Great, as are your preſent felicities, I am perſuaded they admit addition. There is a paſſion, my <hi>Delia,</hi> that gives the laſt fine finiſh to the bliſs of an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent life: it is the animator of every other hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; and I am ſurprized that a heart ſo gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle as Miſs <hi>Delmore's</hi> ſhould ſo long remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed of it. The pleaſures of a pure and mutual paſſion would not be unworthy her attention.</p>
                  <p>Amongſt the various characters in your train of ſlaves, <hi>Delia,</hi> is there not one can attract you? Hard-hearted girl, how ſhall we contrive to captivate you? Surely, you terrify the tribe of humble ſervants! A modern lover, who has ſtudied only his rotine of rhapſody, and who depends on the repetition and arrangement of a certain number of warm words, his flames and fires, hearts and darts, thrills and hills, groves and loves, Cupids and ſtupids, had no ſort of chance; but when he has run the changes and chimes, till he can do nothing but ring them over again, he is quite at a ſtand, can go no further, and is loſt in his own abſurdity, feels

feels his own inſignificance, and makes his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous exit. Will you, however, <hi>never</hi> be caught?</p>
                  <p>If the rocks of <hi>Buxton</hi> are too barren, pray haſten to your <hi>Worceſterſhire</hi> paradiſe: your gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens there, the ancient ſeat of the <hi>Delmores,</hi> contain everything auſpicious to the <hi>belle paſſion.</hi> You have thickets of roſes, which may furniſh your ſighers with ſimilies, and abundance of bowers, where Cupid may repoſe on violets: you have beds of primroſes to entertain the Silphids, velvet verdure for the dancing fairies, and lucid water, wherein Venus may bathe herſelf in brooks. But I am miſtaken, if you now need this poetical Arcadia. <hi>Buxton</hi> rocks have their beauties, pray, my dear, let me hear more of this gentleman of birth, rank and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, this diſtinguiſhed he, whoſe converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is ſo pleaſing, inſtructive, and various: who, at firſt ſight, hath all the eaſe, firmneſs, and unembarraſſed air of an old acquaintance, and who preſents himſelf ſo engaging to a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny!

                  <p>BY ſome means or other, I have caught, as I think it is, a cold, and that has produced a fever; ſo that I am obliged (and that muſt

excuſe the badneſs of it) to write this as I ſit up in my bed, that bed, my dear, of which an equal part is your property. Though I am not, God be thanked, ill enough to alarm you, yet I cannot but believe your valuable ſociety would materially accelerate my return to health and contribute to my re-eſtabliſhment. Mrs. <hi>La Motte,</hi> who always ſpeaks of you with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable tenderneſs, has been prevented, as ſhe ſays, on account of a ſore throat, from being with you; and therefore as your company here would be quite a cordial, and as <hi>Buxton</hi> is not, perhaps, the proper place to be in, without a relation, (even though that tie is almoſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by the civilities of Mr. <hi>Sedley,</hi> to which worthy gentleman pray tender my hearty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects) I could wiſh you would ſet off as ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after your receipt of this, as can be made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient. But I conjure you, nevertheleſs, not to put yourſelf into any hurries, and by all means come in a poſt-chaiſe, and by eaſy ſtages; and charge the driver to go eaſily, and pray reward him for his care. Never mind the coſt of the journey: conſider your preſent delicate ſituation, and all the charming hopes, (part of which now bring the water into my eyes) depending upon it. Therefore come leiſurely, and it is very likely, as I don't in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge

fretting under every ſlight affliction, you may find me conſiderably amended on your ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival at our little retreat, which, though I am juſt at preſent, not able to enjoy it, is, me thinks, prettier this ſummer than I imagined it would be: for all the woodbines I have planted have thriven wonderfully; the laylocks, particularly the purple ones, are leafy and bloſſomed moſt luxuriantly; and, what I eſteem an addition, an innocent little wren has, even in this, the firſt ſeaſon of my reſidence, built her neſt in the very center of my arbour, between two honeyſuckles. I declare I would protect the poor thing, and preſerve to it all the rights of hoſpitality and good faith, even at the hazard of my life.</p>

But, to come to the point, <hi>Thornton,</hi> I am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt at the end of my wits. <hi>Horace Homeſpun</hi> pines for his abſent mate. Mrs. <hi>La Motte</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes to come down: and urges <hi>Harriet</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, upon peril of inſtant diſcovery. This very hour did I ſee ſuch a packet as aſtoniſhed even <hi>me,</hi> who am not ſtartled at trifles. <hi>La Motte</hi> has written with the pen of a <hi>Sappho,</hi> dipt in the ink of <hi>Juvenal.</hi> Such aſperity, ſuch acumen, ſuch a ſting in the tail of every ſentence! <hi>Horace,</hi> too, hath written; written, <hi>Thornton,</hi> though bed-ridden, full of endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, full of care, full of the huſband. I call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in upon <hi>Harriet,</hi> in the very criſis of my fate; ſhe had the whole packet ſpread upon the table before her, and had juſt put the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing to an epiſtle that would have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely ruined me for ever, had it been ſent. I caught it from her with the eagerneſs of a lion, and I encloſe it for thy inſpection, that thou may'ſt judge of my ſituation, which is not at all amended by <hi>Harriet's</hi> violent declaration of ungovernable paſſion and wiſh to live with me for ever. Oh! that women could learn like me, to gratify the paſſion of the hour, and think no more of it: but there is no ſeducing a woman into pleaſure, but ſhe is ſo curſedly ungrateful, as to hug the ſeducer for ever after,

without any regard to time or to place. I have dined too at <hi>Delmore's,</hi> and thrice caught the eye of <hi>Fanny.</hi> By my ſoul, the old fire is yet alive in her. I ſee it will only be neceſſary to nurſe the embers, and add freſh fuel. How the duce came ſhe to marry? and how is it, that being married, ſhe does not admire her huſband, who is one of the fineſt figures in the creation!

                  <p>I HAVE with infinite pleaſure obeyed the injunctions ſuggeſted by Mrs. <hi>La Motte,</hi> in hinting to Mrs. <hi>Homeſpun</hi> your anxiety for her return. She heard me with great patience, and very readily conſented to go to a huſband, whom ſhe ſo tenderly eſteems. I deſign to ſee her properly provided with a chaiſe, and every thing neceſſary to the delicacy of her ſituation; and I moſt heartily pray for your returning health. I hope you will forgive my having ſent your lady, my fair, charge, home, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out my attending her; but you will reflect on
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:016020_0181_0F9B294395B6E238"/>
the world's aptitude to aſperſe and cenſure, and on that account, forgive: for the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, I have adviſed Mrs. <hi>Homeſpun</hi> to go in the middle of the day, that even a colour might not be given to the ready tongue of detraction. Though Mrs. <hi>Homeſpun</hi> will be with you in a few hours after this, I could not forbear antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating your felicity, though it ſhould even be but for a moment.</p>

                  <p>CRUEL <hi>Sedley,</hi> how could'ſt thou treat me ſo harſhly? But I will neither quit urging to thee the ſubject of Virtue, nor paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thee the horrors of Vice; nor will I bring my epiſtolary correſpondence to a period. What! have I myſelf eſcaped from the ſnare, and ſhall I ſee the foot of a friend ready to be entrapped, yet not endeavour to reſcue him! Forbid it, fidelity; forbid it, honour! Yes, <hi>Sedley,</hi> I muſt continue to love, and will perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in admoniſhing thee; for, in earneſt repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, I declare to thee, that <hi>Cheſterfield</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

to purchaſe the delightful and ſoothing pleaſures reſulting from <hi>my</hi> preſent and new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adopted ſyſtem, which I am not aſhamed to tell thee, (although it is repugnant to thine) is borrowed from the Scriptures: it runs thus, <hi>Sedley:</hi> 
                     <q>Do, as thou would'ſt wiſh others ſhould do unto thee,</q> This is moſt palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the ſentiment of true policy as well as true honeſty; and I am every day more and more perſuaded, that nothing but this will, in the end, prevail. There is a moment, my dear, diſſipated <hi>Sedley,</hi> in which, though thou wert to wear the maſk of a forty years ſucceſs, thou muſt per force lay it aſide, and appear in all the nakedneſs of Nature. And can there, I aſk thee, can there poſſibly be a more hideous ſight than a hypocrite unveiled, where every defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity can no longer hide itſelf from obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when fraud ſhall be traverſed through all its meandering intricacies, even to its ſoul and polluted ſource, and when the very heart ſhall be diſplayed, without ſubterfuge, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealments, and without a poſſibility of either being on its own guard, or throwing others off theirs. By the bye, <hi>Sedley,</hi> that ſentiment, borrowed (as I perceive many of thine are) from the pernicious volumes of thy darling
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:016020_0184_0F9B2945AF358688"/>
theoriſt, is ſubverſive of all fair dealing in buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, true affection in a connection with the other ſex, and ingenuouſneſs of manners in all human ſituations.</p>
                  <p>The Lieutenant is not yet returned, but he hath ſent two letters, of which, for certain reaſons, I have procured the favour of copies, to incloſe you. If thou haſt a ſingle minute to ſpare from the proſecution of thy ruinous ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, read them; and if after that, thou art not made better, if they want efficiency to check thee in the purſuit of pleaſure, through the bounds both of law and humanity, farewel to every hope of feeling, farewel to all that orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the real gentleman, farewel to manhood. The firſt is addreſſed to me, the ſecond to Mrs. <hi>Vernon.</hi> On the receipt of mine, which was the very day of my trial to ruin the fair ſubject of it, judge what I felt: you know my ſenſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and can imagine thy <hi>Thornton's</hi> ſituation, when it is poignantly wounded.</p>

                     <salute>My dear Benefactor,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>GUESS how eaſily your former favour ſat upon my heart, by my readineſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from you another! I had more reaſons than you yet know of for inviting you to my villa, and it was thoſe reaſons that prevented me from inviting my <hi>Sophia</hi> to partake of the excurſion. To tell you the plain truth, my friend, I have more policy than buſineſs in this excurſion. I have lately had offers of prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: To ſpeak openly, I can have the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of a company, upon joining General—, in <hi>America.</hi> The half-pay of a Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant, you know, Sir, is not ſufficient to, even a man of moderation: my wife's private for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune I have very ſtrickly ſettled upon her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as a ſort of comfortable ſecurity againſt unfortunate contingencies: I think myſelf no more intitled to touch the intereſt of this, than I would touch upon a property in truſt, which, after my deceaſe, was to be the only certain reſource of the perſon under my guardianſhip. Another point is my own thirſt of glory. I was trained very early to the exerciſe of arms,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:016020_0186_0F9B2947359EB710"/>
and although I continued to ſtarve upon my enſigncy near twenty years, (I weep with joy, Sir, when I think upon the generous means by which I became a Lieutenant) yet the ardours of military ambition are by no means extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed. I declare to you, Mr. <hi>Thornton,</hi> even bleſt as I now am in a competent income, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to me with the hand of <hi>Sophia,</hi> in the full poſſeſſion too, of <hi>Sophia</hi> herſelf, I cannot, even at this time, hear the beat of a drum, without feeling my heart bound at the alarm. In a word, I deſign to go to the field, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the promotion. I am one of thoſe who ſide with that party which conſiders the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Britain inſulted by America. I was bred a ſoldier, and taught even from my cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle (for my father had won his laurels) to feel all the delicacies of martial majeſty. In my opinion, Sir, the Sovereign of theſe realms is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured: his injuries are mine: it is enough for a ſoldier, to believe his cauſe is juſt. I perceive many of my old comrades have voluntarily drawn the ſword, while mine is gathering ruſt in its ſheath. I drew it, Mr. <hi>Thornton,</hi> laſt night, out of the ſcabbard, and upon examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the blade I ſaw a ſpot, a lazy ſpot of inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, deſtroying the keenneſs of its edge. By
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:016020_0187_0F9B2948064C1B38"/>
my ſoul, I felt myſelf bluſh at it; nor can I be ever eaſy, ever forgive myſelf, till I have at once wiped away the ſhame, and the ſpot, as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes my ſtation. Now then, Mr. <hi>Thornton,</hi> we are come to the point, a point of all others in the world the moſt delicate. <hi>Sophia,</hi> my poor <hi>Sophia,</hi> muſt, muſt—Excuſe me, dear <hi>Thornton</hi>—excuſe a blot, which my weakneſs has, I ſee, made upon the paper: a tender wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man will, at any time, unſoldier the boldeſt of us. But, fie upon it! fie upon it! it was the infirmity but of a moment: "I am a man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain." In ſhort, Sir, my wife knows nothing of my intention, and I do not know how to break the matter with her. She has peculiar gentleneſs of heart, and will, I am convinced, feel the ſevereſt pangs at parting. This is the firſt time ſince our marriage that I have ſlept from her ſide, and I wiſh much to know how ſhe has ſupported it: if tolerably well, ſhe may, perhaps, be brought to bear the thoughts of a longer abſence; and, in that caſe, I would have you gradually open the deſign to her, of which, indeed, I diſtantly hint in my letter to her. The worſt of it is, Mr. <hi>Thornton,</hi> women are ſo apt to aſſociate with the duty of a ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, ſuch horrid ideas of death, broken bones,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:016020_0188_0F9B2948AF7229F8"/>
groans, and cannon balls, that they give a man over the moment he marches from their em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces to front the enemies of their country: however, let us not blame the ſoftneſs that was deſigned to ſoothe us, to ſoften us, to poliſh our ruggedneſs, and harmonize our natures. The drift of my letter is evident to you, <hi>Sophia</hi> muſt know it: the ſummer is advancing: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our troops are midway betwixt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending countries: ſome of them are arrived at the theatre of the war. I have but a few days to ſpare. Dalliances muſt in no wiſe be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged: they are too effeminating: I dare not truſt myſelf with them. My abſence is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious to the diſcloſure. You are not unſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in argument: you want not the advantages of perſuaſive eloquence: to you, therefore, I truſt the tranquillity of a wife's boſom. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire her, if poſſible, my worthy Mr. <hi>Thornton</hi> with the duty ſhe owes to my character, which longer idleneſs would utterly obliviate. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake in her thoſe ſparks which I hope even a female nature ſometimes experiences; the ſparks of patriotiſm. But if you find this impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, at leaſt obtain her conſent to my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, and ſupport her ſinking ſpirits with the hopes of my return, and with the expectation of the honours, rewards, and various diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

                  <p>I FIND buſineſs will engage me from plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure (that is, from your ſociety) longer than I at firſt believed: but you are I know, too well eſtabliſhed in the moral duties, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine at what is neceſſary to be done, even tho' your acquieſcence is to be attended with ſome inconveniencies. Nay, I am not ſure, whether, if at any time my country ſhould require me in the way of my profeſſion, you are not he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roine enough to lend thoſe arms to your King, which, were they in ſuch an exigence reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, would be wholly unworthy to incircle yours. I ſhall never forget the glorious week we paſſed together ſoon after our union, when we made a purchaſe of Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s verſion of <hi>Homer,</hi> and employed our long delightful even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:016020_0190_0F9B294D9A2396E0"/>
in reading him through. Do you recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect with what earneſtneſs we attended every hero in his progreſs? How we joined in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment of <hi>Achilles,</hi> deteſted the injuſtice of <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> and pleaded the cauſe of the good old father of the fair <hi>Chriſſis?</hi> Pray call to mind, with how much ardour we followed <hi>Hector</hi> to the field; how he deſpiſed the puſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanimous, hare-hearted <hi>Paris;</hi> and though we pitied the drooping <hi>Andromache,</hi> though we wept over her woes, yet we ſhould have felt for her ſtill more, had ſhe not endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to detain the warrior from his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Nor can you help recollecting with how much pleaſure, a pleaſure that was radiant in your dear eyes, <hi>Sophia,</hi> you heard of the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous victories atchieved and related by the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative <hi>Neſtor:</hi> of his triumphant returns to his native country after the laurels of conqueſt were waving in his helmet, while the patriotic virgins were ſcattering in his path the incenſe of the Spring, and the emulous youths bowed to the victor, and ſang the ſong of ſucceſs before him. Before we had reached the twelfth book, you was half a hero, and with the ſhield and buckler of <hi>Minerva</hi> (her wiſdom is already in your poſſeſſion) you would now be ſit to take

the field, arrange the file, and inſpirit at once, by your courage and beauty, the ſoldiers of your own <hi>Caeſar.</hi> Do you know, <hi>Sophia,</hi> that I am child enough to be vain of the name that was given me by my godfathers and godmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. There is conqueſt in the ſound, and I have a ſoul that pants, I muſt confeſs, to be ranked amongſt the <hi>Roman Caeſars.</hi> But ah! <hi>Sophia,</hi> I am only a diſbanded, unemployed Lieutenant, and the little glory I gained in the field in the days of my youth, is now entirely faded: and, without one mark of the ſword, without one apologizing ſcar, by which might be ſeen the neceſſity of retreat, I am withering in the eye of my King and country, and ſhall, after a few years, fall into an inglorious grave, and be no more remembered.</p>
                  <p>At a villa in <hi>Suſſex,</hi> through which I paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and where I ſtopped to dine, I was told of a manſion, which ſtrangers uſually went to ſurvey, the property of a veteran officer, whom I fought with, ſide by ſide, in the firſt battle that fleſhed my arm: I have a thouſand times mentioned him to you, under the well known name of <hi>Fraſer.</hi> The old man hath left two of his limbs in different parts of the globe; <hi>France</hi> hath the honour of his arm, and his
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:016020_0192_0F9B294FC9135D40"/>
right leg adorns the plains of Minden: but the trunk is whole, and ſeems to have acquired freſh vigour from lopping the branches. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dihood hath ſettled the roſe of high health in his cheek; the ſun hath ſeaſoned his complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion to the heat of the Torrid Zone; and the hair of his head is like the whiteneſs of a her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit's beard, that ſpreads itſelf beyond the gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle. He knew me at the firſt ſight, and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed my hand with an honeſt roughneſs that denoted ſincerity: but on ſeeing me ſtill able, and in the force of youth, at leaſt of middle age, he contracted his brow, and ſeemed to aſk me, by his look, what I did baſking here at home? In the enthuſiaſm of his martial ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, which riſes to every thing but idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, he hath at his own expence, erected in his garden little monumental ornaments to the memory of his favourite heroes. <hi>Britannia</hi> was on one ſide, weeping over <hi>Wolfe;</hi> and on the other, the figure of <hi>Public Tranquillity</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the olive-branch to <hi>Cumberland.</hi> Not a warrior of any celebrity, but had at leaſt a buſt, a pedeſtal, or an inſcription. And upon my taking notice of a vacant nich in the centre of the garden, the Major ſtruck it with his cane, and exclaimed, "In the name of honour, <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> why wilt thou not give an old friend an

                  <p>What courſe I am to take in the preſent cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, Heaven only can tell. Such an accident has happened as totally confounds me. In conformity to my promiſe, I diſpatched <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riet</hi> to the languiſhing pedant; but ſhe had ſcarce got, as I underſtand, five miles on her way, when the curſed poſtillion, willing to ſhew his dexterity, (according to their villainous cuſtom) by driving like a devil through the village, at a ſhort turn, or rather angle in the

road, overturned the chaiſe, fell himſelf from the ſaddle, and ſet the horſes a-going, while the poor <hi>Harriet</hi> was dragged along the earth, with her body half out of the chaiſe-window, till a countryman caught the off-horſe by the bridle, and put a ſtop to the career. She was carried into a little dirty-looking inn, almoſt ſpeechleſs; and, as ſhe informs me, with an arm torn by the glaſs, which was unfortunately drawn up, ſcribbled an almoſt unintelligible line to requeſt I would haſten to ſee her before ſhe died. The poſt-boy brought me the note, and, trembling like a leaf, and white as a ſhirt, proteſting moſt fervently that he could not help the accident. I knew not what to do: I heſitated, dreaded the conſequence; wrote a hurried line to poor <hi>Horace,</hi> without feeling either pen or paper; called for a taper, without thinking that I wanted wax; ſent it to the poſt by the boy; and then ordered my horſes. The curſed landlord, who is ever alarmed at the ſound of a hoof, in the expectation of freſh prey, now detected my diſorder, and ſet every wheel at work to find out the cauſe: "He was ſorely ſorry to ſee me uneaſy; would do any thing in his power; hoped nothing material was the matter. Could he do any thing? he was concerned to ſee me in ſuch confuſion;

would do a great deal to ſerve ſo worthy a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, <hi>mayhap</hi> I was taken ill; mayhap my friends <hi>was</hi> taken ſick in <hi>London;</hi> my wife, my aunt, my uncle. Some law-ſuit, <hi>may be,</hi> had gone wrong, or <hi>ſommut</hi> or other was moſt <hi>far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinly</hi> the matter." My ſervant came with my horſes to the door, and the perſecutor began again: "Good lack, good lack, what can be the <hi>'caſion</hi> of this! Was I going away? Was I obliged to leave <hi>Buxton? Martha,</hi> where's the gentleman's little account? How ſorry he was again!"</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, <hi>Thornton,</hi> I was obliged to eſcape <hi>him</hi> and my riſing rage, by ruſhing into a little ſlip of ground behind his houſe, where, under pretence of picking a few pinks that ſtraggled, poverty-ſtruck, about the beds, I caſt about what was to be done. In this manner I argued with myſelf: If I go to <hi>Harriet,</hi> the affair will certainly be ſuſpected: for how came I ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in this lady's misfortune! If I do <hi>not</hi> go, it will be barbarous; but then I have ſent to her huſband, and home is the beſt and fitteſt place for a ſick woman. Upon the whole, I thought it not proper or political to go; and, as to writing, I dare not give way to my ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for a diſcovered letter is irrecoverable

perdition. Upon my return into the houſe, I found the raſcally landlord tampering for intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence with the poſtboy, who had come upon the ſaddle-horſe with the tangled traces ſtill about his back: I had well nigh broke out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. <hi>Thomas,</hi> who ſtays with me, although married, till I can ſuit myſelf, looked as if he ſuſpected the matter. The landlord muttered forth a million pities, and talked of our being all mortal, and liable to accidents; the poſtboy ſaid his horſes were cut, as I ſaw, all to pieces, and his chaiſe ſhattered in the pannels.</p>
                  <p>I could <hi>Stanhope</hi> it no longer: Curſe your horſes, chaiſe and pannels, all together, ſaid I: get out of my ſight, and leave me to myſelf: a lady is dying, and you are prating about your damn'd pannels. <hi>Tom,</hi> take away the horſes. You poſtboy, ſtop till I write a note to the lady, to let her know that I have written to her huſband.</p>
                  <p>I would have gone in to write.</p>
                  <p>The landlord again ſtruck up: "Had not the lady better come back to my houſe, Sir? The journey to Mr. <hi>Homeſpun's</hi> will be too far in her preſent condition." Pray, Mr. <hi>Wyngood,</hi> ſaid I, ſuffer me to do as I pleaſe. The man

                  <p>It was with a difficulty equal to the ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles betwixt life and death, that I ſupported myſelf from ſinking under this intelligence: I had, however, ſufficient preſence of mind to return to the company, and make excuſes with ſome degree of coherence; after which I mounted the reeking horſe, and ordering <hi>Tom</hi> to follow me, went upon the full ſtretch to my lodgings. At my entrance into the parlour I found <hi>Harriet</hi> in a ſtrong hyſteric: and upon her recovery, we had her put into a warm bed. She is pefectly <hi>mangled, Thornton:</hi> her fine face is gaſhed with wounds; and the landlady tells me, that other parts of her perſon have ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained their ſhare of bruiſes. To mend the matter, I have received a long epiſtle from <hi>Fanny Mortimer,</hi> which was delivered with as much peculiarity as thou wilt find in the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents. After dinner, the whole family ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled into the garden, and as I was paſſing near

Mrs. <hi>Mortimer,</hi> along the ſhade of a ſmall ſhrubbery, that affected to ſerpentine, ſhe, with her own hand, bade me look at that paper: I folded it in my boſom, and bowed; and, juſt as ſhe deſired, no one perceived it.

<pb n="51" facs="unknown:016020_0203_0F9B27AAD26997B0"/>
exigencies. I find it neceſſary to the peace of my mind to write to you. The acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, Sir, that brought us together at <hi>Scarbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough,</hi> when your viſits to me were very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, and, as a ſingle woman, I confeſs not diſagreeable, is recollected with ſome anxiety. You were then at ſome pains to convince me I had made an impreſſion on your ſenſibility, and certain ſentiments were interchanged, which it would be, at this period, highly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to repeat. It may not be amiſs, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to obſerve that, prior to your quitting <hi>Scarborough,</hi> you did not omit exerting your utmoſt talents (and they are not inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Mr. <hi>Sedley</hi>) to engage my heart. How far you ſucceeded, it is not <hi>now</hi> material to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. Be that as it may, my health hath been gradually upon the decline from that hour to this. It is now ſome months ſince I gave my hand to Mr. <hi>Mortimer,</hi> than whom their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver lived a better character, or a tenderer huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. He was educated under the eye of my father, who ſeemed ſo wrapt up in the ideas of making him ſtill nearer to his family, that as he thought proper to addreſs me, I could not deny to duty, what poſſibly I ſhould have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to every thing elſe. In a word, Sir, my
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:016020_0204_0F9B27AC0FC640F8"/>
worthy father's heart was in the match, and it is impoſſible for a child to diſappoint the wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of <hi>ſuch</hi> a parent. The ſoftneſs, delicacy, and gentleneſs of Mr. <hi>Mortimer</hi>'s behaviour has ever been uniform and exact: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it has pleaſed Heaven to continue my indiſpoſition, and indeed rather to increaſe than abate it, yet he has not ſuffered my languor to relax his animated aſſiduities, but has acted, both by day and by night, the double part of nurſe and huſband. Peculiarly unlucky do I account the deſtiny by which you and I, Sir, meet again: not that I have the leaſt traces of affection for your perſon, being really attached to Mr. <hi>Mortimer</hi> by duty, and upon principle. At the ſame time, Sir, I cannot but own your preſence gives me uneaſineſs, and uneaſineſs of any kind I am not now equal to. You have, I ſee, recommended yourſelf to my father more warmly than ever; my ſiſter thinks very high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of you: Mr. <hi>Mortimer</hi> is loud in your praiſes; and even my mother, who is not eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attracted, ſpeaks of you with ardour. As my ſituation is ſufficiently ſacred to exclude every poſſible hope, nay, as I dare preſume your own connections have, by this time, led your inclinations into a more proper channel, I will venture to talk to you with the freedom
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:016020_0205_0F9B27AC306319A8"/>
of a friend. To ſpeak plainly, then, Mr. <hi>Sed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> there is a point in which you may ſtill oblige me, it is this: that you would enter as ſeldom into this houſe as is conſiſtent with a reſolution, which I earneſtly beg you will take, of withdrawing yourſelf from this family. Do it leiſurely: but at all events, let it be done. Ah! Mr. <hi>Sedley,</hi> pity the perturbation of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy mind. Before you came, I could at leaſt conceal agitation, and ſubmit to the ſilent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>predations of my diſtemper. Every tear I then ſhed, every ſigh that then ſtole from me, was attributed to the unavoidable riſings and ſinkings of a comſumptive habit. But within theſe few days I have had ſome conflicts, and every one of them adds to my weakneſs, to hide—a ſomething that preys upon my heart. To account to you for this is needleſs. If you have the leaſt ſuggeſtion that it is occaſioned by your appearance, let it intereſt your humanity, your honour, your compaſſion, in my cauſe; and do not, Mr. <hi>Sedley,</hi> render more exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitely wretched the laſt hours of a fate at the beſt unenviable, and not ſuſtained without a ſorrow that is haſtening its object to the tomb. Go then, I conjure you. Leave me to the protection of a generous family, of a dear ſiſter,
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:016020_0206_0F9B27ACFB954FA8"/>
of a fond huſband. It is not, I <hi>feel</hi> it is not poſſible, that I ſhould long live amongſt them. Let me not ſhew Mr. <hi>Mortimer</hi> that I gave myſelf to him as to the friend and darling youth of my father. Let not—Alas! Mr. <hi>Sedley,</hi> what have I ſaid! Pardon me, pity me, oblige me, leave me. As your ſtay at the bath cannot be of conſequence: as the floridneſs of your complexion, the luſtre of your eyes, the eaſe of your air, all aſſure me, your purſuit is mere amuſement; I intreat you to change your route, fix it at <hi>Scarborough, Bath, Margate,</hi> any where, ſo as you will but leave this place. I look at you with anguiſh, I know your rap at the door, I diſtinguiſh your ſtep, and, tho' I feel the impropriety, the crime, the ſhame, of being diſturbed, I cannot bear it. Contrive, therefore, and that inſtantly, to begin your taſk of diſſolving the connection here. Permit me to enjoy the little ſerenity that a waſting ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs admits. The poor pittance of eaſe, which that allows, do not you deſtroy. As I ſaw the intimacy betwixt you and my family daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing, nay, as you have been almoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly at this houſe for the laſt week, I could contrive no other way of addreſſing you, but by writing an honeſt explicit letter, which I
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:016020_0207_0F9B27ADB16F2E90"/>
have now done, with many interruptions both from pain, fatigue, and the fear of being ſeen, but chance has favoured me, and I have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſomed the ſecret of my ſoul undiſcovered. Think not, however, that I mean to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a correſpondence. Take a week to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw with the elegance becoming your cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter: during which time I will, as hitherto, endeavour to ſupport myſelf as an acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, although it is ſufficiently ſhocking that I ſhould be reduced, even to a moment's diſguiſe. If you are not diſengaged from us by that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, I have no other refuge than a conſtant retreat to my ſick chamber, whenever you viſit us: and, if this ſhould, in the end, occaſion ſuſpicion, and the cruel, unconquerable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſion I entertain be ever diſcovered, you will remember that, to your injuſtice muſt be imputed the conſequences, even though the beſt of parents ſhould be made miſerable, the worthieſt ſiſter partake their anxiety, and the kindeſt of huſbands fall a victim to the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ingratitude of</p>

                  <p>EVERY moment in the day affords ſome freſh and beautiful inſtance of my noble father's wiſdom and affection. About an hour after tea this evening, while Sir <hi>Henry</hi> was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying his ſerene ſummer-walk, as he calls it, <hi>William</hi> brought a pencilled card, and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to me. It was to adviſe with him (Sir <hi>Henry</hi>) about ſome concerns eſſential to the general welfare. Even my little brother and ſiſter, <hi>Charles</hi> and <hi>Caroline,</hi> (who are down
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:016020_0214_0F9B27B53ACB3178"/>
with us) were mentioned in this invitation: the card requeſted the company of all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, adding, that as the evening was delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, his mind compoſed, and nobody but our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, at preſent, in the houſe, he much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired that we might all have our ſhare in the general ſerenity. How prettily, my dear <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> how perſuaſively, this exalted parent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, as a pleaſure, what his authority might command as a duty! But it is among the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his excellent maxims, that none but fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſpirits do well with compulſion, and that a frank and ingenuous tenderneſs hath in it equal weight and ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>The converſation paſſed in the garden, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſhade of hawthorns, laurels, and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berts: there is a white bench under it; and a ſort of natural arching, bower-faſhion, made by the mixture of thick leaves and branches interwoven above. Hither we came in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the ſummons: a group of relations, loving and beloved. <hi>Fanny</hi> who had been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſing herſelf with the pen, (not having had ſtrength for the pleaſures of writing for ſome time) came forward, delicate as angel meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, with her younger brother in one hand, and her little ſiſter in the other. <hi>Venus,</hi> with
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:016020_0215_0F9B27B8748849B8"/>
two of her attendant Graces, could not be more lovely, even though the diſtreſs of ill health threw ſomewhat of languor into her air: but then it was a languor ſo ſoft, and a diſtreſs ſo gentle, that it only ſerved the more to <hi>feminine,</hi> (if you will allow the word), and to recommend her to the ſpectator, as a more pathetic, intereſting figure.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Henry</hi> was at firſt ſitting ſomewhat pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, with an opened letter in his hand, my mother by his ſide, leaning her arm on one of the corners of the bench, and repoſing her cheek within her hand, the true poſture of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation. They both roſe at our approach. Mr. <hi>Mortimer</hi> and I went up firſt; then <hi>Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> and her twin-cherubs: we were a little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmed, but this was ſoon diſſipated by Sir <hi>Henry,</hi> who ſeating us all on the bench, drew a green garden-chair from an adjoining ſhade, placing himſelf oppoſite to us, and, with a ſmile of ineffable benignity, in which the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and the friend ſhone beautifully blended, he paid each of us a varied compliment, on our obedience to his wiſhes, and addreſſed us to this effect:</p>
                  <p>"I have requeſted your company, my dear and worthy children, to engage your filial at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:016020_0216_0F9B27B91AB5F3A0"/>
on ſeveral of the moſt important events of human life: I have, indeed, for ſome time, had a deſign to ſummon you together on this ſubject, but care, company, and amuſement, have thrown their attractions or interruptions hitherto in the way of my wiſhes. I have, however, fixed upon this evening of leiſure to deliver to you the ſecrets of my heart, and in mine are included thoſe of the beſt of wives, and tendereſt of mothers."</p>
                  <p>Lady <hi>Delmore</hi> drew her ſpread fingers acroſs her face, and Sir <hi>Henry</hi> repeating his panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric, went on:</p>
                  <p>"I am happy, my dear relatives, to tell you, in the firſt place, and let that ſerve as an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to you, that I can look back up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a life of more than threeſcore years, with a tranquillity of retroſpect, at the ſame time ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, chriſtian, and philoſophic. The ſerenity of my ſoul is in no degree wounded by the cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm with which I review it's conduct thro' the perilous voyage of my life, in which, by the care of Heaven, I have eſcaped thoſe quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands that endanger our youth, and thoſe rocks which alarm us in age. But that which I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count far the richeſt indulgence of Providence,
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:016020_0217_0F9B27B9DDCF2E08"/>
is that dear proſpect which I now behold in the perſons of this beauteous circle, a circle filled with the pledges of this generous crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's invariable fidelity, and the teſtimonies of my conſtant attachment to excellences ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed."</p>
                  <p>My mother roſe, <hi>Lucy</hi> gave her hand to Sir <hi>Henry,</hi> looked at him a moment, looked at him blooming even in age, ſighed ſoftly, and returned to her ſeat.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Henry</hi> proceeded:</p>
                  <p>"The ſeaſon of infancy is paſt with moſt of you; and it's pleaſures are ſucceeded by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections of a higher nature. Even this ſweet pair <hi>(here he pointed to my young brother and ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)</hi> are at the age of diſtinguiſhing, and the teſt are mature. The bloſſoms of youth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe a generous fruitage. You, <hi>Delia,</hi> have not yet been rewarded by the tenderneſs of ſuch a man as my <hi>Mortimer:</hi> yet the colour of your life will depend on the exchange of your name. Your mother's expectations, like mine, are ſanguine, and extenſive: our eyes are turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on your every action. We hope to ſee you all the ſupports of our declining age: our ſun is about to ſet, and we wiſh it's departure may be gilded by your virtues and indulgencies.</p>

"The father of a family is at once a ſublime and venerable character. My full heart di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates as I ſee myſelf encompaſſed by theſe charming portraits of ourſelves."</p>
                  <p>Here Lady <hi>Delmore</hi> melted into tears of tranſport, but endeavoured to conceal them.</p>
                  <p>"I can form to myſelf (continued my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) no ideas beyond it, nor many equal. Our family is at preſent the ſeat of integrity, una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity, and mutual confidence. Our pleaſures are reflected upon each other, and we recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally give and receive inimitable complacence. Yet we muſt be alarmed for thoſe we love. Though the tenor of your conduct, and the gratitude of your tempers, make us leſs fearful of deviation, and though the maxims we have ever been induſtrious to inculcate make us more ſecure and inapprehenſive, yet certain tremors will inevitably touch the boſom of a parent: be not diſpleaſed therefore, my children, if I give you a few general precepts, for your eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and adoption. They come ſanctified to you with the venerable imprimatur of more than fifty years experience. The maxims which are neceſſary to regulate an ingenuous mind are neither multiplied nor intricate. The very corner-ſtone of a great character is a clear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience:
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:016020_0219_0F9B27BB5837E3E0"/>
if you feel well, you will act well: and if you do not, all the talents in the world will only ſerve to torment you. Never wear a maſk before your motives, but when it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary to the felicity of life, ſuch as deceiving, or rather bewitching, the unprinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled into virtue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſome tempers cannot bear the plain truth; ſhe is too awful for them: be it then, in ſuch particular caſes, your parts, to lead them to her ſacred temple by the moſt pleaſing paths. Alleviate the apparent rugged<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and length of the way, by ſuch meanders as, though they ſeem to deviate, may aſſuredly bring you, by the faireſt proſpects, to the ſhrine of the Goddeſs. I have no objection to your adorning yourſelves with all the attraction of exterior, ſuch I mean as are reflected upon the character from dignity of manner, perſuaſion of voice, ſplendor of addreſs, and elegance of air:</p>
                  <l>
                     <hi>"Where virtue is, theſe are moſt virtuous."</hi>
                  </l>
                  <p>They will act like magic, and make the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence both of your ſentiment and example, perfectly irreſiſtable; and I beſeech you to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert them in the cauſe of that truth and ſobriety of heart I have recommended. Make uſe of them to conciliate differences, to inſpirit ſociety,
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:016020_0220_0F9B27BBF1131858"/>
to embelliſh converſation, to ſoften the harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of diſpute, to animate attention; to pleaſe, to inſtruct, to entertain. To all theſe purpoſes they will be excellent and ornamental. But beware of what a licentious and artful indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of them may poſſibly lead to; beware of <hi>Duplicity;</hi> of <hi>that</hi> duplicity, which, ſo accou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, it's deſtructive ſword ſheathed in polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it's heart ſhielded by the impenetrable mail of gilded hypocriſy, is equal to the ſiege of a city, and might do more real <hi>miſchief</hi> than all the efforts of a legion of avowed villainies. Of all earthly things, therefore, moſt deteſt, what is moſt to be dreaded, the ſyſtem of a well-bred, high-poliſhed, elegant deceiver: no eye can ſee him; no underſtanding detect him; no policy eſcape him. He comes in the form of a Seraph, and thoſe who are themſelves ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, cannot imagine that he is a Syren.</p>
                  <p>"At your time of life it is hard, extremely hard, to maſter the predominant inclination: yet virtuous exerciſe will habituate the ſoul to the practice of uniform honour. To you, <hi>Delia,</hi> I am now going to ſpeak more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly.

worthy young man, our dear <hi>Mortimer,</hi> who, having ſeen more of life, and the tranſactions of men, is the better able to promote happineſs and avert miſery. With theſe ſentiments, I truſt you to your underſtandings, virtues, and tempers: with theſe precepts, which I have a particular reaſon now to urge, I truſt you to diſcretion, oeconomy, and fair dealing. If I have been tedious, confider I am an old man: If I have dealt in repetitions, or if I have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed, confider I am a father: Go, then, my children, cheriſh each other; avoid the path of Deceit, walk ſteadily in the road of Truth, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven though the roſes may not always be in bloom: ſatisfy the feelings of your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; be merciful, be moderate and be happy."</p>

                              <p>THAT you was ſuperior to the feebleneſs of the modiſh female, who affects to liſp, to ſhudder at the ſhower, and tremble at the breeze, I knew before: but that your ſoul was ſo nicely attuned to the pains and pleaſures of mine, I was not ſo aware of, till the receipt of your laſt kind favour.</p>
                              <p>You will ſpare me to your King, you will lend him my ſervices againſt the foes of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: noble woman, generous wife! I am again at Major <hi>Fraſer's,</hi> in my way home, and upon my arrival at our peaceful villa, I will pay you my warmeſt acknowledgments by my em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces. I put your letter, with a ſparkling eye, into the hand of my old friend: he read it, and burſt forth into extacies, peculiar to the manly violence of his nature. "'Sdeath, <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> ſaid he, ten ſuch wives as thine would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the female character from the ignominy of the reſt of the ſex. Such were the Spartan,
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:016020_0226_0F9B27C08AD25ED8"/>
ſuch were the Roman women: I do not wiſh our wives to fight, Lieutenant: I do not wiſh them to wield the battle-axe, nor to eject the bomb, but in the name of honour, let them ſuffer their huſbands to behave like men, and permit thoſe who wear beards to deſerve them. I love ſoftneſs, <hi>Vernon,</hi> and conſider it as the female characteriſtic, but ſtill I would have ſome diſtinction made betwixt women and children, excluſive of the mere difference of bodily ſize: and I do declare to thee, Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, though I have ſeen many women that I could have liked, that I could love, yet I never dared venture upon matrimony; leſt my wife ſhould ſtand betwixt me and my duty as a ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier; but could I, like thee, have met with a <hi>Sophia,</hi> I had long ſince taken to myſelf a brave ſpirited wench, who ſhould have ſpread the triumphal roſes under my feet, and wove her garland of welcome againſt my return: But you are the happy hero: you are more than a general in the affections of <hi>Sophia.</hi> Go on then, embark, exert yourſelf, to merit ſo illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious a girl: fail not, I charge you, to viſit me with <hi>Sophy</hi> under your arm, on your coming again to the country you have honoured." I was preparing to give him the farewel embrace; but he held me by the hand, and ſurveying
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:016020_0227_0F9B27C144C3C1D0"/>
his figure in a glaſs that was oppoſite. ſhook his head, and burſt into tears. "Thou ſeeſt, ſaid he, ſtill looking into the mirror, I do not counterfeit; my beſt arm, and my moſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable leg, have left me: my ſoul wiſhes for the field; but my body, this uſeleſs load of an old fellow, of whom the one half is timber, would but ſhame the troops and diſgrace his Majeſty." Then turning to the other end of the room, he took from the mantle-piece a ſword, cautiouſly guarded from the ruſt by a ſcarlet caſe; "There, (continued the Major, after he had taken it from the covering) there, <hi>Vernon,</hi> is the blade that attended me in all my fortunes, for more than thirty years: examine it, take notice of the marks of proweſs: it is no maiden, I'll aſſure thee:</p>

There are other traits, my dear <hi>Sophia,</hi> of this brave invalid's character, which I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve for the opportunity of domeſtic endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

                  <p>I Confeſs it, <hi>Lucy,</hi> he <hi>has</hi> pleaſed me; and I am above concealing from my friend, that I admire his <hi>manner</hi> even more than his perſon. His, words, his looks, his motions, are truly irreſiſtable; and if you knew half the noble things he hath done ſince he came to the bath, you would the leſs wonder at my being caught. I will only mention to you one or two points of his conduct, which will help you, by ſuch ſpecimens, to conjecture the reſt. His ſervant had played the libertine with an innocent wench, who depended upon the bounty of the bathers for her attendance at the pump and well: the fellow ſeduced her, the poor deluded wretch loſt her virtue, and her means of liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood at the ſame time. Common maſters would have cuffed the footman, and called the injured girl a ſimpleton. Mr. <hi>Sedley</hi> inſiſted upon the deceiver's marrying the deceived; the ceremony has actually been celebrated, and it is ſaid, not by him, for he never ſpeaks of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that he deſigns to fee them well ſettled before he leaves <hi>Buxton.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is, you muſt know, a lady, who on her

return from the bath to her houſe, was hurt by the overturning of a carriage, and the huſband, who is a worthy clergyman, would have been quite diſtracted, had it not been for the cares, the tenderneſſes, and attention of this obliging man, who hath the art of propitiating every body to him, and making every body around him happy, by thoſe nice and minute, yet tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly engaging offices, which (being in general conſidered as unimportant, though in reality I find they are but too pleaſing) are too often neglected. He is now very frequently in our family, and I rejoice to ſee him ſo much in the confidence and good graces of my father, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and brother. As to poor dear <hi>Fanny,</hi> ſhe ſeldom talks, when ſhe can avoid it: and one may ſee Mr. <hi>Sedley's</hi> good breeding, and even the feelings of his heart, in the manner with which he adapts himſelf to the perſon he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes: when his ſentiments are directed to Sir <hi>Henry,</hi> they are acute, correct, claſſical, pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating, learned: when to my brother, they are elegant, noble, dignified, and animating: when to my mother, they are grave, condeſcending, cautious: when to my ſiſter, gentle, in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-tone of voice, ſoftened, as it were, to the ſituation of a ſick perſon, and that perſon a woman: his ſubjects of <hi>Fanny</hi> are ſuch as might
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:016020_0234_0F9B27C678EAF028"/>
ſoothe a ſpirit much nearer its end than I hope that dear creature is.

I am ſo far from deſiring to ruin her reputation, that I tremble as I approach her: I have not aſſurance enough to kiſs her beautiful lips: the ſlighteſt touch of her hand diſorders me: I detect myſelf looking at her, and withdraw my eyes, for fear of offending. I am a very young man, Mr. <hi>Sedley,</hi> and thou and <hi>Cheſterfield,</hi> with your united councils, had nearly led me to every thing odious: but I ſaw the precipice time enough to eſcape it: the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of virtuous people, the friendſhip of the Lieutenant and his lady, the eſteem, and, oh! that I might be allowed to ſay, the love, the pure love of <hi>Araminta,</hi> will, I hope, again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore me to what I formerly was. As to your ſecrets, Sedley, I ſhall not betray them: and you will judge how true I muſt be to the point of confidence, when I dare not violate it, even though, by ſo pious a treachery, I could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably ſave a noble family, and involved in the

                  <p>PITY, Mrs. <hi>La Motte,</hi> the diſtraction of a huſband and a father. I have loſt my child, and my wife is in the agonies of death. The babe that was to have bleſſed me, and crowned my nine months expectation, appeared only to weep, and to die. The mother could nouriſh it no longer: her agonizing fits have produced an untimely labour, and, lifeleſs as it is, ſhe will not part with the infant; ſhe hugs it in her arms: cradles it in her boſom, inſiſts upon its being laid upon her pillow, and will not ſuffer any hand but hers and mine to touch it. Oh! Mrs. <hi>La Motte!</hi> what ſhall I do, and whither muſt I fly. There is but one reſource, and I will ſeek it before I finiſh my letter.</p>

Bleſſed is the power of prayer! I retired, Madam, into my own bed-room, and upon the bended knee of humility ſought for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to the only hand that, in an exigence like mine, can beſtow it. I riſe eaſier, Mrs. <hi>La Motte,</hi> indeed I do: He that correcteth hath not utterly forſaken me. I have ſoftly opened <hi>Harriet's</hi> apartment, and by the nurſe's waving me to withdraw again, I judge that my poor patient is aſleep. The GOD, who alone can effectually give medicine to a mind diſeaſed, protect and proſper her moment of awaking.</p>

                  <p>MY maſter-wheels are in motion: I ſent <hi>brother Mortimer</hi> upon a love-meſſage made to the lady <hi>Delia's</hi> eyebrow, ſaw the old Baronet and his Dame ſet out for an evening<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride to <hi>Buxton</hi> bath, and had the fair <hi>Fanny Mortimer</hi> all to myſelf. Oh! ye Deities of Deſign! ye ſpirits congenial to <hi>Stanhopes!</hi> what an hour of whiſper and inſinuation have I paſſed! Oh! <hi>Thornton,</hi> for a ſecond interview!

Conſcious of the prepoſſeſſing idea, I availed myſelf of her partiality. I did not kneel, I did not whine, I did not ſmack the palms, nor ſqueeze the handkerchief, but I hit her on the only chord of the ſoul that could make a vibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in my favour; I pitied her want of health, I praiſed the ſacrifice ſhe had made to paternal quietude. I was all refinement, all aſſiduity, all <hi>Cheſterfield.</hi> The features were obedient, and every atom of irreſiſtible art was levelled againſt her. I called the colour into her face by one ſentiment; I ſent it away by another: one look brought the tear; a ſecond dried it up. Now the roſe, now the lilly, prevailed in her cheeks. Cordials became neceſſary. I <hi>ordered</hi> my hand to ſhake as I preſented the hartſhorn, the water, the drops. The lovely object of my battery began to yield. Nature tugged at her heart; her frame became weaker; her paſſion ſtronger: every finger tottered: her breath became difficult: ſhe rocked herſelf in her chair; her eyes were full; her voice faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered out an—Oh!

                  <p>WHAT a dreadful change; my dear <hi>Lucy,</hi> ſince I laſt wrote to you! There is an unuſual degree of uneaſineſs on the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of my ever-honoured parents: my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Mr. <hi>Mortimer,</hi> is penſive: <hi>Fanny</hi> was ſeized with an hyſteric diſorder, while her huſband was communicating to me the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe that paſſed between him and Mr. <hi>Sedley,</hi> who has never been at our houſe ſince. Mrs. <hi>Mortimer,</hi> it ſeems, knew not that Mr. <hi>Sedley</hi> had intereſted her huſband in the declaration made, by that medium, to me: ſhe remains exceedingly ill: has actually refuſed to ſuffer Mr. <hi>Mortimer</hi> to ſleep with her: ſays, ſhe has ſtrong reaſons for it, which he ſhall know at a proper time. At our coming into the drawing room, after we were ſummoned to her aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance by <hi>Sedley,</hi> (who in his confuſion and hurry to fetch us, ran down our long garden un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced and without his hat) we found the poor dear creature juſt recovering from a ſwoon: her eyes cloſed, her teeth ſhut, her clenched hands locked in each other, and her dreſs in the utmoſt diſorder, I ſuppoſe from the violent
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:016020_0247_0F9B2869F189A018"/>
changes of poſture occaſioned by the fits. I have no heart now, Lady <hi>Lucy,</hi> to talk of my own affairs; and yet, as you have a right to know every thing that concerns me, I juſt ſend you a ſketch of my brother's converſation in the ſummer-houſe, previous to theſe alarming circumſtances. My almoſt conſtant attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on my ſiſter will not permit me to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe it fair; and you muſt be contented with a looſe paper, on which I have been able to ſcribble only at intervals.</p>
                  <p>[The Paper, incloſing Mr. <hi>Mortimer's</hi> Addreſs to his Siſter, upon Mr. <hi>Sedley's</hi> Subject.]</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Mortimer,</hi> having led me by the hand through the garden into the ſummer-houſe, began, as uſual, with a pretty compliment, told me, that he found I had already done execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that I had made a wound which all the waters of <hi>Buxton</hi> were not able to cure, and then proceeded (you know, <hi>Lucy,</hi> what an able advocate he is) to open the deſign of his calling me aſide. I will own to you, ſaid he, my dear <hi>Delia,</hi> that I ſummon your attention in behalf of Mr. <hi>Sedley;</hi> but I will, as nearly as I am able, to recollect his own words, and, without the leaſt endeavour to ſway you, leave the reſult to your own determination. I lately
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:016020_0248_0F9B286AAF612298"/>
had a particular converſation with Mr. <hi>Sedley,</hi> wherein he addreſſed me, to the beſt of my remembrance, as follows:</p>
                  <p>"The motive of this viſit, Mr. <hi>Mortimer,</hi> is in confidence to enquire of you, from whom I have reaſon to believe ſhe conceals nothing, whether your ſiſter <hi>Delia</hi> is under any preſent engagement of heart, or in the leaſt reſpect partial to any one in the diſpoſal of her affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; for I ſhould ſhudder to be the cauſe of even a negative pain to ſo amiable a woman: and I forbore to aſk this queſtion of Sir <hi>Henry,</hi> leſt that regard which he is pleaſed to entertain of me might incline him to ſomething that might be contradictory to the private proſpects of his daughter. I know, Mr. <hi>Mortimer,</hi> the fraternal affection your ſiſter bears you, and I am no ſtranger, young as I am in your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, to the all-ſouled intimacy ſubſiſting between you as happy relations: hence I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined it more for the general peace to direct myſelf to you rather than any other: for as my enquiries are anſwered by <hi>you,</hi> Mr. <hi>Mortimer,</hi> I will either bury my ambitious wiſhes in my own and your boſom, or, ſhould they meet an encouraging reply, I will proceed to take ſuch meaſures as ſeem to you moſt conducive to the happineſs I aſpire to."</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="97" facs="unknown:016020_0249_0F9B286B6FF06A48"/>
Here, <hi>Delia,</hi> he pauſed a little, and then, with inimitable grace, purſued his overtures:</p>
                  <p>"Although, Mr. <hi>Mortimer,</hi> ſaid he, I have of late often had the honour of Sir <hi>Henry's</hi> company, whoſe neareſt ſecrets of heart I am beginning to ſhare, I never found that he had any view of uniting Miſs <hi>Delmore</hi> to any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular family. But why do I talk thus? Sir <hi>Henry</hi> ſpurns the bare idea of compulſitory connections, and his noble nature can never ſtoop to barter the felicity of a child to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted proſpects. And yet, Sir, may it not be reaſonably apprehended, that a ſoul ſo delicate, a heart ſo ſuſceptible, feelings ſo fine, and a boſom ſo alive to every nicer alarm, as Miſs <hi>Delmore's,</hi> may have made ſome wiſe and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite choice of her own? If ſo, tell me of it, frankly, and I promiſe, dear <hi>Mortimer,</hi> to join you in promoting, rather than oppoſing, the happineſs ſhe hopes for. After what I have now ſaid, you will be quite explicit, ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and unreſerved."</p>
                  <p>He waited my reply: his fine eyes ſhone with expectation: I told him, that I believed my ſiſter <hi>Delia</hi> had not yet, amongſt the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pretenſions made to her hand, ſeen the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ſhe could approve in the intimate light he
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:016020_0250_0F9B286C31C881C0"/>
alluded to; that I had often heard her expreſs a proper regard to the excellencies, manners, and addreſs of Mr. <hi>Sedley:</hi> that, as a very young friend, introduced into the family by the hand of ſo reverend and ſagacious a father, ſhe had an elegant opinion of his merit: and that, tho' I had not obſerved the leaſt intimation of her entertaining any ſenſibility of <hi>heart</hi> as to his perſon, (here, <hi>Delia,</hi> he bowed and bluſhed) yet that (be not diſpleaſed, <hi>Delia</hi>) I knew her naturally ſoft, ſenſible, and a nice diſtinguiſher of ſuperior endowments. I concluded with ſaying, that for the ſhort time I could boaſt the honour of his acquaintance, I knew none more likely to inſpire Miſs <hi>Delmore;</hi> and that, as a proof of my good wiſhes, I would take the opportunity given me of Sir <hi>Henry</hi> and Lady <hi>Delmore's</hi> evening ride, from which I would excuſe us young folks, to inform you of the converſation previous to any farther procedure.</p>
                  <p>His cheeks coloured to their full bloom (and you know what a complexion he has, <hi>Delia</hi>) at this propoſal: he begged, with great delicacy, that, till I was pre-acquainted with your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals, wiſhes, and views, I would preſerve the whole matter a ſecret, not only from your mother and Sir <hi>Henry,</hi> but even from my wife,
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:016020_0251_0F9B286CF19E4928"/>
the angelic Mrs. <hi>Mortimer,</hi> as he was pleaſed to call her: adding, that he could not bear to occaſion, by an ill-timed petition, one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's uneaſineſs in a family ſo harmonized, innocent, and affectionate, as Sir <hi>Henry Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more's;</hi> and that, rather than be cruelly inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in the ſubverſion of this, although his heart was in the cauſe, he would ſtifle the pleadings of it to eternity. I eaſily prevailed, <hi>Delia,</hi> on Sir <hi>Henry</hi> and your mother, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe us, and, as ſoon as their chariot rolled from the door, I took Mr. <hi>Sedley</hi> by the arm, and told him I was going to be his advocate. He preſſed my hand, and, in a whiſper, ſaid he would have the honour to keep Mrs. <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer</hi> company in the ſaloon, while I pleaded for him in the ſummer-houſe.</p>
                  <p>And now, my dear <hi>Delia,</hi> continued my brother, may not I congratulate you on the conqueſt of a man, who, if there is any faith in the faireſt appearances, is equally adorned in mind and body, and who will, I dare ſay, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly proceed to acquaint us with his circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and fortunes, if he receives your ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be more explicit. I muſt own I never was ſo truly attracted by any man, and he real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeems born for an alliance with a woman as
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:016020_0252_0F9B286E8C08E308"/>
enchanting as himſelf. Tell me truly, tell me like a ſiſter, Did you ever ſee ſo manly, yet ſo decorated an addreſs? ſuch ſplendid ſentiments, ſo elevated an air? Or did you ever before meet with any gentleman ſo eaſy, or ſo engaging, in that ſort of behaviour which is the reſult of a brilliant capacity, ornamented breeding, and unaffected complaiſance.</p>
                  <p>When you have read the incloſed, <hi>Lucy,</hi> give me the ſentiment of your heart upon it: for my own part, flattering as it is, I am too diſordered, and too much intereſted in the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, gloom that hangs over our houſe, to find ſatisfaction in any thing.

That this is an uncommon proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I am not to be told, but it is, nevertheleſs, conſiſtent with <hi>my</hi> notions of piety, tenderneſs and duty, and ſhall be done.</p>
                  <p>I am obliged to lay down the pen, but will not fold up my letter; for though I ſhall be with you ſome time to-morrow night, ſcarcely till the middle of it, I know I ſhall be inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of relating to you (what yet you will be anxious to underſtand) the manner of my poor <hi>Harriet's</hi> death, and therefore I will try to ſet it down, as I think I can with leſs miſery to myſelf, upon paper.</p>

                  <p>About an hour before ſhe died, ſhe deſired the nurſe to withdraw, and, taking me gently by the hand, ſhe looked at me for ſome time, was almoſt drowned with her tears, and hid her face within the pillow. Then, having ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what relieved herſelf, ſhe roſe again upon her arm, and with a voice ſcarcely audible, but piercingly tender, ſhe addreſſed me thus:—

Oh, my beſt <hi>Horace!</hi> I have injured thee: I die a victim to the arts of the ſeducer; a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducer under the faireſt form of irreſiſtible virtue. Inquire not who or where he is; reſentment would, perhaps, ruin you both, and GOD can tell, I would not have any miſchief befal either. I have long—</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mrs. <hi>La Motte,</hi> ſhe could not finiſh her ſentence. A ſecond effort gave her juſt the power to ſay, <q>Put the child in my boſom, that we may ſleep together:</q> after which her eyes became fixed full upon mine: I fell upon the bed in exceſſive grief: ſhe ſtruggled hard to give the kiſs which exhauſted nature denied her power to impreſs, and then, half turning upon her ſide, the ſigh came forth that wafted her ſoul to it's Creator, and ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired upon my cheek.</p>
                  <p>Oh, Mrs. <hi>La Motte,</hi> that I could find the ſeducer! Oh, that I could diſcover the dark complotter of all this miſchief! Clergyman as I am, I would make him feel the vengeance of a huſband's arm. I have enquired in vain; not a clue is left me in her pocket-book; the landlord, to whom I applied, without telling him the drift of my application, aſſures me, that ſince my departure from <hi>Buxton,</hi> none

Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the horrid circumſtance happened before our coming to the bath; perhaps the infant is the offspring of ſome other parent; perhaps—Oh, Mrs. <hi>La Motte!</hi> Mrs. <hi>La Motte!</hi> I am bewildered, and wild with a thouſand appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions. But why do I rage thus for revenge? Is that conſiſtent with <hi>my</hi> holy character? Is not the poor object of ſeduction puniſhed ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently? Are not the child and the parent both dead? Ah, my unhappy <hi>Harriet!</hi> I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure thee, I wrong thee! I have juſt kiſſed the clay-cold lip, Mrs. <hi>La Motte.</hi> I will thirſt no more for the blood of the wretch that has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoiled me.

                  <head>LETTER XCIX. Lady Lucy Saxby to Miſs Delia Delmore.</head>
                  <p>HOW ſhall I be able to write a proper anſwer to ſo intereſting a letter as your laſt, in which two ſubjects ſo immediately oppoſite are touched upon? As to poor Mrs. <hi>Mortimer's</hi> health, I anxiouſly hope, ſhe is by this time, again reſtored to a more tolerable degree of it; and yet how much are you all to be pitied in being neceſſarily made the ſpectators of a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition ſo full of fears, hopes, wiſhes, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions! But, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſays, <q>I dreamed a dream laſt night,</q> and I ſhall relate it to my <hi>Delia,</hi> my fair oracle, for interpretation. Methought I was on a ſudden (theſe things are all done ſuddenly) tranſported from the city of <hi>London</hi> to the realms of <hi>Heaven,</hi> where a <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raph,</hi> in the form of my departed ſiſter, (whom you and I uſed ſo much to admire) immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledged me, and addreſſed me thus: <q>Upon what account is my dear <hi>Lucy</hi> come,
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:016020_0259_0F9B2875C6B37FF8"/>
uncalled, to <hi>Elyſium?</hi> or How got ſhe hither without a guide!</q> "I come," ſaid I, <q>in behalf of a dying friend, on the preſervation of whoſe life depends the felicity of mine. Lead me, my ſiſter, to the Angel of <hi>Health,</hi> and I will kneel down and worſhip him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>If that is the purport of your errand to <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyſium,</hi> I fear you are come here in vain,</q> ſaid <hi>Clariſſa:</hi> 
                     <q>there can be no partialities, and yon old, grey-headed, frowning perſonage, you ſee with a ſcythe in his hand, would be very angry if he was but to imagine what you want. Death is above a bribe, ſiſter, you may depend on it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>At this inſtant I beheld a moſt beautiful cherub, with golden plumage expanded, flut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering over my head, and alight by the ſight of me. I trembled and bowed. "Stranger," ſaid the celeſtial figure, <q>I know your buſineſs! put the name of your friend into that little lattice; it leads to the palace of the Angel of <hi>Pity;</hi> approach reverently.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Soon after I had obeyed theſe commands, a door opened, out of which came the moſt ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant appearance of the female ſex that can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be imagined, and with her a ſecond form, whoſe face was ſhaded by a ſnowy veil.—
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:016020_0260_0F9B2875F0BCA770"/>
"Mortal," ſaid the firſt ſplendid figure, <q>the prayer of the affectionate ſhall not be offered in vain; thy friend ſhall live, and lo! here ſhe is in the bloom of beauty, and in the height of health.</q> Saying this, the veil was thrown aſide, and in the ſecond form I imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately recognized the features of <hi>Fanny,</hi> more animated and animating than ever. I ran to embrace the ſiſter of my friend; but the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of <hi>Pity</hi> interpoſed, and after bidding me depart in peace, ſhe waved a golden wand, and then the different emotions occaſioned by the viſion awaked me.</p>
                  <p>And yet, <hi>Delia,</hi> I am perſuaded this dream will be propitious. How truly happy ſhall I be, if you ſend me word that I have made a trip to <hi>Elyſium</hi> to ſome purpoſe. Nor will I, at any rate, ſuffer you to call me ſuperſtitious; for the thing is very probable: ſurely, in reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering ſuch a woman, where ſuch a family and ſuch a huſband are concerned, the Angels of <hi>Pity</hi> and <hi>Health</hi> may very probably be intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I will not excuſe you, if you do not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint me with the ſucceſs of my dream im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately.</p>
                  <p>As to the conduct and converſation of Mr. <hi>Sedley</hi> in the ſummer-houſe, I cannot but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:016020_0261_0F9B2876C39A39D8"/>
his addreſs and ingenuity. His making a confidante of your brother was ſuch a ſtroke of policy as ſhews him to be no ordinary lover; and I can ſee, from the delicate turn of his compliments, and his management of thoſe nameleſs delicacies, (which though called mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute, are amongſt the points of importance) that he is no novice in thoſe matters. You aſk for my ſentiments upon the ſubject: What can I ſay? Have you not ſent me the moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable ſpecimen of his attachment? Was not this attachment diſcovered in a mode peculiar to the elegance of his character? Has he not perſon, manner, fortune, wit, ſenſe? Do you not know what a complexion he has, my dear, when he bluſhes? Has he not, by your own confeſſion, the moſt decorated addreſs, the moſt ſplendid ſentiments, the moſt elevated air? and, Is it not the opinion of your brother, that he never met with any gentleman <q>ſo eaſy, or ſo engaging, in that ſort of behaviour which is the reſult of a brilliant capacity, ornamented breeding, and unaffected complaiſance?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus recommended, then, my dear, on all ſides, how is it poſſible that my ſentiments ſhould not be greatly in his favour? How is it poſſible that I ſhould not wiſh to alter the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſcription

Let her memory eſcape the cenſure even of an ill ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion. I write this upon the road at our reſting-place, while the horſes are baited, and the men refreſhed. Ah, my dear Mrs. <hi>La

Motte,</hi> what a mechanical creature is man! People who are hired for their attendance at a funeral are ſo familiarized to the laſt ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, that they ſmile in their ſables; and, while they are conveying youth and beauty to the tomb, can enjoy the ordinary, every-day e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents of life with as much glee and inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation as if they were carrying the gayeſt bride and bridegroom to the altar. The mourners who came with me, are at this inſtant carouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the next room, while ſhe who uſed heretofore to be the companion of my jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, and made every place a <hi>home</hi> to me by the enchantments of her preſence and ſociety, is waiting their leiſure, and lying in a gloomy vehicle, without any refreſhment whatever.</p>
                  <p>Without refreſhment! What have I ſaid, and how does my preſent <hi>practice</hi> contradict my former <hi>precepts?</hi> Do I forget the rewards of an innocent <hi>ſoul,</hi> and are all my tears ſhed over the breathleſs <hi>body;</hi> which, being no longer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimated by that ſoul, is <hi>nothing?</hi> Surely, I have loſt my wonted ſenſe of religion, and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence—</p>

Though I know the independency of ſoul and body in ſuch a ſituation, though reaſon points out to me their ſeparate ſtate, yet I cannot, all at once, diſunite them. Human Nature, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, pathetic Nature, puts in her plea, and you have too much tenderneſs not to admit it. Do not, therefore, reproach me for ordering ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther covering to be thrown over the hearſe.</p>
                  <p>More weakneſs, Mrs. <hi>La Motte.</hi> I have walked forth, and am a little relieved; the ſhower is over. Do not argue with me, dear friend; while the earth contains the beloved re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of Mrs. <hi>Homeſpun,</hi> I muſt conſider her as claiming from, me reſpect and tenderneſs: the duties even of the huſband, do not termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate till ſhe is in the grave.</p>
                  <p>But the ſable train have finiſhed their repaſt. We are preparing to proceed in our journey. The poſtman is blowing, his horn cloſe beſide me: he ſays this letter will reach you ſome hours before the wretched writer of it. He waits, while I beg of you to be at the Parſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age againſt our arrival: your preſence will be then neceſſary to prevent me from running the gauntlet, through ſtarers and condolers. Such pity is, at ſuch periods, inſupportable. The

hearſe is moving awfully on. I muſt not leave it without one <hi>real</hi> mourner.</p>

                  <head>LETTER CII. Mrs. La Motte to Philip Sedley, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> at Buxton. (After the Return of Mr. Homeſpun.)</head>
                  <p>I Congratulate you, Sir, on your victory over every feeling that ſhould diſtinguiſh the <hi>human</hi> ſpecies from the <hi>brutal:</hi> or rather I ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute you upon your notable tranſmigration! The ſyſtem of the philoſopher, who contended for ſuch a change, you have adopted, <hi>even in this world,</hi> with ſucceſs. Yes, Mr. <hi>Sedley,</hi> you are moſt compleatly <hi>brutalized</hi> indeed. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I have not the <hi>diſhonour</hi> to know you perſonally, I make bold to addreſs a few ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to you, chiefly to acquaint you with what you might otherwiſe be for ſome time ignorant. Your principal victims were buried laſt night, and the ſurvivor is in a fair way of ſoon following them.</p>
                  <p>I could have wiſhed, however, for the ſake of your amuſement, as it ſeems you are
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:016020_0270_0F9B287E36423E58"/>
gratified upon ſuch occaſions, that you had been a ſpectator of this funeral. Though I can eaſily conceive you do not love <hi>preaching,</hi> yet, in the diſcourſe of laſt night, there were ſuch remarks as might have highly diverted ſo <hi>ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated</hi> a mind as yours!</p>
                  <p>But, to drop this ineffectual part of my ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and proceed to another, more likely to excite your curioſity, Do you know, moſt aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous and yet moſt <hi>negligent</hi> Sir, that a part of your treaſures are now in my poſſeſſion? To ſpeak plainer: you muſt know that, amongſt the now uſeleſs cloaths, and other late neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the entombed <hi>Harriet,</hi> was found a <hi>Book,</hi> very thickly marked, both by marginal notes, croſſes of the nail, points of the pen, and ſtrokes of the pencil; and in the fair leaf, next the title, there is written what diſtinguiſhes it to be Mr. <hi>Sedley's</hi> property.</p>
                  <p>Now, it plainly appears, Sir, from the ſeveral parts referred to, that you purpoſely pillaged the volume for the <hi>pernicious,</hi> and rejected the <hi>inſtructive.</hi> This would have been very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, had you contented yourſelf, like other commentators, with reprobating what is <hi>wrong,</hi> in order to ſet it apart from what is <hi>right:</hi> but how could ſuch ordinary methods be expected
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:016020_0271_0F9B287F02DAA6E0"/>
from a perſon ſo very <hi>extraordinary!</hi> You, Sir, have even improved upon your original, and have ingeniouſly laboured to annihilate it's merit, while you perpetuate it's infamy.</p>
                  <p>As an inſtance of this, I ſelect the ſubſequent <hi>well-illuſtrated</hi> paſſages, out of a multitude of others equally amiable. I ſhall place both the Commentator and his Author in a ſeemly, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly manner, and, as you will eaſily recollect, act the part of a faithful <hi>tranſcriber.</hi>

guard thy fame, even with my life, from the breath of detraction.

In a word, <hi>Harriet,</hi> This is the true Volume of Delight. The world is full of maſks, and if you and I put <hi>ours</hi> delicately on, ſo as to talk not of our own affairs, never ſhew Maſter Miniſter H. any contempt, flatter his little oratorical and claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical vanity, and aſſume the proper flexibility, what joys may we not taſte, what treaſures of tenderneſs may we not allow one another!</p>
                     <p>Ah, dear arbitreſs, keep this ſacred volume from every eye but your own: read, and return it to the fondeſt and moſt faithful of men!</p>
                     <p>Here break we off, Mr. <hi>Sedley,</hi> to make way for a reflection; I have always taken notice that your great ſchemers counteract their fondeſt purpoſes.

                  <p>No, my friend, I could not obey the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. I could not, on the other hand, have courage to ſend an apology. About ten mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes after the card was delivered, I heard the dear, well-known voice of <hi>Lady Delmore,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The excellent, moſt revered, and moſt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable Lady, a ſecond time returned unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</p>
                  <p>Oh! <hi>Araminta, Araminta,</hi> how I wept! how my heart yearned to claſp this dear mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to it! but I was all the time labouring with a dreadful circumſtance, which to diſcloſe would produce complicated misfortune.</p>
                  <p>GOD of compaſſion, to what an exigence am I reduced!</p>
                  <p>Scarce had Lady <hi>Delmore</hi> withdrawn, but Mr. <hi>Mortimer</hi> aſcended the ſtairs, and <q>Will not my lovely <hi>Fanny,</hi> will not the wife of my ſoul, condeſcend to oblige us?</q> ſaid he with a ſoftneſs that was a freſh occaſion of diſtreſs to me.</p>
                  <p>I could not, upon this, avoid giving way to ſome incoherent expreſſions, and wild ejacula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, part of which were uttered upon my knees.</p>

                     <pb n="129" facs="unknown:016020_0281_0F9B2888B6B58DE0"/>
The trembling <hi>Mortimer</hi> turned down ſtairs, and preſently I heard the whole family aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in the entry leading to the chambers, conſulting by whiſper.</p>
                  <p>They conclude (I overhear) that my brain is hurt. Ah! that it were, <hi>Araminta.</hi> How, how, my friend, is this to be accounted for, but I would not enter the ſleeping apartment of <hi>Edward Mortimer</hi> for all that the ſun ſurveys beneath its radiance! My ſoul is not polluted!</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>When will the darling of my wiſhes ſuffer me (ſaid <hi>Mortimer</hi> juſt now) to lead her from that melancholy chamber to her own apartment?</q>
                  </p>

                  <p>I recollected my imprudence, and catching up a piece of paper, wrote on it as follows:</p>

                  <l>"Thus to a diſtaff chain'd!"</l>
                  <p>'SDEATH, <hi>Timothy,</hi> "I'm ſped, I'm mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried." In the very flower of my youth, in the bud of my adventures, I'm cut off from all the joys of rambling, by matrimony. In a word, <hi>Timothy,</hi> the firſt fair ſhe that I was <hi>well with,</hi> as the great Lord <hi>Cheſterfield</hi> calls it, complained in form to my maſter, who, in the moment of his rage, drew his ſword, cocked his piſtol, and giving me the choice of two curſed things, namely, death or a wife, would certainly have ſent me to my account, "with all my imperfections on my head," even now broad blown in the middle of May, if I had not fixed upon ſomething: and, although in the confuſion of my fears I have choſen the worſt of the two deſtinies, by taking to my bed the low-born wench I have <hi>ſimulated,</hi> yet, "no man knows the fate he's born to," and I have been to the church with a water-dipper, yea, <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi> with a creature, who for ſome years, hath got her bread by ſtanding at the ſide of the
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:016020_0285_0F9B288BDA21C220"/>
bath, and preſenting a brimmer of the water to the paſſenger. Then ſhe is as inſipid as the water itſelf, and ten times more illiterate than the tumbler that contains it. I marked her out only as a petty experiment, juſt to bring my hand into play, as it were, before I ventured to <hi>Cheſterfieldiſe;</hi> a word, <hi>Timothy,</hi> I collected from <hi>Thornton's</hi> letters, which thou knoweſt I have an occaſional acceſs to, with others. However, my ſpouſe, or rather my ſpoſo, for I would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void vulgar expreſſions, which are "certain characteriſtics of bad company, and a bad edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation," my ſpoſo is wholeſome, pretty, and not ill-made: but as ſhe has not the ſmalleſt degree of <hi>ton</hi> about her, and doth not pretend the moſt diſtant acquaintance with either A, B, C, or any of the twenty-four members in that learned family, I deſpair of ever making her figure as an editor, or, indeed, of collecting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether any of my papers, upon which account, I charge thee, <hi>Timothy,</hi> to preſerve, very cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly, all my letters, notes, minutes, and max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims; and as I ſhall very ſoon travel, (for a wife at home will only give me <hi>eclat</hi> abroad, and thou canſt not believe I will live long with a water-dipper, though ſhe were the Nereid of the ſpring) thou wilt obſerve to tie them up, date them on the backs, docket them, and if

As far as the maxims of his Author extends, in regard to being well with women, he is a wonder. But of this excluſive, between our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, he is a bungler.

truſts them to me, under the ſimple ſafeguard of a wet wafer: my knowledge of the world points out to me the neceſſity of learning all I can, eſpecially when I can make obſervations without being obſerved. But, beſides this, an epiſtle ſo hurried off is but half a letter; for nicely is it noted, that neatneſs in folding up, <hi>ſealing,</hi> and directing, is by no means to be neglected: there is ſomething even in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior of a letter that may pleaſe or diſpleaſe, and conſequently deſerves attention. Thou muſt know, <hi>Timothy,</hi> and I tell it thee in great confidence, that I have beſtowed ſeveral leiſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hours in preparing for thine eye (and in due time for the world, that is, <hi>againſt my will)</hi> a Treatiſe on Tooth-picking, wherein I will ſhew the preciſe method of holding, handling, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and re-placing the dentical inſtruments. Beſides which, I have almoſt ready, an Eſſay on Nail-cutting; and I have gone a great way in bringing to perfection an inſtrument, for which, by the bye, I expect both a reward and a patent, that is ſo contrived, as to curve the nails, prevent their raggedneſs, hinder the fleſh from growing up, and preſerve them ſmooth, even, and tranſparent. And that every thing may be compleat, I have ſketched out a plan for a ſatire againſt tricks and oddities, of which

                  <p>I muſt not, however, forget to appriſe thee of the moſt elaborate of all my works, enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled, The Art of Carving, wherein the adroit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and gentility of doing the honours of the table, without hacking acroſs a bone, without beſpattering the company with the ſauce, and without overturning the glaſſes into our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours pockets, will be critically conſidered.—At the end of my performances I propoſe to annex certain miſcellaneous obſervations on men and manners, ſuch as knowledge of the world, the taking off the hat, offering the hand, making the bow, hanging the ſword, managing the cane, holding the knife and fork, blowing the noſe, and all the et-caetera eſſential to a
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:016020_0289_0F9B288EE35CF698"/>
gentleman. I ſhall, by way of ſupplement, add a few <hi>free</hi> thoughts on modeſt aſſurance, a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veat againſt baſhfulneſs, hints on exterior ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and cautions on flexibility of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; with a key to the heart, or the ſtudy of weakneſſes, infirmities, foibles, and paſſions, illuſtrated: in ſhort, <hi>Timothy,</hi> my labours all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together, will form a complete commentary on <hi>Cheſterfield,</hi> and I would have them lettered on the back thus: <hi>Traverſe</hi> on <hi>Stanhope.</hi> Perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity is a peculiar grace.</p>
                  <p>Oh! <hi>Timothy,</hi> why were talents like mine denied an adequate fortune? Here has <hi>Sedley</hi> been, almoſt a month, catching a pair of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſimulating a couple of petticoats; when I, had my purſe been like his, could have encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed a dozen. To ſay the truth, he has been rather unlucky too, for one of his damſels is dead, and the other is moving off.</p>
                  <p>You will gueſs what a regard I pay to moral character, when, notwithſtanding my poverty, I ſcorn to repair my ſhattered fortunes by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaching him. No, <hi>Timothy,</hi> that would be baſe; let every gentleman's affairs be ſacred: I muſt not wound my feelings. I muſt not be blaſted, <hi>Timothy,</hi> I muſt not be blaſted.</p>
                  <p>

I lament nothing, my friend, but want of <hi>money;</hi> and yet I have been lately thinking, <hi>manner,</hi> may procure even that. Surely, <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy,</hi> the ſame ſprightly powers that can make a cuckold, cannot fail, if dexterouſly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, to help a man's pocket. There is a very rich, old, rheumatical, heavy-heel'd fellow at the bath, whom I have fixed my eye upon, and I am reſolved to try the experiment.</p>
                  <p>Surely the ſerious exterior may befriend us with men as well as women. I know his weakneſſes, and he ſays he is ſure I was born a gentleman. Money I muſt really have.</p>
                  <p>Now, taking a ride upon the King's high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, rather late in the evening, is ſo curſedly hazardous, and I have ſuch an objection to ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guery, that I cannot think of it: but I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded I can ſimulate or diſſimulate (for I hardly know the diſtinction) a purſe or two, and make the perſon ſimulat<hi>ed</hi> pleaſed with himſelf, and much obliged to me for taking it. This is, at worſt, an ingenious way of running round the halter, without putting the neck into it; and if we view it as it ought to be viewed, it is only a notable way of making a man pay ſo much gold for ſo much flattery, ſelf-love, and ſatisfaction.

I delight in the appellation of plain <hi>Tim,</hi> or <hi>Timothy.</hi> You are offended unleſs, Sir, or Mr. precedes the name which was beſtowed upon you by your godfathers and godmothers.</p>

In ſhort, <hi>Tom,</hi> I beg pardon; in ſhort, Mr. <hi>Thomas,</hi> I begin to think, (as we ſo little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble one another, either in our likings or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions) that we had better not put ourſelves for the future to the expence of poſtage; which (as you and your maſter are addicted to go pretty far into the country, and you are apt to write four letters where a man of leſs genius and ſpirit would ſcarce write one) is really a ſerious circumſtance.</p>
                  <p>Not that I ſhould propoſe ſuch a matter nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, were there no other obſtacle in the way: for (to flouriſh for a moment in your mode) I muſt inform you, that</p>
                  <p>"The friends I have, and their adoption try'd, I'd grapple to my heart with hooks of ſteel."</p>
                  <p>Frankly to ſpeak therefore, Mr. <hi>Traverſe,</hi> (tho' you are undoubtedly a youth of parts, and able to do as much harm as any lad I know) you are not the man to my mind. In a word, <hi>Tom,</hi> I never took kindly to you; and ſince your laſt letter, which lies on the table before me, I like you leſs than ever.</p>
                  <p>And ſo you look like a <hi>dog</hi> now you have got a wife, do you, <hi>Tom?</hi> and marriage at three and twenty you call being <hi>cut off.</hi> Take care you
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:016020_0294_0F9B2643F9B73908"/>
are not cut off in your flower <hi>another</hi> way!—For if the ſcheme of <hi>ſimulating</hi> (the meaning of which God knows) the rheumatical Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's money out of his pocket ſhould fail, and you ſhould employ the ſprightly powers you talk of in making him part with it whether he will or no, you may ſtand a chance to be promoted even ſooner than you wiſh.</p>
                  <p>With reſpect to the books you figure ſo much upon, I know nothing about them; and if they relate only to picking of teeth, and turning out of toes, paring of nails, blowing noſes, and taking off hats, I muſt beg to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed having any thing to do with it; in the firſt place becauſe I think I know all theſe things partly as well as his Lordſhip, and, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, ſome of them better. As to knives and forks, I believe I can handle them as well as any nobleman in the univerſe. I am no bad carver, unleſs, I am ſharp ſet; I am not to be told when it is my duty to have my hat under my arm; and, as to the reſt, I never under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, till his <hi>Lordſhip told</hi> me, that it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent to pick the teeth at all in company, if it could be avoided.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall make you laugh, no doubt, when I acquaint you that I approve a cuſtom my maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

                  <p>You wiſh for a full purſe, you ſay, for the ſake of doing more injuries to innocent wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: there we differ again: though I am, in the main, contented with what I <hi>have,</hi> I now and then ſigh for an increaſe of fortune to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute amongſt many worthy people whom I <hi>know</hi> to be under a cloud: and (if I thought you would not ſmile too much) I ſhould ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to tell you, that I have two little orphan couſins in my eye, who ſhall not want a <hi>friend,</hi> if they turn out well, though they have loſt a father: and I have more pleaſure in ſeating my old frail mother her arm-chair by a chearful fire, and giving now and then a neceſſary to a blind brother that I have, all which I pinch out of my perquiſites and wages, than it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible you ſhould even <hi>ſimulate,</hi> as you call it, out of a ſtranger, or get by the ruin of all the men, women, and children, in <hi>Buxton.</hi>

                  <p>OH, <hi>Thornton! Thornton! Thornton!</hi> I muſt write, I muſt fly to thy kind boſom for reſource, although it were only to tell thee that thy prophecy is fulfilled! There walks not the inſulted earth, at this preſent moment, ſuch a raſcal, ſuch a wretch, ſuch a fiend as <hi>Philip Sedley.</hi> Oh, my GOD! what a ſtroke of heart have I this inſtant ſuſtained! The dead of the night, thou knoweſt, is generally my hour for projection; and, as this evening was particularly dark, ſerene, and favourable to my purpoſe of reflecting upon the miſchiefs of the morrow, I left my chamber about eleven o'clock, and took the path that would ſoon have brought me to a little grove, by the ſide of a ſtill ſtreamlet, where I could have indulged "meditation even to madneſs." But, oh, Mr. <hi>Thornton!</hi> what an agonizing interruption met me in the way! As I reached the door where I lately reſided, (for
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:016020_0297_0F9B262178B62488"/>
on <hi>Horace's</hi> return to town I changed my lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings) what, of all things horrible to the heart, doſt thou think I ſaw? Not lightning, not the flames of a burning town, but a ſingle torch, that diſplayed to me <hi>two coffins,</hi> containing the two fair creatures in whoſe fates I had been inſtrumental, carried on the ſhoulders of the attendants to a hearſe that was ſtanding ready to receive them: yes, my friend,—<hi>Harriet Homeſpun,</hi> and the pledge of chaſte embraces, were both paſſing to their laſt home: I gave a ſcream that broke voluntarily from my boſom. I fainted in the arms of a perſon that was ſtanding in a penſive poſture againſt the ſide of the hearſe. Oh, Mr. <hi>Thornton,</hi> it was <hi>Horace</hi> himſelf!—it was the honeſt man, the kind friend, the unſuſpicious prieſt, that I had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured paſt redemption. I recovered only to meet an eye that ſunk me to the earth again; the dominion of the accurſed <hi>Dormer</hi> was paſt. Truth took me by the heart-ſtrings, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience caſt me upon the knee. I had no power over my own faculties; and the God of Nature did as he thought proper. I took the coffin of the wife in my arms: I bathed it with the ſcalding tears of unaffected penitence: I told the poor, trembling, aſtoniſhed prieſt, <hi>whom</hi> he might thank for all his miſeries, <hi>whom</hi> he
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:016020_0298_0F9B26223ABE6808"/>
might conſider as the murderer of his family. I uſually carry with me, in my night-walks, a ſword: I was armed with one at preſent: I offered it to the hand of <hi>Horace.</hi> I tore open my waiſtcoat, bared my breaſt, and begged from him the ſtroke of mercy. He refuſed to give me the death I merited. Cruel man! he left me to <hi>my</hi> GOD! I caught the weapon, ſhortened it, and pointed it at the deteſted heart, that directed the deteſted hand: but even here I was diſappointed by the barbarity of <hi>Horace,</hi> who wrenched it from me ere I had little more than perforated the ſkin; and aſſuring the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants, that I was at times, as now, diſordered in my ſenſes, ordered the hearſe to paſs on.—He mounted his horſe, bade the landlord go quietly to bed, ſay nothing of what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, and, wiping his eyes, rode after the machine that contained the ruins of his family.</p>
                  <p>I was left alone; my ſhame is revealed; every man's tongue will be againſt me on the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.

                  <p>I Am this moment arrived in town from <hi>Bux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> where the body of your wounded friend, Mr. <hi>Sedley,</hi> will be found either by you, or any of thoſe who think it worth while to own him. He has, as I ſuppoſe you know, been the occaſion of the moſt multiplied miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief that ever was, I believe, committed in the ſame ſpace of time, in that or any other town.

                  <p>The ſcene of Mr. <hi>Sedley's</hi> villainy has, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, been already exhibited to the eye of Mr. <hi>Thornton,</hi> who hath, it ſeems, long been his confidant and correſpondent; though he muſt pardon me, if I eſteem <hi>him</hi> leſs worthy the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-minded <hi>Araminta,</hi> who could countenance by his regard, the actions of a <hi>Philip Sedley.</hi>—Happy, however, am I to hear, for his lady's ſake, that the connection is at length diſſolved.

                  <p>NEVER was the ruin of a happy family ſo rapidly completed, as that of your wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Delia Delmore's.</hi> All the fair hopes that I communicated to Lady <hi>Lucy,</hi> in my late letters, are now totally overthrown; and the fairy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect I drew before her eye hath terminated in death and horror. Oh! Lady <hi>Saxby,</hi> I can ſcarce command my hand, or my tears, to enter into explanations: but your kind condolence is the only conſolation now left me, and I will endeavour to collect myſelf.</p>
                  <p>About twelve o'clock, laſt night, a horſeman ſtopt at our door, and knocked loudly for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance. We were ſeated quite out of ſpirits at the table, and had juſt been talking about withdrawing for the night, while poor Mrs. <hi>Mortimer</hi> was lulling her cares to reſt upon the ſopha, having paſt the day in a manner too me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy to deſcribe to you. <hi>William</hi> had ſcarce opened the door, when a perſon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted, from a panting, hard-ridden horſe, and ruſhed into the middle of the ſupper-room without any ceremony. We ſoon diſcovered, through the dreadful metamorphoſe, the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:016020_0303_0F9B2625F85A3178"/>
of Mr. <hi>Sedley,</hi> his waiſtcoat unbuttoned, his hair without a ribbon, his ſhirt ſpotted with blood at the boſom, his face pale and ſquallid, and his eyes beating all the marks of terror and deſperation. Without making any apology for his intruſion, he drew a chair from the ſide of the room, flung himſelf into it, ſtampt his foot twice againſt the floor, ſmote his breaſt with an air of inexpreſſible vengeance, and, taking a paper from his pocket, held it at arm's length, and burſt into tears. By this time our attention was diverted from this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larming object to another ſtill more dreadful; poor <hi>Fanny Mortimer</hi> was in the ſtrongeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions I ever remember to have ſeen. <hi>Sedley</hi> toſſed away the paper, after he had cruſhed it in his hand, and flew like lightning to Mrs. <hi>Mortimer:</hi> my father, mother, and my brother, all aſſiſted: we hurried her up ſtairs: as I had got to the edge of the door, I ſaw Mr. <hi>Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> with a trembling hand, pouring out a glaſs of the brandy, and lean, almoſt ready to ſink, againſt the wainſcot: and juſt as I left the room he took up the paper that <hi>Sedley</hi> had thrown away. It is a good way to any bed-chamber, and the ſtairs are ſleep: we were ſome time reaching <hi>Fanny's</hi> apartment: ſhe remained in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible. When we got her into the bed-room,
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:016020_0304_0F9B2626B8C12CC0"/>
Mr. <hi>Sedley</hi> went down ſtairs; where he had not been two minutes before the words villain! impoſter! murderer! were vehemently rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berated. Sir <hi>Henry</hi> ran to the head of the ſtairs, and ſaying that he diſtinguiſhed the claſhing of ſwords, ran down with the utmoſt precipitation: my mother followed him, and <hi>Fanny</hi> ſtarted from the bed, and ſtaggering at every ſtep, begg'd, for God's ſake, I would conduct her down. Terror gave her ſwiftneſs, horror lent her temporary ſtrength: ſhe was in the ſupper-room in a moment, but even <hi>that</hi> was a moment too late; for Oh! Lady <hi>Lucy,</hi> the deed was done. Mr. <hi>Sedley</hi> was on the ground, writhing in blood, and Mr. <hi>Mortimer</hi> was ſobbing in his chair, with the weapon of deſtruction ſmoaking in his hand. <hi>Fanny Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer</hi> ſaw, ſhriek'd, ſhiver'd, and fell down: even at this moment ſhe lies diſtracted. Her ſenſes are quite gone: neither bleeding, chaſing nor any other applications can recover her; ſhe pierces us to the heart with her cries. She execrates firſt <hi>Sedley,</hi> then herſelf, then <hi>Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: Sedley</hi> is put into one of our beds; my poor father wiſhes to huſh the horrid affair as long as poſſible.

                  <p>Theſe are, I perceive, ſelected from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious volumes of the late Lord <hi>Cheſterfield,</hi> whoſe letters falling into the hand of any vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous character, might very naturally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce effects the moſt dreadful.

not dead: her ſenſes are in ſome meaſure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to her; and perhaps the life of her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, huſband, and father, may be made ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable by her preſervation. In the midſt of my own miſery, Sir, I have a wiſh for the nuptial joy of you, and the amiable young lady to whom you are now ſo tenderly united. I formerly knew the brave Lieutenant <hi>Vernon,</hi> and I beg the compliments of a forlorn parent may be made welcome to him: recollect me, alſo, kindly to Mrs. <hi>Thornton,</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.</hi> The corpſe of Mr. <hi>Sedley</hi> ſhall be ſent to your addreſs, as ſoon as the hearſe can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided.

                  <p>PROVIDENCE and Felicity ſeem again diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ſmile upon us. The trial and honourable acquittal of Mr. <hi>Mortimer</hi> is over: and the thouſand tender aſſurances he has given his <hi>Fanny,</hi> (whom Heaven has ſpared to us) that the violence ſhe ſuſtained, is quite for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, have contributed, with the careſſes of her affectionate parents, to reconcile her to that life, which GOD ſeems intending to continue. Though extremely weak, ſhe is in perfect poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of her ſenſes, and mends every day.—There is certainly ſome turn in her favour, and perhaps ſhe is preſerved as an example of Almighty benignity, that will not deſert perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering goodneſs, and patient affliction. The truth of Mr. <hi>Sedley's</hi> death, I mean as to the preciſe occaſion of it, is little known. The Judge was extremely delicate on the ſubject: ſo was every body concerned. Mr. <hi>Sedley's</hi> rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have not wept over the aſhes of their kinſman, nor does any body ſeem to regret,—

though every body profeſſes to be aſtoniſhed. For my own part, I heartily deteſt his memory. Mr. <hi>Mortimer</hi> is ſo truly tender of <hi>Fanny,</hi> that her gratitude ſeems ripening into love: none e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver deſerved a fonder return than our <hi>Mortimer.</hi>
