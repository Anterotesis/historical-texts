            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE following Queries and Remarks <hi>ſeem</hi> to us to concern Matters of the utmoſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance. We are repreſented in Scripture as Pilgrims and Travellers to a better Country; and as a <hi>wrong Choice of the Road</hi> may ruin us eternally, we ought to <hi>examine</hi> every Step we tread, and take Notice that our Guides be not <hi>blind</hi> nor <hi>miſtaken,</hi> leſt they lead us aſtray. None can blame us when our Souls are in Danger of eternal Ruin, to look to our ſelves, and to ſecure the one Thing need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; nor dare we allow ourſelves to fellow the Multitude, if we fear they go aſtray; nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard any Man further than he follows Chriſt: And we hope this will juſtify us in what we have done in the following Pages; for, if all our Chriſtian Brethren, who may think it worth while to read our Remarks, have ſuch
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:004588_0005_100D834B1E70ADC8"/>
ſuperior Attainmments as to <hi>ſee clearly,</hi> that all that Mr. <hi>Whitfield</hi> has printed, is ſound and agreeable to the holy Scriptures; yet we hope that their Chriſtian Charity is ſo great, that they will not condemn us for applying as we have done to our Teachers, and by their Advice to Mr. <hi>Whitfield</hi> himſelf, to remove ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Stumbling-Blocks out of our Way. We cannot help thinking for ourſelves and judging of Things according to the Light they appear in; and we promiſe, that when that Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſatisfies us in theſe Things, we will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him; and we <hi>cannot</hi> do it ſooner. But when we reflect, that he is but a Man; that great and good Men have <hi>been miſtaken;</hi> and that Infalibility <hi>(as far as we know)</hi> is entailed neither on him nor his followers, we hope that both he and they are better Chriſtians than to blame us if we can be the Inſtruments of pointing out their Miſtakes, <hi>if there be any:</hi> We believe, that they regard their Souls, and will look on it as the moſt eminent Service can be done them, if by our Means they receive a Kindneſs that will turn to their Account, through a boundleſs Eternity.</p>
            <p>We confeſs, that we are at a Loſs to know what to make of ſome of his Expreſſions; if they have <hi>any Meaning at all,</hi> we fear it is
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:004588_0006_100DA599A0257248"/>
a bad one; and will rejoice to find ourſelves diſappointed, if he ſhews us that they are ſound and good. But if he pretends Hurry or Want of Time, and <hi>does not either juſtify</hi> or <hi>condemn them,</hi> or give us <hi>ſome Satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> he will <hi>conſtrain</hi> us to think, that he has his own <hi>Glory</hi> in View more than the <hi>Glory</hi> of God or the <hi>Good</hi> of his Church. He has ſuch <hi>high</hi> Conceptions of Man, or ſuch <hi>low</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of God, that we fear he has <hi>juſt</hi> Conceptions of neither; to ſay, "That Man was adorned with all the Perfections of the Deity, That he was the Perfection of the <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> and <hi>material World,</hi>" as he does, <hi>Pag. 17. Vol. 2d. of Sermons,</hi> is what we can <hi>neither believe,</hi> nor find Ground from Reaſon nor Revelation to ſupport it. When our Divines prove the Divinity of our bleſſed Lord, they ſometimes do it <hi>(we think to a good Purpoſe)</hi> by proving, that the Scriptures attribute to him <hi>all the Perfections of the Deity,</hi> and of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence that he is the eternal God, equal with the Father and Holy Spirit; but if a <hi>meer Man</hi> may be adorned with <hi>all theſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,</hi> we know not what to make of this Argument, 'till he give us better Light.</p>
            <p>Again if Men be baptized <hi>into the Nature</hi> of the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, as he ſeems
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:004588_0007_100DA59B2C816AD8"/>
to aſſert, <hi>p. 128, vol. 2.</hi> is not this to make them, on their Converſion, Partakers of the Godhead, or ſomeway equal to the Supream Being? What ſhall we think of the Doctrine, that one while <hi>finks us</hi> into <hi>Brutes and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels,</hi> and <hi>again exalts</hi> us to be equal to <hi>God?</hi> This puts us in Mind of ſome <hi>Antinomian</hi> Reveries, of being goded with God, and chriſted with Chriſt: And we hope the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders will pardon us, tho' we deſire to get Light in theſe Things, ſeeing it is our great Concern to have <hi>right Notions of God</hi> and <hi>ourſelves,</hi> and to Act accordingly.</p>
            <p>When we hear him tell us, "That the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate waſhes away the Guilt of Sin <hi>by the Tears</hi> of a ſincere Repentance, <hi>joined with</hi> Faith in the Blood of Chriſt," <hi>p. 22, 23. vol. 2.</hi> we think that it ſavours of <hi>Popery and Arminianiſm,</hi> to join any Thing with the Blood of Chriſt to waſh away Sin; and hope it will offend none, that we cannot believe this on his <hi>bare Word</hi> contrary to many Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Texts, for we abhor an implicit Faith. Is not that Expreſſion of the ſame <hi>Stamp? Vol. 1, p. 7.</hi> Where he ſays, "That a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Aim at God's Glory, — <hi>alone</hi> can ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our Actions <hi>acceptable</hi> in God's Sight:" If a ſingle Aim at God's Glory <hi>alone</hi> can ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:004588_0008_100DA59D48F81CB0"/>
our Actions acceptable in his Sight, what need is there for the Blood of Chriſt? We hope none of our Brethren will be offended, that we cannot believe this <hi>popiſh</hi> Doctrine, till he explain or prove it from Scripture.</p>
            <p>He further tells us, <hi>p. 128. vol. 2.</hi> (if we miſtake him not) "That our Lord commanded his Diſciples to baptize Men <hi>into</hi> the Nature of the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt," which is either to convert them, or rather to make them equal with God: And if he has given Men <hi>Ability</hi> to do either the one or the other, by repeating the Words of the Inſtitution; Why <hi>may</hi> they not as eaſily change a Wafer into his Body and Blood? And this <hi>ſmells of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,</hi> and will <hi>ſupport</hi> the Doctrine of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantion. — When he tells us, "That we muſt be juſtified by the inherent Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt, "if by this he intends our Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, or good Habits, and good Works per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the Aid of the Spirit, does not he here again give another <hi>fair Invitation</hi> to bring us to <hi>Rome?</hi> And we hope we will be excuſed from <hi>ſetting</hi> our Face <hi>that Way,</hi> till we be once convinced, that it is the <hi>ſure Road</hi> to eternal Happineſs. Are not theſe Doctrines full of <hi>Arminianiſm?</hi> And 'tis no Wonder, that we are ſurprized to find them in his <hi>own
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:004588_0009_100DA59ED8615928"/>
Writings,</hi> and to hear him <hi>continually ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud</hi> Mr. <hi>Weſtly,</hi> who (we are informed) is an <hi>Arminian,</hi> when we find him cry them down in <hi>all but</hi> themſelves: We <hi>deteſt</hi> theſe <hi>Errors</hi> in both, and cannot ſee through this Piece of Management.</p>
            <p>But poſſibly by inherent Righteouſneſs, in <hi>vol. 1. p. 16.</hi> he underſtands the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt inherent in us; if ſo, we hope every one will deſire to know, as well as our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, how the <hi>infinite Righteouſneſs</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt can inhere in a <hi>finite</hi> Creature? Unleſs, as has been already obſerved, he make the Believer in ſome Meaſure equal with God; but when we compare this with Mr. <hi>Flavel's 2d Appendix, vol. 1. Fol.</hi> and find it the <hi>ſeventh Antinomian Error,</hi> that he there condemns, what can we ſay? When we find Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> countenancing Mr. <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly's</hi> Preface to <hi>Halyburton's Memoirs,</hi> which is <hi>big</hi> with <hi>Antinomian Abſurdities;</hi> when he can <hi>applaud</hi> that Gentleman, and not diſcover the <hi>falſe Divinity,</hi> that he has there ſent a broad to poiſon the World; Can we think that himſelf is ſound? When he tells us in his Letter againſt the Book, entitled, <hi>The Whole Duty of Man, p. 4,</hi> and <hi>5.</hi> "That <hi>God never made a ſecond Covenant with</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:004588_0010_100DA5A0CCB806F8"/>
Adam <hi>himſelf, nor any of his Poſterity; That it is a Promiſe</hi> and no Covenant; <hi>That there are no Terms</hi> nor <hi>Conditions</hi> in it." We cannot take his <hi>bare Word,</hi> while we think that above <hi>one hundred and Fifty Texts</hi> in our Bibles aſſert the <hi>contrary.</hi> How many of our ableſt Divines have long ſince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed this wild <hi>Antinomian Notion?</hi> And among others, Mr. <hi>Flavel, Vol. 1. Fol.</hi> in his <hi>2d Appendix.</hi> where he <hi>expoſes</hi> it as the <hi>Ninth</hi> of their Errors.</p>
            <p>When we find him, <hi>vol. 1. p. 7.</hi> giving Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why Men muſt be <hi>New Creatures,</hi> in order to <hi>qualify them</hi> to be <hi>ſavingly in Chriſt,</hi> Why does he condemn Archbiſhop <hi>Tillotſon;</hi> Letter firſt againſt the Archbiſhop, <hi>page the 3d.</hi> for ſhewing the Nature of <hi>Regeneration</hi> and its <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> in order to <hi>our Juſtification</hi> and <hi>Salvation?</hi> Is not the <hi>New Creature</hi> in Mr. <hi>Whitefield,</hi> and the <hi>Regenerate</hi> in the Archbiſhop's Words, of the <hi>ſame Meaning</hi> and <hi>Import?</hi> Is not <hi>being ſavingly in Chriſt,</hi> as the Firſt <hi>expreſſes</hi> it, and <hi>obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Juſtification</hi> and <hi>Salvation,</hi> as the other <hi>has</hi> it, the very ſame Thing? Why did not Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> correct this Error in <hi>his own</hi> Writings, as well as in the others? If it be an Error in the one, to ſay, That we muſt be

<pb n="14" facs="unknown:004588_0014_100DA5AB70DA1698"/>
beſt Peruſal we could make of them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, we find that great Part of his Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings do anſwer the Character given them, as being ſound, yet, to our great Surprize, we every now and then ſtumble upon ſomething that ſeems to jar with thoſe ſounder Parts, as well as with other good Books; and, if we be not miſtaken, with Scripture and ſound Reaſon.— Our Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies hereanent, whether Right or Wrong, giving us ſome Uneaſineſs, we were much perplexed what to do: If we ſhould think of going to ſome of Mr <hi>Whitefield</hi>'s warm Adherents, we were afraid, by Reaſon of the Treatment that others (and it may be ſome of ourſelves) met with, that nothing could be expected thereby, but incenſing them againſt us, to call us blind and carnal Men, as uſual. Now tho' Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> himſelf, by ſome Part of his Writings, would ſeem to be a Man of another Spirit and Sentiments from ſuch warm inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Adherents, as appears by many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions in his Letters againſt Archbiſhop <hi>Tillotſon,</hi> and the Author of <hi>The Whole Duty of Man;</hi> particularly by his taxing the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters for acting very partially, for not ſpeaking ſo explicitly as they ought againſt

the Archbiſhop's Doctrine, when known to be contrary to the Truth of the Goſpel, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, the Arch-biſhop was their Friend, and behaved with much Moderation towards them, whilſt he lived; we cannot ſee, how be could, conſiſtent with this, tax any of the Lovers of Truth for acting unchriſtianly, for enquiring into the Reaſons of ſome of his Aſſertions, when we judge that they appear to us as contrary to Truth as ſome of the ſaid Archbiſhop's Doctrines: For, if we miſtake not, it is the Duty and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of every doubting Chriſtian, to enquire into the Reaſons of the plaineſt Scripture Doctrine, when he heſitates about it: But we ſhould not ſpeak explicitly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any Doctrine, but what upon mature Deliberation we have found falſe. But when we conſider the Treatment a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Miniſter had from Mr. <hi>Whitfield</hi>'s warm Adherents, and their Cries ſtill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him for deſiring a Conference with Mr. <hi>Whitfield,</hi> about ſome Points in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, which ſaid Miniſter was in Doubts about; we do diſpair of Acceſs to him.</p>
            <p>The only Remedy therefore left us, to ſolve us of our Doubts, as we ſee, is, an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to you our Teachers, now in Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery

met, and ſetting our Scruples in order before you: And we promiſe, that if you, or any of you, can ſatisfy us with Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and ſound Reaſon, we ſhall not only chearfully ſubmit to the ſame, but alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn you our moſt hearty Thanks, as coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Diſcovery of Truth our Gain and Joy. But if you decline, or cannot agree among yourſelves, about ſolving us herein, we deſire your Judgments, whether it be any Breach of Order, for us, at our own Expences, and ſuch as ſhall join with us, to put our Scruples into Print, that ſo there may be an Opportunity given to Mr. <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> to clear his Doctrine, if miſrepreſented or miſapprehended by us: And that we may make a fair Eſſay to have our Doubts cleared, which for the preſent ſeem to be Bars and Letts to hinder us to join with our Chriſtian Brethren in Matters of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Concern, with that Oneneſs of Mind and Heart, which is deſirable and neceſſary for our mutual Comfort: For when one Side is as zealous for, as the other is jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of a controverted Point, and Aſſertions about it in Matters of Conſcience, it is well known how Difficult it is to go Hand in Hand. We find by Experience, that the

We have therefore endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to put our Scruples in the moſt inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Way we could, by not only tranſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome Paragraphs out of Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi>'s Printed Writings; but alſo, according to our Capacities, we have endeavoured to propoſe our Doubts by raiſing proper Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries upon ſuch Paragraphs, as follows.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> in his Sermon on <hi>Acts</hi> 19.5. <hi>Page.</hi> 5. * where ſpeaking of Man's Creation, he has theſe Words, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>He, <hi>that is God,</hi> breathed into Man the Breath of ſpiritual Life, and his Soul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came adorned with all the Perfections of the Deity.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> I. Muſt not that Man have either very diminutive Thoughts of God, or elſe mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrouſly exalted Thoughts of Man, that can think, much more ſpeak and write, that the Soul of Man in its beſt State was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned with all the Perfections of the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty!
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:004588_0018_100DA5B44CD7B458"/>
What then is become of the Diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that all ſound Divines make between the communicable and incommunicable At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes of God? Doth not Scripture and Reaſon ſupport this neceſſary Diſtinction? if the Soul of Man was adorned with all the Perfections of the Deity, without Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of any, what is the native and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Conſequence therefrom, but that the Soul then was in ſome ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rt equal to God; which is too horrid to u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er, without a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of it? Were not Expreſſions of this Import condemn'd for Blaſphemies in the Mouths of <hi>Fox</hi> and <hi>Naylor?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. In the ſame Sermon, <hi>p.</hi> 9. [<hi>Vol.</hi> II. <hi>p.</hi> 22, 23.] Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> ſpeaking of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, when fallen into Sin, hath theſe Words: <q>
                  <hi>He,</hi> i. e. <hi>The Regenerate Perſon, quickly</hi> Riſes <hi>again, and goes out from the World, and weeps bitterly,</hi> waſhes away the Guilt of Sin, by the Tears <hi>of a ſincere Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> join'd with Faith in the <hi>Blood of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quer.</hi> I. Is not the Blood of Chriſt to be applied by Faith, the <hi>ſole</hi> or <hi>only</hi> Laver, to waſh away the <hi>Guilt</hi> of Sin, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.7. 'Tis true, Faith in grown Believers, to make Application of his Blood to the Soul, muſt
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:004588_0019_100DA5B5E3508318"/>
be exerciſed thereon: And it is true, that a Believer muſt renew the Exerciſes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, in order to regain the Senſe of Pardon; but ſtill, what <hi>ſolely</hi> obtains the Pardon, and blots out the <hi>Guilt,</hi> is the Blood of the attoning Sacrifice. Is it not by our Juſtification that the Guilt of Sin is waſhed away? How then can there be any Room to <hi>join</hi> our <hi>Tears</hi> with Faith in the Blood of Chriſt, to juſtify us before God, without we ſuppoſe the Satisfaction of the Croſs to be incompleat? By what Art can our Tears be <hi>joined</hi> with Faith in the Blood of Chriſt to cleanſe away the <hi>Guilt</hi> of Sin? What Quantity of the one and of the other will make a due Compoſition, without ſpoiling the whole? Why may not ſome Grains of new Obedience be again added to our Tears to make the Compoſition more compleat; for ſurely this is Duty, and a neceſſary Fruit of Faith as well as godly Sorrow, and as inſeperable from it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quer.</hi> II. How is this conſiſtent with what Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> himſelf ſaith, in his Letter againſt the Book entituled the Whole Duty of Man, <hi>p.</hi> 6. <q>God's Law was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, Jeſus Chriſt fulfilled it in our ſteads; and upon account of that Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs

imputed to us, and received by Faith, and <hi>not</hi> on our <hi>hearty Endeavour</hi> or <hi>Repentance,</hi> are we accepted by him?" What is there in our <hi>hearty Endeavour</hi> or <hi>Repentance,</hi> to recommend us to the Favour of God, or render them worthy of <hi>being joined</hi> with the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt; as tho' that was not <hi>ſufficient</hi> of itſelf?</q> Further, Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> adds the Words of pious Biſhop <hi>Beveridge</hi> to the ſame purpoſe, <hi>p.</hi> 7. who ſaith, <q>Nay I cannot confeſs my Sins, but my very Confeſſions are ſtill Agra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of them: My Repentings need to be repented of: <hi>My Tears need Waſhing;</hi> and the very <hi>Waſhing</hi> of <hi>my Tears</hi> need ſtill to be waſhed over again with the Blood of my Redeemer.</q> Now if Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> ſpeaks right in <hi>p.</hi> 8. of the ſame Letter; <hi>for there is no Hopes of bringing People to the right Knowledge of the Goſpel, till their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite tho' erroneous Authors, are diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced and laid aſide:</hi> And it is therefore accounted a becoming Zeal in Mr. <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> to write warmly and keenly againſt the Writings of others upon this Account; How then can others be blamed for oppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch Expreſſions in <hi>Whitefield</hi>'s Books as are as erroneous as thoſe he condemns in
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:004588_0021_100DA5BA9E038478"/>
others? Nay, ſhould not Mr. <hi>Whitefield,</hi> and his warm Adherents, be as careful in Correcting his own Sermons as the Books of others, if found faulty in ſome of the ſame Points, or other Points as material? if it be ſaid, that Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> is ſo buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly employ'd in Preaching, and Writing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt other Men's Writings, that he hath no Time to look back upon his former Writings; may not ſome of his Adherents aſſiſt herein to a good Purpoſe? Or if a By-Stander ſhould mark ſome of thoſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions that look exceptionable; by what Rule, but that of Contraries, can he be judged an Oppoſer of God's Work, or of the Goſpel?</p>
            <p n="3">III. In the ſame Sermon, <hi>p.</hi> 18. [<hi>vol.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 33.] He ſaith, <q>You have paſſed thro' the Pangs of the New-Birth and now rejoice, that the <hi>Man</hi> Chriſt Jeſus is <hi>ſpiritually</hi> form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in your Hearts.</q> To the ſame Purpoſe, if we rightly apprehend it, is what we find in the Letter aforeſaid, <hi>p.</hi> 5. where paraphraſing upon thoſe Words, <hi>The Seed of the Woman ſhall bruiſe the Serpent's Head;</hi> Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> writes thus, <q>The Seed of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <hi>i. e.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt (who in all Probability was <hi>ſpiritually</hi> conceived that inſtant in the

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> I. Had the Man Chriſt Jeſus a read tho' a ſpiritual Being or Conception in the Days of <hi>Eve?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> II. <hi>What</hi> or <hi>who</hi> was that which was <hi>ſpiritually conceived</hi> that Inſtant in the <hi>Heart of</hi> Eve, wherein the Promiſe was given, but the <hi>New-Creature,</hi> or the Image of Chriſt? If ſo, in what Senſe can the New Creature, or Image of Chriſt in us, be called <hi>the Seed of the Woman,</hi> or <hi>the Man Chriſt Jeſus?</hi> Is the Man Chriſt Jeſus, and the New Creature in us, one and the ſame? Are we to believe in the New Creature, as the Chriſt held forth in this Promiſe? How, or when, did this New Creature, or this ſpiritual Man Chriſt Jeſus, who then had a Conception, bruiſe the Serpent's Head by his Obedience and Sufferings? Had the Man Chriſt Jeſus, as the Seed of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, any other Conception, beſides that ſuppernatural One by the Power of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:004588_0023_100DA5BEF0BDA558"/>
Ghoſt, in the Womb of the Virgin <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry?</hi> We would be glad to know, where there is any Scripture Ground to ſupport the ſpiritual Conception of Chriſt, as the Seed of the Woman; or the ſpiritual Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of Chriſt? Are not theſe Notions as unintelligible as thoſe of <hi>Barclay</hi> in his <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, p.</hi> 135. 136. where he ſpeaks of <hi>the Chriſt within?</hi> It is true, the Apoſtle ſpeaks of <hi>Forming of Chriſt in us, Gal.</hi> 4.19. but are we not to underſtand that Place as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the Image, and not the Perſon of Chriſt, as God-Man? much leſs, can we underſtand it of Chriſt, as the Seed of the Woman, or as Man. We hope we do (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our Meaſure) underſtand what it is to feed on a crucified Chriſt; but yet, we would deſire to know what is that <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Body</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual Blood,</hi> with which Souls are nouriſhed? Is this <hi>ſpiritual Body and Blood of Chriſt, Humane</hi> or <hi>Divine?</hi> Are theſe <hi>finite</hi> or <hi>infinite?</hi> Was it not the natural Body of Chriſt that ſuffered for us? Was it not the natural Blood of Chriſt that was ſhed for our Sins? How then can we feed upon the ſpiritual Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, which never (as we know of) had a Being in Heaven, nor on Earth? It
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:004588_0024_100DA5C0828FD688"/>
is true, we own, according to the Scriptures, that Chriſt's Soul and Body have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone a glorious and an ineffable Change; ſo that if we ſpeak of Chriſt's Body, as it now ſubſiſts in an exalted State, it may well be called <hi>a ſpiritual Body:</hi> But yet, when we feed by Faith on a crucified Chriſt, doth not Faith look to Chriſt's Body as Hanging on the Croſs; and to the real Sufferings of Chriſt in his humane Nature in a State of Humiliation, as what attones Juſtice for us, and as what feeds and nouriſhes our Souls?</p>
            <p n="4">IV. In the aforeſaid written Letter againſt the Book entituled, <hi>The whole Duty of Man,</hi> wherein Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> quotes the 17th Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph of the Preface of that Book, wherein the Author, as Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> obſerves, talking of the ſecond Covenant, ſpeaks thus: <q>The ſecond Covenant, ſays he, was made with <hi>Adam,</hi> and us in him, preſently after his Fall, and is briefly contained in theſe Words, <hi>Gen. 3.15.</hi> where God declares, that the Seed of the Woman ſhall bruiſe the Serpent's Head: And this was made up, as the Firſt was, of ſome Mercies to be afforded us by God, and ſome Duties to be performed by us." 'Who that is any way enlightned, cannot but ſee the falſe Divinity and funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:004588_0025_100DA5C2994F9958"/>
Errors of this Paſſage: For how can it be proved, that the ſecond Covenant was made with <hi>Adam,</hi> or that God ever entered into any Covenant at all with Man after he had broken the Firſt? It is true, God the Father did enter into a ſecond Covenant (and that from all Eternity) with the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> the God-Man Chriſt Jeſus, in our Stead: But it cannot be proved, that he made any ſecond Covenant at all with <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf, or any of his Poſterity.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Before we come to propoſe Queries on this Head, it will not be amiſs to premiſe a Word or two, to prevent Miſtakes, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. We freely grant that Chriſt Jeſus is our ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> our common Head and Surity in the ſecond Covenant, and that the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> was only a private Believer or Perſon, and ſo muſt come in, or enter into Covenant with God by or thro' a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, and at a ſecond Hand (if we may ſo ſpeak) as well as we his Poſterity. And when we read the 16th Paragraph of the Preface of that 'fore cited Book, we cannot but judge that the Author thereof doth ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly own this, when he ſaith, <q>For tho' by that Sin of <hi>Adam,</hi> all Mankind were under the Sentence of eternal Condemnation, yet it
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:004588_0026_100DA5C5A2D98DF8"/>
pleaſed God ſo far to pity our Miſery, as to give us his Son, and in him to make a new Covenant with us, after we had broken the Firſt.</q> Thus far the Author ſeems ſound enough.</p>
            <p>Whether the next Paragraph that Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> condemns may bear a favourable Conſtruction, we leave you to judge; but we cannot but heartily join with him in ſhewing our Diſlike to whatſoever in <hi>any Author may miſlead the Weak or Ignorant, or countenance the Erroneous:</hi> Yet, whether this may lay Foundation for ſuch a <hi>hard Cenſure</hi> as that he was <hi>not a Real Chriſtian at Heart,</hi> or had not ſo much as <hi>a Head Knowledge of the Goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> aſſerts, is what we are at a Loſs to determine? How would Mr. <hi>Whitefield,</hi> or ſome of his warm Adherents, like it, if another would take the ſame Liberty to cenſure his Writings, and him for them, to the ſame Degree? Upon the like Ground, we muſt, and do condemn the Author of <hi>The whole Duty of Man,</hi> for aſſerting that the ſecond Covenant was made with <hi>Adam,</hi> and us in him, if thereby is meant, his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our publick Head and Surety in the ſecond Covenant. And may we not alſo
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:004588_0027_100DA5C7BA9B2898"/>
condemn Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> for running into another Extreme and an Error, that ſeems as dangerous as this, in aſſerting that God never made any ſecond Covenant at all with <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf, or any of his Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? And muſt beg Leave to lay before you the following Queries.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> I. How can Chriſt be a Mediator of the new Covenant, if there be no other Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the Covenant, but God the Father, and Chriſt engaging for us? Muſt not the Elect or Believers, be conſidered as a third Party in the ſecond Covenant?</p>

               <hi>Q.</hi> II. How can the new Covenant be called a Teſtament, and Chriſt the Teſtator of it, if there be no Parties in it but the Father and him? He receives all from the Father as Mediator: On whom then doth he beſtow Legacies, without there be a third Party in this Covenant?</p>

               <hi>Q.</hi> IV. How can any juſtify Mr. <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi>'s Calling the ſecond Covenant <hi>a bare Promiſe,</hi> and that in a Way of <hi>Diſtinction from</hi> and <hi>Oppoſition to</hi> its being a Covenant? when the Apoſtle calls it, in Reſpect of the ſeveral Editions of it, <hi>the Covenants of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, Eph.</hi> 2.12. Is there any Promiſe made to the Sinner or Believer, but what is or may be, yea, muſt be owned to be a ſecond Covenant Promiſe? And are not all that are Strangers to the Covenant of Promiſe, or out of the Bond of the ſecond Covenant, without God, without Chriſt, and without Hope? How poor then is the Condition of all the Poſterity of <hi>Adam,</hi> if it cannot be proven, that God did make a ſecond Covenant with any of them?

               <hi>Q.</hi> VI. Is it any Thing like a ſolid Way of Arguing, for Men to ſay, that there is a Covenant of Redemption, therefore there is no Covenant of Grace; when the very Deſign of the one was to lay a Foundation for the other: Or, becauſe there is a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant made with the Redeemer, therefore there is none made with the Redeemed Ones, to whom Chriſt is ſaid to be <hi>given as a Covenant of the People?</hi> Is it any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that becauſe there was a Covenant made with Chriſt as ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Head of his elect Seed; therefore there was no Covenant made with his Seed in Time? Is it any Argument that becauſe
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:004588_0030_100DA5CD24D23D30"/>
there was a Council of Peace from all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, between the Father and the Son, that therefore there is no Covenant of Peace and Reconciliation tranſacted in Time, thro' the Mediator, with fallen Sinners? How could the former be of any Uſe without the latter follow?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> VII. If it be ſaid, that the ſecond Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant could not be made with <hi>Adam,</hi> or any of his Poſterity, becauſe it was made primarily with Chriſt; may not we as well ſay, that the firſt Covenant was not at all made with us, becauſe it was made pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily with <hi>Adam,</hi> as our Surety and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant Head? Was not the very mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the firſt Covenant with <hi>Adam,</hi> as a publick Perſon, the making of that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant at leaſt virtually with us in him? Was not the making of the ſecond Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with Chriſt as a publick Perſon, vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualy the making that Covenant with us? Did not the Conſent of our Repreſentative make us Parties in the firſt Covenant? Why then will not the Conſent of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Adam</hi> make his Covenant-Seed Parties in his Covenant as well? If the Conſent of our Repreſentative doth not make us Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the firſt Covenant, how are we born
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:004588_0031_100DA5D0093E97A8"/>
under the Guilt of <hi>Adam</hi>'s firſt Sin? How are Infants in the Womb bereaved of Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Righteouſneſs and born in Sin? Is not the Original Pollutions of our Natures the Fruit and Puniſhment of the firſt Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of <hi>Adam?</hi> If an implicite Conſent to the Terms of the firſt Covenant in grown Perſons, and acting accordingly, be a Bond firm enough to keep and hold us Parties in that Covenant; Why will not an explicite Conſent to the Terms of the ſecond Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant make us Covenanters with God? Do not Believers, when they come to believe and profeſs Faith in Chriſt, as expreſsly and explicitly enter under the Bond of the ſecond Covenant, as any of the Sons of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> ever entered into the Bond of the firſt? Beſides, if the Conſent of our Head and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rety in the ſecond Covenant, doth not make us Subjects and Parties in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; How then can Infants be regenerated and ſaved?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> VIII. If there be not any ſecond Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant at all made with Men, how can the Sacraments be called ſealing Ordinances? Can they Seal the Covenant to us, if it be true there is <hi>none</hi> made with us? Can the Covenant be confirmed to us by Seals, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:004588_0032_100DA5D21AFC14C0"/>
or without it is made with us? And doth not Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> ſeem to allow, that the Sacraments are ſealing Ordinances? when he ſaith in his Journal, <hi>p.</hi> 110. <q>This Day <hi>24</hi> Years, was I baptized; Lord! to what little Purpoſe have I lived? However, I ſealed my <hi>baptiſmal Covenant</hi> with my dear Saviour's moſt bleſſed Body and Blood, and truſt in his Strength I ſhall keep and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it.</q> Now, what Covenant is that, which is tranſacted over between God and Believers in all Ages, in the Uſe of ſealing Ordinances, if it be not the Covenant of Grace, or the ſecond Covenant?</p>
            <p n="5">V. In the ſame Letter, <hi>p.</hi> 4. Mr. <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> further Aſks, Where any Covenant is contained in theſe Words, "the Seed of the Woman ſhall bruiſe the Serpent's Head," and how it is "made up of ſome Mercies to be afforded by God, and ſome Duties to be performed by us?" Here is a free Gift and Promiſe of Salvation made to <hi>Adam,</hi> but no Covenant. Here is not a Word of a <hi>Condition mentioned.</hi> — No, it was the free Gift of God in Chriſt.—</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> I. Was not here (beſides a Promiſe of Salvation through Chriſt) ſo alſo the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Chriſt himſelf to be a Saviour and

            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> II. Tho' we freely grant there is no expreſs Condition mentioned in ſaid Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, yet we would again aſk doth not every Promiſe in our Bible, in the Nature fo it, require Faith to believe and embrace it, before we can reap the Benefit of it, and conſequently contain an <hi>implicit Condition?</hi> beſides what are the both Teſtaments, but a fuller Explication of this Promiſe? And is it not evident, that there are many <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Promiſes</hi> added to the abſolute Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, that ſo we may have a compleat View of this Covenant? Can any Man expect to have a truer View of the ſecond Covenant, as to the compleat Nature of it, in that initial and firſt Edition of it, than by a fuller View of all its Edition com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared together? Are there not many weighty Truths and Leſſons to be learned from the after Editions thereof, touching the Nature of this Covenant, which are of abſolute Neceſſity to Salvation, now under the Diſpenſations we are under? Is not there more required of thoſe that received more?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> III. Whether it be not as great an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in Divinity, to deny conſequent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:004588_0034_100DA5D7B007DA48"/>
for Duties in the ſecond Covenant, as to aſſert antecedent Conditions therein? Doth not the one run as far into the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomian</hi> as the other runs in the <hi>Arminian</hi> Scheme; and ſo leave the true Goſpel Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, or <hi>Calviniſtical</hi> and <hi>Lutheran</hi> Scheme, in the Middle betwen theſe two ſtrained Extremes? Doth not the Law, as a Rule of Life, require Duties of thoſe that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from under the Law as a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant? if there be <hi>no Duties required</hi> in the ſecond Covenant, to what Purpoſe are we ſo often preſs'd to the Performance of them, in the Old and New Teſtament; and why are the Neglecters of them ſo often blamed and reproved?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> IV. Whether Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees with himſelf or Truth, in ſeemingly denying <hi>any Condition or Duties</hi> in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Covenant <hi>one while,</hi> as may be ſeen in the forecited Letter, <hi>p.</hi> 4, 5. when he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <hi>elſewhere</hi> preſſes Men to perform <hi>thoſe eaſy Conditions</hi> preſcribed by our Saviour, as neceſſary to Salvation, and upon Pain of Damnation, as appears by <hi>p.</hi> 71. &amp; 92. of <hi>Vol.</hi> 1. of his Sermons printed at <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia?</hi>

               <q>For tho' we tranſlate theſe Words, <hi>baptizing them in the Name;</hi> yet as the Name of God, in the Lord's Prayer, and ſeveral other Places, ſignifies his Nature, they might as well be tranſlated thus, <hi>baptizing them into the Nature of the Father, into the Nature of the Son, and into the Nature of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>

               <hi>Q.</hi> I.

            <p>But to come to the Exceptionable Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of my Sermons. You blame me for ſaying, Pag. 17. vol. 2.

               </gap> my Faults, I can inform you of other Paſſages as juſtly exceptionable. In my Sermon <hi>on Juſtification,</hi> I ſeem to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert <hi>univerſal Redemption,</hi> which I now abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely deny. — In my <hi>Almoſt Chriſtian,</hi> I talk of <hi>Works procuring us ſo high a Crown.</hi> In my Sermon <hi>on the Marks of the new Birth,</hi> I ſay, <hi>We ſhall endure to the End, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe, and perhaps ſome other Paſſages, tho' capable of a candid Interpretation, I now miſlike, and in the next Edition of my Sermons, God willing, I propoſe to alter them. — In the mean while, I ſhall be thankful to any that will point out my Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and I promiſe, by divine Aſſiſtance, they ſhall have no Reaſon to ſay, that I am one who hates <hi>to be reformed. Let the Righteous ſmite me, it ſhall be a Kindneſs; and let him reprove me, it ſhall be an excellent Oil, which ſhall not break my Head; for yet my Prayer alſo ſhall be in their Calamites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for your inſinuating, that I counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance Mr. <hi>Weſly</hi> in his Errors, it is no ſuch Thing. I prefaced <hi>Haly Burton's</hi> Memoirs, before I ſaw what Mr. <hi>Weſly</hi> wrote, and ſince I have ſeen it, have more than once

               </gap> known what Mr. <hi>Weſly</hi> had wrote, I would not have prefaced <hi>Haly Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> at all. — I do not underſtand Mr. <hi>Weſly</hi> in his Interpretation of theſe Words, <hi>He that is born again of God, ſinneth not;</hi> and therefore have torn that Part out of ſeveral of thoſe Books which I have given away lately, and have acquainted him of what I think on this Particular he errs, in ſundry <hi>Letters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You wrong me if you think I am an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomian:</hi> For when I ſay, <hi>God made no ſecond Covenant with</hi> Adam, I mean no more than this, <hi>God made no ſecond Covenant with</hi> Adam <hi>in his own Perſon, in behalf of his Poſterity.</hi> Nor did Man's Acceptance in the Sight of God, after the Fall, depend either wholly or in Part on his Works, as before the Fall. Whoever reads the Author of <hi>the whole Duty of Man,</hi> will find he thinks otherwiſe, and I believe your Friends in <hi>Scotland</hi> will not thank you for defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>the Whole Duty of Man,</hi> as you ſeeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have done in the late Queries.</p>
            <p>Your Objection concerning my favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Opinion of ſome particular <hi>Quakers,</hi> I converſed with, and alſo about ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Promiſes, which I think have been

            <p>I am no Friend to caſting Lots: But I believe on extraordinary Occaſions, when Things can be determined no other Way, God, if applied to, and waited on by Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Faſting, will anſwer by Lots now, as well as formerly.</p>
            <p>Do not condemn me <hi>for Preaching extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore,</hi> and ſaying, <hi>I am helped often immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in that Exerciſe,</hi> when Thouſands can prove as well as my ſelf, it has been ſo.— Neither ſhould you cenſure me as one that would lay aſide Reading.

            <p>But my other Affairs will not permit me to enlarge. Some of the latter part of your Queries, for your own, and not for my ſake I ſhall not mention. I hope I can ſay with more Sincerity than <hi>Hazael, Is your Servant a Dog, that he ſhould do what you ſuggeſt?</hi> But I pray God forgive you. He knows my Heart. My own Deſign is to bring poor Souls to Jeſus Chriſt. I deſire to avoid Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams, ſo as not to be a Bigot on the one Hand, or confound Order and Decency on the other. And I could heartily wiſh, the Rev. Preſbytery, when they adviſed you to publiſh your Queries, had alſo cautioned you againſt dipping your Pen in ſo much Gall. Surely your Inſinuations are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to that Charity, that <hi>hopeth and believeth all Things for the beſt.</hi> And I appeal to your own Hearts, whether it was right, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſince you heard the conſtant Tenour of my Preaching in <hi>America,</hi> has been <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtical,</hi> to cenſure me as a <hi>Papiſt</hi> or <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> becauſe a few unguarded Expreſſions dropped from my Pen juſt as I came out of the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford.</hi> Could Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Tillotſon</hi> or the <hi>Author of the whole

I will give you a Specimen: Inſtead of "A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>was adorned with all the Perfections of the Deity</hi>" you correct it, "<hi>All the</hi> moral communicable <hi>Perfections of the Deity.</hi> "— Was not Man created a little lower than the Angels?

                  <hi>moral Perfections</hi> communicated to them, which were not communicated to him? For otherwiſe in what Senſe could he be ſaid to be <hi>inferior</hi> to them?

               <p>IN your Anſwer to the <hi>Queries</hi> you ſay, That to the Honour of free diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace, you recieved the Spirit of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption, before you had converſed with one Man, or read a ſingle Book, on the Doctrine of <hi>Free Juſtification by the Imputed Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs

of</hi> JESUS CHRIST; and therefore, no Wonder that you was not ſo clear in ſome Points at your firſt ſetting out in the Miniſtry."— This Declaration to me ſeems clearly to imply, That the Spirit of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption alone, without the Aid of human Converſation or Books, is not ſufficient ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to accompliſh a Chriſtian Miniſter, but that human Converſation and Books are abſolutely neceſſary, in order further to <hi>enlighten</hi> him. — As I underſtood you in this Senſe, and further," That it is not yet <hi>perfect Day</hi> with you," I concluded you would readily retract any of your Errors, even now, ſince you are not fully enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened; and more eſpecially, as you ſay in your Anſwer to the <hi>Queries,</hi> "That you ſhall be thankful to any that ſhall point out your Errors; and promiſe, by Divine Aſſiſtance, they ſhall have no Reaſon to ſay, That you are one who hates to be reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed." — It was the Strength of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, that I thought it proper, not only to pray that God's Grace might ſhine more and more in your Heart, but alſo to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you with my Letter of the 11th Inſtant.</p>

               <p>I Have receiv'd your Letter of this Day but it will not do. The Difficulty I propoſed, is of no ſmall Importance with me, who have not only my own, but the Souls of many others committed to my Charge, concerned in it.</p>
               <p>I firmly believe, and have always taught, that <hi>good Works</hi> do as neceſſarily ſpring from, and accompany a true and <hi>lively</hi> Faith, whether <hi>before or after</hi> Juſtification, as Light and Heat do the Sun; or that, <hi>as the Body without the Soul is dead, ſo Faith without Works,</hi> whether before or after Juſtification, <hi>is dead alſo.</hi> If this be an Error; if in this I'm departed from the <hi>Goſpel</hi> and the <hi>Articles of the Church,</hi> will you not endeavour to reſtore me? Sure, if not the Precept and Example of our great Maſter, the common Bowels of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity will induce you to do a Thing, on

               </opener>
               <p>YOu'll excuſe the Trouble of this, by Way of Supplement to my former Letters, and containing alſo a few Queries concerning your preſent Behaviour as a Preſbyter of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You cannot but know, that to bring a criminal Accuſation againſt any one, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſufficient Evidence or Proof to ſupport it, is wilful and malicious Slander: But, this, Sir, you have done againſt your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in your <hi>Sermon</hi> entitled, <hi>What think ye of Chriſt.</hi> In
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:004588_0078_100DA64399D51920"/>
that Sermon (<hi>P.</hi> 18.) you have accuſed them, of <hi>not Preaching the Truth as it is in</hi> Jeſus; of <hi>falling from our eſtabliſh'd Doctrines;</hi> and of <hi>preaching only the Law</hi> and <hi>not ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Way of Salvation by Faith in</hi> Chriſt Jeſus; that is of preaching Juſtification by Works, and not by Faith only. Thus you have accuſed your Brethren in that <hi>Sermon;</hi> but where are the Proofs of your Accuſation? What Evidence have you therein brought to ſupport your Charge? Not the leaſt Shadow or Appearance of any ſuch Thing throughout the Whole. — But what Need (you'll ſay) of Proof in ſo plain a Caſe? The <hi>Clergy</hi> indeed pretend to Preach the true Doctrine of <hi>Juſtification by Faith only;</hi> but in explaining, do they not deſtroy it? Do they not explain it, as the preſent Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> in his 4th Paſtor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l Letter, <hi>hopes</hi> they do; <hi>viz. That the Faith by which only we are juſtified muſt be true and lively or productive of good Works,</hi> and conſequently <hi>That good Works are a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Condition</hi> (included in that Faith) <hi>of our being juſtified in the Sight of God?</hi> And is not this explaining the Doctrine into a Contradiction? Is it not <hi>preaching a new Goſpel?</hi> Preaching <hi>Juſtification by Works, and not by Faith only.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="unknown:004588_0079_100DA6464A3C1E00"/>Well then, the Doctrine the Clergy preach, which you are ſo angry at, and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure as preaching Juſtification by <hi>Works, and not by Faith only,</hi> is this; that <hi>we are juſtified by Faith only and not by Works;</hi> thus explained, <hi>viz. that we are juſtified by ſuch a Faith only, as is true and lively that is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually producing good Fruits or Works, and conſequently implying them as a neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> (but no meritorious Cauſe) <hi>of our Juſtification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This then, I ſay, is the Doctrine which you cenſure, and are ſo angry at: But which notwithſtanding is indeed the true Doctrine of the Goſpel; — and agreeab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, taught by the ancient Fathers, by the <hi>Church of England;</hi> by her Clergy at all Times; and (be not ſurprized!) the very Doctrine taught by your <hi>Reverence</hi> and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren <hi>Methodiſts,</hi> tho' not without apparent Shuffle and Contradiction, diſguiſed under the Diſtinction of <hi>before</hi> and <hi>after</hi> Juſtification.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This Doctrine you condemn, is the true Doctrine of the Goſpel. — <hi>We are juſtified by Faith and</hi> not by Works, teacheth St. <hi>Paul;</hi> that is (expoundeth St. <hi>James</hi>) not by <hi>ſuch</hi> a Faith as is <hi>without</hi> Works; for Faith, if <hi>it hath not Works, is dead being
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:004588_0080_100DA648C1B3E1F0"/>
alone;</hi> but by a lively operative Faith, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the Fruit of good Works, <hi>by Works is Faith made Perfect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. This alſo is the Doctrine of all the ancient Fathers. — <hi>We are juſtified by Faith and not by Works,</hi> taught <hi>Clemens, Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen, Cyprian, Baſil, Chryſoſtom, Auſtin,</hi> &amp;c. that is, <q>not ſo meant of them,' (Hom. of Salv. Part 2d.) that the ſaid juſtifying Faith is alone in Man, without true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, Hope, Charity, and the Fear of God at any Time or Seaſon: But this ſaying that we be juſtified by Faith only, freely and without Works, is ſpoken, for <hi>to take away clearly</hi> ALL MERIT <hi>of our Works,</hi> as being unable to deſerve our Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification at God's Hands; — and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to aſcribe the Merit of our Juſtification unto Chriſt only, and his moſt precious Bloodſhedding.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. This ſame Doctrine alſo teacheth the Church of <hi>England. We are accounted righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous</hi> (or juſtified) <hi>before God only for the Merits of our Lord and Saviour</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>by Faith, and not for our own Works or Deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings.</hi> Art. 11. <q>That is, (ſaith Hom. of Faith) not by a dead or barren, but a lively and fruitful Faith. — Good living
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:004588_0081_100DA64AF43CAA58"/>
cannot be ſeparated from true Faith, which worketh by Love; — and Faith of itſelf is full of good Works; as ſoon as a Man believeth he is garniſhed with them. — And by all the Declarations of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> it is evident, that a true and Chriſtian Faith, is no dead, vain, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful Thing; but a Thing of perfect Virtue, of wonderful Operation, Working and Strength, bringing forth all good Motions, and good Works.</q> 
                  <hi>See Hom.</hi> of <hi>Salvat.</hi> and ſhort Declar. of a true and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Faith.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And as of the Church, ſo agreeably is this the Doctrine at all Times preached by her Clergy. — <hi>We are juſtified by Faith on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and not by Works;</hi> — <q>And yet (ſaith Biſhop <hi>Downam,</hi> Treat. of Juſtific. P. 15.) that Faith which is alone, ſevered from all other inward Graces, and outward O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, doth not juſtify either alone, or at all; becauſe it is not a true and lively, but a counterfeit and dead Faith.</q> Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reeably alſo Biſhop <hi>Beveridge</hi> on the 39th Art. (Art. 11.) <q>Tho' it be by Faith (ſaith he) that we are juſtified, and by Faith only, yet not by ſuch a Faith as hath no Works accompanying it: No, every ſuch
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:004588_0082_100DA64D3B71BE30"/>
Faith is a dead Faith; ſo that Faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Works is as unable to juſtify us, as Works without Faith. And yet it is not from our Works that accompany our Faith, but from the Faith that is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by our Works, that we are juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</q> —Thus Biſhop <hi>Burnet</hi> alſo (on the ſame 11th Art.) <q>A Man is then only juſtified when he is freed from Wrath, and is at Peace with God. And tho' this is freely offered to us in the Goſpel through <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> yet it is applied to none, but ſuch as come within thoſe Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications ſet before us in the Goſpel. That God pardons Sin and receives us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Favour, only through the Death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is ſo fully expreſſed in the Goſpel, that it is not poſſible to doubt of it. Nor is it leſs evident, that it is not offered to us abſolutely, and without Conditions and Limitations. Theſe Conditions are <hi>Repentance,</hi> with which <hi>Remiſſion of Sins</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> often joined; and <hi>Faith;</hi> but a <hi>Faith that worketh by Love, that purifies the Heart;</hi> and <hi>that keeps the Commandments of God.</hi> Such a Faith as ſhews itſelf to be alive by good Works by Acts of Charity, and every Act of Obedience. Such a
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:004588_0083_100DA64FE6B74528"/>
                     <hi>Faith</hi> as this <hi>juſtifies;</hi> but not as it is a Work or meritorious Action, but as it is the Condition upon which the Mercy of God is offered to us by <hi>Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> — Our Faith and Repentance are not the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable Conſiderations for which God par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons and juſtifies; that is done merely for the Death of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> — But ſtill our Faith, which includes our Hope, our Love, our Repentance and Obedience, is the Condition that makes us capable of receiving the Benefit of this Redemption and free Grace.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Agreeably alſo Biſhop <hi>Williams</hi> (Serm. of <hi>Juſtification by Faith</hi>) — <q>It is ſaid here, (Rom. v. 1.) <hi>being juſtified by Faith;</hi> by which we are to underſtand, not a mere notional Faith, (for that is no other than an Aſſent to the Truth of what is reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) but a Faith in Operation, a Faith ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and vigorous, and that doth compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend in it, all that Duty and thoſe Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which are elſe where in Scripture made the Condition of the Goſpel Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and which gives me a Title to all the Benefits of it, ſuch as Forgiveneſs of Sin, Adoption and Glorification. And that is a practical Faith, and to which
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:004588_0084_100DA65242B18F58"/>
Repentance, Obedience, and Perſeverance do belong, as the eſſential Parts of it.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Finally, This is the very Doctrine taught by your <hi>Reverence</hi> and Brethren <hi>Methodiſts,</hi> tho' not without Shuffle and Contradiction, diſguiſed under the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs <hi>Diſtinctions</hi> of before and after <hi>Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and 'twixt <hi>Juſtification</hi> and <hi>Salvation.</hi> Thus your <hi>Reverence</hi> (Serm. <hi>What think ye of Chriſt.</hi> Pag. 16.) <q>The Faith we preach, is not a lead ſpeculative Faith, <hi>an Aſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Things credible as credible,</hi> as it is commonly defined; it is not a Faith of the Head only, but a Faith of the Heart. It is a living Principle wrought in the Soul, by the Spirit of the everlaſting God, convincing the Sinner of his loſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done Condition by Nature, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally exciting them to ſhew forth that Faith, by abounding in every good Word and Work.</q> Thus alſo your Brother <hi>J. Weſley</hi> (Serm. <hi>Salvation by Faith,</hi> Pag. 14.) —<q>The firſt uſual Objection to this (ſaith he) is that to preach Salvation or <hi>Juſtification</hi> by Faith only, is to preach againſt Holineſs and good Works. To which a ſhort Anſwer might be given; it would be ſo, if we ſpake, as ſome do, of a
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:004588_0085_100DA6541BF1AFC0"/>
Faith excluſive of theſe. But we ſpeak of a Faith which is neceſſarily incluſive of all good Works, and all Holineſs.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now Sir, this being the Doctrine of Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification as taught and explained by the <hi>Clergy,</hi> and by you <hi>Methodiſts;</hi> how comes it to be a falſe Doctrine in the Mouths of the one, and not of the other? How comes it to be preaching <hi>only the Law</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by <hi>Works,</hi> and not by <hi>Faith only</hi>) in the <hi>Clergy</hi>'s Mouths; and yet to be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Goſpel</hi> (Juſtification by <hi>Faith only,</hi> and not by <hi>Works</hi>) in the Mouths of your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and Brethren <hi>Methodiſts?</hi> — Have not the <hi>Clergy</hi> as good a Right as you to preach Juſtification by a true and lively Faith, a Faith, operating and bringing forth <hi>good Works,</hi> or incluſive of them, withou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

See <hi>J. Weſley</hi>'s Serm. (<hi>Salvation by Faith, p.</hi> 9. <hi>Whatever elſe it</hi> (Salvation by Faith) <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is a preſent Salvation, ſomething at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable yea actually atained on Earth by thoſe who are partakers of this Faith.

Now what other can this preſent Salvation by Faith be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than a State of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and Acceptance with God, that is, a State of Juſtification? And therefore, if a
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:004588_0089_100DA65EAAC975F0"/>
State of Juſtification be a preſent Salvation, or rather a preſent State of Salvation, the aſſerting of good Works a neceſſary Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Salvation, but not of Juſtification, is a Contradiction. And agreeably the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Dr. <hi>Jackſon, (Tom.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 739. of his Works.) <hi>That good Works (ſaith he) are more neceſſary to Salvation than to Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or that they are leſs neceſſary before Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, than after it, implies a Contradiction in the Terms well expreſſed and equally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared. And Man in that he is juſtified, is the immediate Heir of Salvation, at the leaſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted from the Sentence of Death. Now if we affirm, that</hi> good Works <hi>are more neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary after he is juſtified, than before, we ſhould in Congruity grant, that Works win Heaven, and Faith only delivers from Hell: Or grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Juſtification to be the Paſſage from Death to eternal Life, the Addition of ſuch Works ſubſequent, as were not precedent, could be ſerviceable only to ſupererogate ſome Exceſs of Glory; for tho' we ſtood ſtill at the ſame Point where Juſtification found us, we ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Heirs of Glory. Or if Faith without Works obtain Juſtification, having juſtified us, ſhall it not much more without them lay ſure hold on Salvation, and all the Degrees of Joy
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:004588_0090_100DA6608204E438"/>
that accompany it? Suppoſe a Man ſhould die in the very Instant wherein he is justified; none would Doubt either of his Abſolution or Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Is he then ſaved with Works, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them? If without them, then our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Rule doth fail us, (Mat.</hi> v. 20. Except your Righteouſneſs exceed, <hi>&amp;c.) For this Man enters into the Kingdom of Heaven with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out more ſtrict Obſervance of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments than the Scribes and Phariſees uſed: If with them, then their Preſence is neceſſary to Juſtification, and in Order of Nature before it, becauſe neceſſary e'er he can be capable of Entrance into the Kingdom of Heaven; as the Performance of every Condition is in Nature precedent to the Accompliſhment of what is not promiſed without it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor indeed is the admitting of Faith a <hi>Condition of Juſtification,</hi> in any Senſe, and yet denying it of the <hi>neceſſary Fruits or Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Faith</hi> leſs abſurd or contradictory.</p>
               <p>This you know is the main Point in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs with you, and which drove the above cited <hi>Dr. Edwards</hi> not only on the Senſeleſs Diſtinction of <hi>Juſtification</hi> and <hi>Salvation,</hi> but moreover of the ſilly Subterfuges of ſcrupling to call Faith <hi>a Condition,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying its <hi>going before Juſtification.

But this is not all. <hi>It is an idle Contest</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and yet hath troubled ſome Heads, which of theſe (Faith or Juſtification) is firſt in Time For I apprehend that they are both together: therefore no Man can tell which is precedent, and which Subſequent.</hi> Here is a Matter decided for you; Who dares any longer conteſt it? <hi>I apprehend, &amp;c.</hi> That this is an idle Conteſt, and owing only to ſuch Heads as his own will be eaſily granted: But his <hi>I apprehend, &amp;c.</hi> will be deemed a very ſorry Deciſion. — 99 of 100 will apprehend, <hi>that his</hi> Apprehenſion <hi>of the Matter is abſurd, and repugnant to the very Order of Thought or Apprehenſion in

Thus both are true in different Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects. On one Account Faith Precedes Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; on the other it follows it.

               <p n="3">3. As to the 12th Article of the Church it is obvious, that by the Words, <hi>and follow after Juſtification,</hi> the <hi>Article</hi> means not to exclude good Works going <hi>before</hi> Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from being acceptable or pleaſing to God, provided they are the Fruits of Faith, becauſe it has no negative Words to exclude them. And not only ſo, but which is ſtill confirmed, by the next following Article, intitled, <hi>of Works before Juſtification. Works</hi> (ſaith this Article) <hi>done before the Grace of</hi> Chriſt <hi>and the Inſpiration of his Spirit are not pleaſant to God:</hi> Why ſo? <hi>Forasmuch as they ſpring not of Faith in</hi> Jeſus Chriſt.

                  <pb n="95" facs="unknown:004588_0095_100DA66ACC8F64A0"/>
the Article meaneth Works that are <hi>ſo</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it as to be before the Grace of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and conſequently Faith in him; that is Works in a State of mere <hi>Heatheniſm</hi> or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity.</hi> And therefore according to the Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im, <hi>Exceptio firmat regulam in non exceptis,</hi> the Article confirmeth, that Works which are not <hi>ſo</hi> before Juſtification as to be before the Grace of <hi>Christ</hi> and Faith in him, but after theſe and ſpringing from them, are pleaſing to God, tho' before Juſtification.</p>
               <p>But do not both Articles rather ſeem to ſuppoſe that <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Juſtification</hi> are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſtant; or that 'twixt the firſt Act of a juſtifying Faith, and that of Juſtification, there intervenes no Space for good Works to be exerted in?

                  <p>In the Preface to the Hymns and ſacred Poems lately publiſhed at <hi>London, by</hi> Mr. <hi>John W-ſl-y</hi> and his Brother, <hi>p.</hi> v. we are told, that <hi>"even the</hi> Condition <hi>of our Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with</hi> God, <hi>is not our Holineſs either of Heart or Life, but Faith alone; Faith</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiſtinguiſhed <hi>from Holineſs, as well as from good Works."</hi> And then immediately follow theſe Words, "<hi>Other Foundation therefore can no Man lay, without being an Adverſary to</hi> Chriſt <hi>and his Goſpel, than Faith alone, Faith, tho' neceſſarily producing both, yet</hi> not including either good Works or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs."</p>

a Word;</hi> it is neither for your Sake not my own, that I trouble you with this <hi>Fourth</hi> Letter, but for ſuch Reaſons as may in due Time be aſſigned.</p>
               <p>I have now before me an <hi>anonymous</hi> Pamphlet, entituled, <hi>The Caſe between Mr.</hi> Whitefield <hi>and Dr.</hi> Stebbing <hi>ſtated,</hi> &amp;c. containing, or deſigned to contain, the <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Syſtem</hi> of the <hi>Methodiſt</hi> Doctrine of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation.</hi> Whether you approve of all and every Thing it contains, I preſume not to know; but to me it appears as elaborate a Peace of <hi>dogmatical</hi> Theology, as any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd in the <hi>Oliverian</hi> Age, and calculated not to edify, but to puzzle and amuſe the Minds of the Populace, or common Readers.</p>
               <p>Touching the <hi>Foundation</hi> of this goodly Structure, either the Author muſt beg the Queſtion, of the <hi>Propagation of Souls,</hi> or his <hi>Propoſitions</hi> are mere Amuſements.</p>
               <p>Either he muſt take for granted, that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> begat the Souls, as well as Bodies of his immediate Poſterity, or who can underſtand the <hi>Second</hi> Propoſition? <hi>viz.</hi> Had <hi>Adam</hi> 
                  <q>continued in his happy State, he ſhould have <hi>tranſmitted</hi> to his Poſterity, <hi>by the Laws of Generation,</hi> that Image of God in which he was made.</q> Conſiſting

chiefly (Prop. 1ſt.) <q>In the Indowments of the Soul, <hi>viz. Knowledge, Innocence, Righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Holineſs.</hi>
                  </q> — Can the Endowments or Qualities of any Thing be tranſmitted to another by <hi>any Laws of Generation,</hi> without the Subſtance? The Author dare not ſay they can; and if they cannot, then how could <hi>Adam</hi> tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the <hi>Endowments</hi> and Qualities of <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Innocence, Righteouſneſs and Holineſs</hi> to the <hi>Souls</hi> of his Poſterity, <hi>by the Laws of Generation,</hi> without tranſmitting the Subſtance alſo?</p>
               <p>Again, either the <hi>Author</hi> muſt take the ſame Principle for granted, or to what End or Purpoſe <hi>Prop.</hi> vii and its Comment?</p>
               <p>If his Meaning, indeed be, that as every animal Creature, <hi>by the Laws of Generation,</hi> begets its like; the Toad, the Viper, the Tyger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> begets Toads, Vipers, Tygers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So the animal Part or Bodies of our firſt Parents being degenerate, corrupt and mortal, the animal Part or Bodies of their Poſterity, which alone they could beget, muſt therefore, <hi>by the Laws of Generation,</hi> be degenerate, corrupt and mortal alſo: If this, I ſay, be his Meaning, who will ever diſpute the Truth of the Propoſition? Nay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="105" facs="unknown:004588_0105_100DA67E1A2F7208"/>
who will not moreover readily grant, that <hi>the corruptible Body preſſeth down the Soul,</hi> and often too eaſily beſets and draws it off, from heavenly and ſpiritual to earthly and carnal Things? But then, alas! what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther End or Purpoſe will all this be of, to the Author's Scheme of <hi>Regeneration,</hi> than to deſtroy it? This Scheme abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the poſitive <hi>innate</hi> Degeneracy and Corruption of the Soul for its Foundation. And as the <hi>Author</hi> muſt plainly ſee, that this Degeneracy &amp; Corruption tranſmitted from <hi>Adam</hi> by <hi>the Laws of Generation,</hi> muſt nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily ſuppoſe the <hi>Propagation of Souls;</hi> it is evident to me, that rather than touch this Point, or expreſsly beg the Queſtion, he choſe to lay its Foundation in Darkneſs, and to hide its Weakneſs under general and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous Phraſes, and eſpecially the Word <hi>Nature;</hi> to the no ſmall Puzzle and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity of common Readers.</p>
               <p>It is true, Mention is once made of a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant <hi>Adam</hi> was under, his being <hi>the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative Head,</hi> and of the <hi>Imputation of his Sin;</hi> but as theſe, the Author owns, <hi>lay <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Appearance, and we hear no more of them.</p>
               <p>But to have done with this Head: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Body can eaſily conceive, as <hi>Adam</hi> was the <hi>Root,</hi> from which ſprang the animal Part or Bodies of his Children, that the animal Patt or Bodies of his Children muſt therefore, <hi>by the Laws of Generation,</hi> partake of the Nature and Qualities of that <hi>Root,</hi> whether they were good or evil; but how their Souls, if they ſprung <hi>not from that Root,</hi> muſt partake of its Nature and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, by <hi>any Laws of Generation,</hi> I believe a <hi>Methodist</hi> only can conceive.</p>
               <p>The Populace have been ſtrangely amuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of late with the <hi>Doctrine of Regeneration,</hi> as a ſudden, inſtantaneous Work (Act) of <hi>the Holy Spirit,</hi> and in which the Subjects are <hi>entirely paſſive.</hi> But this <hi>Author,</hi> tho' he ſtill <hi>dogmatically</hi> inſiſts on ſome <hi>certain cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Act</hi> in the Caſe, yet has a whole Chap. (4th) concerning the <hi>Manner, Means and Steps,</hi> by which this Work is wrought by the Spirit of God in the Hearts of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. I'm afraid that in this <hi>Chap.</hi> he has departed from <hi>the ancient Teſtimony,</hi> and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced ſeveral Things, which natural Men may take <hi>for Inconſiſtences and Contradictions.</hi>

                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 52, 53. I find the following remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Paſſages. <hi>In all his Ways towards us, and eſpecially in the Work of Regeneration and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, God deals with us as reaſonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, however weak degenerate, or corrupt; and always acts in a Way agreeable to our ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Powers; this the Precepts, Admonitions, Promiſes, Councils and Invitations, &amp;c. of the Word do clearly demonſtrate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How from the Bottom of my Heart do I wiſh, that this honeſt and inſtructive Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage ſtood in <hi>Golden Capitals,</hi> at the Head of every Page, throughout the whole Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance; with <hi>[Regeneration is the whole and ſole Work of God, in which we are entirely paſſive]</hi> incerted between Hooks in the very Center of it; to expoſe the Contradiction in direct View, and guard the Judgment of the unwary Reader! The Author goes on, <q>Theſe (that is, <hi>Precepts, Admonitions, Promiſes, &amp;c.</hi> of the Word all ſuppoſe that we are either capable of doing ſomething or other in a Way of Duty; or, at leaſt, of being <hi>excited, diſpoſed</hi> and <hi>enabled</hi> to hear, underſtand, and do what is required. Tho' we have loſt our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, Righteouſneſs and Holineſs, we have not loſt our Faculties and Powers.
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:004588_0108_100DA684C7699D10"/>
We are not Stocks and Stones, and mere Machines; but, intelligent Agents: And tho' we cannot, in our natural State, know the Things of the Spirit of God, as we ſhould, and as we muſt, if we would be ſaved; yet many Things we ſtill know of our Maker, and his Will; yea, and many Things we can alſo do. In our Renovation, God reſtores what we have loſt, but does it by working upon what remains. He calls and excites us, to the exerciſe of our rational Faculties, and at the ſame Time cures the Diſorders of them, and frames them in ſome Meaſure, for what he enjoins. He commands us, for Example, to hear and read his Word, with Reverence and Seriouſneſs; and in our obeying, as we can, and hearing it with that Reverence, we would do any Thing of Moment, he makes us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it. He commands us to mix Faith with our Hearing; and in our receiving it, with that Faith which we may have, he confirms our Aſſent to it. He ſaith, Awake thou that ſleepeſt, and ariſe from the Dead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and when we humble our ſelves under a deep Senſe of our utter Inability, and heartily pray for Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

quickning Grace, he by the Power of his Spirit, working with the Word, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly awakens us, and raiſes us from the Dead. He commands Sinners to ceaſe to do Evil; and in their ſincere Care to compply, he many Ways aſſiſts them, And, to learn to do well; and in their ſetting about this Work, in earneſt, he by the Word both diſpoſes them farther, and enables them alſo.</q> Now if all this be <hi>Methodiſm,</hi> I ſubſcribe to it Heart and Hand; only with this Difference from the <hi>Author,</hi> that I muſt inſiſt on <hi>theſe,</hi> not as <hi>previous Diſpoſitions only,</hi> to the Work of <hi>Regeneration;</hi> but in Reality the Work ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and part of it actually done. For ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own Deſcription of <hi>Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> it conſiſts, <q>In the <hi>checking, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> and <hi>in part ſubduing</hi> our Natural De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravity and Corruption; and <hi>the reſtoring</hi> in ſome Meaſure, that <hi>Image of God,</hi> which <hi>Adam</hi> loſt by his Fall.</q> But if the Work of Regeneration conſiſts in theſe, then I muſt inſiſt, that it is not a <hi>ſole, critical or inſtantaneous,</hi> but a <hi>gradual co-operating</hi> Work of the <hi>Holy Spirit;</hi> commencing at <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi> and gradually advancing throughout the whole courſe of Chriſtian Life; including
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:004588_0110_100DA68A4B369EE8"/>
all the Steps or Degrees of Faith, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, renewed Diſpoſitions of the Mind, and Habits of Obedience, 'till we arive at <hi>the Meaſure of the Stature of the Fulneſs of Chriſt;</hi> that is, to ſuch a Degree of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Perfection, as is attainable here; that which is abſolute, being only atainable at the Reſurrection hereafter. In a Word, I muſt inſiſt, that according to the <hi>Scriptures, the whole Oeconomy of Grace</hi> is, an <hi>Oeconomy</hi> of CO-OPERATION, where the Subject is capable; and therefore, that the above cited Particulars are not only preparative, or previous Diſpoſitions to Regeneration; but the Work actually adoing, and Part of it actually done.</p>
               <p>This, in the Judgment of the Chriſtian Church in all Ages, is the plain Doctrine of the Scripture, and therefore the Paſſage next following, contains <hi>a Contradiction</hi> to the above cited Paſſage, and a manifeſtly falſe Aſſertion, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>We are never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to <hi>regenerate our ſelves,</hi> or <hi>beget our ſelves again;</hi> that is God's Work, <hi>his wholly and ſolely.</hi>
                  </q> But are we indeed ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver commanded <hi>to regenerate or beget our ſelves again;</hi> tho' not in the very Words, (for the Word <hi>Regenerate</hi> occurs not once
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:004588_0111_100DA68C28301600"/>
in the whole <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bible) yet not in this <hi>Author's</hi> own Senſe or Meaning of them? Are we never commanded <hi>to check, weaken, or in part ſubdue our natural Depravity and Corruption, and to improve our ſelves in Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Righteouſneſs and Holineſs?</hi> Or are not theſe the Purport of all <hi>the Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands?</hi> Are we never commanded, <hi>to purge out the old Leaven, that we may be a new Lump? To put off the Old Man, and to put on the New? To cracify the Fleſh with the Affections and Luſts? To mortify our Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers which are upon the Earth?</hi> Are we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver commanded to <hi>cleanſe our ſelves from all Filthineſs both of the Fleſh and Spirit, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting Holineſs in the Fear of God? To cleanſe our Hands and purify our Hearts? &amp;c.</hi> And can theſe, or any like Commands, be underſtood to import any more, than our doing ſuch Part of theſe Things as we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or that the main or principal part is not the Work of the Holy Spirit, without whoſe <hi>co-operating</hi> Aids and Graces, we can do nothing? Nay, but ſays the <hi>Author,</hi> this (Regeneration) is <hi>God's Work,</hi> his whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſolely; and in which we are <hi>entirely paſſive.</hi> Are theſe the Words of him who juſt before had ſaid, <hi>That in all his Ways,
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:004588_0112_100E7C2C29C38B28"/>
and eſpecially the Work of Regeneration, God deals with us as reaſonable Creatures, not as with Stocks or Stones, or mere Machines, but intelligent Beings?</hi> And a few Lines after ſays, <hi>That in the whole Work of Grace, God treats us as reaſonable Creatures, and in a Way congruous to our rational Powers?</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with ſuch confuſed and contradictory Gibberiſh.</p>
               <p>But our <hi>Author's</hi> Eyes being fitted only for <hi>Methodist</hi> Light, he is over with it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>pag.</hi> 60, 61. <hi>Taking it for granted, that the Holy Spirit is the Almighty Worker of our Regeneration, in which we are entirely paſſive; we may obſerve, that ordinarily there are certain Works which are previous preparative, and ſome Way diſpoſe to it. — Several Things are required of us in a Way of Duty; which all Men may in ſome Meaſure comply with, if not by their own natural Abilities, yet through the Aſſiſtance of that common Grace, which is in ſome Degree, given to all the Hearers of the Goſpel,</hi> viz. <hi>That we ſeriouſly read<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and carefully attend, to all the Diſpenſations of the Word; that we frequently think of our Ways<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> conſider our State and Frame, and be much in Prayer for the holy Spirit to enlighten, renew and ſanctify
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:004588_0113_100DA68EE8535188"/>
us, &amp;c. Nor has any Man any Reaſon to expect any ſuch invaluable Bleſſing, who is either utter negligent of, or only ſuperficial in the Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of them. Commonly alſo in the ſerious Attention of the Soul, to theſe Duties, the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt much enlightens the Mind, awakens the Conſcience, convinces of Sin, fills with Grief, and Shame, and Fear, excites to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, Prayer and Humiliation, and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly works ſtrongly upon, and produceth a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Change, not only in the outward Life, but inward Affections.</hi> Now if Regeneration conſiſts in <hi>checking, weakning, and in part ſubduing our natural Depravity and Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c.</hi> muſt not this Author allow the above Particulars, eſpecially <hi>the mighty Change,</hi> both of the outward Life and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Affections, to be not only a previous diſpoſing to, but the real Work of <hi>Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> a doing, and part of it actually done? But no ſuch Thing. <hi>Tho none of theſe</hi> (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts he) <hi>nor all of them together be Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, yea tho' all of them may be wrought, and that in a high Degree, in thoſe who are never born of the Spirit, &amp;c.</hi> Is it not plain, that he here ſhifts the <hi>Idea</hi> of the Word <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation,</hi> and inſtead of meaning by it the gradual and Progreſſive Work <hi>of checking,
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:004588_0114_100DA690A443AD18"/>
weakening, ſubduing, &amp;c.</hi> he annexes it to the <hi>Idea</hi> of an immediate <hi>critical Act;</hi> or the natural Depravity or Corruption <hi>actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> checked, weakened and ſubdued, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The ſame which other Chriſtian Writers or Divines call <hi>the highest Degree of Chriſtian Perfection,</hi> which thro' a <hi>Growth in Grace,</hi> is attainable here, if not that, which none ſhall attain to, till the Reſurrection hereafter.</p>
               <p>But above all (Sir) what I chiefly deſign to obſerve to you is, that either this <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> muſt be in a very great Error, or your ſelf; either his Doctrine muſt be falſe, or your own.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Author</hi> Aſſerts, <hi>That ſeveral Things are required of us in a Way of Duty, which all Men may in ſome Meaſure comply with, if not by their own natural Abilities, yet thro' the Aſſiſtance of that common Grace gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to all the Hearers of the Goſpel</hi> viz. <hi>that we ſeriouſly read and attend to all the Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of the Word, frequently think of our Ways, conſider our State, and be much in Prayer, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if according to this <hi>Author,</hi> theſe Works or Duties, <hi>viz.</hi> ſerious reading, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Attention to all the Diſpenſations of the Word, frequent Meditation, and diligent
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:004588_0115_100DA692B7C6ABD8"/>
Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if all theſe Works or Duties (and which thro' common Grace given to all Goſpel Hearers we are able to perform) be required of us as Means naturally diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to the Work of Regeneration, and without which no one has Reaſon to expect that Bleſſing; then of neceſſary Conſequence they muſt be required to <hi>Juſtification</hi> alſo, which in the Order of Nature, according to this <hi>Author,</hi> cannot precede <hi>Regeneration,</hi> but follow after it; but if theſe Works or Duties be required to our <hi>Juſtification,</hi> then what becomes of your remarkable <hi>Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian</hi> Chalenge, <hi>Who dares aſſert that we are not juſtified in the Sight of God, merely by an Act of Faith in</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>without any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to Works, paſt, preſent, or to come? (Jour. cont. P.</hi> 108. <hi>Edit. Phil.</hi>)</p>
               <p>Again, theſe Works or Duties which God thus requires the Performance of, as Means materially, diſpoſing for <hi>Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> when through common Grace per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, are they acceptable to God or not? If you ſay they are not, you ſay, that the Performance of God's own Commands are not acceptable to him: If you ſay they are, you contradict your own expreſs Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, (Serm. <hi>What think ye of Chriſt,</hi> P. 18.)

                  <q>Our Perſons muſt be juſtified before our Performances can be accepted.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I have no Intention to wade through the <hi>Farrago</hi> of the Pamphlet, which I believe no one breathing will be ever be idle e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to do: But if you'll pleaſe to ſatify theſe few Exceptions I have offered upon it, you'll much oblige.</p>

               <p>TOUCHING your two Letters, which you have cauſed to be publiſhed in this Place, I am in no doubt what <hi>Spirit</hi> you were when you wroute them.

Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>and our Juſtification</hi> by <hi>Faith alone, he was as ignorant as</hi> Mahomet.</p>
               <p>Now (Sir) have you proved, or attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to prove that the Archbiſhop <hi>knew of no more than a bare Hiſtorical Faith?</hi> No: <hi>Every Spiritual Man,</hi> you ſay, <hi>that reads his diſcourſes may ſee it.</hi> Did you take this on truſt from your honour'd Friend J.

If you grounded it on your <hi>own Knowledge</hi> of thoſe Diſcourſes; how came this Paſſage of them in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, beſides many others, not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found you!

                  <hi>Whitefield</hi>'s Sermon on Regeneration, P. 14, 17. <hi>The Apoſtle declares it to be the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocable Decree of the Almighty,</hi> that whith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Holineſs, <hi>i. e. without being made pure by</hi> Regeneration, <hi>and having the</hi> Image <hi>of God thereby reinſtamp'd upon the Soul,</hi> no Man living ſhall ſee the Lord. <hi>And it is very obſervable, that our Divine Maſter, in the famous Paſſage before referred to, concerning the</hi> abſol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus an elder Brother of yours, the ever memorable GEORGE FOX, (an <hi>Infallible</hi> alſo in his Days, <hi>to whom God had given the true Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Doctrines of Grace</hi>) bore his Teſtimony concerning the BIBLE, as on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a <hi>Dead Letter;</hi> and which was impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly recieved by his Followers, at leaſt of that Age.</p>

good for; pleaſe not utterly to deſtroy it. The Wrath, you know, of another noble <hi>Champion of Grace,</hi> See <hi>Edwards's</hi> Preacher, P. 49, 50.) was kindled againſt this Book; but his went no farther than the <hi>Title, Yours</hi> extends to the <hi>Preface,</hi> general <hi>Titles,</hi> and <hi>Index.</hi> 
                  <q>The Book (ſaith he) pretends to treat of the <hi>Whole Duty of Man,</hi> and puts us off with <hi>Half</hi> of it.</q> Bad indeed! But is there no way to ſalve the Affair? Let the Title be altered, and for the future run, <hi>One half of the Whole Duty of Man;</hi> or rather let your <hi>Reverence,</hi> ſome ſpare Day or other, ſupply the other <hi>Half</hi> that's wanting, under the Title of the <hi>firſt</hi> or <hi>ſecond Part,</hi> as you pleaſe, to be added next Edition, and then the firſt general Title and Book itſelf may ſtand. And this, I hope, you'll the more readily fall in with, becauſe of the Judgment of this Brother <hi>Champion</hi> of yours, who with ſome Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and Modeſty ſays: <q>I deny not that the aforeſaid Book is of very good Uſe in its Kind, and is in ſome Reſpects an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Piece; and it is probable that if the <hi>worthy Author</hi> had lived longer, he would have made thoſe neceſſary Additions to it which I have hinted.</q> Will either of
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:004588_0127_100DA6AE36A906D8"/>
theſe propoſals do? By no means, <q>You have look'd over the general <hi>Titles</hi> and <hi>Index,</hi> and cannot find the WORD <hi>Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration</hi> ſo much as once mentioned.</q> A fatal Defect indeed! I have juſt been looking into my <hi>Concordance,</hi> and almoſt tremble to tell you, that I find this WORD but twice mentioned in the whole <hi>Bible;</hi> and in neither Place anywiſe to your Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe! What the Conſequence may be, when you have conſidered the Matter, I cannot ſay.</p>
               <p>But neither is this all. <q>The whole Treatiſe <hi>(you ſay)</hi> is built on ſuch a falſe Foundation, as not only proves the Author to be no real Chriſtian at Heart; but alſo that he had not ſo much as a Head-Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the true Goſpel of Chriſt.</q> All Heads, 'tis certain, are not alike furniſhed, nor capable of the ſame Furniture; and therefore, ſaving your Infalibility, this Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage plainly ſhews your Head ſufficiently furniſhed, with what I forbear to name. But what is this <hi>falſe Foundation this Treatiſe is built upon?</hi> Why it is contained in theſe Words of the Preface, <hi>This ſecond Covenant was made with</hi> Adam, <hi>and us in him, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after his Fall; and is briefly contained,</hi> Gen.

And this was made up as the firſt was, of ſome Mercies to be offered by God, and ſome Duties to be performed by us.</hi> In this Paſſage lies the falſe Divinity, or <hi>Fundamental Error</hi> that poiſons the whole Book: But, alas, who that is not ſome Way <hi>Enlightned,</hi> nay, who that is not equally <hi>Enlightened</hi> with your <hi>Reverence,</hi> ſhall be able to find it?

If they can open my Eyes to ſee the ſame Things as they pretend to ſee, the Obligation of doing it will be very great; but their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to ſee this or the other, which yet I cannot ſee is of no Avail to me, who am not diſpoſed to rely on their Pretences, or to ſee with their Eyes, but with my own.</p>

               <p>ALAS Sir is it come to this at laſt! That you to whom <hi>God has given a true Knowledge of the Doctrines of Grace!</hi> And who in the Fulneſs of <hi>that Knowledge</hi> had ſo abſolutely <hi>vindicated</hi> your modeſt and <hi>chriſtian</hi> Aſſertion, viz. <hi>That Archbiſhop</hi> Tillotſon <hi>knew no more of Chriſtianity than</hi> Mahomet! That you, I ſay, inſtead of <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending</hi> your noble <hi>Vindication,</hi> are fain to run for <hi>Shelter</hi> under the Wings of the poor ſhatter'd Dr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> (as dogmatical cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, unfair and confuted a Writer as any of his Time) and to throw out his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded Snarling Stuff to your Oppoſers, and bid them Anſwer it! Are theſe the Arts of a Man of your <hi>Gifts</hi> and <hi>Graces?</hi> Or can you think your Oppoſers ſimple enough to be catch'd by them; and ſet to Work to confute ſuch Stuff, as has been confuted and exploded above 30 Years a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go? It is a <hi>Maxim,</hi> I am told among the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> in Controverſy, never to regard the
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:004588_0134_100DA6BEE72B05F8"/>
Objections of an Adverſary; but to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect them, and always return to their <hi>own Aſſertion,</hi> as if nothing had been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered againſt it. A <hi>Maxim</hi> worthy indeed of that <hi>ſingular Order!</hi> Do not you alſo purſue this Trick of theirs in your <hi>Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micks?</hi> Did you learn it of them? Or is it the Fruit of your own Genius? Do you Sir, firſt vindicate Dr. <hi>Edwards</hi> againſt his Oppoſers in the Caſe, and your Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers may probably take ſome Notice of your <hi>Vindication.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But mean-time, as this Letter, tho' di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to you, is deſign'd to be publiſh'd, and as many of the Readers of your <hi>Epiſtle</hi> in theſe Parts, may never have ſeen ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Dr. <hi>Edwards's</hi> PREACHER, nor any Vindication the Archbiſhop from the injurious Treatment contain'd in it; I ſhall therefore take leave, in a few Words, to put ſuch Readers in the Way, to avoid Impoſition in the Caſe, and to do common Juſtice to the Parties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd. And to this Purpoſe the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſingle <hi>Rule,</hi> and a few <hi>Inſtances</hi> to ſhew the Neceſſity and Uſefulneſs of it, ſhall ſuffice.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="unknown:004588_0135_100DA6C129147AC0"/>The Rule is this, <hi>That ſuch Readers do by no Means truſt to the Authority either of Dr.</hi> Edwards, <hi>your</hi> Reverence, <hi>or any</hi> other, <hi>concerning any Paſſages excepted to, of the Writings of the</hi> Archbiſhop; <hi>but that they ſee with their own Eyes, by reading them in Connection as they ſtand in the ſaid Writings, and with due Regard to the Scope and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the reſpective Diſcourſes in which they are found.</hi> This is the <hi>Rule,</hi> and the Neceſſity and Uſefulneſs of it will appear in theſe following Inſtances.</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. <hi>Tillot.</hi> Works, Vol. III. P. 414. <hi>You do not find any where</hi> revealed <hi>in all the Scripture, that there is a God.</hi> 
                  <q>And yet (excepts Dr. <hi>Edwards</hi>) it is agreed by all ſober and intelligent Chriſtians, that there is expreſs <hi>Mention</hi> and <hi>Confirmation</hi> of a Deity in the Scriptures.</q> Is this a fair and honeſt Quotation from the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop? Or is this a fair and honeſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception to it? It is <hi>not any where</hi> REVEA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LED, ſays the Archbiſhop; <hi>there is expreſs Mention and Confirmation of it,</hi> ſays Dr. <hi>Edwards:</hi> What Inconſiſtency or Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicton in theſe? The <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> denies not the expreſs <hi>Mention</hi> and <hi>Confirmation;</hi> The <hi>Dr.</hi> aſſerts not the <hi>Revelation.</hi> But
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:004588_0136_100DA6C3988C9390"/>
let the Reader ſee the Paſſage in this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Connection (as it ought to have been quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) with his own Eyes. <q>A divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation cannot poſſibly be an Argument inducing me to believe the Exiſtence of a God, for this plain Reaſon; becauſe a divine Revelation can be no Argument to any, that is not perſuaded that it is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation: But before I can be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that any Revelation is from God, I muſt be perſuaded there is a God; and if ſo, there is no Need of this Argument to prove to me there is one. And therefore you do not find it any where revealed in all the Scripture, that there is a God. The Scripture often declares, that <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah is the true and living God;</hi> and that, <hi>beſides him there is no other:</hi> But it doth not reveal but every where ſuppoſe, that there is one.</q> Thus ſtands the Paſſage in Connection, containing as plain and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrable a Truth, as any Propoſition in <hi>Euclid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. From the ſame Vol. and Page of the <hi>Archbiſhop</hi>'s Works, Dr. <hi>Edwards</hi> quotes theſe Words; <hi>I do not find the Immortality of the Soul, or a future State is expreſsly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the Bible;</hi> and excepts to them as

The Words indeed are in the ſame Vol. and Page, but not together as they are quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The Paſſage in Connection runs thus: <hi>As for the other two Principles of Natural Religion, the Immortality of the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

wicked Thoughts on the Minds of Men,</hi> (Vol. II. P. 532, 533, <hi>not</hi> 352, 353. as you directed) I muſt beg the <hi>Reader</hi> to conſult that whole <hi>Sermon,</hi> intitled, <hi>the Knowledge of God.</hi> Of the ſeveral Paſſages relating to this Particular, I ſhall here ſet down but this one. — <hi>I do not ſee, how by any Means it can be granted, without Prejudice to this</hi> Prerogative <hi>of God, which the Scripture plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gives him, of being</hi> the only Knower of the Heart, <hi>that the Devil can have ſo immediate an Acceſs to our Minds, as to put wicked Thoughts into them; nor can I think that when it is ſaid, that</hi> Satan provoked David to Number the People, <hi>that</hi> the Devil entred into <hi>Judas; that</hi> Satan had filled the Heart of <hi>Ananias,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that any or all of theſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions do amount to ſuch an immediate Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, of putting wicked Thoughts into Men's Minds; but they only ſignify, that the Devil hath a greater Hand in ſome Sins than others; and that a Heart wickedly bent and inclined, gives him a great Advantage to tempt Men more powerfully, by preſenting the Occaſions of ſuch wicked Thoughts and Actions to them: For it is uſual, in Scripture Phraſe, as to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe all good Motions to God's Spirit, ſo all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Thoughts and Actions to the Devil; not that
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:004588_0139_100DA6CA317EAB68"/>
he is the immediate Cauſe of them, but becauſe he is always ready to tempt Men to them, and one Way or other to promote them.'</hi> — Thus every <hi>Reader</hi> may ſee, from this Paſſage, but more fully from the whole Tenor of the <hi>Sermon,</hi> that the Archbiſhop is only aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>the Knowledge of Men's Hearts</hi> to be the <hi>ſole Prerogative</hi> of God, and therefore deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame <hi>Prerogative</hi> to the Devil.

Word for Word, thus; — <hi>As it is uſual, in the Scripture Phraſe, to aſcribe all good Motions to God's Spirit, ſo all evil thoughts to the Devil; not that he is the immediate Cauſe of theſe, no more than God's Spirit is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the other.</hi> Thus Word for Word, I ſay, you have cited from Dr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> and all in <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Dr. <hi>Edwards</hi> ſet them down <hi>as ſuch</hi> in his Book, but in a different Character, as an Addition of his <hi>own.</hi> Rare juggling Work indeed! Dr. <hi>Edwards</hi> injuriouſly <hi>adds</hi> to the Archbiſhop's Words, and ſtill more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juriouſly cenſures him on that <hi>Addition.</hi> You, to mend the Matter, put the <hi>added</hi> Words directly into the Archbiſhop's Mouth, and vouch the ſame Cenſure, viz. <hi>Is not this a ſtrange Compariſon between theſe two contrary Spirits? And doth not the Framer of it diſcover what new Models of Divinity he affects? He is pleaſed to excuſe the Devil from ejecting any bad Thoughts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Men's Minds, and he exempts God's Spirit from being the Cauſe or Author of any good or holy Thoughts.</hi> The <hi>Compariſon</hi> is ſtrange enough indeed! But whether Dr. <hi>Edwards</hi> and your <hi>Reverence</hi> are not the <hi>Framers</hi> of it, let the Reader ſee. <hi>You,</hi> Sir, and your Brother <hi>Champion</hi> are the <hi>Framers</hi> of it, and as <hi>ſtupidly as injuriouſly</hi> have you <hi>framed</hi> it. For ſo far is the Archbiſhop from <hi>exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting God's Spirit from being the Author of any good or holy Thoughts,</hi> that it is the whole Scope or Argument of that very Diſcourſe, to prove it the <hi>ſole</hi> Prerogative of God, <hi>to know the Hearts of Men;</hi> and

conſequently his Power of being the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Author of <hi>good and holy Thoughts</hi> there; and denying this Prerogative to the Devil, and conſequently his Power of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the immediate Author of <hi>bad or evil ones.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Edwards</hi> is now dead and before his Maker, but you are yet alive, and therefore upon you I call, either to <hi>vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate</hi> or <hi>retract</hi> your Teſtimony in this Matter, in as publick a Manner as you have bore it, or to reſt under the Charge of being a <hi>wilful Deciever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe few Inſtances are ſufficient to ſhew the Neceſſity and Uſefulneſs of obſerving the above Rule in the preſent Caſe, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in all like Caſes of Controverſy what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. Let no Reader truſt the Citations of either Party or Parties concerned; but conſult and ſee them with his own Eyes. For how eaſy a Matter is it for a diſhoneſt Adverſary to miſ-repreſent and abuſe the Writings of any Author, ſpecially if gone to reſt from his Labours? It is but expoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in <hi>Shreds, Scraps,</hi> or <hi>Sentences de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached</hi> from their Connection, with ſome few Addition of Words, Gloſſes, Inuendoes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in order to give a wrong Turn; and

the Work is done: By theſe and like Means, the poor <hi>Author</hi> is demoliſhed; made to ſpeak the very Reverſe of his true Sentiments, the very contrary of what he meant and intended. Let Readers take Care; the beſt of Writers are not exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from this Uſage. The ſacred Pages have not eſcaped it, at the Hands of <hi>Collins, Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal,</hi> and other <hi>Infidel</hi> Writers.</p>
               <p>As to the Archbiſhop's Sentiments of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> in general, ſo charitably repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by Dr. <hi>Edwards</hi> and your <hi>Reverence,</hi> as <hi>mean</hi> and <hi>diſparaging,</hi> and his either <hi>giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a very crude Account of Chriſtian Duties, or jumbling them with mere Acts of Morality;</hi> I ſhall only lay before the Reader, the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Paragraph</hi> from the <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don<hi>'s</hi> 2d <hi>Paſtoral Letter,</hi> P. 64. 65. 4th Edit. <q>It may not be improper, before I ſhut up this Head, to obſerve that ſeveral of our moſt eminent Divines after the Reſtoration, ſet themſelves both by Preaching and Writing to enlarge upon the Importance of Moral Duties, and to recommend them with great Earneſtneſs to the Regard of the People; to ſuch a Degree, as to ſtand charg'd by others with too great a Diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

to Chriſtianity. Whereas, the Caſe in reality was this. During the Times of Confuſion, many of the Preachers had not only forborn to inculcate the Duties of Morality, but had labour'd to depreciate them; to perſuade the People that Faith was All, and Works Nothing. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Clergy after the Reſtoration, in order to take off thoſe unhappy Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, found themſelves obliged to incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with more than ordinary Diligence, the Neceſſity of moral Duties in the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Life, and to labour to reſtore them to their proper Share in the Chriſtian Scheme. But thoſe of them, who with the honeſt View I have mention'd, labour'd the moſt zealouſly in that Way, were at the ſame Time as zealous to explain to the People the great Work of our Redemption by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as the Means of Salvation which God has appointed: <hi>(a)</hi> The Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and Miſery into which Mankind was ſunk by the Fall of our firſt Parents; <hi>(b)</hi> The Neceſſity of a Mediator to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, and reſtore them to the Favour of God; <hi>(c)</hi> The Incarnation of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I ſhould here put an End to this Trouble, but as your Letter <hi>to the Inhabitants of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riland, &amp;c.</hi> is annexed to this I have now remark'd upon, I ſhall take Leave to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join a few Remarks on that valuable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance.</p>
               <p>In my humble Opinion, Sir, had you cauſed another <hi>Edition</hi> to be printed at <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia,</hi> of the <hi>Biſhop of</hi> London<hi>'s Letter to the Maſters and Miſtreſſes of Slaves in theſe Parts,</hi> and diſperſed the Copies on your Way, as you came through the ſeveral Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, you had done much more effectual Service, than by the Publication of your own. But if you knew of any ſuch Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of His <hi>Lordſhip</hi>'s being extant, I ſuppoſe you'll plead a ſpecial Call for the Publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your own, and that anſwers all Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You muſt inform them</hi> (the Inhabitants of <hi>Maryland, &amp;c.</hi>) you ſay, <hi>In the Meekneſs and Gentleneſs of Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> the <hi>Invective</hi>

is ſo apparent throughout this notable Epi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtle, that theſe can only be taken for ſome <hi>Cant-Terms</hi> you accuſtom yourſelf to in all your Scriblings. But what is it <hi>you Muſt thus inform them of?</hi> Why, <hi>that you</hi> Think <hi>God has a Quarrel with them, &amp;c.</hi> Had God ſent you charged with this <hi>ſpecial Meſſage,</hi> you might well ſay, that you <hi>MUST</hi> inform them of it; but as 'tis only a Matter of <hi>your own Thoughts,</hi> the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> does not ſo well appear. Your <hi>Thoughts</hi> in this Caſe may poſſibly be idle or ill grounded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo better kept at home. But <hi>God you THINK has a Quarrel with them,</hi> and <hi>for their Abuſe of and Cruelty to the poor Negroes.</hi> That God will <hi>have a Quarrel</hi> with any of the Human Race, for their <hi>Abuſe of and Cruelty</hi> to others, is a very juſt Thought; and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful out of all Doubt it is, for any of thoſe Inhabitants <hi>to uſe their Negroes as bad, nay worſe, than as tho' they were Brutes.</hi> But pray, Sir, on what Grounds do you bring <hi>this Charge</hi> againſt <hi>the Generality</hi> of thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants who own Negroes, <hi>of uſing them as had, nay worſe than as tho' they were Brutes?</hi> Do you <hi>know</hi> this Charge to be juſt and honeſt? Or have you ſufficient <hi>Evidence</hi> to ſupport it? No; you only

                  <hi>think</hi> it to be ſo, and <hi>fear</hi> it, and <hi>believe</hi> it. But on the contrary, I ſhall preſume, and on much better Grounds, to <hi>think, fear,</hi> and <hi>believe,</hi> that your Charge is falſe and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious! and that the very Reverſe of it is true, <hi>viz.</hi> that what particular Exceptions ſoever there may be as to <hi>good Uſage</hi> of Slaves (as ſome doubtleſs there are) yet that the <hi>Generality</hi> of Owners uſe their Slaves with all due Humanity, whether in reſpect of <hi>Work,</hi> of <hi>Food,</hi> or <hi>Raiment.</hi> And therefore I farther <hi>think</hi> and <hi>believe,</hi> that the <hi>Generality</hi> of Owners of Slaves in the reſpective Colonies, may bring their Actions of <hi>Slander</hi> againſt you; and that in a certain Country I know, you would be <hi>indicted</hi> for meddling, as you have done in this Matter, which may endanger the Peace and Safety of the Community.</p>
               <p>Hitherto we have only your <hi>Thoughts,</hi> your <hi>Fears,</hi> and your <hi>Belief</hi> on the Matter; you advance a-pace into <hi>poſitive</hi> Aſſertions. <hi>And perhaps,</hi> you ſay, <hi>it might be better for the poor Creatures themſelves to be hurried out of Life, than to be made</hi> ſo miſerable, <hi>as they</hi> generally <hi>are in it. And indeed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering what Uſage they commonly meet with,</hi> &amp;c. — I ſuppreſs the remainder of this
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:004588_0148_100DA6E0EE393C98"/>
and the next following <hi>Paragraph</hi> of your Epiſtle, as judging it both ſinful, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to the publick Safety to reprint them. More Virulence and Falſehood cannot be contained in ſo few Lines. For ſo far are the generality of Slaves in theſe Colonies, from being miſerable, that I dare confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vouch and affirm, and partly on my own Knowledge, that their Lives in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral are more happy and comfortable in all temporal Reſpects (the Point of Liberty only excepted) than the Lives of three fourths of the hired <hi>farming</hi> Servants, and Day Labourers, either in <hi>Scotland, Ireland,</hi> or even in many Parts of <hi>England,</hi> who not only labour <hi>harder,</hi> and fare <hi>worſe,</hi> but have moreover the Care and Concern on their Minds how to provide for their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies; which <hi>Slaves</hi> are entirely exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from, their Children being all provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for at the <hi>Owner</hi>'s Charge.</p>
               <p>Now, Sir, if this be really the Caſe with reſpect to the <hi>generality</hi> of Slaves in theſe Colonies, which can fully be proved it is; what <hi>Apology</hi> can ſuffice either for the Matter or Manner of your Letter, ſpecially the two modeſt <hi>Paragraphs</hi> above mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?

Alas, Sir, this Plea will never do! I have heard by <hi>Report,</hi> of your <hi>Abuſe and Cruelty</hi> to the poor <hi>Orphans</hi> under your Care, not only in <hi>Pinching</hi> their Bellies, but giving them up alſo to Taſk-Maſter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

for Cruelty and bad Uſage. I know alſo, that like Diſcipline and Correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt be obſerved among every Parcel of Slaves; and which in like Manner, may be, and often is miſrepreſented in the ſame Light: And therefore no ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, in either Caſe, can juſtify a direct Accuſation.</p>
               <p>As to the little or <hi>no proper Care taken by Owners of the Souls of their Slaves,</hi> it is too ſad a Truth; and I tremble to think, what Account they will give of it at the great Day! A ſore Evil indeed! But for which, your Letter, I conceive, will afford but a poor Remedy. I cannot think ſo ill of <hi>any,</hi> as you do of <hi>moſt</hi> of them, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>on Purpoſe,</hi> they keep their Slaves ignorant of Chriſtianity. I believe the Reaſon of their being ſo kept, is the want of one certain u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niform Method of teaching them, and which I hope will ſoon be eſtabliſhed with Succeſs. I readily agree, that the Objection to teaching them Chriſtianity, <hi>viz. that it would tend to make them leſs governable,</hi> or <hi>worſe Slaves,</hi> is wild and extravagant: But wiſh you had a little explained, what you mean by the Phraſes, <hi>Chriſtianizing;</hi> and MADE <hi>thorough Chriſtians;</hi> and <hi>the Goſpel

For ſure I am, <hi>that</hi> Paul <hi>may plant, and</hi> Apollos <hi>may water, but God alone can give the Encreaſe.</hi> Men may teach <hi>true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,</hi> but no Man can MAKE <hi>a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</hi>

               <p>Why this Doctrine of Infalibiliiy, or implicit Faith in their ſpiritual Guides, is what they abhor; they read their Bibles, and have learnt to refuſe us the Privilege of thinking for them, or explaining the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures by our Traditions.</p>

               <p>I have a Remedy provided in this Caſe that will bring them by degrees to be true Sons of our Church. The greateſt Number of People in every Place never think for themſelves, but follow the Man they admire. Your Buſineſs is to ſet up for uncommon Degrees of Sanctity, make bold Pretences to Illuminations and the Indwelling of the Spirit, and who can contradict you; Ply theſe Hereticks with Scripture, fix on that Text <hi>the moral Man exerciſeth not the Things of the Spirit of God, for they are Fooliſhneſs unto him, neither can he know them becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned; but he that is ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual judgeth all Things, and is judged of none.</hi> Inſiſt on it that all who differ from you in their Notions are <hi>carnal Men,</hi> who never felt the Power of Godlineſs in their own Souls; produce your own Experiences, as the beſt Commentaries on the Scriptures, and this will ſuit your Purpoſe as well as our Traditions, and will keep Men from explaining any Text contrary to Experiences of the Godly. Theſe Hereticks themſelves depend on the Spirit? Take a little Advantage of what is natural to their Tempers to expect, and what there is ground for the Righteous to wait for, turn to mechanick Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſes and violent Movings, and this will not fail to ſuit moſt Tempers, pretend that the ſame Spirit who inſpired the Apoſtles is freely beſtowed on you, and ſince natural Men cannot underſtand the Scriptures; and you have the Spirit in ſuch extraordinary Meaſure, you may ſurely claim the Rights to ſhew them the true Meaning of the Word, and to think for them in religious Matters, and this will effectually wreſt the Bible cut of their Hands who think not as you do, nor receive your Doctrine as the true Mind of God. For if any will dare to oppoſe the Sentiments of ſuch a holy Man, proclaim him an Enemy to God and his Intereſt, and ſet the Mobb on him, and it will paſs for Merrit to make a Sacrifice of ſuch an Hererick.</p>

Hence you may eaſily perſwade 'em not to truſt their own Judgement or Examination of their State, but to give themſelves up to their ſpiritual Guides, who can clearly ſee thro' 'em, and learn from their Confeſſion how Matters are between God and their Souls. And ſince none but real Chriſtians, as they all grant, have a Right to ſealing Ordinances, here is their Hold; ſhew 'em <hi>the Danger of Partaking if they are not Chriſtians;</hi> inſiſt that they confeſs their Caſes, under a Pretence of Reciting their Experiences, 'till you ſchool and accuſtom 'em to confeſs themſelves to you upon all Occaſions; and as you know they cannot tell their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences without mixing amongſt them ſome of their Relapſes and Miſcarriages, this will bring them by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to lay their Sins before you, and introduce Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of all Sorts, and gently bring them home to our holy Mother.</p>
