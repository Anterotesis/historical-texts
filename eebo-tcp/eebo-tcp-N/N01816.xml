            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IT is known to thoſe few in the World, who have any knowledge of ſo obſcure &amp; incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable a Perſon as I am, that in my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I am for the <hi>Congregational Church-Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,</hi> as it is in the <hi>New-England Platform</hi> declared. Which is no Abatement unto my great Eſteem &amp; Honour, for our Brethren of the <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian</hi> Peſwaſion; among whom <hi>I</hi> know, there have been as Pious and Learned Perſons, not only in <hi>England</hi> &amp; <hi>Scotland,</hi> but alſo in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, France, Geneva, &amp; Switzerland,</hi> &amp; elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, as any whom the World hath known. When the Divine Providence ordered my Reſiding at <hi>London</hi> for about Four Years, I did my utmoſt to promote an <hi>UNION</hi> between thoſe of the <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian</hi> &amp; <hi>Congregational</hi> Perſwaſion; and have received Thanks from the moſt Eminent of them, for thoſe my Endeavours, which thro' the Bleſſing of GOD, were not without Succeſs. They have been ſince known by the Name of, <hi>United Brethren.</hi> But I am far from Approving <hi>Morellianiſm,</hi> or <hi>Browniſm,</hi> or <hi>Independency,</hi> which is diſclaimed, not only by our Renowned <hi>Hooker,</hi> but alſo in our <hi>Platform of Church-Diſcipline.</hi> My declaring for the <hi>Deciſive Power</hi> of <hi>Councils,</hi> is not upon a Notion lately Eſpouſed by me; my Learned Tutor Mr. <hi>Norton,</hi> from whom I received Principles of Truth in my Youth, not to be forgotten in Old Age, has Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly handled that Queſtion in his Anſwer to

            </p>
            <p>I advance nothing in the following Papers, but what I have aſſerted many Years ago; particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, in, <hi>The Firſt Principles of New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> Written Fifty Years ſince; And in my, <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Goſpel,</hi> Printed, both in <hi>Boſton</hi> and at <hi>London,</hi> Twenty Years ſince, I handled that Queſtion, <hi>Whether there ought not to be an Agreement, that Matters of Importance,</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, the <hi>Ordaining,</hi> the <hi>Depoſing,</hi> and the <hi>Tranſlating</hi> of a <hi>Paſtor,</hi> ſhould be with a <hi>common Conſent?</hi> I there ſhew, that it was ſo, in the Next Age to the Apoſtles, and that <hi>Cyprian</hi> aſſures us, it was ſo in the Churches of <hi>Africa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was at the Deſire of <hi>My Brethren,</hi> ſeveral Miniſters in <hi>Boſton,</hi> that I ſet my Name alone to this <hi>Teſtimony;</hi> in the Compoſing &amp; Approving whereof, there were more hands than mine. I ſay, <hi>My Brethren,</hi> and not, <hi>My Sons,</hi> tho' I am the Natural Father to the Eldeſt of them; and in ſome Senſe a Father to the Two Next Eldeſt of them, who were my Academical Children, when Students at the College Thirty Years ago. I rejoyce that I have ſuch <hi>Brethren,</hi> and that when I am juſt going out of the World, I ſhall Leave Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters in <hi>Boſton,</hi> who, I truſt, will defend the Churches, when I ſhall Sleep with my Fathers.</p>
            <p>May our Lord <hi>JESUS CHRIST</hi> walk ſtill in the midſt of His Golden Candlesticks, and hold the Stars in His Right Hand, and cauſe us to Remember whence we are fallen, and to do the Firſt Works.</p>

            <head>A Seaſonable TESTIMONY To Good Order in the CHURCHES of the Faithful.</head>
            <head type="sub">
               <hi>Given by Several Miniſters of the Goſpel in BOSTON.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IT appears a Duty incumbent on us, whom the Hand of the Glorious LORD that is the <hi>King of Zion,</hi> hath Placed as <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Watchmen</hi> of Churches in a <hi>City ſet upon an Hill,</hi> to Publiſh unto the World, and leave with the Churches throughout the Country, a <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> relating to the <hi>Order of the Goſpel:</hi> And Expreſſing; (that ſo they whom we addreſs, may the more ſuitably <hi>Receive the Teſtimony</hi>) the Sentiments of our <hi>Synods,</hi> and of ſuch <hi>Divines</hi> as have been in ſome Sort <hi>Maſter-builders</hi> among thoſe by whom our Churches have been <hi>Edified:</hi> whoſe Thoughts cannot but Challenge a
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:002149_0005_0FBCBDDFEB91BF60"/>Great Attention, from thoſe to whom GOD has made them the Inſtruments of ſo much Illumination. The Deſign of our preſent Action being partly to do a Juſtice unto the Reputation of Churches, the <hi>Managements</hi> as well as <hi>Miniſters</hi> whereof ſhould be <hi>the Glory of CHRIST,</hi> and partly, to make an offer of what may be of ſome uſe, to direct their Steps on <hi>recurring Occaſions</hi> that may ariſe of no little Conſequence to their Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity; we may Comfortably Ask and Hope for the Bleſſing of Heaven upon it.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>I.</hi> THE firſt Caſe that at this Time calls for our Conſideration, is, <hi>The Releaſe of a Paſtor from the Solemn Charge of a Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which he has taken upon him.</hi> Upon this there have been once and again Publiſhed, ſome <hi>Determinations,</hi> which have been En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained without Exception in our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; From whence, (without Repeating the Cauſes of a <hi>Removal</hi> there allowed of) we tranſcribe theſe words, as Expreſſive of what we would have ever to be thought upon. [<hi>Thirty Caſes.</hi>]
<q>A <hi>Paſtor</hi> ſettled in the Service of a <hi>People,</hi> is to be ſo ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of his <hi>Deſignation</hi> by the Spirit &amp; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of the Lord JESUS CHRIST for that Service, and of the <hi>Account</hi> that he
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002149_0006_0FBCBDE158562210"/>muſt give unto GOD about his Behaviour in it, that his <hi>Removal</hi> muſt not be raſhly attempted, but with much Conſideration, Conſultation, Supplication, and Sincere Deſire to follow the Conduct of Heaven in it. The Frowns of GOD uſe to follow <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves,</hi> that have not ſo been Regulated.</q> 
               <hi>Again</hi>
               <q>That the <hi>will</hi> of our Lord about the <hi>Removal</hi> of any <hi>Paſtor</hi> from his <hi>People</hi> may be underſtood, it is requiſite, that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter do not entirely <hi>Aſſume to himſelf,</hi> the Judgment of his own Call to Remove, but a Great Regard muſt be had unto the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Churches of our Lord, in the Neighbourhood. <hi>Once more.</hi> If much of <hi>Scandal</hi> will certainly enſue upon the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval</hi> of a <hi>Paſtor</hi> from his People, <hi>That</hi> ſhould weigh down many Circumſtances that would rather invite it. <hi>And,</hi> It becomes not any Miniſter, to <hi>Seek his own Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> by firſt offering himſelf unto it.</q> It is accordingly our Apprehenſion, that ſuch a <hi>Removal</hi> ought ſtill to be attended, at leaſt with Two Qualifications to Legitimate it, and render it Inoffenſive unto the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of GOD.</p>
            <p n="1">Firſt. IT is requiſite, that the <hi>Reaſons</hi> of the <hi>Removal</hi> be laid before <hi>Authentick Judges;</hi> even ſuch as may be moſt likely to paſs an
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002149_0007_0FBCBDE55016A318"/>
               <hi>Impartial Judgment</hi> upon them; and by theſe be pronounced ſuch, that the <hi>Removal</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon may be Juſtly &amp; Wiſely proceeded in. And, where it can be obtained, we think, that nothing leſs than a <hi>Council</hi> of Churches in the Neighbourhood, ſhould have the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter laid before them. For, if ſuch a <hi>Council,</hi> be according to the <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Practice,</hi> of theſe Churches, always Convened, for the <hi>Ordaining</hi> of a <hi>Paſtor,</hi> it ſtands to Reaſon, that there ſhould as much be requiſite for his <hi>Removing;</hi> it being, as it was by a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiderable Number of Eminent Divines on a Great Occaſion in theſe Churches once pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, <hi>A very conſiderable Act of the Kingly Government Exerciſed by our Lord JESUS CHRIST, in His Churches.</hi> Accordingly, a General <hi>Synod,</hi> in the Year 1662. have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, That the <hi>Tranſlation of a Paſtor,</hi> is a Point, wherein the <hi>Communion of Churches</hi> is to be Exerciſed; and the chief way of <hi>Communion</hi> there Propounded, is Expreſsly that of <hi>Councils.</hi> And certainly ſo Important an Affair will demand ſuch a <hi>Cogniſance.</hi> Wherefore, If a Miniſter be upon a Removal from his Flook, eſpecially when there are no ſufficient Cauſes Evident for it, and the Flock Earneſtly Propound and Requeſt, that the thing may be laid before a <hi>Council</hi> of the
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002149_0008_0FBCBDE83128E278"/>Neighbour-Churches, but he refuſe it, it may be feared, that it is an <hi>Hour of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> with him, and that his <hi>Way is not Right</hi> before the LORD.</p>
            <p>Secondly. IT is requiſite, that the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> be found ſuch as are Conſiſtent with the <hi>Solemn Vow,</hi> which a Perſon who receives the <hi>Paſtoral Charge</hi> of a Church, makes unto our Glorious LORD, for the <hi>ſaithful Diſcharge</hi> of his Miniſtry, and the <hi>Labour &amp; Patience</hi> of One that muſt <hi>give up an Account</hi> unto Him; and Conſiſtent with the fervent <hi>Love,</hi> which One that has the <hi>Paſtoral Charge</hi> of a Church, ought to bear unto his Flock; <hi>having them in his Heart,</hi> as the Servant of GOD ſpeaks. <hi>To Die and to Live with them.</hi> Very Plain are the Directions of that Word, which they Preach unto others; [Act.

            <p n="2">
               <hi>II.</hi> ANOTHER Caſe that calls for our Conſideration, is; <hi>How the Right of a Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church to Chuſe their own Paſtor, is to be Exerciſed.</hi> Now herein we for ever adhere to the Sentiments, which we have ſome Years ago, declared in theſe Terms.
<q>A Body of Chriſtians <hi>Aſſociated</hi> for all the Ordinances of the Goſpel, are a CHURCH of our Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious LORD, which have among other precious Privileges, a <hi>Right</hi> from HIM, <hi>To Chuſe their own Paſtors.</hi> The Churches which have Recovered this <hi>Right</hi> from <hi>the Oppreſſion of Man,</hi> under which many Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002149_0010_0FBCBDEDB42A3F80"/>of the Reformation are to this day groaning, ought to <hi>keep the Precepts</hi> and the <hi>Favours</hi> of the Lord, and not eaſily part with what He has <hi>given them.</hi> NEVER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THELESS, A Church in the Exerciſe of this <hi>Right,</hi> ought in all poſſible ways con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent therewithal, to conſult the Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Satisfaction of their <hi>Neighbours;</hi> Eſpecially thoſe, on whoſe Aſſiſtance to carry on their Affairs, they may have much Dependence. The Church ought ſo to Manage their <hi>Choice,</hi> that if the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours have any juſt Diſſatisfaction, all the Reſpect required by <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and <hi>Gratitude,</hi> may be paid unto it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And long before this Inſtrument, which was given ſome Years ago, it was declared in the well-known, <hi>Thirty Caſes;</hi>
               <q>That a <hi>Particular Church</hi> owing a Great Regard unto the <hi>Church Catholick,</hi> in the uſing of its own <hi>Right,</hi> is bound to Conſult the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction and Edification of <hi>Others,</hi> in their <hi>Election</hi> of a <hi>Paſtor. And,</hi> That Churches in their <hi>Election</hi> of a <hi>Paſtor,</hi> are to conſider the Benefit of <hi>All</hi> that are to be his <hi>Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> and more particularly the Concurrence of ſuch, as are by the <hi>Covenant</hi> and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of GOD, under the <hi>Church-Watch</hi> among them. <hi>And,</hi> That <hi>Churches</hi> may
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:002149_0011_0FBCBDF0DCDFF7C0"/>ſuffer their <hi>Elections</hi> to be <hi>Directed,</hi> yea, and be <hi>Diverted,</hi> by Conſiderations, which they <hi>owe</hi> to others in the <hi>Vicinity,</hi> without Surrendring their <hi>Liberties</hi> to be Smothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by any that would unjuſtly Impoſe thereupon.</q>
            </p>
            <p>UNTO this, we now add our further De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, That a Church may be guilty of doing what is very <hi>Wrong,</hi> if they uſe the <hi>Right</hi> which they claim, in ſuch a way, as to forget thoſe Indiſpenſable Maxims of our SAVIOUR. [Rom.XIV. 19.] <hi>Let us follow the things that make for Peace, &amp; things wherewith one may edify another.</hi> And, [2 Cor.XII. 26.] <hi>Let all Things be done to Edifying.</hi> And, [1 Pet.

<q>
                  <hi>Conſociation</hi> of Churches
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002149_0016_0FBCBDFB1DEF6038"/>is not only lawful, but in ſome caſes neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. When cauſes are difficult &amp; parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches want light and help, they ſhould crave the aſſiſtance of ſuch a conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation. Churches ſo meeting, have right to counſel, rebuke, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as the caſe doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. In caſe any particular Church ſhall walk pertinaciouſly, either in the profeſſion of Error, or ſinful practice, and will not hear their counſel, they may and ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the right hand of fellowſhip with them.</q> Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> in ſeveral of his Treatiſes does advance Poſitions of the ſame Aſpect on the Neceſſity &amp; Authority of Regular <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,</hi> for the welfare of particular Churches. In one of his former, [Catech. p. 224.] he ſays,
<q>
                  <hi>Churches</hi> ought to preſerve a Mutual Holy communion, and Exerciſe it in making uſe of the Advice of one another. And in caſe any Church give offence to other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, other Churches may require an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count from them. Admeniſh them of their Faults, &amp; withold Communion from them, in caſe they perſiſt in the Error of their way; and that becauſe in their Difficulties, and before their Miſcarriages, they were bound to have deſired the Advice of other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; which being neglected by them, the other are to recover the End of it unto the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002149_0017_0FBCBE014D8833F0"/>utmoſt of their Ability.</q> Thus Dr. <hi>Owen.</hi> And in one of his laſt, he has theſe Memorable words. [Nat. of Church. part 2. p. 251.]
<q>No Church is ſo <hi>Independent,</hi> as that it can always, and in all caſes obſerve the Duties it owes unto the Lord CHRIST, and the <hi>Church Catholick</hi> by all thoſe Powers, which it is able to act in it ſelf diſtinctly, without Conjunction with others. And the Church that confines its Duty unto the <hi>Acts of its own Aſſemblies,</hi> cuts it ſelf off from the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Communion of the <hi>Church Catholick:</hi> nor will it be ſafe for any Man to commit the conduct of his Soul to ſuch a Church.— Every <hi>Particular Church</hi> which Extends not its Duty, beyond its own Aſſemblies and Members, is fallen off from the principal End of its Inſtitution. And every Principle, Opinion, or Perſwaſion, that inclines any Church to confine its Care &amp; Duty unto its own Edification only;</q> — is <hi>Schiſmatical.</hi> But <hi>Great has been the Army of them that have Publiſhed</hi> ſuch Truths as theſe, whereof ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing may be further ſeen in, <hi>The firſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> of <hi>New-England,</hi> Printed in the Year 1675. Unto all which we may add, what our celebrated <hi>Norton,</hi> has in his <hi>Laſt Sermons;</hi> Particularly, that paſſage,
<q>Let us acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Order of the Elderſhip in out
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002149_0018_0FBCBE0265716B30"/>Churches, in their Way, and the Order of <hi>Councils</hi> in their Way, duely back'd &amp; En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged; without which, Experience will witneſs that theſe Churches cannot long conſiſt.</q> Nor are the words of the worthy Mr. <hi>Samuel Danforth,</hi> (once Paſtor of <hi>Roxbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>) in his Election-Sermon, in the Year 1670. unworthy to be recited.
<q>In our Firſt and Beſt Times, what Pious Cate was there of Siſter Churches, — that in thoſe that wanted Peace, their Diſſenſions might be healed? What Readineſs was there in thoſe Days to call for the Help of Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Elders &amp; Brethren in caſe of any Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference or Diviſion that could not be healed at home? What Reverence was there then of the Sentence of a <hi>Council,</hi> as being <hi>Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive,</hi> and iſſuing the Controverſy? Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that Ancient Proverbial ſaying, <hi>They ſhall ſurely ask Counſel at Abel, and ſo they Ended the Matter.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>FROM whence, it will follow That if any of our Churches preſume to Tranſact their more <hi>Weighty Affairs,</hi> and ſuch as are of a <hi>Common Concern</hi> to the Churches in their Neighbourhood, with a <hi>Contempt</hi> of ſuch <hi>Councils</hi> of them as ought to be adviſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; or, if they ſhall upon grievous Differences ariſen among them, refuſe the Advice of
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002149_0019_0FBCBE084118A3C0"/>thoſe who urge them to make uſe of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, which the want of <hi>Light</hi> &amp; <hi>Peace</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them calleth for: and much more, if they ſhall proceed in Matters after the Neighbouring Churches have ſignified, that they cannot countenance their proceedings; thoſe Churches will be far from Expreſſing the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> which is <hi>with the well-adviſed;</hi> and will greatly Sin againſt the Second and Third Commandment; and will practically go too far towards Excluding themſelves from Communion with the Churches of the Faithful. Indeed, the more <hi>Councils</hi> &amp; <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods</hi> are diſregarded &amp; ſlighted, ſo much the more diſorder and confuſion will (we fear) grow &amp; prevail in all the Churches in the Country; which GOD of His Infinite Mercy prevent.</p>

               <hi>IV.</hi> CONCERNING the Caſe of <hi>Reinſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a Tranſlated Paſtor,</hi> which may alſo call for ſome Conſideration; we need only Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, what has been the <hi>Practice,</hi> of our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, in thoſe very <hi>Few Examples,</hi> that have been <hi>moſt generally approved</hi> of. The <hi>Paſtor</hi> having been (with the Advice of a <hi>Council</hi>) Regularly <hi>Releaſed,</hi> and then <hi>Diſmiſſed,</hi> from the Church where to he has been Related, the Church, whereto he has been upon a Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,

But yet a <hi>Charge</hi> has been uſed to be given by the Moderator, for the faithful Diſcharge of his Miniſtry, <hi>in this Place;</hi> and <hi>ſuitable Prayers</hi> accompany'd it; unto which has been added, <hi>The Right Hand of Fellowſhip,</hi> from the Churches. And indeed, All ſuch Things ought for ever to be done <hi>Decently and in Order.</hi> And as we hear, Unbiaſſed Strangers coming among us, have ſometimes confeſſed, <hi>That the moſt Solemn Actions they have ever ſeen in their Lives, have been the Ordinations in the Churches of</hi> New-England; ſo we cannot but wiſh, that they may never loſe any thing of their Solemnity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:002149_0021_0FBCBE0D2BA8A2C0"/>
To which end we find reaſon alſo to add our <hi>Teſtimony</hi> againſt all Indecency and Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularity in the Management of a Publick <hi>Diſſent</hi> from and <hi>Oppoſition</hi> unto the Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Inſtalment of a Paſtor over a Flock, whenſoever there may be Occaſion for ſo Melancholly an Action, which rarely hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens. We acknowledge the <hi>Right</hi> that every Chriſtian has, and much more, that any <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> of aggreived Brethren have, in an order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Manner to object and declare againſt the Ordination of a Miniſter, or his Induction into the Paſtoral Office over a Particular Flock, when they apprehend Sufficient Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for doing ſo. But then Chriſtianity requires that this be done, when it becomes neceſſary, with much Modeſty &amp; Calmneſs, Meekneſs and Gravity, Wiſdom and Seriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and not with a Noiſe, Wrath &amp; Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs, Diſagreeable to ſuch a Solemnity. Wherefore alſo, every Church ought very Carefully to avoid all Provocations, that may have a Tendency to drive things unto ſuch Extremities; and therefore Seaſonably to hear, and duely to Conſider, what the Diſſatisfied may have to offer.</p>
            <p>FINALLY; We know not what <hi>Irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities</hi> may come to be committed in any
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:002149_0022_0FBCBE11241BE198"/>of our Churches, as <hi>Days of Temptation,</hi> and of <hi>Defection,</hi> may grow upon us. The Caſe may ſo happen, [with <hi>Sad Reflection</hi> may we ſay ſo!] that Churches may with much Temerity, Reject the Advice of Other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and carry on their Affairs with ſo much Diſorder and Confuſion, as may open the Floodgates for a Torrent of Strife and Sin to break in, and much Damage ariſe to the Kingdom of GOD. In this Deplorable Caſe, there is an awful Proceedure directed in our <hi>Platform.</hi> [ch 15. §. 2.] <hi>If a Church be Rent with Diviſions among themſelves, or ly under any Open Scandal, and yet refuſe to Conſult with other Churches, for healing or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving of the ſame, it is Matter of juſt Offence, both to the Lord JESUS, and to other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. — And therefore the State of ſuch a Church calleth aloud upon other Churches, to Exerciſe a fuller Act of Brotherly Communion; to wit, By way of Admonition.</hi>—And, <hi>If ſtill the Offending Church continue in Obſtinacy and Impenitency, — and if they hear not the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod. — the Synod having declared them to be Obſtinate, Particular Churches, — are to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the Sentence of Non-Communion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively concerning them.</hi> And tho' for ſome ſpecial Reaſons, in ſuch a Day, it may
