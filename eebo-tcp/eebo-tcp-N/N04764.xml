            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>ROM theſe Words, conſider'd in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection and Dependance, I might raiſe a Variety of inſtructive Notes, for your profitable and pleaſing Entertainment. But this would ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing carry me away from the ſpecial Deſign I had in chuſing this Text; which was, to lead you into ſome Meditations agreable to the preſent Seaſon, the Commencement of a <hi>New Year,</hi> — after a <hi>wonderful Year</hi> of great Deliverances and ſignal Mercies; tho' ſhaded with a Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of cloudy and afflictive Diſpenſations. <hi>I will ſing of Mercy and Judgment: unto Thee, O Lord, will I ſing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To commemorate the <hi>Works</hi> of God, and <hi>remember the Years of the right Hand of the moſt High,</hi> is a Duty of perpetual, as well as univerſal Obligation, and can never be <hi>out of Seaſon:</hi> but on ſuch a Day as this, it appears to be eminently <hi>in Seaſon;</hi> it ſeems the ſpecial <hi>Duty of the Day.</hi> — It has been the Practice of God's Children (a very fit and reaſonable Practice) to take ſome peculiar Notice of the <hi>Beginning</hi> and <hi>Ending</hi> of the <hi>Year,</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:005947_0004_102727B32FC6DD90"/>
in their ſolemn Meditations and religious Exerciſes. And while we are careful to avoid every Thing of a ſuperſtitious Aſpect, not <hi>turning back to weak and beggarly Elements,</hi> nor <hi>obſerving Days and Months and Times and Years</hi> (from a Principle of <hi>Conſcience toward God,</hi> ſtrictly, as if any Seaſon had the ſame Character of <hi>Holineſs</hi> upon it as the <hi>Lord's Day</hi>) but only employing common Time to holy Purpoſes, as we have Opportunity, from a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Zeal toward God, and of Care for our Souls; I cannot but think it a laudable Cuſtom, to <hi>begin</hi> and <hi>end</hi> the Year with the Exerciſes of more ſolemn Devotion. It ſeems to fall within the Limits of thoſe general Rules, — <hi>Walk circumſpectly, not as Fools, but as Wiſe, redeeming the Time: — Gird up the Loins of your Mind: — Stabliſh your Hearts; for the Coming of the Lord draweth nigh: — Be diligent, that you may be found of Him in Peace, without Spot, and blameleſs.</hi> 
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">By Means of the Abuſe of <hi>Chriſtmas-Holidays,</hi> when many, that pretend to commemorate one of the moſt glorious Facts in the ſacred Story, our <hi>Lord's Nativity,</hi> do on that Occaſion indulge a looſe Behaviour, Idleneſs, and ſenſual Exceſs, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly more than at other Times, it's to be fear'd the Year is <hi>begun</hi> and <hi>concluded</hi> in ſuch a Manner by Multitudes, that ſcarce any Part of it ſeems proſtituted ſo much as this Seaſon, to the Service of Sin and the Diſgrace of Chriſtianity, by <hi>making Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for the Fleſh to fulfil the Luſts thereof,</hi> inſtead of <hi>putting on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>Among the religious Exerciſes of <hi>New Year's Day,</hi> a very fit one is <hi>Meditation:</hi> and on ſuch Occaſions one very fit Subject to employ our devout Thoughts, is that pointed out to us by the Pſalmiſt in our Text. <hi>I will remember the Years of the right Hand of the moſt High: I will remember the Works of the LORD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Poſſibly he may not here intend ſtrictly the Period of a <hi>Year;</hi> but only in general, by <hi>Years</hi> he may mean the <hi>Times</hi> and <hi>Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> wherein the <hi>Works</hi> were wrought, which he reſolves to recollect and celebrate. In the Context he uſes the Terms of <hi>Day</hi> and <hi>Year</hi> as equivalent. So by <hi>Years</hi> in our Text may be underſtood in general the <hi>Aera</hi>'s of God's marvellous Works, the <hi>Times</hi> or <hi>Seaſons</hi> of his remarkable Diſpenſations of Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. — Only, it may be, ſo much is hinted, ſometimes at leaſt,
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:005947_0005_102727B71F3C0478"/>
when the Word <hi>Year</hi> is made Uſe of, — as in our Text, <hi>the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ears of the right Hand of the moſt High,</hi> — that it refers to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>vine Works <hi>protracted</hi> to a conſiderable Length of Time; it may point at a <hi>long Seaſon</hi> of glorious divine Operations. A <hi>Year</hi> being the moſt extended Period in the natural Diviſion of Time, this Word may be choſen to denote a <hi>Series</hi> of Days of God's Power and Goodneſs, a <hi>continued Courſe</hi> of his wonderful Works to the Children of Men.</p>
            <p>However, taking the Term in its literal Signification, for the Space of Duration properly denominated a <hi>Year,</hi> it muſt be granted, that ſome <hi>Years</hi> are eminently <hi>the Years of the right Hand of the moſt High.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We muſt note here, 'tis but by a Figure that <hi>Hands</hi> are aſcribed to God, who is a <hi>Spirit,</hi> and hath not <hi>bodily</hi> Parts or Paſſions as Men have. The <hi>Hand</hi> being one of the comelieſt, ſtrongeſt, moſt active and important Members of the human Syſtem, of conſtant and extenſive Uſe, ſerving to a vaſt Variety of valuable Purpoſes in human Life; hence, while the Scripture condeſcends to accommodate its Language to our Capacity, in deſcribing the bleſſed God, we find his <hi>Hand</hi> fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſpoken of: which yet is to be underſtood only as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd by Way of Analogy or Alluſion, and principally imports the divine Influence and Activity, or the Exertment of God's Power and Perfections on the Creature. — We may further obſerve, that as <hi>Man,</hi> to whom ſuch Expreſſions allude, is pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileged with a Duplicity of <hi>Hands,</hi> a right and a left, hence in the ſame analogical Way a <hi>Plurality</hi> of this excellent Member is attributed to God in Scripture, and under the expreſs Diſtinction too of <hi>his right Hand</hi> and <hi>his left;</hi> — tho' when the <hi>Hand</hi> of God is mention'd with one or other of theſe Epithets join'd to it, 'tis the former that is moſt commonly uſed. So in our Text, <hi>the Years of the Right Hand of the moſt High.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It mayn't be unfit to note here more particularly,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Right Hand</hi> commonly being the <hi>ſtrongeſt</hi> and the <hi>moſt uſed,</hi> and having a greater <hi>Aptitude</hi> for Exerciſe, hence this does moſt ſignificantly expreſs <hi>Power,</hi> and <hi>Action,</hi> and <hi>Skill:</hi> and when figuratively apply'd to God, it often denotes his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Strength, Activity, and Dexterity in Operation. So <hi>the Years of the right Hand of the moſt High</hi> may intend the Years of his mighty Works, and glorious Atchievements, diſplaying
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:005947_0006_102727B8B0A579D8"/>
his immenſe Wiſdom, moſt active Nature, and divine Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Right Hand</hi> is of all the Members of the Body one of the moſt <hi>beloved</hi> and <hi>endeared</hi> to us. This is the Favourite-Hand. In Alluſion to which Property, the Mortification of a darling Luſt is compar'd in Scripture to the <hi>Cutting off a Right Hand.</hi> — The Patriarch <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Son <hi>Benjamin</hi> (which ſignifies <hi>a Son of the Right Hand</hi> had his Name given him for this Reaſon, becauſe he was the Son of his peculiar <hi>Affection.</hi> — So <hi>the Years of the right Hand of the moſt High</hi> may intend ſuch as have been diſtinguiſh'd by the Smiles of Heaven, and been full of the Bleſſing of the Lord, — remarkable Years of his Loving-kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Favour, wherein his <hi>good Hand</hi> has been ſignalized towards his People; — and ſuch as may be called the <hi>Favourite-Years,</hi> which he hath as it were <hi>embraced with his Right Hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Right Hand</hi> is ſignificant, among Men, of <hi>Dignity</hi> and <hi>Preheminence.</hi> The Right Hand is that on which, as the worthieſt, the <hi>Signet</hi> has been wont to be worn: and in Token of Honour, Perſons of Diſtinction are placed on our Right Hand. Hence Chriſt's Exaltation in the heavenly Places is repreſented in figurative Language, by his <hi>ſitting down on the Right Hand of the Majeſty on high:</hi> which imports his being near and dear to God, and crown'd with ſuperlative Glory. Hence he is ſaid to be <hi>ſet down with his Father on his Throne:</hi> and is called <hi>the Man of his right Hand.</hi> To him God hath <hi>ſworn by his Right Hand;</hi> Him hath God <hi>exalted with his Right Hand;</hi> Him hath He exalted <hi>to his Right Hand;</hi> and he is indeed <hi>his Right Hand,</hi> the <hi>Right Hand of his Righteouſneſs,</hi> and the Strength of his Salvation. — So the Expreſſion in our Text, <hi>the Years of the right Hand of the moſt High,</hi> may be underſtood of Years which God has emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently dignify'd, raiſed in Fame above other Years, and put a remarkable Luſtre and Diſtinction upon, by great Works of the Arm of the Lord bringing Salvation and Proſperity, that make them ſhine in the Annals of the Church. Theſe may be called <hi>Years crowned with his Goodneſs,</hi> as the Expreſſion is in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.11. — He hath <hi>ſtretched out his Right Hand,</hi> and <hi>laid it on their Head,</hi> honouring them (as the <hi>Firſt born</hi>) with a double Portion of his Bleſſing.</p>

The <hi>Right Hand</hi> is given among Men, one to another, in Token of <hi>Covenanting,</hi> and profeſſing <hi>Friendſhip.</hi> Holding up the <hi>Hand</hi> was the ancient Mode of taking a ſolemn <hi>Oath:</hi> and <hi>giving the Hand</hi> has always been practiſed as a federal Rite, as a Signal of Agreement, and an Expreſſion of Friendlineſs.

            <p>Thus I have aſſign'd ſome of the moſt probable Senſes of the Phraſe in our Text.

And indeed this is counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced

by the Connection of the Words. <hi>I will remember the Years of the Right Hand of the moſt High: I will remember the Works of the Lord: Surely I will remember thy Wonders of old,</hi> &amp;c. Then in the following Verſes the Pſalmiſt proceeds to celebrate the mighty Acts of God, and his gracious Appearances for his People. — Accordingly in the preſent Diſcourſe I ſhall have a particular Eye to this Senſe, as primarily intended; tho' not excluding the others. — And when the Text ſpeaks of <hi>remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring the Works of the Lord,</hi> and <hi>the Years of his Right Hand,</hi> we are to underſtand by this, not a meer ſpeculative Exerciſe of the Mind and Memory on theſe Objects, but alſo correſpondent Actions of the Judgment and Conſcience, Will and Affections, with agreable Practice and Behaviour in the outward Life.</p>
            <p>Having premiſed theſe general Obſervations, I ſhall now diſtinctly mention ſome of thoſe <hi>Years</hi> of God's Right Hand, and ſome of thoſe <hi>Works</hi> of the moſt High, which challenge from us this devotional and practical Commemoration.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I begin with commending to your Remembrance the Year of the <hi>Creation,</hi> and its mighty Wonders.</p>
            <p>This is a great and notable <hi>Year of the Lord;</hi> as it were, <hi>the Beginning of his Strength,</hi> and the <hi>Firſt-born</hi> among the <hi>Years of the Right Hand of the moſt High.</hi> This ancient Year, the firſt Date of Time, muſt never be forgotten, when we profeſs to <hi>remember the Works of the Lord,</hi> and to <hi>conſider the Days of old, the Years of ancient Times.</hi> It muſt ever be remembred, that <hi>in the Beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth,</hi> and formed all Things by the Word of his Power. Then his <hi>Right Hand</hi> became glorious in Power, and wrought wondrouſly: He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed his <hi>mighty Arm,</hi> ſtrong was his <hi>Hand,</hi> and high his <hi>Right Hand.</hi> Then the Greatneſs of his Excellency appeared; then he manifeſted forth his Glory, the Glory of his Strength, and Wiſdom, and Goodneſs, Sovereignty, and Alſufficiency, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing theſe Worlds out of Nothing, in forming them with ſuch admirable Beauty and Harmony, filling them with ſuch unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Riches, and ſtocking them with ſuch glorious Inhabitants: All which ſhould come into our Remembrance. — We ſhould <hi>conſider his Heaven,</hi> the Work of his Fingers; and enter with our Meditations into the upper and inviſible World, the Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of bleſſed <hi>Angels.</hi> — But <hi>the Years of the Right Hand of the moſt High</hi> is a Phraſe that calls our Thoughts down to this viſible
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:005947_0009_102727C0DA4B9140"/>
and lower World, the Stage of <hi>Time</hi> and the Seat of <hi>Mankind.</hi> The Sons of the Morning ſaw that great Work, which the Lord did, when he created this Earth, and brought forth Man upon it: thoſe <hi>Morning-Stars</hi> ſang the Praiſes of their and our Creator, and ſhouted for Joy at the building this Temple, ſacred to the Honour of his Name. The Lord himſelf <hi>rejoiced in the Works of his Hand:</hi> and upon a Review of the whole, pronounced <hi>all very good.</hi> He conſtantly claims it as his Prerogative to <hi>create,</hi> and glories in his Character of univerſal <hi>Creator.</hi> Thus ſaith the Lord, <hi>I am the Firſt, and I am the Laſt; and beſides Me there is no God. — I am the Lord that maketh all Things, that ſtretcheth forth the Heavens alone, that ſpreadeth abroad the Earth by my ſelf.</hi> And again, <hi>I have made the Earth, and created Man upon it; I, even my Hands have ſtretched out the Heavens, and all their Hoſt have I commanded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Verily the Year of the <hi>Creation</hi> is one of the moſt glorious and memorable <hi>Years of the Right Hand of the moſt High.</hi> — The <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible Things of Him</hi> from the <hi>Creation</hi> of the World are clearly ſeen, being underſtood by the Things that are made, even <hi>his eternal Power and Godhead.</hi> — The <hi>Heavens</hi> declare his <hi>Glory;</hi> the <hi>Earth</hi> alſo is full of his <hi>Riches;</hi> at its firſt Formation 'twas eminently ſo. In its Production and Eſtabliſhment, the <hi>Glory of the Lord</hi> brake forth with an aſtoniſhing Luſtre, and the <hi>Right Hand of his Power</hi> wrought marvellous Things without Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. — Well may we adore the Creator in that Language, <hi>Who is a God like unto Thee! Glorious in Holineſs, fearful in Praiſes, doing Wonders. — Worthy art Thou, O Lord, to receive Glory, and Honour, and Power; for Thou haſt created all Things, and for thy Pleaſure they are, and were created.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſhould often contemplate on the Glories of the <hi>Creation</hi> in its <hi>general</hi> View; and wiſely apply the Meditation to its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per practical Uſes, — to make us hate and mourn for Sin, which caſts Contempt on God and his wonderful Works, — to raiſe our Admiration of the divine Excellency, Fulneſs and Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the great <hi>Creator,</hi> — to excite our Veneration, Love, Gratitude, with every other devout Paſſion; — particularly to confirm our Faith in the Promiſes of an alſufficient God, — eſpecially with Reſpect to the coming Day of the <hi>Reſtitution of all Things.</hi>—And ſince our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the only Begotten of the Father, ſuſtains in common with him this exalted Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the <hi>Former of all Things,</hi> as well as the Saviour of his

Body the Church, this Reflection ſhould eſtabliſh us in the Belief of his <hi>eternal Divinity,</hi> ſo plainly taught us in the Scriptures: for <hi>He that built all Things is God.</hi> Hence, according to his Demand, <hi>all Men ſhould honour the Son, even as they honour the Father.</hi> The <hi>Earth</hi> is the Lord's, and the Fulneſs thereof; we ſhould therefore <hi>honour the Lord with our Subſtance;</hi> and we ſhould <hi>glorify him in all Things,</hi> conſecrating our ſelves and all our Enjoyments to his Service and Honour: Particularly as we <hi>believe</hi> in God the Father, ſo ſhould we alſo in God the Son, by whom he hath in theſe laſt Days ſpoken to us, <hi>by whom alſo he made the Worlds,</hi> and whom he hath appointed Heir of all Things. What a powerful Motive have we to the firmeſt <hi>Truſt</hi> in Jeſus Chriſt, ſince he is the <hi>Maker,</hi> and therefore <hi>Lord of all!</hi> And well may the conſcious <hi>Believer</hi> triumph in the Name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> to whom he has committed and devoted himſelf. — But <hi>Sinners</hi> in <hi>Zion,</hi> on the contrary, may well be <hi>afraid,</hi> when they conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Whom</hi> they deſpiſe and refuſe, even the <hi>great Creator</hi> and <hi>high Poſſeſſor of Heaven and Earth,</hi> the <hi>one Lawgiver</hi> that is able to ſave and to deſtroy; who ſpared not the <hi>old World,</hi> but brought a <hi>Flood</hi> upon the Ungodly, nor will ſpare <hi>the World that now is,</hi> but <hi>reſerveth it unto Fire</hi> againſt the Day of Judgment and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of ungodly Men, which ſhall ſo come as a Thief in the Night, in the which the <hi>Heavens</hi> being on Fire ſhall be diſſolved, and the Elements melt with fervent Heat, the <hi>Earth</hi> alſo and the Works therein ſhall be burnt up. Seeing then that ye look for ſuch Things, make the <hi>World</hi> no longer your Idol: but mind the <hi>one Thing needful,</hi> your eternal Intereſt; ſeek and chuſe the <hi>good Part,</hi> that (being obtained) ſhall never be taken from you. <hi>Brethren, the Time is ſhort,</hi> and the <hi>World paſſeth away,</hi> with the Luſt thereof: but he that doeth the Will of God, <hi>abideth for ever,</hi> and poſſeſſeth a moſt <hi>durable</hi> and <hi>bliſsful Inheritance.</hi> And this is the Will of God, that ye <hi>believe</hi> on him whom he hath ſent, who is the alone Saviour, and whoſe Favour only can be your Security at the laſt Day amidſt the Terrors of a diſſolving World. May you therefore now be perſwaded to <hi>flee for Refuge to lay hold of the Hope ſet before you,</hi> and be diligent that you may be <hi>found of him in Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to proceed,</p>
            <p>Among all the glorious Occurrences of the <hi>Creation-Year,</hi> the moſt illuſtrious and ſignal were thoſe referring to <hi>Man,</hi> his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and the divine Diſpoſition of him and Tranſactions with him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:005947_0011_102727C7D0E6DBC8"/>Tho' it be the general Character of <hi>Man,</hi> that he is <hi>born of a Woman,</hi> yet our firſt Parents were the immediate <hi>Offspring of God,</hi> brought into Being by his creating Hand. <hi>Male and Female</hi> (one of a Sex) <hi>created he them.</hi> God formed the <hi>firſt Man</hi> out of the <hi>Duſt</hi> of the Ground, and the <hi>firſt Woman</hi> out of one of his <hi>Ribs:</hi> and the Lord breathed into their Noſtrils the <hi>Breath of Life;</hi> ſo they became each a <hi>living Soul.</hi> He <hi>brought the Woman to the Man,</hi> and joined them by the Bond of Matrimony even in Paradiſe; and of this <hi>one Blood</hi> (originally pure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupt) hath God made all Nations of Mankind, of every Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and Language, dwelling on all the Face of the Earth. Now indeed they are in a depraved State univerſally, and the Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Man is great upon the Earth; <hi>nor can he be clean, that is born of a Woman:</hi> But from the Beginning it was not ſo; for <hi>God made Man upright, — in the Image of God created he him,</hi> with a ſuperior Light in his Underſtanding, a heavenly Bias on his Will and Affections, and a divine Rectitude in all the Powers of his intellectual and moral Nature; whereby he ſhone at firſt as a little <hi>Image</hi> of God upon Earth, and had the Beaſts of the Field in League with him, a League of Friendſhip and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>
            <p>The Production of this noble Creature, <hi>Man,</hi> is celebrated every where in Scripture as a tranſcendent Work of divine Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Power, and the Account we have of it in the <hi>Moſaic</hi> Hiſtory is accordingly introduced with that peculiar Enſign of Counſel and Solemnity, <hi>Let us make Man.</hi> — And truly if <hi>Man</hi> be conſider'd in his twofold <hi>Nature</hi> and original <hi>Conſtitution,</hi> he appears to have been <hi>fearfully and wonderfully made.</hi> — His <hi>Body</hi> an admirable Structure, full of Myſtery and Glory, a meet Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle for his pure and immortal Spirit, and the Temple of the living God, every Way fitly framed together, and exhibiting the infinite Skill and Perfection and Goodneſs of its divine Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. — But the <hi>Soul</hi> of Man ſtill more excellent, as it firſt came out of his forming Hand; participating of the divine Nature, in its Spirituality and Immortality, in its Powers of Perception, Judgment and Choice, and in the Harmony, the moral Purity and Perfection of all its Faculties. — And above all the viſible Creation, <hi>Man</hi> had a conſpicuous Reſemblance to his bleſſed Maker and Sovereign, in the Dignity and Felicity of his exalted <hi>Condition;</hi> as having Dominion over all the other Creatures in this ſublunary World, ſituated in Paradiſe, the Centre of all ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene

Pleaſures, Riches and Glories, and enjoying the moſt inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Communion with his divine Maker.</p>
            <p>What a happy and excelling Creature was <hi>Man</hi> in the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning! How dignify'd and diſtinguiſh'd! An Angel in Fleſh, a Kind of terreſtrial God, an illuſtrious Image of the ſupreme Majeſty!</p>
            <p>And how did his Maker exalt him by entring into <hi>Covenant</hi> with him, a Covenant of Friendſhip and of glorious Grace, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the wiſeſt and moſt righteous Demands, as well as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced with the moſt weighty Sanctions, perfectly adjuſted to his Nature and State, addreſſing to his Reaſon and Conſcience, to his Hopes and Fears, and to every Paſſion of his Soul; and thus moſt excellently calculated to ſecure his Obedience, and hereby his Happineſs! Surely this is a memorable Occurrence: one of the moſt ſignal and admirable in the primitive Year of Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
            <p>But after all it muſt be obſerved, there's one <hi>dark</hi> and moſt <hi>melancholy</hi> Event (which not <hi>God,</hi> but <hi>Man</hi> only was the Author of) that eclipſed the Glory of this <hi>Year of the Right Hand of the moſt High,</hi> ſpread a univerſal Gloom upon the Face of the Earth, turn'd Man out of Paradiſe, and degraded him to a Level with the brutal Herd, — I mean <hi>Adam</hi>'s <hi>Tranſgreſſion,</hi> in the Matter of the forbidden Fruit. An amazing Fall! and a horrid Guilt, that reach'd Heaven and ſpread through all the Earth, that ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated not in his ſingle Perſon, but extends to his whole natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Poſterity through all Generations! Alas, <hi>Man being in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, underſtood not,</hi> but quickly corrupted his Way, and <hi>became like the Beaſts that periſh.</hi> God made him holy and happy, but with a mutable Nature and in a mutable State; and having in his adorable Sovereignty put him upon Trial, by a diſciplinary Prohibition, he diſobey'd, and <hi>fell by Tranſgreſſion,</hi> loſt the Image of God his Maker, forfeited the divine Preſence and Favour, and involved his numerous Progeny in Guilt and Ruin together with himſelf. For ſo the Scripture teaches us to account for the preſent State of this evil World, — <hi>By one Man's Diſobedience many were made Sinners — By the Offence of one, Judgment came upon all Men to Condemnation — By one Man Sin entred into the World, and Death by Sin; and ſo Death paſſed upon all Men, for that all have ſinned.—In</hi> Adam <hi>all die.</hi>—And <hi>curſed</hi> was the very <hi>Ground for his Sake, the Creature by Reaſon of him was made ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Vanity,</hi> and the Earth groans under the Burden of its
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:005947_0013_102727CB8CA75D58"/>
guilty Inhabitants, and the Effects of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall, even until now. Thus the Creation was ſcarce finiſh'd before <hi>Man</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted, and by the Merit of his Sin filled this habitable Word with Darkneſs and Death, and introduced a moſt formidable Train of Evils. <hi>This is for a Lamentation;</hi> and it ſhould always be called to Mind with juſt Reſentments of Shame and Grief, while we are recollecting the wondrous Events of <hi>the Year of God's</hi> crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, it ſhould be remember'd too, that God our Maker, in his ſovereign Grace, preſently upon the Fall of Man, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd the <hi>good Tidings of Peace;</hi> and opened a <hi>new Covenant,</hi> in the Promiſe, that <hi>the Seed of the Woman ſhould bruiſe the Serpent's Head,</hi> who had <hi>beguiled</hi> Eve <hi>through his Subtilty:</hi> — which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd a Declaration of God's gracious Purpoſe to <hi>viſit and redeem his People,</hi> and to <hi>raiſe up a Horn of Salvation</hi> in his own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Time.</p>
            <p>Thus I have hinted at ſome of the memorable and ſurprizing Occurrences of this firſt <hi>Year of the Right Hand of the moſt High,</hi> the Year of <hi>Creation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this ſurely is a Year <hi>much to be remembred,</hi> and never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by us. While we read our <hi>Bible,</hi> we find it frequently reminding us of this memorable Year, and calling its remarkable Events to our Remembrance. Indeed it's here only, that we meet with the Hiſtory of theſe ancient Facts. How thankful ſhould we be for the ſacred Scriptures, to which we are indebted, as for peculiar Diſcoveries of the Mind and Will of God, ſo of his Works? In this divine Revelation to Mankind we have ſuch Diſcoveries as tranſcend thoſe of the moſt improv'd Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, particularly in Relation to the <hi>firſt Cauſe</hi> and the <hi>laſt End</hi> of all Things, the <hi>Origin of Good and Evil,</hi> the priſtine <hi>perfect</hi> and preſent <hi>fallen</hi> States of Man, &amp;c. Diſcoveries, of the laſt Importance to us, and ſuch as ſpeak the <hi>Scriptures</hi> to be of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Excellency and Uſefulneſs. How thankful ſhould we be for this ſingular Privilege of Scripture-Revelation? How diligently ſhould we conſult it? And while we do ſo, we ſhall find it often reading to us entertaining Lectures on the Works of God, particularly thoſe in the memorable Year of <hi>Creation:</hi> calling this to our Thoughts, and ſpeaking of its various Events as deſerving our ſolemn Attention and Conſideration; in which therefore we ſhould frequently exerciſe our ſelves, — not on a mere <hi>Philoſophic</hi> Deſign, but on <hi>Theological</hi> Principles, and with
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:005947_0014_102727D0C3C220B0"/>
a View to thoſe <hi>devotional</hi> and <hi>practical</hi> Ends, which this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation has in its Nature a Fitneſs to ſubſerve.</p>
            <p>Our whole Life is not too much to be employ'd in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration of God's wonderful Works in the Year of <hi>Creative.</hi> The longeſt Life, yea, Eternity itſelf, can never exhauſt the boundleſs Subject. We ſhould enter early on the Buſineſs of remembring God and his Works. What ſaith the Scripture <hi>I Remember now thy Creator in the Days of thy Youth.</hi> Under this his firſt relative Character, we ſhould all of us, Young and Old, be much in <hi>remembring the Lord our God.</hi> — We ſhould remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that <hi>God made the Earth, and created Man upon it;</hi> gave him his Being, and this at firſt a Being admirably excellent, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with all the Advantages of intrinſick Perſection, and every deſirable external Accommodation. Our Commemoration of theſe Things ſhould be frequent; nor merely contemplative, but influential on our Hearts and Lives.</p>
            <p>Let it be ſaid here diſtinctly,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Conſidering the <hi>Production</hi> of Man, in its <hi>general</hi> or more ſimple and abſolute, View, it is to be <hi>remembred</hi> by us, with due Acknowledgments to God, practical and devotional.</p>
            <p>We ſhould confeſs God the <hi>firſt Cauſe</hi> of Man's <hi>Exiſtence,</hi> the <hi>Origin</hi> of our <hi>Being,</hi> the Author of human <hi>Nature,</hi> in its very firſt and all ſucceſſive Inſtances. And this <hi>Work of the Right Hand of the moſt High</hi> is to be <hi>remembred</hi> by us in the Exerciſe of every correſpondent Diſpoſition, and with all agreable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portments. — We ſhould ſee and own our common <hi>Obligations</hi> to God our Maker, and ever maintain a <hi>thankful</hi> Senſe of the Riches of his creating Goodneſs. — We ſhould, by often view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Him as <hi>Creator,</hi> ſtudy to get and keep our Minds under the deepeſt Impreſſion of our abſolute <hi>Dependance</hi> on him; and learn the great Leſſon of intire <hi>Submiſſion</hi> to his ſovereign Will. —We ſhould apply this Reflection to invigorate and enliven our Belief of a divine <hi>Providence,</hi> ſuperintending the World moral, as well as natural; and learn accordingly to refer all our Affairs, all our Intereſts (together with our Perſons) to the divine Direction and Diſpoſal, with a firm <hi>Confidence</hi> in God, as a Being perfectly ſufficient to preſerve us, and to provide for us, whether in Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Body or Soul, to Time or Eternity. — The Conſideration of God as <hi>Creator</hi> ſhould ſerve alſo to awaken in us the moſt humble <hi>Fear,</hi> and awful Apprehenſions of him. This divine
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:005947_0015_102727D254BA0BA8"/>
Character ſpeaks his infinite Diſtance from us in Nature, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Dignity above us, his abſolute Authority over us; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpeaks him the juſt Object of our higheſt Reſpect and ſolemn Dread, and challenges our moſt ſolicitous Care to pleaſe and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him, and to walk humbly before him.— Should we not alſo <hi>love,</hi> as well as reverence the Hand that formed us? Ought not our Deſire to be unto his Name, and to the Remembrance of him? As we are in a natural Senſe <hi>the Offspring of God,</hi> ſurely our heavenly <hi>Father</hi> deſerves our beſt Affections. Accordingly that is his Demand, <hi>My Son, give me thy Heart.</hi> A Demand founded in the moſt perfect Reaſon, and approving itſelf to every enlighten'd Conſcience. How then can any of us (viler than the <hi>Ox,</hi> that knoweth his Owner) be ſo ſtupid and ungrateful, as not to <hi>inquire after God our Maker,</hi> but <hi>forget the Rock that beg at us!</hi> Or how can we deny him our whole Thought and Heart, who gave us our very Breath and Being! Yet <hi>this is our Manner from our Youth.</hi> — And how abſurd our Conduct, while <hi>by breaking the Law</hi> we <hi>diſhonour God</hi> that made us! Surely we ought to be <hi>in Subjection to the Father of Spirits,</hi> and <hi>learn Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> from this View of God. The <hi>Creator</hi> muſt needs be the Lawgiver and the chief End of Man. He that made all Things <hi>for himſelf,</hi> has an undoubted Right of Propriety in and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over them, and juſtly claims a Tribute of Praiſe from them, according to their various Natures and Capacities: and moſt certainly he propoſed <hi>his own Glory</hi> as the ſupreme Deſign of <hi>Man</hi>'s Creation, whom he fram'd with a Capacity of rendring to him a <hi>reaſonable Service,</hi> a voluntary active Homage, and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Worſhip; thereby diſtinguiſhing him from the <hi>Fowls of Heaven</hi> and <hi>Beaſts of the Earth, that have no Underſtanding,</hi> to conſtitute them fit Subjects of moral Government. Wherefore, as we would <hi>ſhew ourſelves Men,</hi> it becomes us to ſtudy the Will of God, and be <hi>obedient</hi> in all Things. And how befitting the fallen Creature is that Prayer of the Pſalmiſt? <hi>Thy Hands,</hi> O God, <hi>have made and faſhioned me; Give me Underſtanding, that I may learn thy Commandments.</hi>—Now (to add no more here) the Commandments which reſpect our <hi>Neighbour,</hi> as well as thoſe which more immediately reſpect God, are what we have to learn. That comprehenſive and excellent Law, <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf,</hi> receives Light and Force from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of God as our original <hi>Creator</hi> and <hi>common Father.</hi> This Thought ſhould reſtrain us from deſpiſing, injuring, or

maligning any of our <hi>Fellow-Creatures:</hi> yea, it ſhould teach us to <hi>do Good unto all Men,</hi> as we have Opportunity, to be <hi>kindly affectioned</hi> to one another, and to love as <hi>Brethren;</hi> ſince <hi>we all have one Father,</hi> ſince <hi>one God created us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I go on to ſay,</p>
            <p n="2">2. When we contemplate the <hi>Manner</hi> of Man's Production, and <hi>how</hi> he was form'd <hi>originally,</hi> this complex View of the Caſe will afford us ſtill more Leſſons of Wiſdom; and lead us to other practical Uſes, to which we ſhould apply our Reflections on the <hi>Year of God's</hi> creating <hi>Hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Particularly as to Man's <hi>Body,</hi> when we remember that this was originally made <hi>out of the Duſt of the Ground,</hi> it ſhould lead us to admire the infinite <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Skill</hi> of the Creator, in form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo curious and comely a Fabrick, out of ſuch mean and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apt Materials: and to admire the <hi>Myſtery</hi> of Wiſdom in the <hi>Union</hi> of two ſuch diſtant Natures, a heavenly Spirit and earthly Fleſh, in one human Perſon:— as alſo to admire the infinite <hi>Condeſcenſion</hi> of God in admitting an embody'd Spirit to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of his ſacred Preſence and Communion, while he had Thouſands of <hi>Angels</hi> to miniſter about his Throne above, nor ſtood in any Need of the ſublimeſt Homages and Honours of his moſt exalted Creatures, much leſs of the mean Services of <hi>Man</hi> upon his Footſtool here below. — And when we reflect, that Man (as to his viſible Part) was <hi>formed out of Clay,</hi> that <hi>the firſt Man was of the Earth earthy,</hi> and that <hi>we have born the Image of the Earthy,</hi> this ſhould mortify the <hi>Pride of Life,</hi> humble us by a Senſe of our mean Original, and make us afraid to <hi>ſtrive with our Maker,</hi> or to exalt ourſelves in the Vanity of our Mind above our <hi>Fellow-Creatures.</hi> — This ſhould teach us, not to over-rate our <hi>bodily</hi> Part, but to prefer our <hi>ſpiritual</hi> and <hi>immortal,</hi> in all our Care and Proviſion for our ſelves. — And may not this admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter ſome Encouragement to us (at leaſt to the People of God) to hope for divine <hi>Compaſſion</hi> towards us? For he <hi>remembreth that he hath made us as the Clay,</hi> he <hi>knoweth our Frame,</hi> and <hi>remembreth that we are but Duſt.</hi> — However, let all our Complaints be for ever ſilenced by the Sovereignty of God that made us; and let none murmur, that they are of <hi>them who dwell in Houſes of Clay, whoſe Foundation is in the Duſt;</hi> nor even that they are put to ſuffer grievous Things in the Body. <hi>Wo unto him, that ſaith to his Father, What begotteſt thou? Shall the Clay ſay to him that
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:005947_0017_102727D8957AF660"/>
faſhioneth it, What makeſt thou?</hi> Even our firſt Parents in their <hi>Innocence</hi> dwelt in Clay-Tabernacles: and ſhall we, in our <hi>fallen</hi> State, repine and fret, becauſe we are not <hi>as the Angels,</hi> but <hi>Spirits dwelling in Fleſh,</hi> and <hi>Men of like Paſſions with others!</hi> In a Word, while we remember that we are <hi>of the Earth,</hi> it ſhould likewiſe be remember'd that we are doom'd to <hi>return to the Earth,</hi> from whence we were taken; that our earthly Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, in which we ſojourn at preſent, muſt ere long be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd of its cohabiting Spirit, and be reſolved into its original <hi>Duſt;</hi> and this, principally, as the Fruit of the original Curſe upon Man, for his <hi>firſt Tranſgreſſion:</hi> — Which is a Reflection that ſhould excite us much to bewail the <hi>Sin</hi> &amp; <hi>Fall</hi> of <hi>Adam,</hi> who thereby introduced <hi>Death</hi> into the World, and entailed it on all his unhappy Progeny. — Nevertheleſs, at the ſame Time, we ſhould magnify the <hi>Grace</hi> of our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> who has undertaken to ſave his People from the <hi>Sting of Death,</hi> to purchaſe for them the <hi>Redemption of the Body,</hi> as well as Salvation of the Soul, and who will one Day <hi>change our vile Body, that it may be faſhioned like unto his glorious Body.</hi> — How ſolicitouſly therefore ſhould we all ſeek an Intereſt in Chriſt, that being <hi>joined to the Lord,</hi> we may <hi>fall aſleep in Jeſus,</hi> when the <hi>Duſt ſhall return to the Duſt,</hi> but <hi>the Spirit to God that gave it;</hi> and ſo may not only ſecure to our ſelves the Tranſlation of our Souls to Heaven when we die, but <hi>our Fleſh having reſted in Hope,</hi> may at laſt obtain the <hi>Reſurrection of Life!</hi> — And how ſhould <hi>Believers</hi> be excited by this Reflection, to be looking beyond Mortality, and longing for the <hi>Glory that ſhall be revealed in them,</hi> that in the fulleſt Senſe they may <hi>win Chriſt, may know the Power of his Reſurrection,</hi> ſhine in his perfect Image, and dwell in the Joy of his immediate Preſence!</p>
            <p>Let it now be obſerv'd,</p>
            <p>When it's remembred how the <hi>Soul</hi> of Man was at firſt made in the <hi>Image of God,</hi> this Reflection alſo may be apply'd to many profitable <hi>Uſes</hi> in Religion, and ſhould conſtantly be directed to its juſt <hi>practical</hi> Ends.</p>
            <p>Thus, it ſhould lead us to review and admire the <hi>Perfections</hi> of God, his Sanctity and Skill and Power and Goodneſs, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play'd in <hi>forming the Spirit of Man within him;</hi> an intelligent, active, holy and unblemiſh'd Spirit, as it was when it came firſt out of his creating Hand. We ſhould magnify his Name with Thankſgiving, for the exalted <hi>natural</hi> Powers of the human
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:005947_0018_102727DC86B9BDA0"/>
Mind, and for the <hi>moral</hi> Rectitude, Purity, and ſpiritual Beauty, theſe were all originally endow'd with. We ſhould admire and celebrate the Goodneſs of God to Man, in the many diſtinguiſh'd Advantages and Excellencies of his <hi>primitive State,</hi> as with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Perfection of his Knowledge &amp; Wiſdom, the Tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of his Conſcience, and the Empire of his rational Powers over all his animal Appetites and Paſſions, ſo with Regard to his having a meet Help and a bleſſed Habitation provided for him, as alſo to the Order and Place he ſuſtain'd in this lower Syſtem of created Beings, and the Command he had over the whole Circle of natural Agents; <hi>all Sheep and Oxen, yea, and the Beaſts of the Field, the Fowl of the Air, and the Fiſh of the Sea,</hi> being made for his Uſe, and put in Subjection to him. <hi>For God made him little lower than the Angels; crowned him with Glory and Honour,</hi> with Majeſty and <hi>Dominion over the Works of his Hands, and put all Things under his Feet,</hi> in Point both of Dignity and Empire. Thus, <hi>Man</hi> was at firſt a little <hi>Image</hi> of God in the World, ſhining with all the Glories of intellectual and moral Perfection, compatible to human Nature in its probationary State, and with the Honours of Sovereignty over all other ſublunary Creatures. With what Gratitude and Praiſe ſhould we always remember the Goodneſs of God our Maker, in all this!</p>
            <p>Yet at the ſame Time, with what Tears of bitter Grief and Confuſion of Face ought we again to reflect on the unhappy <hi>Fall</hi> of our firſt Parents, and mourn the firſt Rebellion, as a Diſhonour to God, a Reproach and Ruin to themſelves, and fatal to their Poſterity, in ſpiritual and moral Regards eſpecially!</p>
            <p>However, we ſhould take a thankful Notice of God's ſparing Goodneſs, in that there are ſtill ſome <hi>Remains,</hi> in the Soul of Man, of <hi>the Similitude of God,</hi> in natural Reſpects, I mean, in Regard of natural Reaſon, and natural Conſcience; which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves a Diſtinction between the human and brutal Kinds, and lays the Foundation for a Poſſibility of our Recovery, makes us (tho' fallen Creatures) ſtill capable Subjects of moral Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and by the Influence of divine Reſtraints ſtill capable, in ſome Meaſure, to purſue the Ends and enjoy the Good of Society.</p>
            <p>Hence, in Conformity to the Precepts of Scripture, as well as Reaſon, we ſhould learn, <hi>not to deſpiſe</hi> human Nature, even under its moſt uncomely Forms, but to <hi>honour all Men,</hi> tho' in the moſt ſervile and abject Condition, as excelling the Brutal
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:005947_0019_102727DE18726C40"/>
Creation, in their rational Make; and in their general Nature (excluſive of gracious and ſpiritual Reſpects) <hi>made after the Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of God</hi> himſelf. — But eſpecially ſhould the <hi>Saints in the Earth</hi> be honoured as <hi>the Excellent,</hi> in Regard that they have the divine <hi>Image</hi> (in its moral View) reſtored in their Souls; which ſpeaks <hi>the Righteous more excellent than his Neighbour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor can we be excus'd, if we don't every Man learn to <hi>reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence himſelf;</hi> I mean, to <hi>ſhew our ſelves Men,</hi> and be concern'd to live up to the Dignity of our Nature, and Rank in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>not ſetting our Affections upon Things on the Earth,</hi> after the Manner of <hi>Beaſts</hi> that grovel in the Duſt; but <hi>ſeeking thoſe Things which are above, where Chriſt ſitteth on the Right Hand of God,</hi> and which only are commenſurate to the Duration and ſuited to the Wants and genuine Cravings of our unperiſhable and intellectual Part.</p>
            <p>Should we not alſo be convinced by the Reflection before us, that the great God, the <hi>Former of Spirits,</hi> is the ſupreme <hi>Happineſs</hi> of Man, and the only Object of our religious <hi>Worſhip?</hi> And ſhould it not teach us the abſolute <hi>Reaſonableneſs</hi> of all that <hi>Duty</hi> which God requires of Man, to reflect, that we are <hi>his Creatures,</hi> and as made at firſt in his <hi>Image,</hi> had originally ſufficient <hi>Power</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly to obey his Will? — But, on the other Hand, ſhould not this Reflection ſerve to convince us of the utter Unreaſonableneſs and Baſeneſs of <hi>Sin,</hi> in all its Kinds and in every Inſtance and Degree? Ought it not to awaken in us a Reſentment and Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of ſo malignant an Evil, which has at once diſhonour'd the Creator, and degraded the Creature, obliterated the moral Image of God, and defiled the univerſal Nature of Man? Ought we not to be aſham'd of that which hath ſo polluted and debaſed us? Ought it not to make us bluſh, and even abhor our ſelves in our own Eyes, to think how (thro' the Influence of <hi>Sin,</hi> which dwelleth in us) we naturally <hi>contemn God,</hi> and <hi>deſpiſe our own Souls,</hi> daily abuſing and perverting our nobleſt Powers or Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and Will to miniſter to the Gratification of our inferior Appetites and Paſſions, tamely ſubmitting to the Tyranny of fooliſh and hurtful Luſts, and taking unhappy Methods to <hi>deſtroy our ſelves,</hi> who once bore the very Image of God, and are ſtill (ſubjectively) capable of a bleſſed Conformity to him, by the Impreſſions of ſupernatural Grace?</p>
            <p>In brief, this Reflection, as it ſhould humble us, and make as groan under a Senſe of the <hi>Degeneracy</hi> of our Nature, ſo it
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:005947_0020_102727E011EA45F0"/>
ſhould teach us the abſolute Neceſſity of a <hi>Renewal</hi> of the <hi>Image</hi> (as well as Recovery of the Favour) of God, in order to our true and ſolid Happineſs; and ſhould accordingly put us upon earneſtly ſeeking to be <hi>renewed in the Spirit of our Mind, after the Image of him that created us;</hi> yea, ſhould put us upon ſeeking this at the Hand of <hi>God,</hi> humbly conſcious of our own ſpiritual Impotence, and the utter Inſufficiency of all created Power, and ſenſible that only the ſame <hi>Right Hand of the moſt High,</hi> which at firſt <hi>made Man after the Likeneſs of God,</hi> is able to <hi>reſtore our Souls,</hi> by a transforming Work of his Almighty Grace.</p>
            <p>It muſt now be obſerv'd in the laſt Place,</p>
            <p n="3">3. While we remember God's <hi>Tranſactions</hi> with, and various <hi>Diſpenſations</hi> to his Creature, <hi>Man,</hi> in the Year of Creation, we ſhould be in Care to improve our Tho'ts of theſe Things wiſely to their genuine <hi>practical</hi> Purpoſes. If we would <hi>remember the Hand of God</hi> our Maker, as we ought, we muſt recollect and rightly apply theſe <hi>Circumſtantial,</hi> but important Events; ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of which I will here briefly mention, and lead you to ſome ſuitable Reflections on them.</p>
            <p>Thus, God's forming the Garden of <hi>Eden</hi> for our firſt Father, and <hi>putting him into it,</hi> a Place abounding with all terrene Riches, Beauties, and Delights, perfectly ſuited to all the regular Propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of animal Nature, and undoubtedly adjuſted to the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Purpoſes of divine Contemplation and ſpiritual Devotion (perhaps ſacred to the peculiar Uſes of a holy <hi>Temple,</hi> and exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting a moſt lively emblematical Idea of the heavenly <hi>Paradiſe</hi>) as alſo God's planting therein, amidſt other Trees moſt beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the Eye and good for Food, that ſingularly excellent one, the <hi>Tree of Life,</hi> which beſides it's beneficial and lovely natural Properties, ſeems to have been deſtin'd to a <hi>Sacramental</hi> Uſe, to be a Seal of the Covenant made with <hi>Adam,</hi> and a Pledge of his Reward in Caſe of Obedience, having this Inſcription upon it, <hi>Eat and Live;</hi> our <hi>Remembrance</hi> of theſe Things furniſhes us with Matter of <hi>Praiſe</hi> and <hi>Thankſgiving</hi> to God, for his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Goodneſs to Man, in this diſtinguiſhing Proviſion for his Comfort and Well-being, both in Soul &amp; Body. It ſhould alſo lead us to contemplate and acknowledge God's ſovereign Right of <hi>appointing to Mankind the Bounds of their Habitation,</hi> and <hi>chuſing out their Inheritance for them.</hi> It ſhould lead us to ſee his Hand, and confeſs his merciful Kindneſs to us, if <hi>the Lines are fallen to
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:005947_0021_102727E560D27358"/>
us in pleaſant Places;</hi> and particularly to bleſs his Name, for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given us a <hi>goodly Heritage,</hi> as our Lot is caſt within the Pale of his <hi>Church,</hi> where the <hi>Tree of Life,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, is exhibited to us, where we enjoy the <hi>Sabbath</hi> of the Lord, and the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Privileges of his <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> in ſome Reſpects excelling even thoſe of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Paradiſe. And it ought to raiſe our Idea of the Riches of divine Grace to <hi>us</hi> herein, when we remember, that our firſt Father by his Tranſgreſſion forfeited <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> both for himſelf and us, ſo <hi>God drove out the Man,</hi> and to prevent his Return and Acceſs to the <hi>Tree of Life,</hi> placed an <hi>Angelick</hi> Guard with a <hi>flaming Sword,</hi> the viſible Enſign of provoked Majeſty and the Terror of guilty Mortals. On this Occaſion we ſhould <hi>aſcribe Righteouſneſs to our Maker,</hi> juſtify God in the Expulſion of Man out of <hi>Eden,</hi> and admire his Goodneſs to the <hi>Children of Men,</hi> in <hi>giving them the Earth,</hi> at large, for a Place of Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and in ſtoring the ſame with the rich Fruits of his Benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity from Age to Age; but above all, in creating for us a new and heavenly <hi>Paradiſe</hi> (ſo preferable to the old and earthly one) in which he hath opened <hi>Rivers of living Water,</hi> hath planted the <hi>Tree of Life,</hi> hath erected the <hi>Temple of his Holineſs,</hi> and a <hi>Throne of Grace;</hi> the Lord God <hi>walking in the midſt of his Garden, eateth his pleaſant Fruits;</hi> the <hi>Gates of Righteouſneſs</hi> are open for his People's Acceſs, <hi>they enter in, and praiſe the Lord,</hi> and <hi>delight themſelves with the Abundance of</hi> divine and ſpiritual <hi>Glory.</hi> Nor indeed are any excluded finally, but ſuch as by Unbelief ſhut the Door againſt themſelves: And theſe indeed will all at laſt find the <hi>Gate of the Lord</hi> terribly guarded with the <hi>flaming Sword</hi> of incenſed and inexorable Juſtice, to forbid their Admiſſion; nor will all their <hi>knocking at the Door</hi> in that Day, and crying, <hi>Lord, Lord, open to us,</hi> be anſwered otherwiſe than by that tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous Sentence, <hi>Depart from me, ye Curſed, into everlaſting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi>— Now therefore, before it be too late, let us hear the Warning, which a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate Saviour has given us: <hi>Strive to enter in at the ſtrait Gate; for many, I ſay unto you, will ſeek to enter in, and ſhall not be able. When once the Maſter of the Houſe is riſen up, and hath ſhut to the Door</hi> againſt you, there will only remain for you <hi>Weeping and gnaſhing of Teeth,</hi> to <hi>ſee</hi> ſuch Multitudes <hi>in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, and you your ſelves thruſt out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to proceed unto another Fact,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:005947_0022_102727E820A0D050"/>God's inſtituting a <hi>Sabbath</hi> for Man, immediately on his Creation (as it's commonly judg'd) and before his Fall, is a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Demonſtration of divine Goodneſs, Holineſs, Wiſdom, and Sovereignty, which ſhould be <hi>remembred</hi> by us with Gratitude and Praiſe, and with due practical Acknowledgements. God having finiſhed the Work of Creation in the ſpace of ſix Days, <hi>reſted on the ſeventh Day;</hi> wherefore the Lord <hi>bleſſed the Sabbath-Day, and hallowed it.</hi> This Reflection ſhould teach us to honour the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> for its venerable Antiquity, its divine Authority, and the Stamp of Holineſs from the Beginning put upon it. We ſhould celebrate the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of God, in appointing ſo fit a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial of the World's Creation, and in appropriating to his own immediate Service ſo fit a Proportion of the Life of Man. We ſhould ſee in this Inſtitution an early and laſting Teſtimony of God's <hi>Sovereignty</hi> over Man; and withal, of his <hi>Goodneſs</hi> to him. <hi>The Sabbath was made for Man,</hi> to be a Day of ſpecial Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God in this World, and a Pledge of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Reſt in God, in the World to come. We ſhould admire the Grace of God in continuing to Man the Privilege of a <hi>Sabbath,</hi> notwithſtanding the Forfeiture of it by his Fall. We ſhould give our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> the Glory of having purchas'd this Privilege for his People; and as <hi>He</hi> has claim'd to be <hi>Lord alſo of the Sabbath,</hi> we ſhould acknowledge Him in this his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Character, by <hi>remembring the Sabbath-Day, to keep it holy</hi> to his Honour; looking to him for the Sabbath-Bleſſing, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming Sabbath-Duty in his Name; Commemorating as well the <hi>new</hi> Creation, as the <hi>old,</hi> and <hi>honouring the Son, even as we honour the Father.</hi>— A <hi>ſeventh Part</hi> of Time has been ſacred to God, for a <hi>Sabbath,</hi> by his own Inſtitution, from the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World: and ſince Chriſt's Reſurrection, the <hi>firſt</hi> Day of the Week (being that on which he roſe) worthily ſuſtains the Honour of being <hi>the Lord's Day,</hi> ſacred to the Memory of a <hi>riſen</hi> JESUS, the <hi>Lord of Glory,</hi> our Creator and our Redeemer.</p>
            <p>Another Fact, which ſhews God's Kindneſs to <hi>Adam</hi> in his Paradiſiacal State, and which we ſhould <hi>remember,</hi> is the provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and beſtowing upon him a fit <hi>Companion.</hi> God ſaid, <hi>It is not good, that the Man ſhould be alone:</hi> and therefore he prepared <hi>an Help meet for him,</hi> by his own creating Hand made he a <hi>Woman, brought her to the Man,</hi> &amp;c. — While we remember this admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Occurrence, we ſhould in general learn from it to conſider our ſelves as <hi>converſable</hi> Creatures, form'd for amicable and uſeful
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:005947_0023_102727E9B3875860"/>
               <hi>Society,</hi> — not to herd diſhonourably with the <hi>Beaſts</hi> of the Earth (as the Manner of ſome is) but as the moral Fitneſs and Reaſon of Things inſtruct us, to aſſociate with thoſe of our own ſuperior Species: And this teaches us, that we ought by all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Ways to cultivate human Friendſhips and Alliances, to value and promote eſpecially the Communion of Saints, to be <hi>ſerving one another in Love,</hi> and <hi>ſerving our Generation according to the Will of God,</hi> in the uniform Practice of every ſocial and relative Duty. — In particular, As the <hi>Family</hi> was the firſt Society, and is that little Community we are all firſt initiated into, and moſt converſant in, it ſhould be our early and abiding Care to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe our ſelves in <hi>Family-Duty,</hi> of every Kind ſuitable to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations we ſuſtain, and to practiſe all the important Virtues of Domeſtick Life.— As the Relation of <hi>Huſband</hi> and <hi>Wife</hi> was inſtituted with a View to their being mutual <hi>Helps,</hi> even in the State of primitive Perfection, all ſhould conſider this as one va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable <hi>End</hi> of the conjugal Relation, directing their Choice of a Companion by it, and adjuſting their Conduct in the Relation, to this excellent Deſign; ever ſolicitous to approve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>Helps meet</hi> for each other. Remembring that they are myſtically <hi>one Fleſh,</hi> they ſhould alſo be as it were of <hi>one Soul,</hi> and ſtudy to glorify God with <hi>one Mind</hi> and <hi>one Mouth;</hi> living with one another as becometh <hi>Heirs together of the Grace of Life, that their Prayers be not hindred.</hi> — Moreover, when it's remembred, that the <hi>matrimonial</hi> State was originally of <hi>Divine</hi> Inſtitution, and commenced in Paradiſe, while the Man and Woman were <hi>inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,</hi> this teaches us to condemn the Doctrine which <hi>forbiddeth to marry;</hi> it teacheth us to eſteem <hi>Marriage honourable in all,</hi> and to venerate the Holineſs, the Goodneſs, and the Wiſdom, as well as Sovereignty of God in its primitive Inſtitution, and in its Continuation. Yet in a peculiar Manner ſhould we value and honour the <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Marriage, of which that between <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> was a Figure, and by which Souls are <hi>joined to the Lord. This is a great Myſtery: but I ſpeak concerning Chriſt &amp; the Church.</hi> If we be <hi>eſpouſed to Chriſt,</hi> if <hi>our Maker be our Huſband,</hi> He will <hi>guide us by his Counſel,</hi> and <hi>receive us to Glory,</hi> where we ſhall be <hi>as the Angels of God.</hi>—Further, when we recollect, that our firſt Parents were made, the one as well as the other of them, in the Image of God, we ſhould learn to <hi>honour</hi> each the other Sex, &amp; guard againſt all unrighteous Partiality in our Regards to either: Tho' it's confeſs'd, that as the <hi>Woman</hi> was made after the <hi>Man,</hi> and

               <hi>for</hi> him, the <hi>Male</hi> is in Civil Reſpects to be conſidered as the <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritur</hi> Sex. But ſtill in the Rights of Religion &amp; Conſcience, and in Point of Salvation, <hi>there is neither Male nor Female,</hi> but <hi>all are one in Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Joint-Heirs of the Promiſe.</hi> For <hi>with God is no Reſpect of Perſons:</hi> and thus it was <hi>from the Beginning.</hi> —. In a Word, when we remember, that God at firſt made Man <hi>Male</hi> and <hi>Female,</hi> and but <hi>One</hi> of a Sex, we ſhould conſider this as a wiſe Proviſion for accompliſhing his Deſigns, to produce Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in <hi>ſucceſſive</hi> Generations, to derive of <hi>one Bleed</hi> all Nations of Men, to ſeek unto Himſelf a <hi>godly Seed,</hi> &amp;c. Nor was it one of the leaſt powerful Motives, to induce our firſt Parents to a Care of <hi>Perſeverance,</hi> that without this they would either miſs the Bleſſing of Poſterity, or entail Miſery on their Children. And this Conduct of God our Maker muſt be confeſs'd <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>good,</hi> as it ſubſerv'd his Deſign of dealing with the whole Body of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in the Method of a conſtituted <hi>Repreſentative</hi> and common federal <hi>Head;</hi> which Character and Capacity the <hi>firſt Man</hi> muſt be own'd of all our Race the fitteſt (as the Caſe then was) to ſuſtain.—And it ſerv'd too to lay a Foundation for the future Riſe of a <hi>ſecond Adam,</hi> in due Time; even the Son of God incarnate in our Nature, <hi>made of a Woman, made under the Law,</hi> and <hi>made a Curſe for us,</hi> that he might repair the Ruins of the Fall, and become <hi>the Reſurrection &amp; the Life</hi> to a loſt &amp; periſhing World.</p>
            <p>Finally, As another ſignal Event in the Year of Creation was God's making a <hi>Covenant</hi> with Man, and putting his Obedience on the Trial by a ſpecial poſitive Prohibition, we ſhould <hi>remember</hi> this, and ſubſcribe to the Wiſdom, the Righteouſneſs, and the Grace of God in this Diſpenſation.— We ſhould adore the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty and Holineſs of God, in leaving Man to his own muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Will in this Caſe, and permitting him to <hi>fall,</hi> thro' the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty of the Serpent, who having firſt beguiled the Woman, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd her as a Tempter and Seducer to her Huſband.— And whereas, when <hi>Adam</hi> had broken the Covenant, and ſo (being a <hi>publick</hi> Perſon) had forfeited the Good of the Promiſe, as well for his Poſterity, as for himſelf, a righteous God immediately began to execute the Sentence of <hi>Death</hi> upon him, and entail'd the ſame upon his Deſcendants, we muſt confeſs the Juſtice of God in this Puniſhment and laſting Monument of the firſt Tranſgreſſion; and beware that we indulge no murmuring Thought, neither <hi>charge God fooliſhly.</hi> — With Regard to our ſelves in particular, we ſhould ſolemnly realiſe our own Relation to that original Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:005947_0025_102727EE5DA5D800"/>
and in Conſequence hereof our Intereſt in the Guilt of original Sin, our being born <hi>under the Law of Sin and Death,</hi> and being <hi>by Nature Children of Wrath,</hi> as <hi>Tranſgreſſors from the Womb,</hi> as the polluted guilty Seed of a Covenant-breaker and Traitor againſt God. — We ſhould conſequently meditate and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliſe our Need (as of ſupenatural Grace to ſanctify us, ſo) of a ſupernatural <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> to juſtify and recommend us to God, even a <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> adequate to the Demands of his Law and Juſtice, whether moral or penal; and ought to believe it an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable <hi>Prick</hi> and <hi>Vanity of Mind</hi> they are chargeable with, who <hi>go about to eſtabliſh their own Righteouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>ſubmit not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto the Righteouſneſs of God.</hi> — We ſhould ſee therefore and own our periſhing Neceſſity of a <hi>Mediator,</hi> to interpoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us and offended Juſtice; even another <hi>Adam,</hi> excelling the firſt, and of whom <hi>he was a Figure.</hi> — We ſhould be deeply concern'd to get <hi>Deliverance</hi> out of our natural and fallen State, as an indiſpenſable Requiſite to our true Happineſs.— We ſhould be thankful to God, that thro' his ſovereign and arbitrary Grace, <hi>there is Hope in Iſrael for us as concerning this Thing;</hi> that altho' we were <hi>altogether born in Sin,</hi> and ſo under Condemnation, yet our natural State is not remedileſs and deſperate, like that of the <hi>Angels</hi> which ſinned, who are left a Prey to their own Terrors and tormenting Paſſions, and conſign'd over to the Vengeance of eternal Fire; while we have <hi>a Saviour and a great One</hi> provided for us, and revealed to us.</p>
            <p>We ſhould take an admiring and moſt grateful Notice of the diſtinguiſhing Grace of God to fallen Man, in that when the Way to the <hi>Tree of Life</hi> by the old Covenant was ſhut up, He has been pleas'd to open a <hi>new and better Way</hi> by an <hi>everlaſting</hi> Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, a Covenant of Pardon &amp; Reconciliation, thro' another and better Mediator, even the <hi>Seed of the Woman;</hi> at the ſame time viewing this as a Device of infinite Wiſdom for ſecuring the Ends of the firſt Covenant, in the Glory of God and the Happineſs of his People. — We ſhould conſider and admire his Compaſſion and Condeſcenſion in revealing to our firſt Parents the <hi>Purpoſe of his Grace,</hi> ſo quickly upon their Fall, even while a guilty Conſcience was driving them from his Preſence, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore He drove them out of the Garden, where they had ſinned. Thus He <hi>remembred Mercy in the midſt of Judgment;</hi> and we ſhould <hi>remember</hi> this with Admiration and Praiſe. — Eſpecially ought we to be thankful for the fuller Revelation, which <hi>we</hi> are
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:005947_0026_102727F2522CC560"/>
favour'd with, of the <hi>Covenant of Peace,</hi> as exhibited in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel: and it ſhould be our earneſt Care, that we be not found <hi>neglecting ſo great Salvation,</hi> but <hi>laying Hold on the Hope ſet before us,</hi> inſtantly and without Delay. For as we are under the <hi>laſt</hi> Diſpenſation of Covenant-Grace, ſo our Opportunity is of uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Continuance. <hi>God waiteth, that He may be gracious.</hi> He <hi>will be gracious to whom He will be gracious:</hi> but none ſhall <hi>fail of the Grace of God,</hi> who <hi>take Hold of his Covenant,</hi> and <hi>chuſe the Things that pleaſe Him. By Grace are ye ſaved thro' Faith</hi> even <hi>Faith in the Blood of Chriſt.</hi> This is of the firſt Account with God, and without it 'tis <hi>impoſſible to pleaſe Him.</hi> This therefore chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges our firſt Attention and Purſuit. But then having <hi>believed</hi> in God our Saviour, we muſt alſo be <hi>careful to maintain good Works;</hi> which, <hi>done in the Name of Chriſt,</hi> are acceptable and well pleaſing in the Sight of God; tho' being done with the Spirit of the old Covenant, from a Self-righteous Principle, and not in the Humility of Goſpel-Faith, they are neither well pleaſing to God, nor ſavingly profitable to Men, but will leave us ſhort of final Happineſs: Whereas ſuch as believe in Chriſt, and obey his Goſpel, ſhall <hi>eat of the Tree of Life,</hi> and <hi>enter thro' the Gates into the City of God.</hi> Wherefore, <hi>let us commit the Keeping of our Souls to Him in well-doing, as to a faithful Creator.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But thus much for the Reflections proper to be made, and the Application we ſhould make of them to the Ends of Devotion and Practice, while we are <hi>remembring the</hi> firſt <hi>Year of the Right Hand of the moſt High,</hi> the Year of <hi>Creation.</hi>

               <p>I go on now to another general Head of Diſcourſe: but having under the former indulg'd to Amplification, and by interſpers'd Reflections in ſome Meaſure anticipated this Part of my Subject, I muſt aſk your Candour while I ſtudy to forbear much of thoſe Enlargements here, which yet the Plenty of the Things preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing would eaſily admit of, and which their Dignity and Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance ſtrongly invite us to, that indeed it's difficult and ſelf-deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be very brief on ſo copious, ſo weighty &amp; agreable a Theme.</p>

                  <pb n="25" facs="unknown:005947_0027_102727F51B95CC50"/>II. The Year of <hi>Redemption</hi> is alſo among <hi>the Years of the Right Hand of the moſt High,</hi> and eminently challenges our <hi>Attention</hi> and <hi>Remembrance,</hi> with a ſupreme Regard to <hi>experimental</hi> and <hi>practical</hi> Purpoſes in Religion.</p>
               <p>Here the moſt ſurpriſing Scenes open to our View; the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, the ſweeteſt, and moſt neceſſary Themes of Meditation offer to our Thoughts. <hi>Iſrael's</hi> Redemption out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that Work of Wonder, was but a Metaphor and Shadow to this ſpiritual and eternal Redemption, which I now ſpeak of. Nay, on a Variety of Accounts, this ſurpaſſes in Glory the Work of <hi>Creation</hi> it ſelf. And ſome worthy Divines incline to be of Opinion, that the firſt Production of the Earth, and of Man upon it, was with an ultimate Deſign of glorifying God in the <hi>great Salvation,</hi> to be accompliſh'd in Time by his eternal Son incarnate in human Nature. But however that was, undoubtedly the Work of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption</hi> implies in it ſuch aſtoniſhing Events, as ſpeak it a more admirable Work of <hi>the Right Hand of the moſt High,</hi> than the <hi>Creation</hi> of the Univerſe. A Work it is, of the nobleſt Kind, and moſt myſterious Nature, of the higheſt Account with God, and the laſt Importance to Man; what <hi>Angels deſire to look into,</hi> and what demands <hi>our</hi> moſt attentive Notice, conſtant Inquiry, and cloſeſt Application of Thought, as the main Subject of Divine Revelation, and the grand Baſis of all the Tranſactions of Divine Mercy, the neceſſary Spring of a rational Hope to the fallen Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the primary Source of all our Religion and all our Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. Accordingly the inſpir'd Scriptures frequently cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate <hi>the acceptable Year of the Lord, the Year of his Redeemed,</hi> and teach us to regard this as in a tranſcendent Senſe <hi>the Year of the Right Hand of the moſt High.</hi> Beſure in this bleſſed <hi>Year</hi> are to be ſeen the moſt illuſtrious Diſcoveries of <hi>his eternal Power</hi> and <hi>Godhead,</hi> the brighteſt Characters of Divine Sovereignty, Strength, Wiſdom, Juſtice, Holineſs, and Truth, with an infinite Profuſion of Goodneſs and Mercy.</p>
               <p>This wonderful <hi>Year,</hi> in it's largeſt Conſideration, may be ſaid to know <hi>no End</hi> nor <hi>Beginning</hi> of Days. Even <hi>from Everlaſting,</hi> it's glorious Plan of Operations was concerted in <hi>the Council of Peace:</hi> and the Execution (I mean with regard to Effects termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating on the Creature) will endure even <hi>to Everlaſting.</hi> The Redeem'd are repreſented as being <hi>from the Beginning</hi> choſen to Salvation, as receiving a Kingdom prepared for them <hi>from the Foundation of the World,</hi> as called according to God's Purpoſe and
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:005947_0028_102727F9295BD460"/>
Grace, which was given them in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>before the World began;</hi> and of <hi>Him</hi> the Scripture ſaith, <hi>He verily was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordained before the Foundation of the World, but was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in theſe laſt Times.</hi>— Alſo in Point of Futurity, the Salvation which they obtain, is call'd <hi>Eternal,</hi> and the Kingdom they are appointed to, is call'd <hi>Everlaſting.</hi> So that this immenſe <hi>Year</hi> takes into it's Reckoning both an antecedent and a conſequent <hi>Eternity.</hi> Now all the Wonders of this <hi>Year of the Lord,</hi> whether the Objects of Reflection or Proſpect, are juſt Objects of our Thought, Belief and Remembrance. Even thoſe primitive Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which reach back to an unknown Diſtance <hi>before the World began,</hi> ought not to be unregarded by us, but ſolemnly notic'd, and ſtudy'd, and apply'd to their practical Purpoſes in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: for theſe belong to <hi>the Doctrine which is according to God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,</hi> to <hi>the Myſtery of the Faith</hi> which we are to <hi>hold in a pure Conſcience,</hi> and to <hi>the Form of ſound Words,</hi> which <hi>nouriſh</hi> the believing Soul <hi>to Life eternal.</hi> They are not jejune and empty Points of Speculation; nor is the meer Theory, without a Care of practical Uſe in the Divine Life, to be reſted in. — However, under the preſent Head, I have my Eye immediately to the <hi>Year of Viſitation;</hi> the Aera's of ſpecial <hi>Diſcovery</hi> and <hi>Communication</hi> of redeeming Grace, and more particularly the diſtinguiſh'd Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> Of this Period the Scripture ſaith, <hi>It is the laſt Time;</hi> and ſpeaks of it in that emphatick Language, <hi>Now is the accepted Time, Now is the Day of Salvation.</hi> It calls it by way of Eminence, <hi>The acceptable Year of the Lord.</hi> All the Characters of celebrated <hi>Years</hi> under the Moſaick Diſpenſation are united here, with a ſurpriſing Glory. 'Tis the Year of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,</hi> the Year of <hi>Releaſe,</hi> the Year of <hi>Liberty,</hi> the Year of <hi>Plenty,</hi> the Year of <hi>Reſt,</hi> the true <hi>Sabbatical</hi> Year, the Year of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilee,</hi> to the ſpiritual <hi>Iſrael.</hi> A happy <hi>Year</hi> indeed; a truly won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Year, and of long Continuance, even in it's moſt limited View, laſting from what the Scripture calls <hi>the Fulneſs of the Time,</hi> until <hi>Time ſhall be no more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Within this famous <hi>Goſpel-Period</hi> we meet with very glorious Events, and aſtoniſhing Facts, which proclaim it a moſt memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Year of the Right Hand of the moſt High.</hi> I ſhall now ſingle out ſome cardinal Inſtances, worthy of your perpetual <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,</hi> and more eaſily applicable to the beſt practical Purpoſes in Religion.</p>

                  <pb n="27" facs="unknown:005947_0029_102727FE4F1C6498"/>[1.] There's that comprehenſive Article of the <hi>Impetration</hi> or Purchaſe &amp; Procurement of Redemption; including the <hi>Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> of the Son of God, his <hi>Obedience</hi> &amp; <hi>Sufferings,</hi> his <hi>Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> on Earth, &amp; following <hi>Advancement</hi> to Heaven. — Here's a rich Collection of admirable &amp; unparallel'd Events, Divine in their Original, myſterious in their Nature, of the moſt difficult Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment, &amp; of the laſt Conſequence, both in Reference to God's Glory &amp; Man's Happineſs: which are Conſiderations, that ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently argue the Year of <hi>Redemption</hi> to be among the <hi>Years of the Right Hand of the moſt High,</hi> and powerfully recommend it to our ſolemn Notice and frequent Reflection.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The eternal <hi>Word,</hi> the ſame which <hi>in the Beginning was with God,</hi> and <hi>was God,</hi> now ſtoop'd to aſſume the inferiour Nature of <hi>Man</hi> into moſt intimate and ineffable Union with his Divine Perſon. <hi>The Word was made Fleſh,</hi> and <hi>tabernacled among Men.</hi> He who was in the <hi>Form of God,</hi> took on him the <hi>Form of a Servant,</hi> empty'd himſelf of his ſuper-angelick Glory, and vail'd it under the Cloud of Humanity. Conceiv'd by the Power of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> he was born of a <hi>Virgin,</hi> made of the Seed of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> according to the Fleſh, and in all Things <hi>made like to his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren;</hi> nevertheleſs <hi>without Sin.</hi> The Scripture ſaith, <hi>How can he be clean, that is born of a Woman?</hi> yet here's an Inſtance (but indeed the ſingle one) of a <hi>Birth</hi> perfectly pure and immaculate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Here's a Babe, <hi>the holy Child Jeſus,</hi> compaſs'd with all our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Infirmities, yet eſcaping our hereditary moral Diſeaſe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all the World beſide! And which gives us the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this, here's the <hi>Son of God</hi> become the <hi>Son of Man,</hi> by an incomprehenſible Conjunction of Divinity and Humanity, the moſt diſtant and unequal Natures, in <hi>one Perſon.</hi> Myſterious and marvellous Event! <hi>Without Controverſy, great is the Myſtery of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, God manifeſt in the Fleſh.</hi> This was a Divine Peculiarity; truly a <hi>new Thing under the Sun,</hi> and without a Precedent in uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Nature; the Device of immenſe Wiſdom, and the pleaſing Wonder of heavenly Intelligences, who came down on Earth to be Attendants of the Birth of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and uſher'd him into the World with their joyful Acclamations.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Yet the <hi>Son of Man came not to be miniſtred unto,</hi> but to <hi>mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and to lay down his Life a Ranſom for many.</hi> He paſs'd thro' aſtoniſhing Scenes of <hi>Humiliation,</hi> from his very Birth to his Bu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rial; by the Meanneſs and Difficulty of his Condition in the World; by the Temptations of Satan; by the Contempts and
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:005947_0030_102727FFE0F940F0"/>
Cruelties of Men; and above all by the Agonies of his Soul un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Hidings of his heavenly <hi>Father's</hi> Face, who <hi>ſpared not his own Son,</hi> but <hi>it pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him for our Iniquities,</hi> and <hi>lay upon him the Chaſtiſement of our Peace, that by his Stripes we might be healed.</hi> — Yet all was on Chriſt's Part a <hi>volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi> Humiliation, with a View to accompliſhing the Ends of his mediatoral Undertaking. The Lord of Glory, being found in Faſhion as a Man, <hi>humbled himſelf,</hi> and <hi>became obedient unto Death, even the Death of the Croſs.</hi> Having in Character of <hi>the ſecond Man,</hi> the <hi>laſt Adam,</hi> become Surety for his ſpiritual <hi>Seed,</hi> which God had given him in Promiſe, and having engag'd to <hi>make Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation for the Sins of the People,</hi> to ſatisfy offended Juſtice on their Behalf, and by a valuable Conſideration to purchaſe <hi>eternal Redemption</hi> for them, it conſequently <hi>behov'd him</hi> to fulfil the Law, in it's whole Demand, both penal and moral: as alſo <hi>it became him</hi> for whom are all Things and by whom are all Things, <hi>in bringing many Sons unto Glory,</hi> to <hi>make the Captain of their Salvation perfect</hi> thro' this active and paſſive Obedience. Nor was the <hi>Law</hi> ever to that Degree <hi>magnify'd and made honourable,</hi> as by theſe extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Means; either in it's <hi>Precept,</hi> which the Man <hi>Jeſus</hi> compleatly obſerv'd, or in it's <hi>Penalty,</hi> which he ſuſtain'd the full Weight of, that ſo he might <hi>bring in Everlaſting Righteouſneſs,</hi> an adequate Price for the whole Good of the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the <hi>chief of Sinners</hi> for Juſtification of Life. — Here's the <hi>Wiſdom of God in a Myſtery!</hi> And <hi>Love,</hi> that paſſes all Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding! Sure only infinite <hi>Wiſdom</hi> cou'd project this admirable Expedient for the Redemption of Sinners; which reconciles the different Propenſities of Juſtice and Mercy, in Relation to guilty Man, and renders the Purpoſe of Grace conſiſtent with the Rights and Honours of rectoral Holineſs. And only infinite <hi>Love</hi> cou'd be the Spring of the <hi>Father</hi>'s ſending his only begotten Son, to be the <hi>Propitiation for our Sins!</hi> — Nor cou'd it be leſs Love in the <hi>Son of the Higheſt,</hi> to ſubmit to what he underwent for our ſakes, in being <hi>made under the Law</hi> and <hi>fulfilling all Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> in becoming a <hi>Man of Sorrows,</hi> in being <hi>numbred with the Tranſgreſſors,</hi> appearing in the <hi>Likeneſs of ſinful Fleſh,</hi> and <hi>bearing our Sins in his own Body on the Tree.</hi> Unparallel'd Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation! Myſterious and amazing Grace. <hi>He who knew no Sin, was made Sin for us, that we might be made the Righteouſneſs of God in him.</hi> The Lord from Heaven condeſcended to cloath himſelf in all the Livery of Guilt and Shame, that we might
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:005947_0031_10272801B567E7D0"/>
inherit Glory. He ſtoop'd to <hi>ſuffer for Sins</hi> (not his own, but ours) <hi>the Juſt for the Unjuſt, that he might bring us to God.</hi> He abaſed himſelf to be <hi>made a Curſe for us,</hi> that he might recover the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited Bleſſing, and <hi>reſtore that which he took not away.</hi> So did Chriſt <hi>love his Church,</hi> as even to <hi>give his Life a Ranſom for it,</hi> and <hi>purchaſe it with his own Blood.</hi> An ineſtimable Expence! A plenary Satisfaction! and proclaiming an immenſe Love! — Theſe are ſome of the Wonders of Chriſt's humbled State, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting him in the Office of a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> or Mediator of <hi>Atonement;</hi> which indeed principally demands our Attention. <hi>His Name was called</hi> JESUS (which ſignifies a <hi>Saviour) becauſe he ſhould ſave his People from their Sins.</hi> This his <hi>Name,</hi> with the <hi>Reaſon</hi> of it, was given before his Conception, by an <hi>Angel</hi> from Heaven ſent to notify it to the <hi>Mother of our Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. There were <hi>other</hi> Things, very marvellous, in his <hi>Miniſtration</hi> on Earth in Character of a <hi>Prophet</hi> and of a <hi>King,</hi> which alſo claim our Conſideration. In theſe Capacities he perform'd an admirable Part, tho' differing from that he acted in the other, and conſiſting chiefly in the <hi>manifeſting forth his Glory.</hi> Even during his State of Humiliation, the <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſs</hi> darted out upon the World ſome bright and benign Rays thro' the interpoſing Vail of his Fleſh. The <hi>private</hi> Life of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> his <hi>Childhood</hi> and <hi>Youth</hi> particularly, was diſtinguiſh'd by ſome ſurpriſing Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens of his ſuperiour <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and convincing Evidences of his <hi>Favour with God,</hi> which rais'd great Expectations from him, and preſag'd his future <hi>Miniſtry</hi> and publick Appearance. And as the Time drew nigh, that he ſhould be <hi>made manifeſt unto all Iſrael,</hi> an extraordinary Prophet was ſent of God (the predicted Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binger of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi>) to go before his Face in the Spirit and Power of <hi>Elias,</hi> to bear <hi>Witneſs</hi> of the riſing <hi>Light,</hi> and to make ready a <hi>People</hi> prepared for the Lord. Therefore came <hi>John</hi> bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing with Water, propheſying of <hi>the Lamb of God, which taketh away the Sin of the World,</hi> &amp; pointing him out to the People. At the Baptiſm of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> when the <hi>Heavens were opened,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit</hi> deſcended, like a Dove, and abode upon him, the Baptiſt <hi>ſaw</hi> the wondrous Appearance, and <hi>bare Record that this is the Son of God.</hi>— Alſo on that and other Occaſions, a <hi>Voice</hi> was heard from the <hi>excellent Glory,</hi> teſtifying of the <hi>Son of God,</hi> and calling Men to believe in him. — The <hi>Works</hi> likewiſe which he wro't, bare him Witneſs: nor was he without a Teſtimony in the <hi>Conſciences</hi> of Multitudes, that flock'd to his Preaching, and were <hi>aſtoniſhed at
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:005947_0032_1027280508245DA8"/>

It <hi>at the firſt began to be ſpoken by the LORD;</hi> and <hi>was confirmed to us by them that heard him.</hi> He in Perſon <hi>went about doing Good,</hi> to the Souls, as well as Bodies of Men, and carrying the <hi>glad Tidings of Peace</hi> into all Corners of the Land; abundant in Labours, full of Zeal, Courage, and Prudence; the Wonder of the deſpis'd (but often more diſcerning) Populace, tho' ſet at nought by the Rulers. Indeed, worthy of a <hi>Teacher come from God,</hi> he taught as one having <hi>Authority;</hi> and not as the impotent Doctors of that degenerate Day, but as a <hi>Prophet,</hi> yea, and <hi>more than a Prophet;</hi> confeſſedly, <hi>ſpeaking ſo as never Man ſpake,</hi> with a ſuper-human Light and Demonſtration, with a Divine Majeſty and Energy, in Sermons, Parables, and Expoſitions; ſilencing all his Adverſaries and putting them to Confuſion; vindicating the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> from the corrupt Gloſſes of the Scribes &amp; Phariſees, opening the Scriptures of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and ſhewing how they all pointed to him, the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> as their common Centre. — He had alſo the Gift of <hi>Prophecy,</hi> as well as of Interpretation; and foretold very important Events, reſpecting himſelf and others, which that Generation ſaw accompliſh'd.—Beſides the <hi>Prophetick</hi> Spirit, he ſhin'd in all the Glories of the <hi>Spirit of Supplication.</hi> As he was a <hi>Prophet mighty in Deed and Word before all the People,</hi> ſo likewiſe <hi>before God;</hi> both mighty in the Scriptures, and mighty in <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Tears;</hi> often <hi>in the Mount</hi> with God, and wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with him day and night, as a <hi>Prince</hi> having <hi>Power</hi> with God, and <hi>prevailing;</hi> for <hi>him</hi> the Father <hi>always heard.</hi> Even on Earth he exhibited moſt lively Samples of his ſubſequent <hi>Interceſſion</hi> in Heaven. — He alſo adminiſter'd the Office of <hi>King</hi> in <hi>Zion;</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing a <hi>Royal</hi> Authority and Power on numberleſs Occaſions, and receiving the Honours due to <hi>Majeſty.</hi> Even before his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, <hi>Angels</hi> foretold his having decreed him the <hi>Throne</hi> of his Father <hi>David,</hi> and propheſy'd of his <hi>reigning</hi> over the Houſe of <hi>Jacob</hi> for ever: at his Nativity they proclaim'd him <hi>Chriſt the Lord;</hi> they miniſtred to him during his whole Abode on Earth, and after his Death guarded his Sepulchre, as humble Attendants of the <hi>Prince of Life,</hi> the <hi>King of Glory.</hi> He receiv'd <hi>Hoſanna's</hi> from the Mouths of very <hi>Babes</hi> and <hi>Sucklings,</hi> even as they were admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably influenc'd by a Divine Afflatus; Multitudes bow'd the Knee,

and <hi>worſhipped</hi> him, as the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> — He triumph'd over all the <hi>Powers of Darkneſs</hi> in his forty Days Temptation in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs; and from time to time ſignally baffled all the Subtilty and Malice of <hi>Hell</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> combin'd in Oppoſition to him. He manifeſted his Glory and Greatneſs in <hi>ſcourging</hi> the <hi>Buyers</hi> and <hi>Sellers</hi> out of the Temple; in <hi>ſtriking to the Ground</hi> (by the Majeſty of his Countenance, or ſome powerful ſecret Influence) thoſe that came to ſelfe him in the Garden of his Agony; &amp; in recovering <hi>Peter</hi> from his guilty Fall, by a <hi>Look</hi> of his compaſſionate Eye amidſt the Sorrows of his afflictive Trial. — At his <hi>Transfiguration</hi> on the Mount, when his Face ſhone as the <hi>Sun</hi> and his Raiment gliſter'd as the <hi>Light,</hi> behold, there were with him two extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary human Attendants from the inviſible World, <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elijah,</hi> who <hi>appeared in Glory,</hi> and talked with him of his <hi>Deceaſe,</hi> which he ſhould accompliſh at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and the Diſciples pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>ſaw his Glory</hi> and <hi>the two Men that ſtood with him.</hi>— Further, he perform'd ſolemn Acts of <hi>Regal</hi> Power &amp; Empire, in ſetting up ſacred Ordinances to be obſerv'd in his Church, and preſcribing Rules for conducting the Affairs of his viſible Kingdom; in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting a new Goſpel-Miniſtry, and ſending forth the Apoſtles, inſpir'd with miraculous Gifts, to preach and act in his Name; in calling to him whom he would, and baptiſing them with the Holy Ghoſt, in forgiving Sins, in caſting out Devils, in healing all manner of Diſeaſes, in raiſing the Dead, and doing theſe Things by an abſolute <hi>Fiat:</hi> the Lord <hi>commanded the Bleſſing;</hi> He <hi>ſpake,</hi> and it was done: inſomuch that the People marvelled, ſaying, <hi>It was never ſo ſeen in Iſrael.</hi> — And from firſt to laſt he powerfully recommended himſelf, in his whole Character, by ſhining before the World in the Light and Beauty of a perfect, unfully'd, and moſt attractive <hi>Example.</hi> — He confirm'd the Truth of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Miſſion and Doctrine by a Multitude of the moſt illuſtrious and unqueſtionable <hi>Miracles</hi> (ſome of them now hinted at) to which he conſtantly made his Appeal: and at length even ſeal'd the ſame with his <hi>Blood,</hi> in dying a voluntary <hi>Martyr</hi> to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, as well as Victim to the Law; for he laid down his Life <hi>of himſelf,</hi> as he had <hi>Power</hi> or Right to do; a peculiar Prerogative of the <hi>Son of Man,</hi> being alſo the <hi>Son of God.</hi> — Nor was his ſuper-eminent Character unconfeſſed, even while he hung on the <hi>accurſed Tree.</hi> But his Royalty was own'd by <hi>Pilate</hi> in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription ſet over his Head, by the penitent <hi>Thief</hi> on the Croſs with him, and by the <hi>Centurion</hi> and his Band that guarded the

Nor is this all: but as our Lord had Power both to lay down his Life and to <hi>take it again,</hi> he ſoon burſt the <hi>Bands of Death,</hi> neither did his Fleſh <hi>ſee Corruption.</hi> He <hi>aroſe</hi> and <hi>revived,</hi> amidſt Miracles and Wonders in Nature, and the Miniſtrations of holy Angels, <hi>declaring himſelf the Son of God with Power,</hi> in a tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Manner, beyond all Parallel, and above all Conception. Marvellous the <hi>Power of his Reſurrection!</hi> Equal to the Merit of his Death, and a Seal to the Validity of his Sacrifice! A noble Conqueſt over the <hi>King of Terrors,</hi> and a glorious Triumph over the <hi>Enemies of his Croſs!</hi> An Aſſurance to all Men of his being <hi>the Lord both of the Dead and Living,</hi> and a happy Earneſt of his conſequent <hi>Exaltation!</hi> — For the riſen <hi>Jeſus,</hi> after a few Days Tarry here below, was tranſlated to the World above. When he had given the neceſſary Powers and Inſtructions to his Apoſtles, had ſettled the Affairs of his ſpiritual Family and Kingdom here, and ſufficiently <hi>ſhewn himſelf alive after his Paſſion by many infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Proofs,</hi> he no longer delay'd his <hi>Aſcenſion;</hi> and this was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with triumphant Circumſtances, as well as follow'd with glorious Conſequences. While he was bidding a ſolemn Farewell and <hi>bleſſing</hi> his Diſciples, he was <hi>parted from them</hi> &amp; <hi>carry'd up into Heaven,</hi> in a Chariot of Glory: They beheld his gradual Aſcent, until a <hi>Cloud received him out of their Sight;</hi> nor ceaſed the aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd Diſciples <hi>gazing towards Heaven,</hi> and <hi>looking up ſtedfaſtly</hi> after their aſcending Maſter, until diverted by <hi>Angels</hi> appearing and reproving them. — And doubtleſs 'twas amidſt a numerous Hoſt of adoring <hi>Angels,</hi> as well as with ſignal Triumphs over the <hi>Prince of the Power of the Air,</hi> that the victorious Saviour exchanged Worlds. <hi>God is gone up with a Shout, the Lord with the Sound of a Trumpet. — The Chariots of God are twenty Thouſand, even Thouſands of Angels, and the Lord among them, as in Sinai, in the holy Place. Thou haſt aſcended on high, and led Captivity captive: Thou haſt received Gift, for Men.</hi> The aſcended <hi>Jeſus</hi> was <hi>received into Glory,</hi> and <hi>enter'd into the holy Place, not made with Hands,</hi> to appear in the Preſence of God for his People.

of his Croſs, and by his Advocacy to <hi>procure</hi> the Beſtowment of thoſe Bleſſings he had bought with his precious Blood. <hi>We have a great High Prieſt, that is paſſed into the Heavens,</hi> Jeſus <hi>the Son of God;</hi> who, <hi>when he had by himſelf purged our Sins, ſat down on the Right Hand of the Majeſty on high,</hi> and <hi>ever liveth to make Interceſſion.</hi> Here's a <hi>Prieſt upon a Throne!

               </p>
               <p>Thus I have glanc'd at many of the principal Facts and Events occurring more early in the <hi>Year of Redemption.</hi> I pretend not to an exact Enumeration, much leſs a perfect Deſcription. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all, <hi>how little a Portion is heard!</hi> Yet enough to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate it a wonderful <hi>Year of the Right Hand of the moſt High,</hi> and to juſtify it's Claim to be <hi>remembred</hi> by us. Verily never did the Perfections of God receive ſuch admirable Illuſtrations, as by theſe great and ſurpriſing Occurrences. His moral Attributes in particular are all diſplay'd here with a <hi>high Hand</hi> indeed, and ſhine out with a Meridian Splendor. O the immenſe Riches of Glory! The inconceivable Height of Power! And the Depth of Wiſdom, beyond all created Underſtanding! The unexampled Truth and Faithfulneſs! The tranſcendent Holineſs and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs! And which crowns all, the ſtupendous Love and Grace, relucent in Chriſt, and the Redemption by him! Here's inflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Juſtice, and ſovereign Mercy, in their higheſt and equal Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs. Never was <hi>the Right Hand of the moſt High</hi> more exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, never more conſpicuous, never exerted to more honourable and happy Purpoſes, in any of his Works, whether of Creation or Providence, than in this wondrous Work of Redemption. The Scriptures every where celebrate this as full of inexpreſſible Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:005947_0036_102728110A490A98"/>
and ſpeak of it in all the Language of Admiration. Hence the Apoſtle calls it, <hi>So great Salvation,</hi> as if he were at a Loſs for Words to expreſs how great and wonderful it is. — Admirable it is truly, in every View of it, in the Decree, the Contrivance, and the Execution. Admirable in its Nature, it's Properties, and it's Conſequences. Admirable in Regard of the whole ſacred <hi>Trinity,</hi> their ſuſtaining different Characters, and acting each a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Part, in the Oeconomy of Redemption. Admirable parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in Regard of the prime Agent, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the glorious <hi>God-Man,</hi> whether view'd in his State of Humiliation, or Exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; and whether conſider'd as purchaſing by his Blood, as procuring by his Interceſſion, or communicating by his Power. This is <hi>he that liveth, and was dead; and behold, he is alive for evermore.</hi> Truly the Conſolation and the Wonder is, <hi>My Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer liveth! Ever liveth,</hi> the <hi>one Mediator</hi> between God and Men! His <hi>Death</hi> not more wondrous, than his <hi>Life!</hi> The Life of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> in every Conſideration of it, whether in the preceeding Animal State, in the ſubſequent Reſurrection-State, while here below, or in his preſent Aſcenſion-State above, exhibits to the Eye of Faith a Thouſand Wonders of Grace. His <hi>Life,</hi> whether in Earth or Heaven, from firſt to laſt, is a <hi>Mediatorial</hi> Life. As he <hi>died,</hi> ſo he <hi>aroſe,</hi> and ever lives, in the Character of <hi>Redeemer.</hi> He was raiſed again <hi>for our Juſtification,</hi> after he had been delivered for our Offences: and he aſcended on high to <hi>receive Gifts for Men,</hi> to proſecute the Ends of his Satisfaction, and carry on his Mediation, tho' in a different Form and Manner: Nor ceaſes he now in Heaven the Exerciſe of any one of his Offices, whether Prophetical, Sacerdotal, or Regal; but only varies the Mode of Adminiſtration. O the <hi>unſearchable Riches of Chriſt! — Thanks be to God for his unſpeakable Gift! — Glory to God in the higheſt, on Earth Peace, Good-will towards Men!</hi> —</p>
               <p>In the Viſions of <hi>John,</hi> the Throne of Chriſt is repreſented as having Thouſands of <hi>Angels</hi> ſtanding about it, and ſaying with a loud Voice, <hi>Worthy is the</hi> Lamb <hi>that was ſlain, to receive Power, and Riches, and Wiſdom, and Strength, and Honour, and Glory, and Bleſſing.</hi> And every Creature in Heaven and Earth is bro't in joining their Doxology, ſaying, <hi>Bleſſing, and Honour, and Glory, and Power, be unto Him that ſitteth upon the Throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.</hi> —It is the preſent uninterrupted Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Bleſſed, and will be ſo in all future <hi>Eternity,</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorate

Redeeming Grace. Nor can we better beſtow <hi>Time</hi> now, than in beginning the Work of Heaven upon Earth.</p>
               <p>Surely if we are to <hi>remember the Years of the Right Hand of the moſt High,</hi> the Year of <hi>Redemption</hi> by our Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> is not to be forgotten by us. It's Operations &amp; Occurrences are in themſelves ſuch as deſerve our utmoſt Care to <hi>remember</hi> them. Theſe Things, if conſider'd in their <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Reference,</hi> muſt needs appear of Weight and Dignity ſufficient to intitle them juſtly to our moſt ſerious and frequent Contemplation. And <hi>the Author of eternal Salvation</hi> can't but be <hi>worthy</hi> to receive this Honour of a conſtant grateful Commemoration. — The Lord promiſed his Apoſtles, to ſend down the Divine <hi>Comforter,</hi> for this End, to <hi>bring all Things to their Remembrance,</hi> which he had ſaid and done; Nor were They <hi>negligent to put</hi> others <hi>always in Remembrance of theſe Things,</hi> even <hi>tho' they knew them, and were eſtabliſhed in the preſent Truth:</hi> which Reflections, as they plainly argue the vaſt Importance of the <hi>Things of Chriſt,</hi> ſo likewiſe our indiſpenſable Obligation to <hi>remember</hi> the Year of the Lord <hi>Jeſus.</hi> Accordingly the inſpir'd Writings, wherein theſe Divine Wonders ſtand recorded, and which are the Chriſtian's Rule of Faith and Practice, do recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend theſe Things to our <hi>Remembrance,</hi> and inculcate the Duty upon us, in all the Language of Precept and Perſuaſive, of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Endearment. Not only is it a Charge to the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> of Chriſt; <hi>Meditate on theſe Things, be wholly in them, that thy Profiting may appear unto all:</hi> but the Exhortation ſpeaketh to <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in common, <hi>Wherefore holy Brethren, conſider the Apoſtle and High-prieſt of our Profeſſion, Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> And again, <hi>Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto Jeſus the Author and Finiſher of our Faith,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Conſider him that endured ſuch Contradiction of Sinners againſt himſelf.</hi> — The Scriptures every where repreſent to us <hi>the Excellency of the Knowledge of Chriſt,</hi> and entertain us with Diſcourſe of <hi>the Things concerning Chriſt</hi> (either in the Prophecy or the Hiſtory) holding them much in our View, as Things of univerſal Concernment and the vaſteſt Moment, the moſt neceſſary Subjects of Meditation, and worthy to employ our beſt Powers of Underſtanding and Memory. Of them the Apoſtle writes in that Manner (1 Cor. 15.2.) <hi>By which alſo ye are ſaved, if ye keep in Memory what I have preached to you, unleſs ye have believed in vain.</hi> So (Heb. 2.1.) <hi>Therefore we ought to give the more earneſt Heed to the Things which we have heard, leſt at any Time we ſhould let them ſlip;</hi> — leſt we ſhould let them <hi>run through,</hi> or <hi>leak out</hi> (as the Original ſignifies) either out
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:005947_0038_102728181F7ACAC8"/>
of our Memory, out of our Creed, out of our Affection, or out of our practical Regard and Uſe in the chriſtian Life.</p>
               <p>It infinitely behoves us, that we <hi>endeavour to have theſe Things always in Remembrance,</hi> with Faith and Love, which is in Chriſt Jeſus. We ſhould ſtudy to increaſe our Acquaintance with them, familiariſe the Thoughts of them, labour to get and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve an habitual Senſe and a lively Impreſſion of them on our Mind and Heart; often calling them to Remembrance, on all Occaſions, nor infrequently employing our devotional Hours in more deliberate and ſolemn Meditation upon them. We ſhould even <hi>daily</hi> ſeiſe ſome of our flying Moments for this delightful, this profitable, and moſt neceſſary Application of our thinking Powers; while the Men of the World let trifling Amuſements and inferiour Concerns engroſs all their Time and Tho't. But eminently ſhould our Minds be exerciſed in ſuch Meditations on the <hi>Sabbath;</hi> a Day by divine Appointment ſeparated to the Buſineſs of Contemplation and Devotion, and now under the Goſpel to be ſanctify'd eſpecially in <hi>Remembrance</hi> of a riſen <hi>Jeſus.</hi> Yet more particularly the <hi>Table of the Lord</hi> invites our warmeſt and moſt engaged Meditations of Chriſt, his Croſs, his Kingdom and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns. The Lord's Supper is in it's primary Intention a Feaſt of <hi>Memorial.</hi> In the original Inſtitution, it was one Part of our Lord's ſacramental Speech at the giving of the Bread, <hi>This do in Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Me;</hi> and again diſtinctly at the giving of the Cup, <hi>This do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in Remembrance of Me.</hi> — And indeed 'tis the very <hi>Motto</hi> of univerſal Chriſtianity, the Inſcription upon every Ordinance and every Duty, <hi>Do this in Remembrance of Chriſt.</hi> For ſo much is included in the juſt Conſtruction of that ſummary Precept, <hi>Whatſoever ye do, whether in Word or Deed, do all in the Name of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> The <hi>Remembrance</hi> of Chriſt and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by him is a moſt comprehenſive Duty, of the moſt frequent Revolution, of never-ceaſing Obligation, and even run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thro' the whole Series of chriſtian Practice. Nor can I ſee how any without this may pretend to <hi>live by the Faith of the Son of God,</hi> or to exemplify a <hi>good Converſation in Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We ſurely forget that we call ourſelves <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> nay, even forget we are <hi>Men</hi> (rational and accountable, but apoſtate Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures) if we forget <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Mediator;</hi> whether in our Schemes of Divinity, in our Acts of Devotion, in our human Converſe, or in Point of practical Regards in our moral Conduct. Nor can we <hi>remember God our Creator</hi> in any due and acceptable Manner,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:005947_0039_10272819B15D5FF8"/>
ſo long as we don't ſincerely and truly <hi>remember God our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</hi> Conſult what the Scripture ſaith to this Purpoſe. <hi>Whoſe tranſgreſſeth, and abideth not in the Doctrine of Chriſt, hath not God. — He that honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father. — He that hateth him, hateth his Father alſo.</hi> In vain then do any pretend to venerate the Name of the <hi>One,</hi> while they ſlight the Memory of the <hi>Other,</hi> or are eſſentially defective in their Regards to it. However Men may value themſelves on the Religion of <hi>Nature,</hi> or however they may boaſt themſelves in the <hi>Law,</hi> yet if they are <hi>aſham'd of the Goſpel,</hi> and <hi>Enemies of the Croſs of Chriſt</hi> (whether in Theory, or Practice) we are aſſuredly taught of God, that <hi>their End is Deſtruction.</hi> The Religion of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> is the only true Religion, the only poſſible Religion of a <hi>fallen</hi> Creature: and this originates with <hi>Faith in the Blood of Chriſt,</hi> the one Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator between God and Men; yea, the whole Progreſs of it, to it's Perfection, is ſum'd up in that one Word, <hi>Looking unto Jeſus,</hi> or in that, <hi>Coming to God by Him.</hi> Without the <hi>Knowledge of that Holy One,</hi> and having him in <hi>Remembrance,</hi> tho' a Man lives in a Place of Goſpel-Light and <hi>ſeemeth</hi> to be religious, his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is <hi>vain,</hi> and <hi>he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know;</hi> be he the greateſt Maſter in human Science, and the brighteſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſt in the World, or how incomparably ſoever he may have profited in meer <hi>Moſaick</hi> Religion. <hi>Philoſophy</hi> is vain, and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daiſm</hi> is vain. Only the Goſpel, the Religion of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> is able to make Men <hi>wiſe unto Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, be our Regards to <hi>Revelation,</hi> to <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and our Reverence for the Name and Memory of it's bleſſed <hi>Author,</hi> ever ſo profound, yet if all terminates in a mere <hi>ſpeculative</hi> Knowledge, or a mere <hi>hiſtorical</hi> Credence, and <hi>idle formal Remembrance,</hi> verily ſtill it will profit us nothing. Says the Apoſtle (Rom. 10.8, 9.) <hi>This is the Word of Faith, which we preach: That if thou ſhalt confeſs with thy Mouth the Lord Jeſus, and ſhalt believe in thine Heart that God raiſed him from the Dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved. For with the Heart Man believeth unto Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore while we commemorate the Incarnation of the Son of God, his Humiliation and Exaltation, his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry and Miracles, his Doctrine and Pattern, his Satisfaction and Interceſſion, his Offices and Benefits, we muſt look to our <hi>Hearts,</hi> that theſe be really engag'd and rightly affected. It muſt be our unceaſing Care, in all our Commemorations of Chriſt and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, that our <hi>Hearts</hi> be in the Buſineſs, &amp; that we act from
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:005947_0040_1027281CB20A1EA0"/>
right Principles, with right Views, and in a right Temper &amp; Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. If we would remember the Year of Redemption, as we ought, this muſt be done under the Power of <hi>unfeigned Faith</hi> dwelling in us, actuating every correſpondent Affection within, and producing all agreable Behaviours without; as well <hi>ſanctifying</hi> our Converſation, yea, <hi>purifying our Souls,</hi> and <hi>transforming us into the Image of the Son of God,</hi> as putting us upon <hi>ſeeking to be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd by Chriſt.</hi> Elſe we ſhall conſtructively call our Redeemer the <hi>Miniſter of Sin,</hi> the Patron of Hypocriſy and Wickedneſs. Horrid Blaſphemy! And impious Abſurdity! To profeſs, that we <hi>know</hi> Chriſt, while in Works we <hi>deny</hi> him! To pretend, that we <hi>remember</hi> Chriſt, while we have a <hi>Heart not right with him!</hi> To pretend, that we remember a <hi>crucify'd Jeſus,</hi> without a Heart <hi>crucify'd</hi> to the World and the Fleſh! What Inconſiſtencies are theſe! — Let us realiſe it, a mere <hi>mental</hi> or intellectual Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance will not ſuffice; much leſs a mere <hi>labial</hi> or verbal. No, it muſt be a <hi>cordial</hi> and a <hi>practical</hi> Remembrance; penetrating the Heart, and governing the Life. It muſt be a Remembrance duly qualify'd with all thoſe ſpiritual, vital, and moral Properties preſcribed in the Goſpel, and ſuch as influences our whole Temper and Conduct: Or it is not a <hi>good Remembrance,</hi> ſuch as the Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> expects and demands, nor ſuch as he will accept from us, as a giving him the <hi>Glory</hi> due to his adorable Name and Memory.— In ſhort, it muſt be a <hi>believing</hi> and <hi>fiducial</hi> Remembrance; it muſt be a <hi>penitential,</hi> a <hi>reverential,</hi> a <hi>loving</hi> and <hi>admiring,</hi> a <hi>thankful</hi> and <hi>prayerful,</hi> and an <hi>active, obedient, aſſimilating</hi> Remembrance, as well as intellective and diſcurſive. All which Properties and Qualifications might profitably be repreſented in their diſtinct Lights: but I muſt not expatiate.</p>
               <p>Now, to make ſome <hi>Reflections</hi> and <hi>Inferences</hi> very briefly, let it be ſaid, —</p>
               <p n="1">1. We ſhould conſider the diſtinguiſhing <hi>Obligations</hi> we are under, in Point of Gratitude, to the bleſſed God, who has <hi>revealed theſe Things to Babes,</hi> when they are <hi>hid from many Wiſe and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> and <hi>Great</hi> in the Earth; and has given us ſo many precious <hi>Helps</hi> for the <hi>remembring</hi> of Chriſt and the Things of Chriſt, while Thouſands in the World are ſitting in the <hi>Shadow of Death,</hi> igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Saviour and eternal Salvation. — We ſhould eſteem it a glorious Advantage, a bleſſed Privilege, that we enjoy, in the <hi>Word written,</hi> where <hi>the Things of our Peace</hi> are diſcover'd, and
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:005947_0041_10272820B6AFE890"/>
the <hi>Memoirs</hi> of <hi>Jeſus</hi> the Redeemer (the moſt excellent, the moſt important whatſoever) are preſerv'd; and which we have in our own Hands, in our own Language, to be our daily Counſeller, and as a Light to our Path, as a Lamp to our Feet, to guide us in the Way of Peace. — It is an additional Privilege we enjoy, in the <hi>Word preached;</hi> which rehearſes to us the Goſpel-Hiſtory &amp; Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Chriſt, from time to time, inſtructs us in the Knowledge of the Divine Records, and aſſiſts us in remembring thoſe impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Facts and Events, in which the Salvation of the Soul is ſo nearly concern'd. — We have further Helps in the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> the <hi>Example</hi> of Saints, the <hi>Counſels</hi> and <hi>Reproofs</hi> of chriſtian Monitors, and other Means (withal likewiſe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current Aids of God's <hi>Spirit</hi>) conducing to promote our Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with Chriſt, &amp; Remembrance of him; nor only ſerving to aſſiſt the Underſtanding &amp; Memory, but likewiſe to aſſiſt the Conſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience &amp; Affections in their reſpective Offices, &amp; to aſſiſt us in Point of Devotion &amp; Practice. O how thankful ſhould we be for ſuch ſignal Advantages and Helps in this momentous Caſe? Happy we, if we improve the <hi>Talents</hi> committed to our Truſt. — But indeed, if we are <hi>ſlothful Servants,</hi> if we are <hi>evil</hi> and <hi>unthankful,</hi> and found finally Strangers to a true <hi>Remembrance</hi> of the Redeemer, how aggravated will be our Guilt and Condemnation! How <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeleſs</hi> ſhall we be, and <hi>of all Men the moſt miſerable!</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. We ſhould therefore ſolemnly and impartially <hi>examine</hi> into our Caſe, into our Experience, our Temper and Management; and inquire whether we have ever yet been bro't by the Grace of God to <hi>remember</hi> Chriſt and Redemption, as we ought. — Do we in our deliberate Judgment <hi>value</hi> the Memory of Chriſt and his redeeming Love; <hi>accounting all Things but Loſs for the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the Knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus our Lord,</hi> and looking upon them as comparatively not worth our <hi>remembring?</hi> Are we firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>perſuaded</hi> of the glorious Realities in the Goſpel-Report? And are we labouring for an increaſed Acquaintance with the <hi>Theory</hi> of Divine Truths referring to Chriſt and Redemption? Do we <hi>inure</hi> ourſelves to the Contemplation, and <hi>delight</hi> in the notional Study of theſe Things? Nor acquieſcing in mere Speculation, are we often entertaining ourſelves with proper <hi>moral</hi> and <hi>practical</hi> Reflections upon them? And have we ever felt Impreſſions on our <hi>Hearts</hi> &amp; <hi>Conſciences,</hi> anſwerable to the Nature and Moment of theſe Divine Subjects? In brief, do we labour to apply what Knowledge and Senſe we have of theſe Things to all their genuine

Uſes and Deſigns in the Chriſtian Life, and find in our Experience the <hi>Remembrance</hi> of Chriſt and Redemption accompany'd with Faith and Love, Repentance and Obedience? — If ſo, it is a right and acceptable, a holy and happy <hi>Remembrance:</hi> If it be thus qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify'd and regulated, it is conformable to the <hi>Remembrance,</hi> which <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf has of the Year of Redemption; and to that which <hi>He</hi> has of his faithful Followers, which is always practical and benevolent, active and beneficent. — But if our <hi>Remembrance</hi> be not thus temper'd and conducted, it may rather be compar'd to that which is found in the <hi>Powers of Darkneſs</hi> and <hi>Spirits in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

Very little or nothing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is the <hi>Remembrance</hi> we pretend to have of the Redeemer and his Salvation, while we content our ſelves with an idle and empty Profeſſion of Reſpect to the Memory of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> without ſuitable inward Affections and outward Converſation and Practice. — O let us beware of Self-deluſion in a Caſe of ſuch vaſt Moment and eternal Conſequence: and therefore be much in the Duty of Self-Examination, always jealous over our Hearts, nor ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent our ſelves with any the moſt plauſible Appearances of a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance</hi> of Chriſt, unleſs <hi>Chriſt</hi> be <hi>formed in us,</hi> unleſs we feel the Efficacy of <hi>Faith in his</hi> Blood, and find our Faith <hi>working by Love.</hi>

Are there not thoſe who eſpouſe the looſeſt Notions of God's <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> as if he muſt nceſſarily <hi>love</hi> his Creatures, tho' apoſtate; or as if he muſt of Courſe <hi>forgive,</hi> if they relent; or as if he will by no means <hi>puniſh</hi> temporary Crimes with eternal Torments; and as if accordingly his <hi>abſolute</hi> Mercy may ſafely be confided in, as a ſufficient Pillar of Hope? Are there not thoſe who have light Thoughts of <hi>Adam's</hi> Fall, and explode the Doctrine of <hi>original Sin?</hi> Are there not thoſe who deny Chriſt's <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> or diſcard the <hi>Imputation</hi> of his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and reproach the Method of Juſtification by Grace through <hi>Faith</hi> in him? Are there not thoſe who aſſert the moral Freedom of the human <hi>Will,</hi> and the Sufficiency of the Powers of <hi>Nature</hi> to the Ends of Holineſs and Happineſs, without the Aids of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Grace; or at leaſt deny the uncontroulable Efficacy of the Grace of Chriſt in Converſion? Are there not thoſe who are for <hi>dividing Chriſt,</hi> either ſetting up one <hi>Nature</hi> in Excluſion of the other, or one <hi>Office,</hi> or one <hi>Benefit,</hi> in Oppoſition to another? Are there not thoſe who <hi>pervert</hi> the Goſpel of Chriſt, who abuſe the Doctrine of electing and redeeming Love, of imputed Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, of juſtifying Faith, and of efficacious Grace, to the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Neglect of <hi>Goſpel-Means,</hi> to a Rejection of Chriſt's <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> to a Denial of the Neceſſity of <hi>Sanctification,</hi> and to a Contempt of the <hi>moral Law,</hi> as ceaſing to be an obliging Rule &amp;c? — But how contradictory are theſe Opinions to the Tenor of <hi>Goſpel-Revelation?</hi> How ſubverſive of the <hi>Faith of Chriſt?</hi> And what dark Symptoms are they upon ſuch as wilfully harbour them, of their being criminally deficient in the Duty of <hi>remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring</hi> Chriſt and his Redemption?

or too cloſe an Attachment to worldly Things, or the Prevalence of ſome ſenſual Luſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are palpable Evidences of their not living in the due <hi>Remembrance</hi> of Chriſt &amp; Redemption?

We ſhould mourn the degenerate State of the Chriſtian Church, and be <hi>trembling for the Ark of God.</hi> Such as are the Friends of Chriſt, and Lovers of Zion, will be found thus doing.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Let Sinners, that are <hi>ſecurely</hi> unmindful of Chriſt and his Salvation, receive <hi>Conviction</hi> and <hi>Reproof,</hi> from what has been ſaid; and live no longer habitual and contented Strangers to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and to the <hi>Remembrance</hi> of him.

Oh how juſtly may you bluſh and tremble, to think of your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful Treatment of the Memory of a crucify'd Saviour!

Indeed, ſhould you die <hi>without Chriſt,</hi> as you muſt die <hi>without Mercy,</hi> ſo you ſhall have Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>without Mercy.</hi> And how will you be able to lift up your Faces <hi>before the Face of Him that ſitteth on the Throne,</hi> or where will you be able to hide your guilty Heads <hi>from the Wrath of the Lamb,</hi> when <hi>the great Day of his Wrath is come!</hi> Verily, the Wrath of <hi>the Lamb on the Throne</hi> will be a <hi>Wrath unto the uttermoſt,</hi> ſuch as you cannot avoid, nor will be able to abide. And realiſe it, I intreat you, the awful Day of <hi>Judgment,</hi> that great and terrible Day of the Lord, is <hi>at Hand.</hi> Beſure, the no leſs awful Day of <hi>Death</hi> is haſtning on you apace, and may overtake you ere you are aware. Depend upon it, the Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> that <hi>juſt One,</hi> obſerves and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents all your Indignities to his Name and Religion, nor will ſuffer himſelf always to be deſpis'd, always neglected and forgotten by you. No, but He will ſooner or later quicken your <hi>Memory,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Terrors of an accuſing Conſcience here, or by the Terrors of the deciſive Sentence hereafter. It's true, <hi>in Death</hi> (i. e. ſo far as concerns the Body rotting in the Grave) <hi>there's no Remembrance of Him:</hi> but yet the <hi>Spirit in Priſon</hi> will have a keen <hi>Remembrance</hi> of a Redeemer and his Salvation, and of the horrid Affronts put upon him, which will be the very Accent of Hell-Torments in the Caſe of Goſpel-Impenitents. <hi>Abraham's</hi>

O <hi>conſider this, ye that forget God</hi> and deſpiſe Redemption by Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>leſt He tear you in Pieces, and there be none to deliver. — Bring it again to Mind, O ye Tranſgreſſors; remember this</hi> now, <hi>and ſhew your ſelves Men.</hi>
               </p>

Mayn'd their future eternal Happineſs depend on a right Improvement of their preſent uncertain Opportunity; as they are liable to <hi>die in Youth,</hi> and muſt be miſerable beyond all Remedy, if they ſhould <hi>die in their Sins?</hi> Or if they ſhould live long, will they not by early Piety be form'd for ſignal Bleſſings in the World, and Comforts to you? And what better Method can you take to promote their Uſefulneſs in this World, or ſecure their Happineſs in the next, than to bring them acquainted with Chriſt betimes; firſt begging of God, that He would <hi>give them a Heart to know him,</hi> and then taking ſuitable Pains for their <hi>Inſtruction in Righteouſneſs?</hi>—Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd therefore that they may (as it infinitely behoves them) now in their young Days <hi>know the Things of their Peace,</hi> do you ſpeak often to them of the <hi>Redeemer,</hi> recount the Wonders of his Grace,

But whether we live, we live unto the Lord, and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: Living therefore, and dying, we are the Lord's. — The Love of Chriſt conſtraineth us. — Wherefore we labour, that whether preſent or abſent we may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of Him.</hi>—Theſe were the Apoſtle's good Profeſſions. Let us herein be <hi>Followers of him,</hi> particularly in the Year now commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing; ſo ſhall it be the <hi>acceptable Year of the Lord,</hi> and whether we live or die, we ſhall be <hi>the Lord's.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But thus much for the firſt great and comprehenſive Article of Wonder in the <hi>Year of Redemption.</hi> —And <hi>the ſecond is like unto it;</hi> which yet I muſt more briefly conſider.</p>
               <p n="2">[2.] Another great and memorable Wonder in the <hi>Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-Year of the Right Hand of the moſt High,</hi> is the <hi>Application</hi> or actual Beſtowment of the <hi>Salvation which is by Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> comprehending the Miſſion of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> the Light of <hi>Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Revelation,</hi> and Privileges of the Evangelical <hi>Church-State,</hi> the <hi>Succeſs</hi> of Goſpel-Means, and the Communication of all <hi>ſpiritual Bleſſings</hi> in this World, follow'd with <hi>compleat eternal</hi> Happineſs in the World to come.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By the <hi>Application</hi> of Redemption is to be underſtood, in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, according to the Repreſentation of it in Scripture, our being made <hi>Partakers of Chriſt,</hi> and brought into the <hi>Fellowſhip of the Son of God.</hi> It implies our having the vital Principle of <hi>Faith</hi> planted in us, and being thereby <hi>united to Chriſt,</hi> in <hi>effectual Calling:</hi> wherein the Spirit of God, convincing us of our Sin and Miſery, enlightning our Minds in the Knowledge of Chriſt, and renewing our Wills, doth perſuade and enable us to embrace Jeſus Chriſt, as he is exhibited to us in the Goſpel. — Particularly we thro'
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:005947_0051_1027283C92CFDB60"/>
Faith <hi>receive the Atonement,</hi> and have <hi>God imputing to us Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs without Works, juſtifying us freely by his Grace;</hi> at the ſame Time alſo <hi>purifying our Hearts by Faith:</hi> And <hi>to as many as receive Chriſt, to them He giveth Power to become the Children of God;</hi> and <hi>if Children then Heirs, Heirs of God and Joint-Heirs with Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> God becometh <hi>their God</hi> in Chriſt, and takes them for <hi>his People.</hi> So <hi>the Bleſſing of</hi> Abraham <hi>comes upon them thro' Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> They <hi>receive the End of their Faith, the Salvation of their Souls.</hi> They ſhare in the Purchaſes of the meritorious Croſs of Chriſt, the Acquiſitions of his victorious Reſurrection and trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant Aſcenſion, the Procurements of his ever-prevalent Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, and the Donations of his Royal Power and Grace. God <hi>crowneth them with Loving-kindneſs,</hi> in the Life which now is, but moſt eminently in the Life which is to come. For the Work of <hi>Application,</hi> tho' begun and carry'd on here, is not perfected till hereafter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A Work this is of equal <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> as that of Impetration. Our Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> deſign'd his Humiliation and Exaltation to be ſubſervient to this ultimate End of his Mediation. This is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Evidence of the Validity of his Sacrifice, and the Efficacy of his Interceſſion. Indeed without this, the <hi>Grace of God</hi> would be <hi>fruſtrated,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> dead <hi>in vain.</hi> The <hi>Purchaſe</hi> of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would become of <hi>none Effect</hi> to us, without the <hi>Application</hi> of it. The Glory of God and the Lamb is connected with this, and the whole Happineſs of his People is immediately founded in it. It is therefore a Work of the laſt Importance.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It's a Work full of <hi>Difficulty,</hi> inſuperable to all meer created Power and Skill: Nothing ſhort of a Divine Agent is equal to this arduous Affair. The <hi>eſpouſing</hi> of a Sinner unto Chriſt, the <hi>forming of Chriſt</hi> in him, &amp; <hi>begetting him to a lively Hope,</hi> inveſting him with <hi>the Righteouſneſs which is of God by Faith, turning him from the Power of Satan to God, crucifying the Fleſh with its Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Luſts, ſanctifying the Spirit Soul &amp; Body, transforming him into the Image of the Son of God,</hi> and tranſlating him from his native State of Sin and Miſery, to a State of Holineſs &amp; Happineſs, from Unbelief to Faith, from Guilt and Condemnation to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and Juſtification, from the Bondage of Corruption to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Liberty of the Sons of God, from loathſome Filthineſs of Fleſh and Spirit to Sanctification and Honour, from Impotence to Strength, from Death to Life, and from Earth to Heaven; theſe are ſome of the Effects wro't in the Application of Redemption.
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:005947_0052_1027283FD020B150"/>
But <hi>who is ſufficient for theſe Things!</hi> What Man or Angel is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of producing ſo vaſt a Change in the fallen Creature! Means and Inſtruments indeed are employ'd in this bleſſed Work: but ſtill they contribute nothing to the Effect meerly by any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent Virtue of their own. <hi>Neither he that planteth, nor he that watereth, is any Thing: but God that giveth the Increaſe.</hi> Here neither the Word written, nor the Word preached, nor Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, nor Providences, are adequate Cauſes in themſelves: but intirely depend on the Action of a ſuperior Cauſe, for all their Succeſs and Efficacy. Of every Step in this great Affair it muſt be ſaid, <hi>With Men it is impoſſible: but all Things are poſſible with God.</hi> And the Scriptures every where attribute the whole Work to a Divine Efficiency. <hi>If any Man be in Chriſt, he is a new Creature; Old Things are paſſed away, behold, all Things are become new: and all Things are of God, who hath reconciled us to Himſelf by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> &amp; <hi>is in Chriſt reconciling the World unto Himſelf.</hi>— The Three which bear Record in Heaven, do all concur in this Work: The <hi>Father</hi> exerciſing the Prerogatives of Divine <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty;</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> performing the Office of <hi>Mediator;</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> miniſtring in the ſubordinate Character of the <hi>Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> The Application of Redemption is <hi>of</hi> the Father, <hi>through</hi> the Son, and <hi>by</hi> the Spirit. The Spirit is the immediate <hi>Operator</hi> in this Affair: but the <hi>Son</hi> is ſaid to <hi>ſend Him from the Father,</hi> and the <hi>Father</hi> to ſend Him <hi>in his Name.</hi> Thus the whole <hi>Trinity</hi> have a joint Cauſality in the Work.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A Work it is every way <hi>worthy</hi> of it's <hi>Divine</hi> Original; full of Myſtery, and full of Glory, containing a great Part of the Wonders of Redemption; and is juſtly the Admiration of Heaven and Earth, as it is the Envy and the Aſtoniſhment of Hell! It is truly admirable for the Excellency of its Nature, for the Luſtre it reflects on the Wiſdom, Power, Holineſs, Grace, and every Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of God, and for the Variety, Plenty, and Value of it's Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits to Man, for the Method of Operation, the Dignity of the Agent, the Aptitude of the Means, the Compleatneſs of the Work in the Iſſue, the Unworthineſs of all and the peculiar Unlikelineſs of many of the Subjects wro't on, the Diſtinction between Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Places, and Times as to the Experience of this Work, and the vaſt Multitude that will be found at laſt to have paſſed under it, however ſmall a Remnant they comparatively appear in one Generation and another. — Truly the Miſſion of the <hi>Spirit</hi> is a moſt wonderful Event, as well as the Incarnation of the Son; and

the <hi>Application</hi> of Redemption a moſt wonderful Event, as well as the Impetration of it: and in Regard of the one, as much as the other, <hi>the Year of the Redeemed</hi> may fitly be characteriz'd <hi>the Year of the Right Hand of the moſt High.</hi> The Promiſe of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was eminently the Promiſe in the Old Teſtament: but now in the New, it is the Promiſe of the <hi>Spirit.</hi> This virtually contains in it all <hi>the great and precious Promiſes</hi> of the Goſpel, and is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive of all deſirable Gifts, Graces, Comforts, yea, of Heaven itſelf. This is call'd emphatically <hi>the Promiſe of the Father:</hi> and every known Inſtance of the Fulfilment of this invaluable <hi>Promiſe</hi> affords Matter of Thankſgiving to God, nor ought to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look'd or forgotten by us.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Remarkable Seaſons of an extenſive <hi>Out pouring of the Spirit,</hi> eſpecially claim our grateful and pleaſing <hi>Remembrance.</hi> Such Seaſons undoubtedly there were among the People of God in the <hi>Patriarchal</hi> Ages, and in the Time of the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law: but the <hi>Miniſtration of the Spirit,</hi> in it's moſt notable Meaſure and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, was reſerv'd till the Time of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and is the peculiar Glory of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Diſpenſation. <hi>The Law came by</hi> Moſes: <hi>but Grace and Truth by</hi> Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>John</hi> propheſy'd of Chriſt, that He ſhould <hi>baptiſe with the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> and this was fulfil'd in Part during his perſonal Miniſtry on Earth, among the <hi>Jews,</hi> but much more admirably among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as well as <hi>Jews,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his <hi>going to his Father,</hi> that he might ſend down the <hi>Comforter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sure I am, 'tis a wondrous and memorable <hi>Year of Viſitation,</hi> this, wherein <hi>God hath viſited the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>to take out of them a People for his Name;</hi> hath viſited a dark and benighted World, that lay in Wickedneſs, with <hi>the Day-ſpring from on high,</hi> with the <hi>Light of the glorious Goſpel of the bleſſed God,</hi> the <hi>Revelation</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> diffuſing the <hi>Knowledge of Salvation</hi> thro' his Name far and wide, and ſetting up his viſible <hi>Kingdom</hi> among Men, even among <hi>all Nations:</hi> nor only ſending forth his <hi>Miniſters,</hi> to preach unto every Creature under Heaven, and diſpenſe the Ordinances, which He had appointed for Means of Grace, but alſo ſending forth the <hi>Spirit of Grace,</hi> to accompany his Word and Inſtitutions with enlightning and quickning <hi>Influences,</hi> to put <hi>Power</hi> into them, and give them <hi>Succeſs;</hi> and thus to <hi>win</hi> Souls to Chriſt, place them in <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> of purchaſed Salvation, and bring them to Life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting. <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord God of Iſrael; for He hath viſited and redeemed his People.</hi> He hath <hi>redeemed</hi> them in the Way of <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,</hi> as well as Purchaſe; and to that End, hath <hi>viſited</hi> them
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:005947_0054_10272846911B6500"/>
by his <hi>Spirit,</hi> as well as by his Son. He hath <hi>viſited</hi> them by the Goſpel, and the Miniſtry of the Word, which reports the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and ſhews Men the Way of Salvation: but that were to little Purpoſe, had He not alſo <hi>viſited</hi> them by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> ſent down from Heaven, in the Capacities of a Teacher, Sanctifier, and Comforter, to preſide over the <hi>Church,</hi> the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> and <hi>Means</hi> of Salvation, and as ſupreme Agent for the Son of God to impart the Benefits of Redemption to his People. And with a ſovereign Liberty He communicates the ſame; <hi>dividing to every Man ſeverally as He will:</hi> Yet proportioning and timing his Diſtributions with an unſpotted Rectitude and unerring Wiſdom; ever adjuſting the whole Adminiſtration of his bleſſed Office to the Plan of Redemption, and Scheme of the Goſpel, and by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence in a Subſerviency to the Ends of the <hi>Redeemer's</hi> Honour and Intereſt, and the <hi>Redeemed's</hi> Safety and Happineſs. O if we <hi>knew the Gift of God,</hi> and <hi>knew our ſelves,</hi> we ſhould at once ſee the Neceſſity, the Excellency, and Advantage of the <hi>Spirit's</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration! He is an omnipreſent, omniſcient, infinitely wiſe and powerful Agent, and perfectly benign, and faithful, holy, and true. His gracious Preſence is the moſt neceſſary, vital, and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Good. The richeſt and happieſt Effects reſult from it, in Proportion to the Degree of it's Enjoyment. Where He ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends the Activity and Influence of his Preſence, there is all Weakneſs, and Darkneſs, and Deadneſs, in the Souls of Men, and in the beſt of Means and Inſtruments: But where He di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely exerts the Powers of his Office and the Perfections of his Nature, there is a proportionable Strength, Light, and Life. He can ſurmount the ſtrongeſt Oppoſition from Men or Devils; He can do all his Pleaſure without Controul. But in the Adminiſtration of his Office He exerciſes an <hi>ordinate Power,</hi> regulated and limited by the Counſel of his own Will: hence, when harden'd Rebels do always <hi>reſiſt</hi> and <hi>grieve</hi> the Holy Spirit, He righteouſly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws his forfeited Preſence, and gives them up into the Hand of their own Counſel. — However, he <hi>abides</hi> with the Church of God <hi>for ever;</hi> and has been always <hi>preſent</hi> with his faithful Miniſters &amp; People, with his own Word &amp; Ordinances, from Age to Age, tho' in divers Manners and in various Meaſures. — As the grand Deſign of his Miſſion is to <hi>glorify Chriſt,</hi> ſo ſince the Aſcenſion of our Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the <hi>Manifeſtation of the Spriit</hi> has been afforded more extenſively and more abundantly. Under the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Diſpenſation, the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> has ſignally diſplay'd his
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:005947_0055_1027284823C86E50"/>
Power and Goodneſs, in Honour to the Son of God; has granted more eminent Tokens of his gracious Preſence, been diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly liberal in his Diſtributions of Light and Grace and Peace, and more frequently repeated the glorious Operations of his Hand.</p>
               <p>In this Regard, it was emphatically <hi>the Year of the Right Hand of the moſt High,</hi> in the <hi>Beginning</hi> of this laſt and moſt perfect Diſpenſation, in the Times eſpecially of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> of our Lord. They were themſelves <hi>burning and ſhining Lights,</hi> and in a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Manner <hi>endued with Power from on High;</hi> the <hi>Spirit of Glory and of God</hi> reſting upon them in the largeſt Meaſures: and they had a ſurpriſing <hi>Succeſs</hi> attending their Labours in the Goſpel, <hi>thro' the Power of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> which <hi>went with their Word.</hi> Inſomuch that the Apoſtle writes in that Language, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Now Thanks be unto God, who always cauſeth us to triumph in Chriſt, and maketh manifeſt the Savour of his Knowledge by us in every Place.</hi> In that Day the <hi>Labourers</hi> were numerous, and the <hi>Harveſt plente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi> A <hi>great Door and effectual was opened,</hi> tho' there were many Adverſaries. Then the <hi>Kingdom of God</hi> came, not in Word only, but in <hi>Power,</hi> and in the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> It was a moſt remarkable Time of general Awaknings; and tho' there were <hi>Counterfeit Profeſſors</hi> then, as in every Age, and not a few Inſtances of <hi>Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacy,</hi> yet ſound <hi>Converſions</hi> were uncommonly multiply'd, and the <hi>Souls of the Diſciples</hi> eminently <hi>confirmed,</hi> and <hi>built up on their moſt holy Faith.</hi> The Word of the Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> prevailed, &amp; grew migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily. Multitudes of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and even of their <hi>Prieſts,</hi> became obedient to the Faith. <hi>Thouſands</hi> were added to the Lord in <hi>one Day:</hi> and the Partition-Wall being broken down, which had ſo long ſubſiſted between <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> the Word of Salvation was carry'd into the <hi>Heathen</hi> World; <hi>Idols</hi> were ſeen falling every where before the preached Goſpel, their <hi>Temples</hi> quickly demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd, the Empire of <hi>Satan</hi> in a Manner deſtroy'd, &amp; the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God our Saviour ſet up, on the Ruins of the Devil's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Then was Chriſt <hi>juſtified in the Spirit, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the World;</hi> the Religion of <hi>Jeſus</hi> trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant over all Oppoſition, the Churches multiply'd and in a flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing State, the Miniſtry magnify'd and had in Reputation, adorn'd with eminent Gifts and Graces, and honour'd with glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Tokens of our Lord's promis'd Preſence. The <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> was ſhed forth <hi>abundantly</hi> on that Generation, thro' Jeſus Chriſt.— This is but an imperfect Account of the <hi>Apoſtolick</hi> Age, agreable to the Current of the ſacred Story. Now <hi>theſe Things were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:005947_0056_1027284B29249BA8"/>
for our Learning, upon whom the Ends of the World are come;</hi> that thro' Comfort of the Scriptures we might have <hi>Hope towards God,</hi> and might <hi>pray in Faith</hi> for the Return of primitive and vital Chriſtianity, for renew'd Triumphs and an univerſal Spread of the glorious Goſpel. With this View, theſe <hi>ancient Things</hi> are to be recollected by us: and thoſe <hi>Years of the Right Hand of the moſt High</hi> often to be reflected on, that we may give God the Glory due to his great Name, for the Wonders of his Power and Grace in the Days of old.</p>
               <p>Nor were the <hi>ſucceding</hi> Ages of the primitive Church left without the <hi>Fruit of the Spirit,</hi> and ſome ſignal Tokens of the <hi>Power of the Higheſt</hi> preſent with the Miniſters of the Word, and with the Churches of Chriſt, in one Place and another. — But indeed (the Reflection is melancholy) there was a gradual Dying of Religion, and a partial Withdraw of the Spirit of Grace; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til at length, in Place of the Temple of the living God, <hi>Satan</hi> obtained to have his Seat, <hi>Iniquity</hi> no longer hid it's Head, but regain'd much of it's old Empire, and the <hi>Man of Sin,</hi> that Son of Perdition, for Ages uſurp'd the Throne of Chriſt in the viſible Church; ſaving among a Few: for ſtill all along God reſerv'd to himſelf a <hi>Remnant</hi> of ſuch as bow'd not the Knee to <hi>Baal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But there has been a glorious Return and evident Preſence of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Chriſt in theſe <hi>later</hi> Generations of his People. A ſignal <hi>Year of the Right Hand of the moſt High</hi> it was, when the <hi>Man of Sin</hi> began to fall before the <hi>Sword of the Spirit;</hi> I mean, when the <hi>Papal</hi> Intereſt about two Centuries ſince receiv'd a fatal Shock, by the Reſurrection of a long-bury'd Goſpel, in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Parts of the World, and ſo many <hi>Nations,</hi> at the Reformation from Popery, were <hi>ſprinkled</hi> from on high by the Baptiſm of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> yea, <hi>Floods</hi> ſeem'd poured on the dry Ground; at a Time while ſome few righteous Souls, that had been groaning under the Tyranny of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> and lamenting after the Lord, were ready to ſay, <hi>Now behold, if the Lord would open Windows in Heaven, might ſuch a Thing be!</hi> Yet the marvellous Event was ſeen, to the Glory of ſovereign Grace in Chriſt. Here was now a ſurpriſing Revival of primitive Chriſtanity. This was a bleſſed <hi>Reſtoration</hi> indeed, worthy of an annual &amp; perpetual <hi>Remembrance.</hi> And the Memory of this happy <hi>Year of the Lord</hi> ſhould, under the preſent awful Decline of the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> encourage our Faith in God for the <hi>Revival</hi> of this languiſhing Intereſt among the Nations.</p>

A remarkable Seaſon of <hi>Converſion</hi> and effectual Calling, which is the ſpecial Work of the <hi>Spirit of Grace,</hi> ſpeaks ſuch a Year to to be among the <hi>Years of the Right Hand of the moſt High,</hi> worthy to be remembred by us. <hi>Converſion</hi> is a vaſt Event, greater than the Conqueſt of a City in War; yea, is myſterious and glorious even above the Reſurrection of the Dead, or the Creation of the World. Be it the Converſion but of <hi>one Sinner,</hi> there's <hi>Joy in Heaven</hi> on the Occaſion: much more, when Converſions are wro't in repeated and numerous Inſtances. This ſpeaks it <hi>the Day of the</hi> Mediator's <hi>Power,</hi> the <hi>Year of the Lord,</hi> to be notic'd and remembred by us. — Nay, be it but an unuſual Seaſon of <hi>Conviction</hi> and <hi>Awakning</hi> of Sinners, which is the Work of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and above the Power of Men and Means, this ſpeaks the <hi>Year</hi> wherein it occurs, to be among the <hi>Years of the Right Hand of the moſt High,</hi> which claim our Notice and Remembrance.

               </p>
               <p>I can't but think (to come nigher home) that there was an uncommon <hi>Preſence</hi> of God by his Holy <hi>Spirit,</hi> as well as Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, with our excellent <hi>Progenitors,</hi> the original Settlers of <hi>New-England.</hi> We have Reaſon to believe, a great Part (if not the Generality) of the firſt Planters of theſe Colonies were happy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the <hi>Application</hi> of Redemption in effectual Calling, and experienc'd much of the Spirit of Grace, in his ſanctifying, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, quickning, and comforting Influences. In that Day, the <hi>Word</hi> had <hi>free Courſe</hi> and was <hi>glorify'd</hi> among them: God was very remarkably ſeen <hi>in his Power and Glory</hi> in the Sanctuary: <hi>His Bleſſing</hi> was upon his People: <hi>His Work</hi> appear'd unto his Servants, and <hi>his Glory</hi> unto their Children. There were many evident Tokens and are ſome remaining Monuments of a ſignal Preſence of the <hi>Spirit</hi> with that Generation. It ſeems to be the Language of Heaven to our <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Thus ſaith the Lord, <hi>I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thee, the Kindneſs of thy Youth, the Love of thine Eſpouſals, when thou wenteſt after Me in the Wilderneſs, in a Land that was not ſown. Iſrael was Holineſs to the Lord. — We</hi> alſo ſhould <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member</hi> this, and not forget <hi>the former Things from the Beginning.</hi> We ſhould recollect and realiſe theſe Things, to give God the Glory of his <hi>former Loving-kindneſſes,</hi> and to enliven our Faith and Hope in the <hi>God of our Fathers,</hi> to remind us <hi>from whence we are fallen,</hi> and to humble us in that we have ſo <hi>left our firſt Love;</hi> being <hi>riſen up in our Fathers ſtead, an Increaſe of ſinful Men,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by our Apoſtacy to the <hi>fierce Anger</hi> of the Lord, except we repent. — Yet it mayn't be thought, that the <hi>following</hi> Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have been altogether <hi>without Chriſt, not having the Spirit,</hi> and ſo <hi>none of his,</hi> but the <hi>Generations of his Wrath,</hi> whom He hath utterly forſaken.

               <p>Upon the whole, the Work of the <hi>Spirit</hi> in the <hi>Application</hi> of Redemption to the Souls of Men, whether in former or latter Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, and whether extending to a greater or leſs Number of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, is ſurely ſuch a Wonder of Divine Wiſdom, Power and Grace, as deſerves our ſolemn <hi>Recognition</hi> and <hi>Remembrance.</hi> — And it is moſt worthy of our Contemplation, whether view'd in it's Commencement, it's Continuance, it's Progreſs, or it's Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.

Spirit will not leave his Work, in the <hi>End,</hi> ſo much as gradually defective: but will <hi>perform it to the Day of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> He will perfect the Believer's Sanctification, in the Hour of <hi>Death:</hi> and will perfect his Glorification, in the Day of <hi>Judgment.</hi> In that Day the Spirit of Chriſt, as Agent for the Son of God in the Adminiſtration of his Kingdom of Grace, will preſent to Him his Church a <hi>glorious</hi> Church, without Spot, or Wrinkle, or Defect, without Mark or Memorial of Sin and Death.

The Perfection of this ſpeaks the Dignity of the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit's</hi> Office, and the Excellency of his Work of <hi>Application;</hi> in the Courſe of which He <hi>brings many Sons to Glory,</hi> and is always peopling the Kingdom of Heaven, with <hi>the Spirits of juſt Men,</hi> tho' in various Proportions, from one Generation to another.</p>

We ſhould <hi>obſerve theſe Things,</hi> in reading the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts; and often review the ſacred Story, to entertain and affect our ſelves with the glorious <hi>Memoirs</hi> they have left us of the <hi>Miniſtration of the Spirit,</hi> which were written for our Information and Uſe.

               <p>But here, as in the Caſe of other <hi>the Works of the Right Hand of the moſt High,</hi> we muſt take Heed, that we don't content our ſelves with a mere <hi>hiſtorical,</hi> and <hi>ſuperficial, heartleſs</hi> Commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: but ever look that our <hi>Remembrance</hi> of theſe high and ſacred Events be attemper'd to the <hi>Nature</hi> &amp; <hi>Importance</hi> of them, and apply'd to <hi>experimental, devotional,</hi> and <hi>practical</hi> Purpoſes in Religion.

With <hi>Frequency</hi> and <hi>Perſeverance.</hi> — In Proportion to the Dignity and Importance of the Subject, we ſhould abound in our ſerious Thoughts upon it: and as the Meditation is of conſtant Uſe, we ſhould be conſtant in the Duty; Not only <hi>in the Spirit on the Lord's Day,</hi> but ſo in ſome Degree every Day.

               <p>Laſtly, With a correſpondent <hi>Life</hi> and Courſe of <hi>Action,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting both the inner and outer Man. — Our Remembrance of the bleſſed <hi>Spirit,</hi> his Office and Agency, which participates in the <hi>Holineſs</hi> of his Perſon, is never genuine and effectual, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we are bro't to reſemble Him in the moral Complexion of our whole Man, unleſs we are conform'd to Him in the Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature of our Hearts and in the Tenor of our Lives.

Theſe practical Regards are a neceſſary <hi>Evidence,</hi> that we are of thoſe to whom that noble Characteriſtick belongs (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.5.) <hi>They that are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Spirit, do mind the Things of the Spirit.</hi> The very Nature of theſe Things, and their Place in the Scheme of Redemption, ſpeaks their nearly concerning us, and their directly tending to influence our whole Temper &amp; Conduct: ſo that it's abſurd to ſuppoſe, they ſhould be <hi>minded</hi> at all truly, if they be not minded <hi>practically.</hi> Where there are no Impreſſions and Effects corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponding to the Nature and Moment of <hi>the Things of the Spirit,</hi> Men do not properly <hi>mind</hi> them, but rather treat them as Things of Indifference and Impertinency to them.</p>
               <p>Now by Way of <hi>Uſe</hi> (omitting many Inferences) I ſhall only offer the following Hints.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It's Matter of ſorrowful Reflection, that the <hi>holy Spirit,</hi> his Office and Agency in the <hi>Application</hi> of Redemption, are ſo much <hi>forgotten</hi> (either doctrinally and ſpeculatively, or virtually and practically) in the profeſſing World: and when we conſider the Impieties but of <hi>one Year,</hi> it may well make us wonder, that He hath not utterly <hi>forſaken</hi> this evil Generation. — An abſolute, total, and final Dereliction would be but a juſt Puniſhment upon an

unbelieving and unthankful, a reſiſting and rebelling World. Surely then under the preſent melancholy Appearance of a partial Deſertion, we ſhould <hi>aſcribe Righteouſneſs to our Maker;</hi> and admire his Patience, in ſparing Sinners from one Year to another, notwithſtanding the Guilt they are contracting, by multiply'd and aggravated Indignities to the <hi>Spirit of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Let it be a Word of <hi>Reproof</hi> and <hi>Warning</hi> to Sinners, that amidſt all their Guilt are yet <hi>ſecure,</hi> and <hi>at Eaſe.</hi> — Are there any here preſent, that to this Day are (both in the ſpeculative and practical Senſe) <hi>forgetting</hi> the Spirit of Grace, and his Agency in the Buſineſs of Salvation? May Conſcience now awake to it's Office, and reduce you to Conſideration, before it be too late! <hi>As ſaith the Holy Ghoſt, To Day if ye will hear his Voice, harden not your Hearts.</hi> Dread that awful Charge lying againſt you, <hi>Ye ſtiffnecked, and uncircumciſed in Heart and Ears, ye do always reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Be not deceived: <hi>It is a fearful Thing, to fall into the Hands of the living God.</hi> Nor can you expect any other End, unleſs you ſhould be chang'd and <hi>born of the Spirit:</hi> for <hi>if any Man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his;</hi> and <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt,</hi> no Salvation.

Let it be our ſolicitous Inquiry, Have we ever yet in any Year of our Life experienc'd <hi>the Power of the Holy Ghoſt?</hi> Has there a <hi>Year of the Right Hand of the moſt High</hi> paſſed over us, wherein we have had the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Grace <hi>applying</hi> Salvation to our Souls, working <hi>Faith</hi> in us, and thereby <hi>uniting us to Chriſt,</hi> in effectual Calling?—But <hi>let no Man deceive himſelf.</hi> If you do not <hi>walk in the Spirit,</hi> &amp; <hi>mind the Things of the Spirit,</hi> if you are Strangers to all true devotional &amp; practical <hi>Remembrance</hi> of him, you have evident Tokens upon you of your not being among them that ſhall be <hi>Heirs of Salvation.</hi>

Let Believers <hi>recollect</hi> their ſpiritual Experiences in the <hi>Year paſt,</hi> to give God the Glory: and begin this <hi>new Year</hi> with all ſuitable Tempers &amp; Behaviours. — Seriouſly <hi>review</hi> the Dealings of the Spirit with you in Time paſt, and particularly in the Year now concluded, that you may glorify God by all due Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements. Has it been the happy Year of your Converſion? Or of your Edification in Chriſt? Has it been a Year of Growth in Grace? Or of Joy and Peace in believing? Have you had any profitable and pleaſant Sabbaths, Sermons, Sacraments, Family-Duties, Cloſet-Devotions, and pious Converſations? Have you had merciful Reſtraints from Sin, Aſſiſtances in the Chriſtian Life, Anſwers of Prayer, Supports and Conſolations under Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, or a Senſe of Covenant-Kindneſs ſweetning temporal En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, &amp;c.? Now think theſe Things over, ſing the Praiſes of ſovereign Grace, and give the Spirit of Chriſt the Glory of his bleſſed Agency in &amp; for you. But be humbled in the Reflection upon all your ſinful Neglects and Diſhonours to his Name. — And be ſolicitous, that this <hi>new Year</hi> may open with new Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of the <hi>Things of the Spirit,</hi> with new Experiences of his Power and Grace, and new Evidences of his dwelling in you. Begin the Year with lamenting the ſad Remains of Darkneſs and Corruption in you, and with an earneſt Care of Improvement in vital Piety, with ſolemn Self-Dedication to God, with renewed Vows of a more cloſe Walk with God; and to that End, with pathetick and believing Supplications for the <hi>Renewing of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> without whom you are Nothing and can do Nothing. Be importunate with God, that the Year now beginning may be very remarkably a <hi>Year of the Right Hand of the moſt High,</hi> in a general <hi>Reviving of his Work</hi> among his People; and in ſpecial, that you may be <hi>filled with the Spirit.</hi> Pray for the <hi>Spirit,</hi> to fill every Ordinance and every Providence, to fill the Miniſtry of the Word, to fill the Houſe of God, and to fill your Cloſet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that you may make happy Advances in Soul-Proſperity &amp; holy Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs. — Nor content your ſelves in the Abſence of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter</hi> at any Time, but aſpire after the <hi>Joy of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> that you may in this and every remaining Year ſerve the Lord with Gladneſs of Heart. — Be you <hi>after the Spirit,</hi> in point of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to Him and Purſuit of Him; and both contemplatively and practically <hi>mind the Things of the Spirit.</hi> So you will be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for all the Events of the Year; and may be chearful Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectants of Sufferings, and of Death and Judgment. — In fine,

               <p>Indeed this Character is, in providential Reſpects, properly enough applicable to <hi>every Year.</hi> For the ſame <hi>almighty Hand,</hi> which originally formed all Things, ſtill ſupports and governs the Univerſe, from Year to Year; perpetually ſuperintending the whole Circle of Cauſes and Effects, in every Syſtem of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, natural and moral.

Our annual Preſervations and Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances, Succeſſes and Supplies, our daily Benefits, Supports, and Comforts in every Part of the Year and Period of Life, are the Reſults of a vigilant and bountiful Providence. Nor is there a ſingle <hi>Year,</hi> how little ſoever diſtinguiſh'd by uncommon Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, but what is repleniſh'd with the Mercies of God and with myſterious and vaſt Events, that witneſs to his Being, Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp; Government.

God requires, that we <hi>regard the Operations of his Hand:</hi> Vaſt are the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of doing this, but equal the Miſchiefs of neglecting it. God hath a <hi>Book of Remembrance written before Him,</hi> wherein are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded all his Providences, and all our Improvements: and e'er long He will call us to a <hi>Reckoning,</hi> nor ſhall we be able to <hi>give an Account of our Stewardſhip, with Joy, and not with Grief,</hi> unleſs we practiſe that <hi>Obſervation</hi> and <hi>Remembrance</hi> of his Dealings with us, which make up ſo great a Part of the Duty of the Chriſtian Life. <hi>Whoſo is wiſe, will obſerve theſe Things.</hi> Nor indeed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out firſt <hi>obſerving,</hi> ſhall we be able to <hi>remember</hi> them: &amp; without <hi>remembring</hi> them, we ſhall but <hi>evilly requite the Lord.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>God hath in the Scripture-Hiſtory given us laſting <hi>Memorials</hi> of his wonderful Works in ancient Times, which we ſhould of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten review, with ſerious Meditation: Nor ſhould we ſlight the Memory of leſs diſtant Ages.

moſt High</hi> by a Variety of his <hi>mighty Acts;</hi> in particular by the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the late horrid and traiterous REBELLION in <hi>Scotland;</hi> and by wondrous VICTORIES, which, we preſume, have broken the Power of our Enemies in <hi>Italy,</hi> and greatly ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Hands of our Allies; as alſo by the moſt ſurpriſing Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wro't for <hi>New England</hi> and theſe <hi>Britiſh</hi> Colonies, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feating the late <hi>grand Enterprize</hi> of our <hi>French</hi> Enemies againſt us (that under the Conduct of <hi>Duke</hi> D'ANVILLE) when they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd on our Coaſt with a formidable <hi>Armada,</hi> and vaſt Naval Armament, with a conſiderable Body of Land-Forces on board, and Thouſands on Shoar waiting to join them, breathing Slaughter and Ruin, and bent on Revenge for the Loſs of <hi>Louiſbourg.</hi> But happily for <hi>us,</hi> happily for <hi>Annapolis</hi> in particular, how did God diſappoint their Hopes, and blaſt their Undertaking! By repeated <hi>Storms,</hi> ſcattering, breaking, or diſabling their Ships; By <hi>Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> deſtroying a Multitude of Lives (among the reſt, cutting off their <hi>Commander in Chief</hi>) and greatly reducing their Strength; By <hi>dividing</hi> their Counſels, and turning their Wiſdom into Foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſs; By <hi>intimidating</hi> them with the Proſpect of Vengeance (hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, if not Divine) purſuing them; &amp; by all haſtning them back, with <hi>Sennacherib's</hi> Fate, loaded with Confuſion and Diſtreſs; without ſuffering them to execute any the leaſt Branch of their vindictive Deſign againſt us, &amp; indeed without ſuffering us to give them the leaſt Obſtruction. — Here was the <hi>Finger of God!</hi> We <hi>ſtood ſtill, and ſaw his Salvation;</hi> and it was <hi>marvellous in our Eyes.</hi> Well may we ſet up our EBEN-EZER, and ſay as <hi>Samuel</hi> on a like Occaſion, <hi>Hitherto hath the</hi> LORD <hi>helped us.</hi> Surely his Name is a <hi>ſtrong Tower,</hi> and his Preſence a <hi>Wall of Fire</hi> round about. <hi>Some truſt in Chariots, and ſome in Horſes,</hi> in Fleets and Armies, in Fortreſſes and Artillery: <hi>but we will truſt in the Name of the Lord our God. When our Enemies and our Foes came upon us to eat up our Fleſh, they ſtumbled and fell. They are brought down and fallen. The Snare is broken and we are eſcaped. They intended Evil againſt us; they imagined a miſchievous Device, which they were not able to perform. Bleſſed be the Lord, who hath not given us a Prey to their Teeth. We will praiſe Him, for he hath heard us, and is become our Salvation.</hi> Verily <hi>the Right Hand of the Lord hath been exalted:</hi> &amp; <hi>hath done great Things for us, whereof we are glad.</hi> Let us <hi>declare his Works with Rejoycing;</hi> record them in our Memories, and hand down Memorials of them to Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Yet let us <hi>rejoyce with Trembling,</hi> ſenſible of the Frowns
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:005947_0074_10272875F10FE020"/>
mixed with the Smiles of Providence, and fearful of forgetting and abuſing the Mercies of God, of forfeiting and loſing them, and careful to apply the <hi>Remembrance</hi> of them to it's genuine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votional and practical Purpoſes. Let the Experiences of <hi>Years paſt</hi> ſerve to animate our Faith and Hope and Prayer in reference to <hi>Years future.</hi> When under diſcouraging Proſpects, let us check our Unbelief and Deſpondence; and ſay with the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> in our Text, <hi>This is my Infirmity; but I will remember the Years of the Right Hand of the moſt High.</hi> — And let us <hi>take good Heed to ourſelves,</hi> leſt we <hi>forget the Lord our God,</hi> in <hi>not remembring his Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,</hi> and <hi>in not keeping his Commandments,</hi> which He hath ſhewn us in his Word, and has been enforcing in his Providence, by many obliging and endearing (as well as chaſtning &amp; mortifying) Diſpenſations. It was a Divine Admonition to Iſrael of old (<hi>Deut.</hi> 8.) <hi>Beware that thou forget not the Lord thy God, in not keeping his Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes— Leſt when thou haſt eaten, and art full, and haſt built goodly Houſes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>then thine Heart be lifted up, and thou forget the Lord.— But thou ſhalt remember the Lord thy God: for it is He that giveth thee Power to get Wealth.</hi> — O that there were ſuch an Heart in us, and in all this People, thus to <hi>remember God, in remembring his Commandments, to do them,</hi> that it might go well with us and with our Children for ever!</p>
               <p>But I muſt not forget, there are Salvations and Benefits of a more <hi>private</hi> Reference, by which particular <hi>Years</hi> are often made peculiarly <hi>memorable</hi> to ſubordinate Societies, Families, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons (even in a Time of publick Troubles) and in which God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, that thoſe ſo diſtinguiſh'd do <hi>ſee</hi> and <hi>remember his Hand,</hi> his good Hand upon them. As therefore we ſhould frequently review our paſſed <hi>Years,</hi> in general, ſo let us in particular reflect ſeriouſly this Day on the <hi>laſt Year.</hi> Has it been a Year brighten'd with ſingular <hi>Bleſſings</hi> and <hi>Salvations</hi> to any of us <hi>perſonally,</hi> or to our <hi>Houſes,</hi> or the little Communities we are ſpecially concern'd in? Has the Year been diſcriminated by proſperous and happy Occurrences, or merciful Preventions of Accidents and impend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Calamities; by remarkable Meaſures of Health, or Recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries from dangerous Sickneſs; by uncommon Succeſs in Buſineſs, or ſignal Preſervation of any important Intereſts; by an uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Series of comfortable Enjoyments, or ſeaſonable Supply of our Wants; by eminent Degrees of ſocial Happineſs, or new Acceſſions of relative Advantages, <hi>&amp;c.?</hi> We ſhou'd then enrol it among the <hi>Years of the Right Hand of the moſt High,</hi> to be
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:005947_0075_1027287787D24DD8"/>
ſolemnly <hi>remembred</hi> by us. And accordingly we ſhould on this Occaſion (as they, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.) <hi>record and thank and praiſe the Lord God of Iſrael: remembring his Works that He hath done, we ſhould give Thanks to his holy Name, and glory in his Praiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet I muſt again remind you, that not a mere <hi>oral</hi> Commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, nor a mere indolent <hi>abſtract</hi> Remembrance, will ſuffice. But if we would <hi>wiſely conſider the Doings of the Lord,</hi> as it ſhould be a deliberate, univerſal, and permanent Conſideration, ſo it muſt be ſincerely purſu'd to it's genuine <hi>Ends,</hi> be accompany'd with grateful Sentiments and Affections, and be productive of all correſpondent Practice. We ſhould highly <hi>value</hi> the Divine Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours done us; admire the <hi>merciful Kindneſs</hi> of God to us; and think of it with an inward Senſe of <hi>Gratitude, Love,</hi> and <hi>Delight;</hi> yet alſo with humble <hi>Reverence</hi> and <hi>godly Fear,</hi> in the Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that He who has done ſuch great Things <hi>for</hi> us, is able to do as great Things <hi>againſt</hi> us, and <hi>will,</hi> if we are <hi>evil</hi> and <hi>unthankful.</hi> We ſhould <hi>fear the Lord,</hi> &amp; <hi>his Goodneſs.</hi> When I <hi>conſider</hi> (ſaid pious <hi>Job) I am afraid.</hi> — At the ſame Time while contemplating what <hi>God</hi> has done for us, we ſhould recollect what <hi>we</hi> have done for Him. Let us then examine our ſelves: Have we been ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably <hi>improving</hi> the Divine Patience to it's holy Ends, and <hi>bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth Fruit with Patience,</hi> while God has ſpared us in the Year paſt? Have we been <hi>uſing</hi> our Liberty, Plenty, Health <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the Honour of God? Have we been <hi>doing Good</hi> in our Places, and abounding in the <hi>Fruits of Righteouſneſs?</hi> Have our <hi>Souls proſpered,</hi> and been <hi>in Health?</hi> What Conqueſts have we gain'd over our <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Enemies? What Progreſs have we made in the <hi>Race ſet before us,</hi> under our diſtinguiſhing Advantages? Are we now <hi>forwarder</hi> in this, than we were <hi>a Year ago?</hi> Thus, while conſidering <hi>God's Ways,</hi> we ſhould alſo conſider <hi>our own Ways.</hi> This implies no Confuſion of Ideas, but the different Meditations are well conſiſtent; and the different Paſſions, ſpringing from them, have a Congruity and Subſerviency to one another, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire to promote the ſame ſolid and ſubſtantial Purpoſes in the Chriſtian Life. — The <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of God, with which the <hi>Year</hi> has been crown'd, leadeth us to <hi>Repentance;</hi> and as <hi>He remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth</hi> all our Sins, ſo ſhould we <hi>remember our Faults this Day,</hi> and mourn them as ſo many practical Contempts of his Providential Kindneſs to us in the Courſe of the <hi>Year.</hi> — And now, ſolicitous that we mayn't tranſfer uncancel'd Debts into another <hi>Year's</hi> Account, we muſt <hi>remember</hi> and <hi>conſider</hi> CHRIST, our <hi>Paſſover</hi>

ſacrificed for us; and be acting <hi>Faith</hi> in Him, that by the <hi>Blood of Sprinkling</hi> we may have our Sins <hi>blotted</hi> out. As we ſhould on this Occaſion pay our Acknowledgements to Chriſt in his <hi>Regal</hi> Character, eye Him as having the Reins of Providence in his Hand, and own Him the ſovereign Diſpenſer of all our Bleſſings; and as we ſhould do Him Honour in his <hi>Prieſtly</hi> Office, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing it intirely owing to his mediatorial Interpoſition, that we have thus long been repriev'd from Hell, &amp; that our <hi>Years</hi> on Earth have not been all darken'd with Calamity and cover'd with Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; and ſhould accordingly <hi>give Thanks to his Name,</hi> and <hi>by Him offer the Sacrifice of Praiſe to God:</hi> So we ſhould at the ſame Time be <hi>receiving the Atonement,</hi> which this our great High Prieſt hath made <hi>once for all,</hi> and which needs not to be <hi>repeated</hi> as that under the Law was <hi>every Year,</hi> but is of abiding Virtue from Year to Year, and always applicable for the Remiſſion of Sins. — Yet not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting our ſelves with a Faith that only looketh <hi>back,</hi> we muſt now alſo look <hi>forward</hi> to the Year &amp; Time enſuing, and exerciſe Faith in Chriſt, both as the Lord our <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> &amp; our <hi>Strength;</hi> looking to <hi>Jeſus,</hi> for <hi>Grace to help in every Time of Need,</hi> to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify us againſt future Temptations to Sin, and enable us to glorify God by a <hi>good Converſation in Chriſt,</hi> that we may ſtill <hi>ſee his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> We ſhould now be renewing the ſincere <hi>Conſecration</hi> of our Perſons, our Time and Talents, to the Service of God, with a humble Reliance on CHRIST; <hi>going forth in his Strength,</hi> and making Mention of <hi>his Name,</hi> even of <hi>his only:</hi> perſuaded by the Mercies of God, we ſhould now <hi>preſent our Bodies a living Sacrifice,</hi> reſolve upon the <hi>obeying his Will,</hi> &amp; the diligent <hi>Imitation</hi> of his perfect <hi>Example,</hi> by doing all the <hi>Good</hi> we can in our ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Places: but to this End we ſhould earneſtly aſk for the <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of the Spirit of Chriſt,</hi> from a Conſciouſneſs of our own <hi>Inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency,</hi> as of our ſelves, for this <hi>Obedience of Faith</hi> and Life of Gratitude. — And thus entring on the <hi>new Year,</hi> we may truſt it will be a <hi>happy</hi> Year to us. The Experiences of <hi>one Year</hi> may and ſhould in this Caſe encourage us to <hi>hope in God</hi> for the needful Mercies of <hi>another Year.</hi> The Evidences we've al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready had of his Goodneſs, Faithfulneſs, Wiſdom and Power, ſhould engage us to <hi>confide</hi> in his Providence for the Year &amp; Time to come, ſhould <hi>eſtabliſh our Hearts</hi> amidſt all the Shakings of the World, and check our uneaſy Apprehenſions, tho' we ſee <hi>Clouds</hi> and <hi>Darkneſs</hi> gathering all around us.</p>

                  <pb n="75" facs="unknown:005947_0077_1027287EE24E0350"/>But ſtill let us begin the <hi>Year</hi> with ſolemn Acts of unfeigned <hi>Reſignation</hi> to the Will of a ſovereign God, as to all the Events of it; mindful of the <hi>Changes</hi> we are liable to in a mutable World, and not vainly preſuming on the <hi>Continuance</hi> of Life and Proſperity, ſo as to forget our Dependance on God, and neglect the Duty of Submiſſion to his Pleaſure, <hi>as the Manner of ſome is,</hi> whom the Apoſtle has admoniſh'd (<hi>Jam.</hi> 4.) <hi>Go to now, ye that ſay, To Day or to Morrow we will go into ſuch a City, and continue there a Year, and buy and ſell, and get Gain: Whereas ye know not what ſhall be on the Morrow; for what is your Life? It is even a Vapour, that appeareth for a little Time, and then vaniſheth away. For that ye ought to ſay, If the Lord will, we ſhall live, and do this or that.</hi> — Alas, how frequent are the Inſtances of Mortality? How many round about us, in the Space of a <hi>Year,</hi> have had their <hi>Days number'd and finiſh'd?</hi> And have any of us that ſurvive, a <hi>Leaſe</hi> of our Lives, that <hi>we</hi> ſhould allot on <hi>continuing a Year</hi> lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger? In all Probability ſome (if not many) of us will never ſee another <hi>New Year's Day:</hi> nor indeed are we ſure of Life for an Hour or a Moment. O let us begin this Year with the affecting Thought, that <hi>our Breath is in God's Hand,</hi> that <hi>the Time is ſhort,</hi> that the <hi>Night cometh wherein no Man can work,</hi> &amp; our Opportunity is awfully uncertain. — You that are in <hi>advanc'd Years,</hi> had Need <hi>walk circumſpectly, not as Fools, but as Wiſe, redeeming the Time, becauſe the Days are evil:</hi> and ſuch of you as have hitherto <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten</hi> God, had need haſten to <hi>remember</hi> Him, ſince the <hi>Graves are ready for you,</hi> and <hi>in Death there is no Remembrance of Him.</hi>— You that are in <hi>middle Age,</hi> and have to this Day been <hi>loving the World,</hi> but <hi>deſpiſing your Souls,</hi> and diſregarding <hi>the Years of the Right Hand of the moſt High, O how long, ye ſimple ones, will ye love Simplicity,</hi> and <hi>hate Knowledge!</hi> Now pity your neglected Souls, and mind <hi>the one Thing needful,</hi> a <hi>Part in Chriſt.</hi> What is a Man <hi>profited,</hi> if he <hi>gain the whole World,</hi> and <hi>loſe his own Soul?</hi> An Intereſt in Chriſt will in a dying Hour be worth ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Worlds to you. — And you that are in <hi>younger</hi> Life, but <hi>walking in the Way of your own Heart and in the Sight of your own Eyes,</hi> ſerving divers Luſts and Pleaſures, will you not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded to a juſt Concern, that now without Delay you may have Grace whereby to <hi>flee youthful Luſts,</hi> and <hi>remember God in the Days of your Youth!</hi> Surely the <hi>Time paſt may ſuffice you</hi> to have purſu'd the <hi>Pleaſures of Sin:</hi> &amp; <hi>know it,</hi> that you, as well as others before you, may <hi>die in Youth,</hi> and if <hi>your Life be found among the

               </p>
               <p>And now, it there be any among you, whether elder or young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>awaken'd</hi> to a ſerious Solicitude for your Souls, O <hi>turn you to the ſtrong Hold, ye Priſoners of Hope,</hi> that <hi>by the Blood of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ye may eſcape out of the Pit, wherein is no Water.</hi> Are you ſolemnly affected with the Apprehenſion, that this may be your <hi>dying Year,</hi> and inquiring <hi>what you ſhall do to be ſaved?</hi> Let it be your inſtant Care to get into <hi>Chriſt</hi> by Faith, and ſo into a juſtify'd and ſanctify'd State. Thus you will be in an habitual Readineſs for <hi>Death;</hi> and if you ſhould <hi>die this Year,</hi> it will be a Year of <hi>Salvation</hi> to you. — Yet let not <hi>Believers,</hi> who are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in this State of habitual Readineſs to die, reſt contented with any preſent Attainments, but be labouring to get and keep in the beſt Poſture of <hi>actual</hi> Preparedneſs for the great Change, ſo, whenever it comes, it will be not only a ſafe and happy, but a welcome and joyful Change to you. God's Call to you this Day is like that to good <hi>Hezekiah, Set thine Houſe in Order, for thou ſhalt ſurely die.</hi> But however (like him) you may deprecate dying young, or dying ſpeedily, perhaps the God of your Life may deny your Requeſt, and not defer your <hi>Death,</hi> as in his Caſe, for <hi>fifteen Years,</hi> nor yet for fifteen Months. It may be your Lot, as well as that of others, <hi>not to be ſuffered to continue by Reaſon of Death,</hi> ſo much as for a <hi>Year,</hi> or a Week, or even a Day longer. <hi>Be ye ready (watch</hi> and <hi>pray) for ye know not the Day nor the Hour.</hi> — It was <hi>Job's</hi> wiſe Reſolution, <hi>All the Days of my appointed Time will I wait, till my Change come.</hi> Let this be the <hi>Purpoſe of our Heart</hi> this Day.

Our <hi>dying</hi> Year will truly be a <hi>bleſſed</hi> Year to us, a <hi>Year of the Right Hand of the moſt High,</hi> a <hi>Time of Love,</hi> and follow'd with an Eternity of Bliſs, with <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Joy at God's Right Hand for evermore.</hi> AMEN.</p>
