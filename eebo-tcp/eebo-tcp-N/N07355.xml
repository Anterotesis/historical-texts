            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Looking Glass, &amp;c.</head>
            <l>
               <hi>NEW-England</hi> for these many Years</l>
            <l>hath had both Rest and Peace,</l>
            <l>But now the Case is otherwise;</l>
            <l>our Trouble doth encrease.</l>
            <l>The plague of War is now begun</l>
            <l>in some great Colonies,</l>
            <l>And many Towns as desolate</l>
            <l>we may see with our Eyes.</l>
            <l>The Loss of many goodly Men</l>
            <l>we may lament also,</l>
            <l>Who in the War have lost their lives,</l>
            <l>and fallen by our Foe.</l>
            <l>Our Women also they have took,</l>
            <l>and Children very small;</l>
            <l>Great Cruelty they have used</l>
            <l>to some, tho' not to all.</l>
            <l>The Enemy that hath done this,</l>
            <l>are very foolish Men;</l>
            <l>Yet God doth make of them a Rod</l>
            <l>to punish us for Sin.</l>
            <l>If we then truly turn to God,</l>
            <l>he will remove his Ire,</l>
            <l>And will forthwith take this his Rod</l>
            <l>And cast it into Fire.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:009388_0003_0F73445418EAE418"/>
Let us then search what is the Sin</l>
            <l>that God doth punish for;</l>
            <l>And when found out cast it away,</l>
            <l>and ever it abhor.</l>
            <l>Sure 'tis not chiefly for those Sins</l>
            <l>that Magistrates do name,</l>
            <l>And make good Laws for to suppress,</l>
            <l>and execute the same.</l>
            <l>But 'tis for that same crying Sin,</l>
            <l>that Rulers will not own,</l>
            <l>And that whereby much Cruelty</l>
            <l>to brethren hath been shown:</l>
            <l>The Sin of Persecution</l>
            <l>such Laws established;</l>
            <l>By which Laws they have gone so far,</l>
            <l>as Blood hath touched Blood.</l>
            <l>It is now Forty Years ago,</l>
            <l>since some of these were made,</l>
            <l>Which was the Ground and Rise of all</l>
            <l>the persecuting Trade.</l>
            <l>Then many worthy Persons were</l>
            <l>banished to the Woods,</l>
            <l>Where they among the Natives did</l>
            <l>lose their most precious Bloods.</l>
            <l>And since that, many Godly Men</l>
            <l>have been to Prison sent;</l>
            <l>They have been fin'd and whip'd also,</l>
            <l>and suffer'd Banishment.</l>
            <l>The Cause of this their Suffering</l>
            <l>was not for any Sin,</l>
            <l>But for the Witness that they bare</l>
            <l>against Babes Sprinkling.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:009388_0004_0F734457B42E3B08"/>
Of later time there hath been some</l>
            <l>Men come into this Land,</l>
            <l>To warn the Rulers of their Sins,</l>
            <l>as I do understand.</l>
            <l>They call'd on all, both great and small,</l>
            <l>to fear God and repent;</l>
            <l>And for their Testimonies thus</l>
            <l>they suffer'd Punishment.</l>
            <l>Yea, some of them they did affirm,</l>
            <l>that they were sent of God</l>
            <l>To testify to great and small,</l>
            <l>that God would send his Rod</l>
            <l>Against those Colonies, because</l>
            <l>they did make Laws not good;</l>
            <l>And if those Laws were not repeal'd,</l>
            <l>the end would be in Blood.</l>
            <l>And tho' that these were harmless Men,</l>
            <l>and did no hurt to any,</l>
            <l>But lived well like honest Men,</l>
            <l>as testify'd by many;</l>
            <l>Yet did these Laws entrap them so,</l>
            <l>that they were put to Death,</l>
            <l>And could not have the Liberty</l>
            <l>to speak near their last Breath.</l>
            <l>But these Men were, as I have heard,</l>
            <l>against our <hi>College Men;</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And this was out of doubt to me,</l>
            <l>that which was most their Sin.</l>
            <l>They did reprove all <hi>Hirelings,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>with a most Sharp Reproof,</l>
            <l>Because they knew not how to preach,</l>
            <l>till sure of Means enough.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:009388_0005_0F7344585180D9A8"/>
Now to the Sufferings of these Men,</l>
            <l>I have but gave a hint;</l>
            <l>Because that in <hi>George Bishop</hi>'s Book</l>
            <l>you may see all in print.</l>
            <l>But may we know the Counsellors</l>
            <l>that brought our Rulers in,</l>
            <l>To be so guilty as they are,</l>
            <l>of the aforesaid Sin?</l>
            <l>They were the Tribe of Ministers,</l>
            <l>as they are said to be,</l>
            <l>Who always to our Magistrates</l>
            <l>must be the Eyes to see.</l>
            <l>These are the Men that by their Wits,</l>
            <l>have spun so fair a Thread,</l>
            <l>That now themselves and others are</l>
            <l>of Natives in a Dread.</l>
            <l>What need is there of such a Fear,</l>
            <l>if we have done no Ill?</l>
            <l>But 'tis because that we have been</l>
            <l>not doing of God's Will.</l>
            <l>When <hi>Cain</hi> had slain his Brother, then</l>
            <l>began this Fear to be,</l>
            <l>That every Man would do to him</l>
            <l>the same that did him see.</l>
            <l>The Scripture doth declare the Cause</l>
            <l>why <hi>Cain</hi> did kill his Brother;</l>
            <l>It was because the Deeds of one</l>
            <l>was good, and not the other.</l>
            <l>Because that God did Favour show</l>
            <l>To <hi>Abel</hi> more than he,</l>
            <l>That was in verity the thing</l>
            <l>that Envy could not see.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:009388_0006_0F734458AC6E34E0"/>
Then let us all, both great and small</l>
            <l>take heed how we do fight</l>
            <l>Against the Spirit of the Lord,</l>
            <l>which is our highest Light.</l>
            <l>Let Magistrates and Ministers</l>
            <l>consider what they do;</l>
            <l>Let them repeal those evil Laws,</l>
            <l>and break those Bands in two,</l>
            <l>Which have been made as Traps and Snares</l>
            <l>to catch the Innocents,</l>
            <l>And whereby it has gone so far,</l>
            <l>to Acts of Violence.</l>
            <l>I see you write your selves in Print,</l>
            <l>the Balm of Gilead;</l>
            <l>Then do not act as if you were</l>
            <l>like Men that are half mad.</l>
            <l>If you can heal the Land, what is</l>
            <l>the Cause things are so bad?</l>
            <l>I think instead of that, you make</l>
            <l>the Hearts of People sad.</l>
            <l>Is this a Time for you to press,</l>
            <l>to draw the Blood of those</l>
            <l>That are your Neighbours and your Friends,</l>
            <l>as if you had no Foes.</l>
            <l>Yea, some there are, as I have heard,</l>
            <l>have lately found out Tricks</l>

I do affirm to you, if that</l>
            <l>be really your mind,</l>
            <l>You must go turn another Leaf,</l>
            <l>before that Peace you find.</l>
            <l>Now loving Friends and Country-Men,</l>
            <l>I wish we may be wise;</l>
            <l>Tis now a time for every Man</l>
            <l>to see with his own Eyes.</l>
            <l>'Tis easy to provoke the Lord</l>
            <l>to send among us War;</l>
            <l>'Tis easy to do Violence,</l>
            <l>to envy and to jar;</l>

            <l>To pride it out, as if there were,</l>

            <l>to cheat and to oppress;</l>

            <l>To swear and lie, and to be drunk,</l>
            <l>to backbite one another;</l>

            <l>and Mischief to our Brother!</l>
            <l>To live in such Hypocrisy,</l>

            <l>Although our Hearts within are full</l>
            <l>of Evil, and of Blood.</l>
            <l>All these and many Evils more</l>
            <l>are easy for to do;</l>
            <l>But to repent, and to reform,</l>

Let us then seek for help from God,</l>
            <l>and turn to him that smite;</l>
            <l>Let us take heed, that at no time,</l>

            <l>'Tis true, there are some times indeed</l>

The Rulers in the Country I</l>
            <l>do own them in the Lord;</l>
            <l>And such as are for Government,</l>
            <l>with them I do accord.</l>
            <l>But that which I intend hereby,</l>
            <l>is that they would keep bound,</l>
            <l>And meddle not with God's Worship,</l>
            <l>for which they have no ground.</l>
            <l>And I am not alone herein,</l>
            <l>there's many hundreds more</l>
            <l>That have for many Years ago</l>
            <l>spake much upon that Score.</l>
            <l>Indeed I really believe</l>
            <l>it's not your Business</l>
            <l>To meddle with the Church of Christ,</l>
            <l>in Matters more or less.</l>
            <l>There's work enough to do besides,</l>
            <l>to judge in <hi>mine</hi> and <hi>thine,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>To succour Poor and Fatherless,</l>
            <l>that is the Work in fine.</l>

            <l>enough of that to do;</l>
            <l>Much more at such a Time as this,</l>
            <l>as there is War also.</l>
            <l>Indeed I count it very low,</l>
            <l>for People in these Days,</l>
            <l>To ask the Rulers for their leave</l>
            <l>to serve God in his Ways.</l>
            <l>I count it worse in Magistrates</l>
            <l>to use the Iron Sword,</l>
            <l>To do that Work which Christ alone</l>
            <l>will do by his own Word.</l>
            <l>The Church may now go stay at home,</l>
            <l>there's nothing for to do;</l>

Their Work is all cut out by Law,</l>
            <l>and almost made up too.</l>
            <l>Now Reader, least you should mistake,</l>
            <l>in what I said before</l>
            <l>Concerning Minister's, I think</l>
            <l>to write a few Words more.</l>
            <l>I would not have you for to think</l>
            <l>that I am such a Fool,</l>
            <l>To write against Learning, as such,</l>
            <l>or to cry down a School.</l>
            <l>But 'tis that <hi>Popish College</hi> way,</l>
            <l>that I intend hereby,</l>
            <l>Where Men are mew'd up in a Cage,</l>
            <l>fit for all Villany.</l>
            <l>But I shall leave this puddle Stuff</l>
            <l>to Neighbours at the Door,</l>
            <l>That can speak more unto such things,</l>
            <l>upon a knowing Score.</l>
            <l>And now these Men though ne'er so bad,</l>
            <l>when they have learn'd their Trade,</l>
            <l>They must come in and bear a Part,</l>
            <l>whatever Laws are made.</l>
            <l>I can't but wonder for to see</l>
            <l>our Magistrates and Wise,</l>
            <l>That they sit still, and suffer them</l>
            <l>to ride on them, not rise,</l>
            <l>And stir them up to do that Work,</l>
            <l>that Scripture Rule there wants,</l>
            <l>To persecute and persecute</l>
            <l>those that they judge are Saints.</l>
            <l>There's one thing more that I believe</l>
            <l>is worse than all the rest,</l>
            <l>They vilify the Spirit of God,</l>
            <l>and count School Learning best.</l>

If that a Boy hath learn'd his Trade,</l>
            <l>and can the Spirit disgrace,</l>

            <l>and may see more in Print.</l>
            <l>There are some few, it may be, that</l>
            <l>are clear of this same Trade;</l>

            <l>these Verses are not made.</l>

            <l>these Wars are like to be,</l>
            <l>I may speak something unto that,</l>
            <l>if Men will reason see.</l>
            <l>The Scripture doth point out the time,</l>
            <l>and 'tis as we do chuse,</l>
            <l>For to obey the Voice of God,</l>
            <l>or else for to refuse.</l>
            <l>The Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> doth say,</l>
            <l>when War is threatned sore,</l>
            <l>That if Men do repent and turn,</l>
            <l>God will afflict no more.</l>
            <l>But such a turning unto God,</l>
            <l>as is but Verbally,</l>

            <l>they cut the Calf in twain,</l>

            <l>O this was all in vain!</l>
            <l>For since they came into this Land,</l>
            <l>they floared to and fro,</l>
            <l>Sometimes their Brethren may be free,</l>

'Tis better for our Magistrates,</l>
            <l>to shorten time, I say,</l>

            <l>Then do not keep such evil Laws,</l>
            <l>as may serve at wet Days.</l>
            <l>If that the Peace of God did rule</l>
            <l>with Power in our Heart,</l>
            <l>Then outward War would flee away,</l>

            <l>Or else it's like he will e'er long,</l>

               <p>UPON reading this Day at the Board, a Report from
the Right Honourable the Lords of the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee
of Councils, upon the Petition of <hi>Thomas Richardson</hi>
and <hi>Richard Partridge,</hi> on behalf of <hi>Ioseph Anthony,
Iohn Sisson, Iohn Akin,</hi> and <hi>Phillip Taber,</hi> Prisoners in
the common Goal at <hi>New Bristol,</hi> in his Majesty's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
of the <hi>Massachusetts-Bay</hi> in <hi>New England,</hi> for not
assessing the Inhabitants of the Towns of <hi>Dartmouth</hi> and
<hi>Tiverton,</hi> the additional Taxes of one Hundred Pounds,
and Seventy two Pounds eleven Shillings, imposed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them by an Act passed there in the Year 1722, which
appears to be for the Maintenance of Presbyterian Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
who are not of their Perswasion; and also in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
of their Friends called Quakers in general, who
are frequently under great Sufferings for Conscience
sake in that Government: By which Report it appears,
that their Lordships are of Opinion, that it may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visable
for his Majesty to remit the said additional Taxes,
so imposed on the said two Towns, and to discharge the
said Persons from Goal.</p>
               <p>His Majesty in Council taking the said Report into
Consideration, is graciously pleased to approve thereof,
and hereby to remit the said additional Taxes of one
Hundred Pounds, and Seventy two Pounds eleven Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
which were by the said Act to be assessed on the
said Towns of <hi>Dartmouth</hi> &amp; <hi>Tiverton.</hi> And his Majesty
is hereby further pleased to order, that the said <hi>Ioseph
Anthony, Iohn Sisson Iohn Akin,</hi> &amp; <hi>Phillip Taber,</hi> be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
released from their Imprisonment on account
thereof. And the Governour, Lieutenant Governour,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:009388_0016_0F7344624442ED58"/>
and Commander in Chief for the time being, of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's
said Province of the <hi>Massachusetts-Bay,</hi> and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
whom it may concern, are to take Notice. &amp; yield
due Obedience hereunto.</p>

               <p>IN Obedience to an Order in Council from the late
Lords Justices, during your Majesty's Absence abroad,
bearing date the 24th day of <hi>October</hi> last, we did make
a Representation upon an Act pass'd in the Province of
the <hi>Massachusetts-Bay</hi> in <hi>New-England</hi> in 1722. entituled,
<hi>An Act for apportioning and assessing a Tax of Six Thousand
two Hundred thirty two Pounds thirteen Shillings &amp; eleven
Pence.</hi> Since which Time another Act mention'd in the
said Order of Reference. passed the 29th day of <hi>May,
1723.</hi> entituled. <hi>An Act for apportioning and assessing a
Tax of Six Thousand two Hundred and five Pounds fifteen
Shillings &amp; seven Pence Half-Peny,</hi> is come to our Hands;
by which Act a Tax is laid in express Terms upon the
Inhabitants of <hi>Dartmouth</hi> and <hi>Tiverton,</hi> for the Support
of a Presbyterian, whom they call an Orthodox Minister,
which falls almost entirely upon the Quakers; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very few Inhabitants of any other Perswasion in these
two Towns. But as by the Charter granted to this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
a free and absolute Liberty of Conscience to all
Christians (except Papists) was intended to have been
their Foundation and Support; and as by several Laws
passed there, it seems to have been laid down as a just
and equitable Rule, that the Majority of each Town-Congregation
should have the Choice of their own Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
we cannot see why the Quakers should be refused this
Liberty in the Towns where they are so great a Majority,
and be obliged to maintain a Teacher of different Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion.
Wherefore we humbly propose to your Majesty,
that this Act may be repealed.</p>
               <closer>Which is most humbly submitted,
