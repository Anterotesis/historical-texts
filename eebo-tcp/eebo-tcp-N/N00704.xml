            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

It is agreed upon by all Sober Divines and Chriſtians, that we are not to expect a full un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the Prophecies until they be fulfilled, and that there may be a gradual and partial fulfill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſundry Prophecies at ſeveral times; and yet ſome ſpecial Time be intended for the eminent &amp; full accompliſhment of them: Alſo, that not the Prophecies but the Precepts of Scripture are to be the Rule of our Actions. It belongs to God to fulfill with His Hand what He hath ſpoken with His Mouth, and that in the times and by the ways &amp; means which are known unto Him, but unknown to us; it belongs to us to obſerve His Commandments concerning our preſent duties, whatever the caſe be, leaving all future Events to God. <hi>Deut.</hi> 29 29 Yet are Propheſies a ground of our Faith, Hope and Prayer, relating to their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment: and ſo far Propheſies are doctrinal, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.2, 3. And it is the doctrinal part of the Scriptures that mainly concerns us to direct us in all caſes in the way of our duty to God &amp; men, as the Reverend Author according to the Wiſdom and Grace given unto him, hath declared unto us with much Evidence from Scripture light. Hence it is without queſtion the duty of the Church and People of God <hi>to be an Habitation of Juſtice and Mountain of Holineſs,</hi> at all times &amp; in all places of the World: and becauſe God hath foretold and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

laſt dayes that are come and coming upon the World, therefore we are to aime at it and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour after it, in all the wayes of our duty, that it may be ſo with us in that meaſure as the Lord ſhall pleaſe to grant the ſame unto us; for it is certain, ſo far as we attain thereunto we ſhall be a People bleſſed of the Lord: For theſe two, <hi>Holineſs towards God, and Righteouſneſs towards men,</hi> are like unto the two Pillars in the Temple of God <hi>Jachin</hi> and <hi>Boaz,</hi> which did ſignify the Strength and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhment of the welfare of the Church &amp; Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, while they continue in the Righteous and Holy wayes of the bleſſed God.</p>
            <p>This duty of endeavouring that <hi>New-England</hi> may be <hi>an Habitation of Juſtice and Mountain of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,</hi> though it is incumbent upon all, yet it is in a ſpecial manner committed to and betruſted with Your EXCELLENCY according to that High Station which GOD and the KING have ſet You in: and then it is required of all orders and ranks of men; both Magiſtrates, Miniſters and People (every one in their own place) that they move regularly in concurrence with Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in all things that may conduce unto that end: Though it may be SIR, You may ſometimes meet with difficulties in Your way, and find things amiſs that cannot preſently be amended.

And therefore it will be no wonder if You ſhould find it ſo. Yet let me tell You from the Word of the Lord, that the ſame Encouragement which the Lord gave unto <hi>Joſhua,</hi> for the Subſtance and Scope of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs unto any of His Servants whom He ſets in the place of Government over His People, <hi>viz Be thou Strong and of good Courage in obſerving all the Commandments of God ſo ſhalt thou make thy way proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous and thou ſhalt have good Succeſs, for I will not leave thee, nor forſake thee, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Joſh. 1. from <hi>v</hi> 5. to <hi>v.</hi> 10. compared with <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5.

But I confine my ſelf to my Text<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The words read contain a Propheſie, with its Preface: the Propheſie is in theſe words, <hi>as yet they ſhall uſe this Speech in the Land of</hi> Judah, <hi>and in the Cities thereof, when I ſhall bring again their Captivity, The Lord bleſs thee O Habitation of Juſtice, and Mountain of Holineſs.</hi> I call this a Propheſie becauſe the matter and ſcope are eſpecially Prophetical, yet are there Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and Hiſtorical Hints evident enough in them, if we conſider what is implied, as well as what is expreſſed; and it ſerves our occaſion to improve what is Doctrinal, and Hiſtorical in them, as well
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:000850_0015_0FABA2BB2A2D0AF8"/>
as what is Prophetical. Let us therefore look over the words again, and ſearch out the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents more diligently and diſtinctly.</p>
            <p n="1">1. And then we ſhall find that theſe words ſhew forth hiſtorically what the Land of <hi>Judea,</hi> and more eſpecially <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> formerly had been, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Habitation of Juſtice, and Mountain of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That then they were ſaluted by men, and bleſſed of God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That at the time when this Propheſie wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> written, they were far from being a Habitation of Juſtice, on Mountain of Holineſs.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And that they were as far from being bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of God and man, as they were from being a Habitation of Juſtice, and Mountain of Holineſs. Theſe four particulars reſult from the word (<hi>as yet</hi>) or <hi>yet again,</hi> as ſome read it, for the particle <hi>yet</hi> notes not a continuation of ſomething in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but a reſtauration of ſomething that former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had been in being, but now for ſome time had been intermitted.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Theſe words ſhew forth doctrinally, what <hi>Judea</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> always ſhould have been, <hi>viz.</hi> a Habitation of Juſtice, and Mountain of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. For if while they were holy and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, they were happy and proſperous; and upon their Degeneration their felicity departed, and woful miſeries enſued; and were like to continue till their reformation, no doubt in point of duty,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:000850_0016_0FABA2BBE82F6638"/>
they ought always to have been a Habitation of Juſtice, and Mountain of Holineſs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Theſe words as they are <hi>Prophetical,</hi> are alſo <hi>Promiſſory,</hi> they contain a threefold promiſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The promiſe of a <hi>Happy Restauration</hi> f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>om their Captivity, in theſe words, <hi>When I ſhall bring again their Captivity,</hi> that is, their Captives; the <hi>Abſtract</hi> being put for the <hi>Concrete,</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> Tranſlation hath it, when I ſhall turn away their Captivity, the ſence is the ſame with that <hi>v.</hi> 16. <hi>they ſhall come again from the Land of the Enemy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The promiſe of a <hi>Holy Reformation</hi> of the Jews from their preſent Impiety and Iniquity. For when it is ſaid, <hi>they ſhall uſe this Speech, O Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation of Juſtice, and Mountain of Holineſs</hi>; it means this Speech ſhall be duly and truly uſed. <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhould not only <hi>be called,</hi> but <hi>really</hi> and <hi>truly be,</hi> what men ſhall call her; the phraſe is of like import with that, Iſa. 48.8. <hi>waſt called a tranſgreſſor from the womb,</hi> that is truly ſo called, for thou waſt a Tranſgreſſor from the womb; ſo for Peace-makers to be <hi>Called the Children of God,</hi> means they ſhall be ſo, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.9. From the Speech then we may infer, God promiſed that Religion and Righteouſneſs ſhould flouriſh again in the Land of <hi>Judah,</hi> and in the Cities thereof.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The promiſe of a <hi>Divine Benediction</hi>; men ſhould <hi>wiſh</hi> it them, and God would <hi>give it them, they ſhall yet again uſe this Speech, the Lord bleſs thee,</hi> which is the inſtituted form of Bleſſing contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:000850_0017_0FABA2BCB41D7DE0"/>
and it intends, that as for their Sins God had made them a Curſe, even to a proverb of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and deriſion, according as God had threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them. <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.37. ſo now on the contrary, it ſhould be obſerved, that they were again in favour with God, and that he had bleſſed them, and did and would bleſs them; and thence men would be encouraged to bleſs them in the name of the Lord, or pray to God to bleſs them; and that more than mans bleſſing of them is here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, is evident by what follows; for in the ſequel, God plainly promiſed Temporal and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Bleſſings to them, ſo <hi>v.</hi> 24. <hi>there ſhall dwell in Judah, and all the Cities thereof, Husband men and they that go forth with flocks</hi>: that is, they ſhall have peace and plenty. <hi>v.</hi> 25. <hi>I have ſatiated the weary Soul, and I have repleniſhed every ſorrowful Soul</hi>; that is, I will as ſurely do it as if it were done already. <hi>v.</hi> 28. <hi>I will watch over them to build and to plant.</hi> v. 33. <hi>I will put my Law in their inward parts, I will be their God, and they ſhall be my people.</hi> v. 34. <hi>I will forgive their iniquity, and remember their Sin no more.</hi> It is manifeſt by the premiſes, that the Propheſie and threefold Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is not intended ſo much of what men ſhould <hi>ſay,</hi> but of what God would <hi>DO</hi> for his people, <hi>viz.</hi> Reſtore, Reform, and Bleſs them. So much may ſerve to explain the Propheſy, and what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it. The preface renders the whole cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, the Doctrine muſt needs be good, and the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:000850_0018_0FABA2BD6C301E58"/>
Hiſtory certain; and the promiſe and propheſy paſt all peradventure. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, the God of Iſrael</hi>: The Divine Veracity, Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tency and Covenant benignity of God engageth, and ſtands engaged for the performance of what is promiſed, and it is flat Infidelity, not to believe it; for God wants neither power nor good will to effect what he hath promiſed. So you have the Text explained as it primarily and nextly ſtood related to the Jews, before the Coming of Chriſt; but <hi>the Jews</hi> may moreover be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a <hi>Prophetical Type</hi> of the Chriſtian Church in the times of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> which times are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to in the very foregoing verſe, <hi>A Woman ſhall compaſs a man</hi>; and this is prefaced with, <hi>The Lord hath created a new thing in the earth,</hi> a new thing indeed; for a Woman to be both a <hi>Mother</hi> and a <hi>Virgin</hi> at the ſame time; a new thing in deed, for a Woman to be the Mother <hi>of him that was God,</hi> though <hi>not of the God Head,</hi> yet of the Humane Nature received into P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Enlarging the Catholick Church, writing the Law in the heart <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which the Apoſtle to the Hebrews refers to Goſpel times. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10, 11.12. And the whole by way of <hi>Analogy</hi> and juſt accommodotion may be referred to Kingdoms, Countries &amp; Places, Nations profeſſing the Chriſtian Religion; thus the New Teſtament teacheth us to interpret, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate and apply to our ſelves, Texts of the Old Teſtament. See Rom. 15.4. <hi>For whatſoever things were written aforetime were written for our Learning, that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope.</hi> So 1 Co. 10.11. <hi>Now all theſe things hapned unto them for enſamples, and are written for our inſtruction on whom the ends of the world are come.</hi> So alſo 2 Tim. 3.16. <hi>All Scripture is given by inſpiration of God, and is profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for Inſtruction in righteouſneſs.</hi> Thus having ſhewed how this text that nextly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the Jews comes to affect us, and concern theſe laſt ages of the profeſſing world: I ſhall only for further Explication of the Text, ſhew what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by Juſtice, what by a Habitation of Juſtice, and then what by Holineſs, and what by a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Holineſs; and then proceed to give you the Doctrines.</p>

               <hi>Reaſon.</hi> 1. Becauſe the Moral Law obligeth all mankind to holineſs and righteouſneſs, from the beginning of the world to the end of it: for it was no ways ſuitable to the Wiſdom and Holineſs of God to make man a rational Creature, which is a cauſe by counſel of his own actions, and ſo capable of honouring or diſhonouring, of obeying or diſobeying him that made him, and then leave it to his liberty, whether he would own and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour his maker, yea or no, whether he would worſhip God according to his Inſtitution, or his own, or anothers invention. Can it be imagined, that the moſt wiſe and holy God would leave it <hi>Arbitrary</hi> to men, whether they would ſanctify the <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Dreadful</hi> Name of God, or prophane it by Blaſphemy, Perjury or Irreverence in his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip? Could ſpecial worſhip be due from man to God, and yet no ſet Time be appointed by God for it, and ſeperated and ſo ſanctified for that holy end and uſe? and when God had by his own Example and Revelation of his will notifyed what proportion of time for his peculiar Service, was beſt pleaſing to him and moſt proper for us: could it be any wayes ſuitable to the Wiſdom, Holineſs and Majeſty of God to Submit to the pleaſure and humor of man, whether he would religiouſly obſerve it, yea or no? Thus it is and could be no otherwiſe with man, relating to the <hi>firſt and great Commandment,</hi> and <hi>there is a ſecond like to it, thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf:</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:000850_0024_0FABA2C2F01D5260"/>
Man muſt of neceſſity be obliged by this alſo, ſeeing we have all one Father; one God made us and made us capable of being beneficial, or miſchievous to our ſelves and one another. It is determin'd by our make as well as our Maker, that although all duty was ultimately owing to God, yet ſome was nextly owing to our ſelves and neighbours: That we who were bound to <hi>Love God ſuperlatively for his own ſake,</hi> ſhould be bound to love our ſelves, and our neighbours in <hi>Subordination to God</hi> and <hi>for his ſake.</hi> If God had intended, to have ſent out man into the world like the wild Aſs free, he would have made him like him: but ſeeing he made man after his own Image in holineſs and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, he muſt needs be obliged to live according to it. Seeing man was made <hi>by God</hi> and <hi>like God,</hi> &amp; <hi>for God</hi>; it muſt of neceſſity be mans duty to live <hi>to God</hi> &amp; <hi>like God</hi>: and ſeeing that the Moral Law bears the Image of Gods holineſs and righteouſneſs, it muſt needs be immutable; and till man ceaſeth to be Gods Creature, or God ceaſeth to be holy &amp; righteous (which can never be) mans obligation to be holy and righteous, is as ſacred and inviolable as ever; and if no People or place can either fairly or ſafely pretend to exemption from the Moral Law, leaſt of all may Chriſtian Plantations or Countries.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſon</hi> 2. Although the Primitive Apoſtaſy hath many wayes mortifyed mans ability to keep the Law, yet it hath no ways nullifyed the Laws au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, or mans duty. God is <hi>God ſtill,</hi> as holy
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:000850_0025_0FABA2C35AF4D930"/>
and righteous as ever he was, and man is as much Gods Creature as ever he was; Gods due therefore and our duty as to holineſs &amp; righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is the ſame, and no juſt exemption or diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can be pretended by any, and leaſt of all by Chriſtians, who are in part recovered to the Image of God, and have his Law written on their hearts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſon</hi> 3. From <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moſes</hi> mankind was held under the direction and authority of this Law, and although the Covenant of Grace was ſome way diſpens'd though darkly, whereby it appeared that ſome were exempt from the <hi>Curſe of the law,</hi> yet was there not the leaſt intimation that any were releaſed from under the <hi>Obligation of it to O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</hi> Paul in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.13. proveth indiſputably that the Law was in the world before the <hi>Sinai-Promulgation</hi> of it, and the Hiſtory of <hi>Cain, Abel, Seth, Enoch, Noah,</hi> &amp;c. offer irrefragable proof that God inſiſted on holineſs and righteouſneſs in the old world; though the <hi>old world was deſtroyed, yet was not the old law aboliſhed:</hi> the <hi>New world</hi> was equally obliged to holineſs and righteouſneſs, if not more, ſeeing they had <hi>ſeen one day of Judgment,</hi> &amp; the flood come upon the ungodly and unrighteous, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Job</hi> 22.15, 16, 17. <hi>Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden? whoſe foundation was over flown with a flood &amp;c.</hi> Though the <hi>Language</hi> of man was confounded, yet was not the <hi>Law</hi> confounded at <hi>Babel,</hi> nor did the <hi>Abraha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitical

            <p>
               <hi>Reaſon</hi> 4. The peculiar Covenant which God made with the <hi>Jews</hi> of which <hi>Moſes</hi> was Mediator, did make them a people nearer and dearer to God than other people, but did no ways free them from Obligation to holineſs and righteouſneſs; nay it was far from it: as is evident by the freſh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation of the Law, by Gods own Voice, and the engraving it in Tables of Stone by his own Finger, and the alluring motives to Obedience, <hi>viz.</hi> the Promiſes &amp; the Coercive Sanctions of the Law, <hi>viz.</hi> the threatnings, &amp; their own perſonal obliging themſelves to very exact obedience. So far was the law of holineſs and righteouſneſs, from being abrogated, that the Jews had it re-enforced upon them with new motives from Law and Gratitude, and the judicial proceedings of God with that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple leave it paſt diſpute.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſon</hi> 5. The Goſpel doth no ways relax the authority of the Royal Law, as it is a rule of holy and righteous living Our Saviour ſayeth, <hi>Think not that I am come to destroy the Law</hi>; implying that licentious men would be apt to <hi>think ſo,</hi> and pretend Goſpel for the tranſgreſſions of the Law. See <hi>Math.</hi> 5.17. Our Saviour aſſerts the very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that he did not come to <hi>deſtroy it,</hi> but to <hi>fulfill it</hi>; he humbled himſelf to be made under
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:000850_0027_0FABA2C69B3879B0"/>
the Law, and he honoured the Law by yielding perfect Obedience to it, when we had diſhonoured the Law by diſobeying of it. <hi>Zacharias</hi> his triumph in the <hi>proſpect of Chriſt</hi> was <hi>that we might ſerve God in holineſs and righteouſneſs all our days without fear,</hi> (that is, without ſervile &amp; tormenting fear) not without that which is filial, and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rential, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.74, 75. And <hi>Paul</hi> being become a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> did not account himſelf <hi>without law,</hi> but <hi>under the law to Christ, and exerciſed himſelf to keep a Conſcience void of offence toward God and toward men.</hi> 1 Cor. 9.21. Act. 24.16. Paul was an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, and Preached the <hi>unſearchable riches of Chriſt,</hi> and yet declareth to the Romans, <hi>that the wrath of God is revealed from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, againſt all ungodlineſs and unrighteouſneſs of men.</hi> Rom. 1.18. and in many other texts to the ſame effect: So that if the Apoſtle ſay leſs by way of motive from temporal rewards &amp; puniſhments, it is partly becauſe that is ſaid already under the old Teſtament, which is ſtill in uſe and force, as to holineſs and righteouſneſs; and becauſe that praetermiſſion is abundantly recompenced, by the frequent mention of eternal rewards and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhments. 1 Cor. 6.9. <hi>Know ye not that the unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi> Heb. 12.14. <hi>Without holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi>

               <hi>Reaſon</hi> 6. The Chriſtian Profeſſion layeth a ſpecial obligation on ſuch profeſſing people to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell in holineſs and righteouſneſs. Becauſe <hi>they

profeſs they take the holy and righteous God for their God,</hi> and <hi>Jeſus Chriſt the righteous for their Lord and Saviour,</hi> and devote themſelvs to him: and by <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> like an <hi>Oath of Allegiance,</hi> oblige themſelves to imitate and obey him, and conſtantly to pray to be <hi>Renewed after his Image in holineſs and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi>; and profeſs themſelves moved to holineſs and righteouſneſs, by the Spirit of Chriſt, the Grace of Chriſt, the Law of Chriſt, the Love of Chriſt, the Example of Chriſt, the Name and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Chriſt, and by the hopes and fears of the unſeen future and eternal World.

               <hi>DOCT.</hi> II. That ſuch People and Places as profeſs the Chriſtian Religion, may expect to be Happy or Miſerable, according as it goeth with them, as to Holineſs and Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>The weight of it bears upon theſe four Pillars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That <hi>Judea</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had formerly not only been <hi>called,</hi> but had <hi>been</hi> an <hi>Habitation of Righteouſneſs, and a Mountain of Holineſs</hi>; and that then they were <hi>Saluted of men,</hi> loved, eſteem'd and pray'd for by men, and <hi>Bleſſed by God</hi>; that thus it was <hi>once,</hi> is evident. <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Iſrael was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs to the Lord,</hi> that is, <hi>very holy, the firſt fruits of his increaſe:</hi> that is, they were Conſecrated to God, as the firſt fruits of mankind; they were holy to

God and his Service, and not to be devoured by <hi>Strangers,</hi> but at their pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> In the <hi>Love of their Eſpouſals</hi> they followed the Lord into the Wilderneſs, like to what is propheſyed of the One hundred forty four thouſand. Rev. 14.1. <hi>They appeared on Mount Sion with the Lamb, and have his fathers name written on their foreheads:</hi> and for purity of Doctrine, Worſhip, Diſcipline, and Manners, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Lamb whereſoever he goeth. <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had been a very <hi>faithful City,</hi> true to God and his Worſhip, free from the unchaſt embraces of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry and Superſtition, neither was ſhe then pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the prophanation of holy things or time. It had alſo abounded &amp; excelled in righteouſneſs: <hi>it was full of Judgment, Righteouſneſs lodged in it.</hi> Iſa. 1.21. If you had lookt for Charity, Equity Honeſty, Verity and fair Dealing, yea Juſtice <hi>Commutative</hi> or <hi>Distributive,</hi> you might have found them <hi>dwelling</hi> in <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And while things went thus, they were very happy; <hi>the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation of their Righteouſneſs was proſperous</hi>: they had peace and plenty, health and ſafety. This is ſo evident that the Lord appeals to themſelves whether it was not ſo. Jer. 22.15. <hi>Did not thy father eat and drink and do Juſtice and Judgment, and then it was well with him.</hi> So Jer. 2.5. <hi>What Iniquity have your fathers found in me?</hi> implying that till they cauſeleſly departed from God, things went <hi>well</hi> with them. Yet muſt not this be ſo ſtrictly taken as if ever there was a time in <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:000850_0030_0FABA2C95AD1D070"/>
wherein there was no unholineſs and unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in them; that the Prieſts, Rulers and People were perfectly holy and righteous, exactly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the Moral Law: for they were ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners by nature, and were, at beſt, liable to humane infirmities and frailties, yea in their beſt times, there was ſomething <hi>wanting that could not be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, and ſomething crooked that could not be made ſtreight,</hi> as their hiſtory ſheweth; and therefore any Expreſſion that may bluſh otherwiſe, muſt be underſtood comparatively, not abſolutely. So when they are ſaid to have been happy, very hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, it muſt not be underſtood as if they had no Calamity or Sorrow, but that no <hi>deſolating deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evil</hi> tell upon them: when in <hi>Solomons</hi> time it is ſaid, that they had no <hi>adverſary or evil oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current,</hi> it muſt be underſtood <hi>Comparatively,</hi> and ſo the ſence is, there had been a time when holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and righteouſneſs had flouriſhed extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily in <hi>Judea</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and at that time they were extraordinarily happy, enjoyed the favour of God in very peculiar Inſtances, and had a very great confluence of Gods Bounties and Benefits.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That in <hi>Jeremiah's</hi> time all ranks and orders of men were grown very degenerate and were greatly corrupted, and were become very unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, almoſt as miſerable as miſery could make them. <hi>In Iſaiah's time,</hi> which was conſiderably before this; <hi>the faithful City was become an Harlot,</hi> and they were over run and over-grown with violence

and unrighteouſneſs of every kind. <hi>In ſtead of Judgment there was Oppreſſion, in ſtead of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, there was a Cry.</hi> Iſa. 1.21. and 5.7. But in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah's time,</hi> they were heightned and hardned in all their wickedneſs, and were unteachable, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſwadable and incorrigible. <hi>The chief of the Prieſts and the People tranſgreſſed very much after all the Abominations of the Heathen, and had polluted the houſe of the Lord</hi>; and deſpiſed all the Patience &amp; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion of their God, and complyed with none of the methods of his grace to reclaim them; but <hi>Stiffned their necks and hardened their hearts, from turning to the Lord God of Iſrael.

Then wrath and ruin of every kind invaded them, and broke in upon them, till they were taken and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into Captivity: and <hi>Jeremiah</hi> was in this, one of the unhappieſt of all the holy Prophets, in that he lived to ſee his woful <hi>Propheſies</hi> turned into <hi>Hiſtory.</hi> The man that did not only <hi>foreſee,</hi> but lived to <hi>ſee affliction by the rod of Gods Wrath</hi>: yea he lived to write <hi>doleful Lamentati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="4">4. Gods Judicial Proceedings with the <hi>Jews</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Coming of Chriſt, are inſtructive to peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and places profeſſing the Chriſtian Religion; that it is like to fare with them as to happineſs or miſery, according as it goeth with them, as to Holineſs and Righteouſneſs. For the proof of this, I offer to your conſideration the following Arguments, which for brevity, I ſhall but name.</p>
            <p n="1">1 That God is the ſame now, as he was then, as holy and righteous as ever he was. Did he then <hi>love Righteouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>bate Iniquity</hi>? So he doth ſtill; therefore his Way and Diſcipline is like to be much what the ſame now, as it was then.</p>
            <p n="2">2. His Church is the ſame Church now, though not the ſame people: God hath but <hi>One Church,</hi> Chriſt hath but <hi>one Body</hi>; from the beginning to the end of the World. <hi>Cant.</hi> 6.9. <hi>Eph</hi> 5.23, 25, 27.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This Law requiring Holineſs and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is the ſame: <hi>not one tittle of it is paſſed away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Gods Name and Honour is alike concerned in the ways and behaviour of his people now, as it was then. Did the Sins of the <hi>Jews, give occaſion to the Enemies of the Lord to blaſpheme</hi>? 2 Sam 12.14. So do the Sins of Chriſtians now. See 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6 1. <hi>That his Name and Doctrine be not blaſphemed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. They were under the Covenant of <hi>Grace</hi> as
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:000850_0035_0FABA2CF6703D2D0"/>
well as we? and we under the authority and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the <hi>Law,</hi> as well as they. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.2. plainly affirms, <hi>that they had the Goſpel preached to them,</hi> and in <hi>James</hi> 2.8. it is evident, that Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are required to fulfil the <hi>Royal Law.</hi> When <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Believers are not under the Law; he means, n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p n="6">6. The Apoſtle ſpeaking of Gods Judicial Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding with the <hi>Jews</hi> in Inſtances of Severity, ſaith: <hi>All theſe things happened unto them for Enſam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and they are written for our inſtruction, upon whom the ends of the world are come.</hi> 1 Cor. 10.11.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>Godlineſs hath the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the life that now is, as well as of that which is to come.</hi> 1 Tim. 4.8. and conſequently Ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs hath the Threatning of the life that now is, as well as of that which is to come. And of like import is that, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.10, 11, 12. <hi>He that will love life and ſee good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil,</hi> &amp;c <hi>for the Eyes of the Lord are over the Righteous</hi>; that is, his Providence is active about them for good: but <hi>his face is againſt them that do evil,</hi> that is, the frowns and rebukes of Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence are againſt them that do evil.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Gods Judicial Proceedings with his profeſſing people in the Old World, and afterwards, till <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>'s time, were much what the ſame as they were afterward, as the Book called <hi>Geneſis,</hi> the Book of <hi>Job.</hi> 2 Epiſt. of <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Jude</hi> plainly ſhow.</p>

That although Places that have been Habitations of Righteouſneſs and Mountains of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſhould become very degenerate, and for their Sin be made very deſolate; yet there is ground of hope that God will again Reſtore, Reform and Bleſs them.</p>
            <p>In the third Doctrine there are three particulars contained: the two firſt more implicitely, the third moſt expreſsly.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That places that have been eminent for the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ofeſſion and practice of holineſs &amp; righteouſneſs, may become very degenerate: they <hi>may,</hi> that is, <hi>poſſibly</hi>; not <hi>lawfully. Judea</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> offer a woful conviction of this: <hi>That Kingdom of Prieſts, that holy Nation,</hi> in which Religion &amp; Juſtice ſome time <hi>dwelt</hi> and flouriſhed, was in <hi>Jeremiah<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s</hi> time degenerate, revolted and gone, all ranks &amp; orders of men had greatly corrupted themſelves. This hath been already demonſtrated, and the Churches that were of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> planting, if we compare the Scripture account of them, with Eccleſiaſtical hiſtory concerning them, and their affairs, it would call for <hi>tears,</hi> rather than further <hi>teſtimony.</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clenſion is down hill and natural; Corruption weighs men down ward.</p>
            <q>— Facilis deſcenſus Averni.</q>
            <p>
               <hi>The heart of man is deceitful above all things and deſperately wicked.</hi> Man hath long ſince forfeited his reputation, <hi>being in honour he abode not,</hi> and

ever ſince beareth the reproach of being a falſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful creature. <hi>Surely men of low degree are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and men of high degree are a lie, to be laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter than vanity.</hi> Pſa. 62.9. If men deal falſely and baſely and treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly with God, they do but like themſelves. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.7. <hi>They like men</hi> (or like <hi>Adam</hi> as it may be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred) <hi>have tranſgreſſed my Covenant, there have they dealt treacherouſly with me.</hi> Beſides, Mortality, in a little time, carrieth off the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Degrees of true Grace may be loſt, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders be weakned and obſcured: that which only <hi>ſeemed</hi> to be true Grace, may be <hi>utterly loſt,</hi> and that goodneſs that ſprang from, and depended upon external motive; when the Sun and the wind riſe, will paſs away like <hi>a morning Cloud</hi>: the ſubtle inſinuations of Seducers, a Spirit of error, the force of evil examples, New temptations and occaſions, all, or many of them ſome times do as it were conſpire to bring on defection &amp; Apoſtaſy: and when it is ſo, it is no wonder, it woful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation enſue.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Places that are become degenerate, howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever happy they were before, may become very miſerable, very deſolate. It was ſo with <hi>Judea</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> The Lamentations of <hi>Jeremiah</hi> afford plentiful proof of this, and the deſolations and ruins of the Churches mentioned in the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> ſufficiently prove it may be ſo. If men
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:000850_0040_0FABA2D80D0413B8"/>
do but <hi>like men,</hi> when they make defection, and revolt from Religion and Virtue; God doth but <hi>like God,</hi> when hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">3. Notwithſtanding ſuch degeneration and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation too, there is ground of hope, that God will again reſtore, reform and bleſs ſuch a People. I ſhall prove this poſition by producing the grounds of Hope the Scriptures offer in this caſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. God <hi>Can</hi> do it if he <hi>Will.</hi> That is not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>incredible</hi> which is not <hi>impoſſible.</hi> What can not <hi>Omnipotency</hi> do? Unbelief and diſtruſt is many times bottom'd upon ſcrupling the Power of God. Pſa. 78.19, 20 <hi>They ſaid, Can God furniſh a Table in the Wilderneſs? can he give bread alſo? can he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide fleſh for his people?</hi> So that they are taxt with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <hi>believing in God, nor truſting in his Salvation</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> No wonder they did not believe God <hi>would,</hi> when they did not believe God <hi>could</hi> provide for them. If <hi>Abraham</hi> had Staggered at the promiſe through unbelief of <hi>Gods Power,</hi> he had not been father of many Nation. But againſt hope he believed in hope, knowing that <hi>God quickned the dead and called things that are not, as if they were. He was ſtrong in faith, giving glory to God, being fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that what he had promiſed he was able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.</hi> Rom. 4 17, 18, 20, 21. Such a degenerate and deſolate People, are much in circumſtances for <hi>Restoration</hi> and <hi>Reformation,</hi> as the bodies of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>

               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But what cant he do that quickens the dead? The belief of Gods power facilitates the belief of his good will. So it was in the Lepers ſaith; <hi>Lord if thou wilt, thou canſt make me clean.</hi> That which ſeemeth impoſſible to men becauſe of their <hi>impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency,</hi> is not difficult to God becauſe of his <hi>Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency</hi>: Though this caſe be very difficult, next to impoſſible, yet it is not deſperate: for <hi>with God all things are poſſible.</hi> The <hi>Lord of hoſts</hi> can reſtore, reform, and bleſs a degenerate, deſolate People.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God not only can if he will, but <hi>may</hi> if he pleaſe. What <hi>may</hi> not he do in a way of mercy, who is mercy it ſelf, and hath mercy upon whom he will have mercy? Rom. 9.15. <hi>I will have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, upon whom I will have compaſſion.</hi> Infinite mercy can find motive in it ſelf, when there is none in the Creature, and divine Soveraignty is not to be <hi>Counſelled</hi> or <hi>Controlled</hi> by any Creature. <hi>If he will have compaſſion, he will have it.</hi> If God be pleaſed to reſtore and reform ſuch a people, whom doth he wrong? What Attribute or Word of his, doth he croſs or contradict? If then Gods power render him <hi>able</hi> to do it, may not his Soveraign Grace, and Mercy render him <hi>willing</hi> to do it? <hi>Once hath God ſpoken, twice have I heard this, that power belongeth unto God, alſo unto thee O Lord belongeth Mercy.</hi> Pſa. 62.11, 12.</p>
            <p n="3">3. God hath done ſo <hi>already</hi> for his Church and profeſſing P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Art thou not it that haſt dryed the Sea? therefore the ranſomed of the Lord ſhall return to Sion with ſinging.</hi> So 2 Cor. 1.10. <hi>Who delivered us from ſo great a death and doth deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: in whom we truſt, he will yet deliver.</hi> If God ſhould reſtore, reform and bleſs ſuch a degenerate and deſolate people, it would not be the <hi>firſt time.</hi> Though God may ſeem to have caſt off a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing people; yet he may chuſe them a <hi>ſecond time,</hi> it is no more than he hath done in the like caſe.

If therefore any of the race, do become holy and righteous, and do good again; we may conclude that they were created in Chriſt Jeſus to good works; for by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture they are dead in treſpaſſes and ſins.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To teach us, That it is a vile abuſe of Chriſt and his Goſpel, and the doctrine of the free grace of God, to make as if Chriſtians were thereby freed from the direction and authority of the Moral Law; or that the motives to Obedience to it were abated by the Goſpel. It is certain that Chriſt did not <hi>Obey</hi> the law, that we might have liberty to <hi>Break</hi> it; nor did he ſuffer that we might have liberty to violate it with impunity: but that we might be ſaved from the Curſe of the law, and from the dominion of ſin; and might be the Servants of God, and have our fruit unto holineſs, and the end everlaſting life. Although the law was never given to fallen man as a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant whereby he could be juſtifyed, yet doth it
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:000850_0050_0FABA2E61B5F7A10"/>
continue as a Rule of life. And the Lord Jeſus is ſo far from aboliſhing it, that <hi>he puts it into the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts of believers, and writes it in their hearts.</hi> Jer. 31.33. It was the error of the Jews in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles time, to think the law was given as a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works; by the keeping of which they might be juſtifyed, and have eternal life. Againſt this the Apoſtle argues, that the inheritance, was by <hi>Promiſe,</hi> and that God gave it to <hi>Abraham by promiſe,</hi> and the law which was given at Sinai 430 years after, could not diſanul it; and makes it an abſurd thing for any to think that righteouſneſs comes by the law, and if ſo ſaith he, <hi>then Chriſt is dead in vain.</hi> Gal. 2.21. Gal. 3.17, 18, 21. The Jews took the law in that ſence, as when <hi>Luther</hi> calls it <hi>Moſes Moſiſſimus,</hi> a ſtrict Covenant of works; but had loſt that ſence of it wherein <hi>Luther</hi> calls it <hi>Moſes Aaronicus.</hi> A darker diſpenſation of the Covenant of grace, a <hi>Schoolmaſter</hi> to bring them to Chriſt. The Apoſtle knew how to urge Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the moral law, and to lay men under ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to holineſs and righteouſneſs by its autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and motives; without urging a neceſſity of perfect and <hi>perſonal Obedience</hi> to it, in order to Juſtification, and eternal life. He could and did urge it, as a <hi>Rule</hi> of life, without making it a <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> of life, and rule whereby men could be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed. Acts 13.38, 39. <hi>Through this man is preached unto you the forgiveneſs of ſins, and by him all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live are justifyed from all things, from which you could
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:000850_0051_0FABA2E6B7A072B0"/>
not be juſtifyed by the law of Moſes.</hi> He could deny the law to juſtify: and yet not make Chriſt the Miniſter of ſin. He could preach the free grace of God; without caſting any blemiſh upon the law, or incouraging Sinners to continue in ſin, becauſe grace had abounded. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.1. Compared with the foregoing Chapter: and did maintain that <hi>the grace of God which bringeth Salvation</hi> agreeth with the law in this, <hi>it teacheth men to deny ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, and to live ſoberly, righteouſly and Godly in this preſent world.</hi> Titus 2.11, 12.</p>
               <p n="5">5. To teach us, That Chriſtians in the times of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> may and ought to make uſe of the Scriptures of the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> for their Inſtruction, Example &amp; Comfort. Although the Ceremonial law be totally aboliſht as to its <hi>Practice,</hi> yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as it typed out or prefigured Chriſt; his Graces, Actions, Sufferings and benefits, and was ſome way inſtructive about moral duties: the underſtanding of it is many ways uſeful to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; as might be ſhewed in <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. So <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. throughout. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.8, 9, 13, 14. The judicial law ſo far as it was <hi>local</hi> and <hi>peculiar to the Jews,</hi> binds not: yet ſo far as it was of <hi>moral Equity,</hi> it ought to be obſerved in Chriſtian States; and <hi>Caeteris paribus</hi> and <hi>Conſideratis Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randis,</hi> is of Excellent uſe to all <hi>Lawgivers</hi> and <hi>Judges</hi> to the end of the world: for that People were under a <hi>Theocraſy,</hi> and their <hi>judicial Laws</hi> were of <hi>divine legiſlation,</hi> for the moſt part. If any
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:000850_0052_0FABA2E7CA501748"/>
were otherwiſe, they had at leaſt <hi>divine approbation.</hi> The <hi>moral law</hi> is all of it of <hi>everlaſting equity</hi> and <hi>amiableneſs</hi> as we have ſhewed; as Holy, Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and Good, in <hi>Paul's</hi> time, as in <hi>Moſes's</hi> time. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.12. And in <hi>our times,</hi> as in <hi>Moſes's</hi> or <hi>Pauls. For till heaven and earth paſs, one jot or title of the law ſhall in no wiſe paſs,</hi> Math. 5.18. The <hi>Aſſemblies</hi> reflection on this text is,
<q>How much more need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful is this Doctrine when men would make <hi>all</hi> the law void, and not obligatory to believers.</q>
Its <hi>Hiſtorys</hi> are our <hi>Examples</hi>; either of <hi>imitation</hi> or <hi>caution.</hi> 1 Cor. 10. <hi>Now theſe things were our Examples,</hi> that is ſaith the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Annotations,
<q>God ſet the puniſhment of thoſe Iſraelites as a glaſs or image before us, that we in them might ſee what we may expect, if we ſin as they did.</q>
In the following verſes the Apoſtle dehorts from Idolatry, Fornication, Tempting Chriſt, and the ſin of Murmuring; from Examples of caution written of old; But, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>they were written for our Admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come.</hi> v.11 So <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.19 compared with <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.1. <hi>So we ſee that they could not enter in becauſe of unbelief.

We have alſo Examples of <hi>Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> taken out of the Old Teſtament, &amp; improv'd in the New. So in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.

Commanders, all famous for Exploits of Faith, Worſhip, and Obedience; are ſet before Chriſtians for <hi>Imitation.</hi> And the Apoſtle argues from them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1. That <hi>Cloud of Witneſſes</hi> are to be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Chriſtians, as the <hi>Cloud</hi> was followed by the Iſraelites in the Wilderneſs.

                  <hi>Propheſies</hi> in the Old Teſtament are of uſe to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; they help us in the belief of <hi>New-Teſtament Propheſies,</hi> many of them being already accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſht, others alſo of them agree with Thoſe in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and illuſtrate one another, as the Text and the interpretation. So alſo, 2 Pet. 3.13. <hi>We according to his promiſe look for New Heavens and a New Earth, wherein dwelleth Righteouſneſs:</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Propheſies in the Old Teſtament, that flouriſh in expreſſions, literally expreſſing temporal felicity; yet were intended as <hi>Prophetick Types</hi> of Spiritual Bleſſings under the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> And they had ſome kind of accompliſhment in Temporal Deliveran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Peace, Plenty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> before the Coming of Chriſt: but were more fully accompliſht in Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Redemption, and the Spiritual Priviledges, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits and Graces, Enjoy'd in the Churches of Chriſt. If we conſider what cognation there is between <hi>Hiſtory</hi> and <hi>Propheſy,</hi> it will not ſeem ſtrange. For <hi>Propheſie</hi> is Hiſtory <hi>antedated</hi>; and Hiſtory is <hi>Poſtdated Propheſie</hi>: the ſame thing is told in both. If therefore the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the Old Teſtament is <hi>Example</hi> to us, and inſtructive to us; ſo muſt needs be Propheſy. And many things in the Old Teſtament are firſt ſet forth in Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy; and afterward in Hiſtory; &amp; either of them, yea, both of them beneficial to the Church. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, Propheſies, for the moſt part, contain Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, or Threatnings in them. And therefore if Old-Teſtament <hi>Promiſes</hi> and <hi>Threatnings</hi> are of uſe,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:000850_0056_0FABA2EABAE5DD98"/>
and may be, by way of accommodation, appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us; ſo may the <hi>Propheſies</hi> alſo. I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted the larger on the foregoing head, not only to ſhow how genuine the Doctrines raiſed from the Text, are; and to ſtrengthen the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation on which I build the Superſtructure of the Application I further intend: but to vindicate the juſt Reputation of the Sacred Scriptures of the Old Teſtament, from the indignity done them by thoſe that ſpeak of them, as of things <hi>formerly</hi> uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but now antiquated and out of date: as alſo for the benefit of thoſe that eſteem them, by way of Direction, how to uſe them; that the Old and New-Teſtament, may be uſed by us as two breaſts of Sacred Conſolation, and we may ſuck and be ſatisfied out of both of them; and milk out and be delighted with the abundant Conſolations they afford. I conclude this Uſe with ſaying only this further, that to deny the fore-mentioned uſefulneſs of the Old-Teſtament Doctrine, Promiſes, Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings; Hiſtory and Propheſy, is to <hi>Apocrypha</hi> the <hi>Old</hi> Teſtament at once; and to confront the <hi>New,</hi> in a thouſand inſtances; and to charge <hi>Non ſequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur</hi> upon the Apoſtolical Argumentation.</p>

To teach us, That by how much more ſimilitude there is between the State &amp; Hiſtory or Circumſtances of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the State and Circumſtances of any <hi>Chriſtian people</hi> or Plantation; ſo much the more apt and eaſy will <hi>accommodations</hi> be, of Doctrinal, Hiſtorical, Promiſſory, Minato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:000850_0057_0FABA2EC6312F548"/>
and Prophetical Paſſages. This is ſelf evident: for where there is <hi>par ratio,</hi> where the reaſon is the ſame, the conſequence will be more evident; and the concluſion the more cogent. And if ſo, I conclude ſuch accommodations will be eaſy to <hi>New England</hi>; ſeeing there is ſuch conſiderable ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude and agreement in the circumſtances of both. Some of which circumſtances and inſtances of ſimilitude, I ſhall modeſtly propound, in hope that they will be as candidly taken, as they are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly intended.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt Planters of the Iſraelitiſh Vineyard, or the firſt Plants therein, were <hi>a noble Vine, a right Seed.</hi> Jer. 2.21. The twelve <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> were all Godly, and God led them like a flock by the hand of <hi>Moſes</hi> und <hi>Aaron. Iſrael</hi> was Holineſs to the Lord. So the firſt Undertakers, Planters; the Foundation men of <hi>New-England</hi> were <hi>Holineſs to the Lord</hi>; though not <hi>univerſally,</hi> yet <hi>generally</hi> ſo; This Land was planted with <hi>choice Vines</hi>; Men E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent in Piety, and Vertue; that Served God and their Generation, according to the Will of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The great End for which Iſrael went into the Wilderneſs, and the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> was that they might Worſhip God according to his own <hi>Inſtitution</hi> with more <hi>purity,</hi> and leſs <hi>peril,</hi> than they could do in the Countrey where they were. Exod. 8.1. <hi>Let my people go that they may Serve me. Exod.</hi> 8.27. <hi>We will go three days Journey into the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:000850_0058_0FABA2ECC477A958"/>
and Sacrifice to the Lord our God, as He ſhall command us.</hi> The firſt Text ſheweth they went out for the <hi>Worſhip</hi> of God, the ſecond ſhews it was for <hi>purity</hi> of Worſhip, according to Gods In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. See <hi>v.</hi> 26. of the ſame Chapter, and you will ſee it alſo to be, that they might ſo Worſhip God with more <hi>liberty</hi> and <hi>ſafety</hi> than where they were. For <hi>Pharaoh</hi> would have <hi>let them Sacrifice to their God in the Land:</hi> but <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid, <hi>It is not meet ſo to do,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Will they not Stone us?</hi> So then, that they might worſhip God purely, without giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing offence to others, or endangering themſelves; they were willing to go further a field. Even ſo was the Deſign of our Predeceſſors in coming more than three days Journey, <hi>viz.</hi> three thouſand miles into this Wilderneſs, that they might Serve God with pure Worſhip according to his own Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without offence to others; and with more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and ſafety to themſelves, than at that time could be had in their own Countrey. The World knows, that our Predeceſſors did not leave their Native Soil, that <hi>dulce ſolum Patriam,</hi> for better Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations in worldly reſpects; they did not come into the <hi>Wilderneſs</hi> for <hi>Worldlineſs</hi>; but for <hi>Godlineſs</hi> ſake: and that the firſt Rulers &amp; Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and Churches had the Glory of God, and the liberty and purity of his Worſhip in their Eye. And their Memory will be precious in Ages to come, notwithſtanding their Aſhes have been pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted, and that with an unuſual degree of Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence

               <p n="3">3. As the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> underwent many hazards &amp; hardſhips in that Enterprize, and had ſpecial aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, preſervation, proviſion and protection from the good Providence of God, that was very peculiar about them for good: So did the firſt Comers into <hi>New-England</hi> run many great risks, and grapple with many difficulties; both of Sea and Land (too many to enumerate) in all which, the good Providence of God was very circumſpect about them, in ſending ſuitable and ſeaſonable ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours and ſupplies. <hi>They cried to the Lord in their troubles, and he ſaved them out of their diſtreſſes</hi>; as the brief Hiſtories of <hi>New-Englands</hi> Affairs ſhow.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As God made room for the <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> Vine, and cauſed it to take root, and ſpread and flouriſh, <hi>ſo that its boughs went to the Sea, and its branches by the rivers, its Shade covered hills.</hi> Whilſt Religion and Righteouſneſs flouriſht among them, they were both numerous and proſperous. And ſo it was in <hi>New England</hi> in a good degree, God bleſſed them and cauſed them to multiply greatly. No Out-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, for the time, can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare with it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. As there grew declenſion and degeneration among that people, notwithſtanding all God had done for them, and notwithſtanding all done for maintaining and tranſmitting pure Religion to ſucceeding Generations: ſo hath it befallen <hi>New-England.</hi>
                  <pb n="48" facs="unknown:000850_0060_0FABA2EE1C37C528"/>
We may with grief and ſhame read over and meditate upon ſome Texts ſpoke of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi> as Hoſ. 4.7. <hi>as they were increaſed ſo they ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi> ſo Joſh. 2.7. <hi>The people Served the Lord all the days of Joſhua, and the Elders that out lived Joſhua,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>there aroſe another generation after them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which knew not the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. As they chang'd their ways from Good to Evil, and walkt contrary to God; ſo God chang'd his ways, from ways of Mercy, to ways of Afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion; and walkt contrary to them. And as was threatned, <hi>did them evil after that he had done them good.</hi> So hath it alſo been with us. As for our Degeneracy, it is too <hi>palpable</hi> to be denied; and too <hi>groſs</hi> to be excuſed. It calls for <hi>Lamentation, Humiliation,</hi> and <hi>Reformation,</hi> rather than proof and demonſtration; though that alſo be needful enough in order to the former. And the Servants of God have in this place, as well as in others, offered conviction of that, to which I refer you. As to Gods change of his Diſpenſations towards his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, from a way of Mercy, to a way of ſore Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction and Judgment, he is a very great ſtranger to the affairs of <hi>New England,</hi> or one that conſiders not the Operations of Gods Hand, that knoweth not this. <hi>Who knoweth not that our Fields which uſe to ſmell as the Fields which the Lord hath bleſſed, have of a long time been blaſted, that a Fruitful Land hath been turned into Barrenneſs.</hi> Inſtead of <hi>Plenty,</hi> we have had <hi>Scarcity</hi>; inſtead of <hi>Health, Sickneſs;</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead

It is an awful ſaying of Dr. <hi>Goodwin.</hi>

               <p>The firſt Danger demonſtrated.</p>
               <p n="1">1.

Although it may be all hath not been done by Magiſtrates, Miniſters, Churches and Synods, that ſhould have been done, to promote Reformation, and Stopping the progreſs of Impiety and Iniquity: yet one that did not know what hath been done by Courts, Synods, Miniſters and Churches, in a publick way, (beſides all private Prayers, Tears, Counſel, and Reproof) would not think one half hath been done, that hath; ſo little fruit of it appears.

               <p>The fore mentioned danger being found real, and impending, this cannot be otherwiſe.

To which I reply, I have no deſign to ſpeak di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minutively of the Sins of the Countrey; I do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge with grief, and ſhame, that they have been, and are very horrible; yet I think ſuch Sayings are not juſtifyable in any. Some well-meaning holy men, being of dark melancholly Spirits, and little acquainted with the advances that Atheiſm, Idolatry, Superſtition, Prophaneneſs, Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and Senſuality have made in other profeſſing parts of the World; are apt to <hi>think ſo,</hi> and in their indignation againſt ſin &amp; ſinners to <hi>ſay ſo.</hi> But the truth is, Though we have cauſe to abhor our ſelves for being ſo bad as we are; and to meditate all ways poſſible to grow better; yet it cannot with truth be aſſerted, that as yet we are as bad as bad can be; for there is real danger of growing worſe. There are other deſigning perſons, that are no great friends to holineſs and righteouſneſs, that are of a vulture Spirit, that fly haſtily over all the fair meadows and fields without eying of them; that they may pitch and prey upon ſome Carrion. Theſe find nothing but faults in the <hi>Government, Churches, Miniſters,</hi> and <hi>Good people</hi> of all ranks: &amp; Sport themſelves with the falls of here and there an Eminent Profeſſor; or the infirmities, &amp; real, or ſuppoſed miſtakes of men much better than themſelves; <hi>Theſe fools make a mock of ſin</hi>; and it ſerves their occaſion to blaſpheme all the Work of God in the Wilderneſs; and traduce for Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, all thoſe, that their evil example can't make

                     </gap>England</hi> may through the Grace of God, have a ſhare in the good things ſpoken of, that are to be fulfilled in the latter days. The proof of the Third Doctrine is pat to this purpoſe. If God can do ſuch thing, may do ſuch things, hath done ſuch things already, and will do ſuch things again for his Ancient People the <hi>Jews</hi>; and there be propheſies and promiſes, that God will do ſuch things; not only for the Jews, but for Chriſtian places that are in ruines, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-run with ſin &amp; miſery. Why ſhould we not hope and pray for the accompliſhment of them? Beſides the fore mentioned Reaſons, I ſhall offer to conſideration, three particulars more, which may animate faith &amp; prayer, &amp; remove impediments &amp; objections.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Reformation is propheſied of, as well as the Reſtauration and Benediction.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Reformation is promiſed, as well as the Reſtauration and Benediction.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That it is not abſolutely neceſſary, that the Reformation precede the Reſtauration.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="61" facs="unknown:000850_0073_0FABA2FF64D8A1E8"/>1. The Reformation is propheſied of as well as the Reſtauration, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now propheſie relates to what is <hi>future,</hi> and properly ſpeaks of <hi>Event,</hi> not <hi>Duty.</hi> If it ſpeaks of <hi>Duty,</hi> yet it ſpeaks of it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the notion of <hi>Event.</hi> Conſequently, if the Propheſie foretells Reformation, than which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more duty; yet it ſpeaketh of it under the notion of what ſhall certainly come to paſs. We muſt not therefore be diſcouraged from pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for it, becauſe we yet ſee not the Deſolate Countreys inhabited as formerly, and ſee not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion reviving and thriving in them as formerly. Were theſe things come to paſs, the propheſie were already fulfilled. But we muſt believe it fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, becauſe the Holy Ghoſt by the mouth of the Prophets hath foretold it. Perhaps ſome could eaſily believe the Reſtauration, if they could ſee the Reformation; but both muſt be believed to be future; though neither as yet be come to paſs: becauſe both are foretold.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Reformation is alſo promiſed. Many ſpeak as if only the Reſtauration and Benediction were promiſed; and look upon Reformation as the condition of the Promiſe. And becauſe they ſee not the condition fulfilled; cannot believe the Reſtaurations &amp; Bleſſings. When the truth is, the promiſe that is contained in Propheſy, <hi>as ſuch,</hi> is <hi>abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute</hi> &amp; not <hi>conditional</hi>: When promiſes are annexed as Sanctions to the Laws of Chriſt, they belong to the <hi>preceptive will of God,</hi> and ſo are conſidered as
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:000850_0074_0FABA3004F736220"/>
                  <hi>Conditions.</hi> But when Promiſes are infolded in Propheſies, they belong to <hi>Gods will of Purpoſe</hi>; &amp; therefore <hi>muſt come to paſs.</hi> For though Gods <hi>Commands</hi> are broken; yet his <hi>Counſels</hi> are not; they ſtand for ever, and the Thoughts of his heart to all generations. All ſuch promiſes therefore ought to be conſidered, as <hi>abſolute</hi>; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the <hi>Reformations will certainly come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. It is not abſolutely neceſſary that the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation precede the Reſtauration, or that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation be ſenſibly advanced before God begin to plead the cauſe of his people againſt their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and begin their Reſtauration: I readily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that in point of Duty, Reformation ought to precede, and all the Religion juſtice and reaſon in the world oblige thoſe that have made defection from <hi>God,</hi> and his pure ways; and are under dreadful effects of his diſpleaſure; <hi>ſhould be ſpeedy and thorough</hi> in their Repentance and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. But ſo deſperataly wicked is fallen man, that if God ſhould not <hi>begin</hi> with man, man would never <hi>begin</hi> with Him, <hi>Men are dead in treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes and ſins,</hi> and ſo <hi>cannot</hi>; or ſo habituated and inclined to evil, they <hi>will not</hi> return to God, till God is before hand with them. If God bring on Reformation upon the world that lieth in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; <hi>he is found of thoſe that ſeek him not</hi>; and if upon a deeply degenerate people, <hi>he stretcheth forth his hands to a gainſaying and rebellious people.</hi> And the Grace of God muſt be exerted in a <hi>victorious</hi>
                  <pb n="63" facs="unknown:000850_0075_0FABA300DBDA4790"/>
and <hi>irreſiſtible</hi> way, before Reformation can: ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, either in the <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>World.</hi> Seeing then both Reſtauration and Reformation depend upon the good pleaſure of God, it is in vain for us to determine which <hi>ſhall</hi> precede; though we know in point of mans <hi>duty,</hi> which <hi>ſhould</hi> be firſt: That which we affirm is, that we ought not to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged in praying for theſe Reſtaurations, or believing they ſhall come to paſs, till we ſee Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation in good forwardneſs; but to hope and pray for the accompliſhment of all propheſied to be done in a way of <hi>Soveraign grace</hi> for the <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>World</hi> in the latter days. If the Reſtaurations depended on the <hi>Antecedency</hi> of Reformation, and Reformation depended upon mans <hi>free will,</hi> it would be long enough before either would come to paſs. But God having foretold &amp; promiſed both, our dependence ought to be on his <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Power.</hi> If <hi>God can make Children to Abraham of the Stones of the Street,</hi> and make a Church to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf out of the <hi>forlorn Gentiles.</hi> When the <hi>boughs of the natural Olive were broke off,</hi> God could <hi>graft in Gentiles, wild Olives</hi> into the <hi>ſame, ſtock,</hi> &amp; therefore cannot be at a loſs <hi>to graft in the natural branch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</hi> Iſa. 44.2, 3, 4, 5. <hi>Fear not Jacob, for I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground, I will pour my Spirit on thy ſeed &amp; my bleſſing on thine offspring.</hi> The ruinous circumſtances of <hi>Jews</hi> and many <hi>Gentile places</hi> are ſuch, as to <hi>Sin</hi> &amp; <hi>Miſery,</hi> that there is little hope; either of Reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration

or Reformation; were it not for the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſy</hi> and the <hi>Promiſe.</hi> But becauſe of the <hi>Propheſie</hi> and <hi>Promiſe,</hi> we muſt <hi>againſt hope believe in hope,</hi> and though they and their circumſtances promiſe <hi>little</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet God in his word hath promiſed <hi>much.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhould <hi>hope for much,</hi> and <hi>pray for much,</hi> though there ſhould be as little ſign of <hi>Reformation</hi> as there was of <hi>Rain,</hi> in the days of <hi>Elias,</hi> when it had not Rain'd in 1260 <hi>days</hi>: yet they that can <hi>believe</hi> and <hi>pray like Elias,</hi> will in the word of God hear the <hi>ſound of abundance of rain</hi>; they will <hi>look out ſeven times,</hi> and pray, and pray again; though there ſhould not appear ſo much as <hi>a Cloud as big as a mans hand:</hi> believing on and praying to the Lord, till <hi>he ſend Rain on the earth, till he come &amp; rain down righteouſneſs</hi> on <hi>Aſia, Africa, Europe</hi> and <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica</hi>; and the Elect come from all parts, and Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the World; from <hi>Eaſt, Weſt, North</hi> &amp; <hi>South,</hi> and <hi>Sit down in the Kingdom of God.</hi> He that hath promiſed theſe things, cauſeth <hi>His Sun to riſe on the evil and on the good, and his rain to fall on the juſt &amp; on the unjuſt,</hi> in a way of <hi>common</hi> bounty and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and he doth no leſs towards the Elect in a way of <hi>ſpecial</hi> Grace. And when the time of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation is come, he will cauſe the <hi>Sun of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi> to ſhine upon the evil and upon the good, and the <hi>Rain of Righteouſneſs</hi> to fall upon the juſt &amp; upon die unjuſt; and then <hi>bad</hi> men will become <hi>good</hi>; and good men will become <hi>better:</hi> and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration and Reformation will ſtruggle like twins

And I am perſwaded, one great reaſon why good mens faith is ſo <hi>wavering,</hi> and their prayers ſo <hi>few,</hi> and no more <hi>fervent</hi>; is becauſe they take it for granted, that Reformation muſt needs conſiderably, out-run Reſtauration.

this) in his Preface to the New Teſtament, in the ſeparate Edition, alloweth the <hi>Americans</hi> to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended of <hi>Noah</hi>; but by <hi>Cham</hi>: and thence ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that they ſhall not be gathered into the Church. To which I reply (1) That it is wholly begg'd that they are the Progeny of <hi>Cham:</hi> and notable Reaſons and Authorities may be produced to the contrary. (2) That if it were certain it were ſo; yet the Conſequence is no way valid: as the Multitude of Churches that have been in <hi>Africa</hi> ſhew; that were undoubtedly, the Poſterity of <hi>Cham.</hi> (3) This opinion is wholly founded, and the ſtreſs of it depends upon a doubtful Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of a dark Propheſie, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.27. <hi>God ſhall enlarge Japheth</hi>: So our Verſion reads it. But if <hi>Cham</hi> with his four Sons hath filled all <hi>Africa,</hi> with a conſiderable part of <hi>Aſia</hi>; and poſſeſs all <hi>America</hi> beſides: he is certainly <hi>enlarged</hi> more than <hi>Japheth</hi> with his Seven Sons; and would vie for Number, with <hi>Shem</hi> &amp; <hi>Japheth</hi> too. If we prefer the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Reading; <hi>God ſhall Perſwade Japheth, and he ſhall dwell in the tents of Shem,</hi> this would not gain the point intended: for the not mentioning of <hi>Cham,</hi> doth not neceſſarily exclude <hi>Cham,</hi> no more than when <hi>Shem</hi> is called the Brother of <hi>Japheth, Cham</hi> is denyed to be the Brother of <hi>Japheth</hi>; or <hi>Shem</hi> denyed to be the Brother of <hi>Cham.</hi> Beſides, Interpreters of great Note go other ways. The <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors gathered from this Propheſie, that they ſhould ſpeak <hi>Japheth's</hi> Tongue; which in the

As the <hi>Reubenites</hi> are ſaid to dwell in the <hi>Hagarites</hi> tents, after the <hi>Hagarites</hi> were ſubdued and fallen. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 5.10. Others read the words, <hi>God ſhall enlarge Japheth, and He,</hi> that is, <hi>God ſhall dwell in the tents of Shem,</hi> in the ſence of <hi>John</hi> 1.14 And ſo make it a famous Propheſie of the <hi>Incarnation</hi> of the Son of God; his taking Fleſh of the ſeed of <hi>Shem.</hi> Others underſtand it of God's ſetting up the <hi>Temple,</hi> and dwelling in it among the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> deſcended of <hi>Shem.</hi> Certainly it is not reaſonable to draw ſo hard a Concluſion on ſuch a Text, that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of ſuch and ſo many various Interpretations: Seeing it tends to diſcourage all Endeavours for the Converſion of the <hi>Indians</hi>; and ſo may greatly prejudice the Souls of Millions of Men, and hinder the inlargement of the Kingdom of Chriſt.

Aſſoon as they ſhall hear of me, they ſhall obey me.</hi> It cannot be, literally, more verified of any, than of the <hi>American</hi> Nations. Chriſt <hi>as God,</hi> knew all Nations: but, <hi>as Man,</hi> He did not. He, <hi>as Man,</hi> had ſeen and known <hi>Aſians, Europeans,</hi> &amp; <hi>Africans.</hi> This cannot be doubted, if you conſider the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of <hi>Jews</hi> and Proſelytes, that was annually at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> at the Feaſt of Pentecoſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.5, 10, 11.

            <p>At <hi>Natick,</hi> we find a ſmall Church conſiſting of ſeven Men and three Women: their Paſtor (ordained by that Reverend and holy man of God Mr. <hi>JOHN ELIOT,</hi> deceaſed) is <hi>Daniel Tokkohwompait,</hi> and is a perſon of good knowledge. Here are fifty nine men and fifty one women, and ſeventy children under ſixteen years of age: their numbers being increaſed by the Acceſſions of diverſe families formerly belonging to <hi>Haſſinnamiſco.</hi> We find no School-maſter here, the want whereof has had a very evil influence into the non proficiency of their children, in thoſe wayes of Education which formerly obtain'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, there being but one child that can read here.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Haſſinnamiſco,</hi> are five families, unto whom <hi>James Printer,</hi> ſtands related as a Teacher: many families belonging unto this Plantation (which before the Wars was very flouriſhing, and had a hopeful Church in it) are removed from thence, ſome to <hi>Natick,</hi> and ſome to other places in hopes of greater ſecurity.</p>

            <p>We have been credibly informed of a great Mortality among the <hi>Indians</hi> within theſe few years paſt, whereby ſome flouriſhing Plantations of them have been almoſt depopulated, and in particular the famous and numerous <hi>Indian</hi> Church at the Iſland of <hi>Chaubaqueduck</hi> is wholly deſtroyed, but one of them ſurviving; and other Plantations exceedingly thinned.</p>
