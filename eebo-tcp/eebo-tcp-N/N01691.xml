            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WE find, <hi>v.</hi> 13. that when <hi>Paul</hi> had Preach'd at <hi>Berea,</hi> there came wicked Jews from <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonica,</hi> and ſo ſtir'd up the People, that 'twas dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous for him to ſtay any longer there. Where upon, leaving <hi>Silas</hi> and <hi>Timotheus</hi> behind him, <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf came to <hi>Athens, v.</hi> 14, 15. And our Text tells us, that while <hi>Paul</hi> waited at <hi>Athens</hi> for the two Perſons
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:002006_0003_0FBA802E557EBF20"/>thus left behind; <hi>His ſpirit was stirred in him, when he ſaw the City wholly given to Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.</hi> The City was wholly <hi>given to Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> to the <hi>Worſhipping of Idols;</hi> this was a groſs, abominable Crime, highly provoking to GOD, and hurtful to their own Souls. And when the holy Apoſtle ſaw, obſerv'd, conſider'd, this plain, this great and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handed wickedneſs; then his <hi>Spirit,</hi> his Heart <hi>was ſtirred in him.

He was put into an holy flame, a <hi>Paroxiſm</hi> of fervent zeal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the flagrant wickedneſs he beheld. It was the commendation of the Angel of the Church of <hi>Epheſus, That he could not bear that which was evil,</hi> Rev. 2.2. So, this holy Apoſtle of Chriſt, this New-born, Heaven born Soul, could not behold the groſs crimes of others; without being fired with an holy diſlike of, Zeal and Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation againſt, the ſame.

We ſhall never duely abhor Sin in others, if we don't heartily hate and loath it in our ſelves. Deepeſt Self abaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and holy ſhame, well becomes us for our own Sins. The beſt of Saints have expreſs'd great Self abaſement for Sin. <hi>Abraham</hi> call'd himſelf, <hi>Dust and Aſhes,</hi> Gen. 18.27. <hi>Job</hi> ſaid (Chap. 42.6.) <hi>I ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor my ſelf, and repent in duſt and aſhes.</hi> The Pſalmiſt ſaid, Pſal. 73.22. <hi>So fooliſh was I, and ignorant; I was as a beast before thee. Agur</hi> ſaid, Prov. 30.2. <hi>Surely I am more brutiſh than any man.</hi> The holy <hi>Prophet</hi> ſaid, Iſai. 6.5. <hi>I am a man of unclean lips.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> who was ſo zealouſly mov'd againſt the groſs crimes of others, had very Self-abaſing thoughts for his own Sins; calling himſelf <hi>the chief of Sinners</hi> (1 Tim. 1.15) <hi>Leſs than the leaſt of all ſaints,</hi>

The ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, ſharpeſt reſentments, ſhould be againſt our own Sins.

It's part of the Character of a true Practical Saint, to <hi>Contemn a vile perſon,</hi> as well as <hi>Honour them that fear the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 15.4. Holy <hi>David</hi> very fully and plainly ſaid, <hi>I hate the work of them that turn aſide, it ſhall not cleave to me. A froward heart ſhall depart from me; I will not know a wicked perſon.

This plainly ſhows, that he was not for prefering and honouring the Vicious, but for diſcountenancing of them; and for prefering and imploying the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and Faithful. And thus it ſhould be with us, according to the various Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Capacities God has ſet us in.

                     <item>6. <hi>We ſhould plainly give in Teſtimony againſt the Sins of others, as there is occaſion for it.</hi> There are caſes, wherein Perſons not only <hi>may</hi> but <hi>ſhould</hi> bear witneſs againſt wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, for the Puniſhing of it and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting Impending Evils, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.7. How common is it when Perſons are Vicious and Scandalous, to tell of their faults be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind their backs, to ſpread their ill ſame; but if any ſtrict Search is made to have their faults puniſhed, then thoſe who can teſtifie to convict them, will ſhrink, bite in their words it may be; and ſay, <hi>They don't care to have ſtrife with their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, nor witneſs against them, nor get the all will of them;</hi> Alas, how often is it thus? So that from a baſe ſinful Cowardice, wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs often prevails Unpuniſhed, God is diſhonoured, Religion ſuffers, the Devil is gratified, the guilty unſpeakably Injured, and the Publick greatly endanger'd by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exposed to Gods Judgments. Becauſe ſome wont be ſo bold againſt the Devil's Kingdom and Intereſt, as to bear witneſs againſt known wickedneſs when they might and ought to do it; therefore they're deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chargeable with the evils now menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd, <hi>God's being diſhonour'd, Religion ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering,</hi>

For Chriſt ſays, Mat. 12.30. <hi>He that is not with me is againſt me: and he that gathereth not with me, ſeattereth abroad.</hi> We ſhould love Chriſt, His Cauſe, Honour, Intereſt above all our neareſt Neighbours, Friends, Relatives, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintaince whatſoever.

The cauſe of Chriſt and Piety, ſhould be dearer to us than the love or friendſhip of any Perſon or Perſons whatſoever. In this ſenſe our Saviour ſaid, Luk, 14.26. <hi>If any man come to me, and hate not his Father, and Mother, and Wife and Children, and Brethren and Siſters; yea and his own life alſo, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be my Diſciple.</hi> We ſhould not Scruple therefore, when we can, and are call'd to it, to bear plain Teſtimony againſt groſs wickedneſs, that it may be puniſhed. Nay it may be our duty in many caſes, where we can prove the groſs crimes of <hi>Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Profane Swearing, Sabbath breaking,</hi> and the like; and Perſons wont be mended by more private and gentle Methods; <hi>to go on purpoſe to Inform againſt them, that they may</hi>

                     <item>7. <hi>We ſhould avoid as much as may be, the needleſs Society or Company of Scandalous Sinners.</hi> Sometimes indeed it may be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be with them, to reprove them. Sometimes poſſibly we may have neceſſary buſineſs with them, or unavoidably fall into their Company; ſo that we muſt even <hi>Go out of the world</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſays, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10.) if we would Intirely and Continually avoid their Company. But my meaning is, we ſhould not <hi>Need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsly</hi> accompany with Scandalous Sinners; eve ſhould not chuſe their Company, nor freely aſſociate with them; not allow them to be our uſual Companions, but ſhould ſhun their Company for their wickedneſs.

Then let us not put ſo much honour and reſpect upon 'em, as to let 'em frequent our Company. Eph. 5.11. <hi>Have no fellowſhip with the unfruitful works of darkneſs, but rather reprove them.</hi> Prov. 22.24, 25. <hi>Make no friendſhip with an angry man; and with a furious man thou ſhalt not go; lest thou learn his ways, and get a ſnare to thy ſoul.</hi> The Apoſtle ſays, 1 Cor. 5.9. <hi>I wrote unto you in an Epiſtle, not to company with Fornicators.</hi> 2 Theſ. 3.14. <hi>If

It's truly a bad mark on any Perſon, when he loves and frequents looſe, vain, idle, wicked Company. How eaſy is it to gueſs, what Perſons are by obſerving the company they keep? As, <hi>He that walks with the wiſe, ſhall be wiſe;</hi> ſo, <hi>a companion of fools ſhall be destroyed,</hi> Prov. 13.20. It's part of the bleſſed Man's Character, Pſal. 1.1.

As we our ſelves ſhould avoid the company of ſuch, ſo we ſhould warn others to do ſo too. <hi>My ſon, if ſinners intice thee, conſent thou not — walk not thou in the way with them, refrain thy foot from their path,</hi> Prov. 1.10,

                  <hi>for the destruction of their fleſh, that their ſpirit may be ſaved in the day of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.5. Miniſters alſo in their <hi>Preaching,</hi> ſhould plainly lay open and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the wickedneſs of Men. <hi>Cry aloud and ſpare not, lift up thy voice like a trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, and ſhew my people their, tranſgreſſion, and the houſe of Jacob their ſins,</hi> Iſai. 58.1. They ſhould plainly Preach againſt all Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs and Ungodlineſs of Men; laying open and condemning their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Luſts of <hi>Drunkenneſs, Profaneneſs, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c. Faithfully denouncing the threatenings and terrors of God againſt them. This they ſhould do with great plainneſs, boldneſs and fervent zeal; as well as Preach the moſt Precious, Inviting, Melting Promiſes, to thoſe that will Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitently Truſt in Chriſt. Thus Miniſters ſhould do, tho' probably when they touch Men to the quick, gall their guilty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, lay open and condemn their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Luſts and darkling Sins; the Mouths of the wicked will be open againſt them, laying ſome cauſeleſs charge or other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. I ſuppoſe 'tis ſeldom if ever known, but that if Miniſters are faithful in their Office, teſtifying againſt Sin; they meet with laſhes and reproaches from ſome vile Tongues or other. Thus it was with the holy <hi>Prophets</hi> of old, <hi>All manner of evil was ſpoken againſt them falſely, for Chriſt's ſake,</hi> Mat. 5.11, 12. For <hi>Chriſt's ſake,</hi> for
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:002006_0019_0FBA8052A14F4860"/>plainly Preaching His Truths, Inclcating His Precepts; and teſtifying againſt and condemning, thoſe Vicious Practices which were contrary to His Laws, and provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in His ſight. However, Miniſters ought to be faithful to God, and to Souls, in plainly Preaching againſt all manner of known wickedneſs.</p>
               <p>So, <hi>Civil Rulers</hi> who bear the Sword of Juſtice, ſhould not let it ruſt in their hands; but Imploy it againſt the wicked. They ſhould <hi>cut off the horns of the wicked,</hi> (Pſal. 75.10.) <hi>break their jaws, and pluck the ſpoil out of their teeth,</hi> Job 29.17. They ſhould be a <hi>terror to evil works,</hi> make the wicked <hi>afraid;</hi> they ſhould <hi>not kold the ſword in vain,</hi> but as <hi>Revengers</hi> appointed by God, they ſhould <hi>execute wrath on him that doth evil,</hi> Rom. 13.3, 4. As the Power of <hi>Civil Rulers</hi> (whether for <hi>Making</hi> or <hi>Executing</hi> Laws) is betruſted with them by God, ſo it ſhould be Imployed for God. It ſhould be faithfully and impartially exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to Incourage all manner of Vertue and Goodneſs; and to Diſcourage all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Vice and Wickedneſs, in all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons High and Low Rich and Poor.</p>
               <p>Theſe are ſome of the ways and methods, wherein thoſe who truly fear God: ſhould manifeſt their reſentment and diſlike of,

               <p>But poſſibly 'twill be objected,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Men wont bear ſuch plain dealing.</hi> Men wont bear to be thus plainly told of, reprov'd and teſtifyed againſt, for their Sins: they wont bear that Perſons ſhould be fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warn'd their Company, becauſe of their wickedneſs; they'll be diſpleas'd and angry to be thus dealt with.</p>
               <p>I reply, <hi>We bad better ſuffer Mens diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure for doing of Duty, than Gods diſpleaſure for neglecting it.</hi> If we ſhow our diſlike of Mens Sins, according as God directs and requires, we ſhall but diſpleaſe Men in it; but if we neglect to do what God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of us, we ſhall then diſpleaſe and provoke the Great GOD Himſelf, even the Infinitely Holy and Jealous GOD. And whom ſhall we pleaſe, GOD or Men? Whoſe favour is moſt to be valu'd and deſit'd; that of GOD or of Men? Can't every Chriſtian anſwer this caſe? The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid, Acts 5.29. <hi>We ought to obey God rather than men.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, Rom. 15.2. <hi>Let every one pleaſe his neighbour for his good, to edification.</hi> We ſhould no further pleaſe 'em, than will be for their good and edification; therefore not pleaſe them, by Incouraging or Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:002006_0021_0FBA805708F1D350"/>them in known wickedneſs, for this is unſpeakably to their hurt and damage. Gal. 1.10. <hi>If I yet pleaſed men</hi> (that is, in oppoſition to God and His Intereſt) <hi>I ſhould not be the ſervant of Chriſt.</hi> I Theſ. 2.4. <hi>Even ſo ſpeak we, not as pleaſing men, but God which trieth our hearts.</hi> Our great Study and Care ſhould be, to pleaſe God, to approve our Hearts and Conſciences to Him; tho' Men ſhould be never ſo much diſpleas'd and provok'd with our doing ſo. We ſhould ſhow a ſervent Zeal, an holy boldneſs for God, for His Truths, Ways, Cauſe and Intereſt; tho' Men fret, fume and rage never ſo much againſt us. When the wicked Jews did <hi>Contradict</hi> and <hi>Blaſpheme,</hi> this did but raiſe the holy cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas;</hi> it's ſaid, <hi>They waxed bold,</hi> Acts 13 45, 46.</p>
               <p>Poſſibly 'twill be objected,</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>This is the way to make Parties and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions among Men.</hi> To be thus plain in teſtifying againſt the Sins, and avoiding the Company of the Vicious and Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous; what is this but to promote Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Diviſions?</p>
               <p>I reply, <hi>This tends indeed to promote Chriſt's Party and Intereſt, and to ſuppreſs the Devils; and we can't do too much in theſe things.</hi> There are but <hi>Two great Parties</hi> in the World,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:002006_0022_0FBA80598231B8C8"/>that of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and that of the <hi>Devil.

And ſhall we not plainly ſhow by our profeſſion and practice, whoſe Party we are of, whoſe ſide we belong to? As ever we would be of Chriſt's Party, appear among His Sheep, at His right hand in the Great Day; let us now be, and act, as becomes His faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful followers. We ſhould not be aſham'd of, but ſhould own, Chriſt before Men; we ſhould openly profeſs His Name and Truths, and walk in His Ways; ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt and obhor thoſe works of the Devil which He came to doſtroy: We ſhould plainly ſhow our obhorrence of damnable Errors and Hereſies, and Scandalous Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moralities; tho' Satan's Party, the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Truth and Holineſs are never ſo much diſpleas'd and provok'd at it. Let the World plainly know, that we are of Chriſt's Party, willing to endure hardneſs, as His good Souldiers, to fight the good fight of faith under Him the Captain of our Salvation; that we are friends and favourers of all Vertue and Holineſs, and enemies of all Hereſy and Wickedneſs. <hi>What fellowſhip hath righteouſneſs with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs? And what communion hath light with darkneſs? And what concord hath Chriſt with Belial?—Come out from among them, and be ye ſeparate, ſaith the Lord, and</hi>

                  <hi>touch not the unclean thing, and I will receive you,</hi> 2 Cor. 6.14, 15, 17. We ſhould ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate as much as poſſibly from all known wickedneſs, from all appearance of Evil, from the Garments ſpotted with the fleſh; and from all needleſs familiar Society with the Vicious and Scandalous; as ever we expect that God ſhould recieve, bleſs and ſave us. <hi>Without Holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord,</hi> Hob. 12.14. Let us not fear therefore, to ſhow our fervent Zeal againſt known Scandalous wickedneſs. The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of groſs abominable wickedneſs, kindl'd a fire of holy Zeal in <hi>Phineas;</hi> he ſhow'd his Zeal againſt Sin, not fearing any Party that might be rais'd againſt him, <hi>Numb.</hi> 25.6-11. When <hi>Moſes</hi> beheld the <hi>Golden Calf,</hi> that Inſtrument of <hi>Curſed Idolatry</hi> (like <hi>Paul</hi> in our Text, his Spirit was ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in him) his <hi>anger waxed hot,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>Who is on the Lords ſide?</hi> Exod. 32.19, 26. He ſhew'd his holy anger againſt the Peoples great wickedneſs, ſtir'd up many to execute Vengeance for it; not fearing what Parties ſhould be rais'd againſt him for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo. Prov. 29.25. <hi>The fear of man bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a ſnare; but whoſo putteth his truſt in the Lord, ſhall be ſafe.</hi> If we are on the Lord's ſide (and wo be to us if we are not) let it appear by our Profeſſing His Truths, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in His Wayes, obeying His Commands, teſtifying againſt the things that evidently provoke Him; let us do thus, how much
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:002006_0024_0FBA8061B7BB5D50"/>ſoever any may be provok'd with us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for. Gal. 4.18. <hi>It is good to be zealouſly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected always, in a good thing.</hi> We need not fear Parties or Diviſions, if our zeal be according to knowledge, and only for good and againſt wicked things; and if we walk in Simplicity and godly Sincerity. Rom. 8.31. <hi>If God be for us, who can be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us?</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 13, 17. <hi>Who is be that will barm you, if ye be followers of that which is good?—For it is better, if the will of God be ſo, that ye ſuffer for well doing, than for evil doing.</hi> It is better, ſafer, more honourable to be on Gods ſide (and ſo have Him on ours) tho' all Men were againſt us; than to have all Creatures on our ſide, and to have GOD againſt us.</p>
               <p>But we may now proceed to the next Inquiry, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>Why ſhould we thus manifeſt our diſlike of, and zealous Indignation againſt, the plain, notorious Sins of others?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. 1. <hi>Becauſe they provoke God and gratify the Devil.</hi> They provoke God, they are a practical trampling on His Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, a deſpiſing of His Laws and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, an affront to His Infinite Majeſty. <hi>Sin</hi> is the <hi>abominable thing that God hates, it provokes him to wrath,</hi> Jer. 44.4, 8. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we ſhould be highly diſpleas'd with
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:002006_0025_0FBA8063D22468C0"/>thoſe things, which are thus highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking to the Infinitely Holy and Glorious GOD. And thoſe things which are thus offenſive and provoking to GOD, are pleaſing and gratifying to the Devil. <hi>He that committeth ſin, is of the Devil,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.8. The Devil is an enemy of all righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, he works in the Children of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience (prompting them to their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience) all Sin is pleaſing to him: and the more vile and wicked Men are, ſo much the more the Devil is pleas'd and gratify'd. Well, we ſhould abhor and renounce the Devil and all his works (<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e ſhould <hi>abhor that which is evil,</hi> Rom. 12.9.) and ſhow our utmoſt abhorrence of, and diſpleaſure againſt, thoſe things which promote his helliſh Intereſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Becauſe they Injure the Souls of thoſe that are guilty of them.</hi> God ſays, Prov. 8.36. <hi>He that ſinneth againſt me, wrongeth his own ſoul,</hi> When perſons are <hi>Proſane, Unclean, Intemperate, falſe in their Words, Unrighteous</hi> in their <hi>Practices;</hi> What are they doing? Why they are <hi>wronging their own Souls,</hi> cutting, wounding, dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming their Precious Immortal Souls; that is, they are Increaſing their loads of guilt, Incenſing Divine Vengeance againſt them, heaping up wrath againſt the day of wrath, and ſo preparing for greater Plagues and Miſeries in the Eternal World, in the End<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:002006_0026_0FBA80654CA7BF00"/>Torments of Hell, if ſpeedy Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance prevent not. Surely, we ſhould be griev'd for ſuch things as theſe, ſhow our utmoſt diſlike of them. For we ſhould <hi>Love our Nighbours as our ſelves;</hi> and how can we do this, without ſhowing out ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt diſlike of what's moſt evidently and extreamly Injurious to them? Would it not grieve our very hearts, to ſee a <hi>Diſtracted Perſon</hi> cutting, wounding, grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly hurting himſelf? Ought we not to do what we could, to prevent his thus Injuring of himſelf? Then how much more ſhould we be griev'd, for what's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakably Injurious to the Precious Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Souls of Men; and how greatly ſhould we be concern'd to prevent their ruine? Where's our Love to our endangered Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, if we don't do what we can to turn him from the error of his ways, and ſo to prevent the Eternal ruine of his Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Immortal Soul?</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Becauſe they tend to pull down Publick Judgments.</hi> Prov. 14.34. <hi>Righteouſneſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alteth a Nation, but ſin is a reproach to any people.</hi> Rom. 1.18. The wrath of God is reveal'd <hi>from heaven, againſt all ungodlineſs and unrighteouſneſs of men.</hi> The more Sin abounds in any Place, or among any People, ſo much the more God is provoked, and ſo much the more likely it is, that His Judgments will ſoon be poured down
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:002006_0027_0FBA8066C404EA58"/>upon them. Jer. 5.25.—<hi>Your Iniquities have withholden good things from you.</hi> Iſai. 42.24. <hi>Who gave Jacob for a Spoil, and Iſrael to the Robbers? Did not the Lord, he againſt whom we have ſinned? For they would not walk in his way;, neither were they obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient unto his law.</hi> Thoſe therefore who <hi>Love their Country,</hi> and deſire the wellfare of it; ſhould do all they lawfully may, to diſcountenance and ſuppreſs wickedneſs; that ſo the Judgments of God may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, and His needful Mercies be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd and continu'd.</p>
               <p>But we may now proceed to ſome brief APPLICATION, and from what we have heard, we may Infer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>We ſhould be deeply humbled, that we have not had more becoming Reſentments and Abhorrence of Sin, in our Selves and Others.</hi> How much of Sin has there been in us, and how little grief and ſhame for it, how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle anger and oppoſition againſt it? How apt have we been, to cheriſh God's Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies (our curſed Luſts) in our own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomes? We ſhould be aſhamed, abaſed, deeply humbled, that we have had no more quick, lively reſentments and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Sin in <hi>our Selves.</hi> And as for <hi>Others,</hi> have we not often ſeen and heard of, much wickedneſs in them; and yet been little or nothing mov'd and griev'd
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:002006_0028_0FBA8069249D8900"/>at it? How vile was this! What, to ſee God diſhonoured, our Neighbour In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured, the Publick endangered, the Devil gratified; and not to ſhow our greateſt grief, diſlike and abhorrence! This is vile indeed, and calls for deep humiliation in us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Great blame is juſtly due to ſundry Sorts of Perſons.</hi> If we ſhould manifeſt our great diſlike and abherrence of the groſs Sins of Others, then great blame belongs,
<list>
                     <item>(1.) <hi>To thoſe who allow themſelves in groſs Scandalous Evils.</hi> Their works ſhow them to be rebels againſt God, to be Enemies of the croſs of Chriſt; becauſe they live in thoſe vile Practices, which Chriſt died to Save Men from. If we ſhould abhor vile Practices in <hi>Others,</hi> then ſurely we ſhould avoid them <hi>our Selves,</hi> elſe we ſhall be utterly Inexcuſable.
<p>Great blame belongs,</p>
                     </item>
                     <item>(2.) <hi>To thoſe who prompt and move Others to do wickedly.</hi> Satan is emphatically cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>The Tempter</hi> (Mat 4.3.) and thoſe. Men and Women are his <hi>Agents and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Officers,</hi> as it were, who tempt and ſollicit Perſons to do wickedly Some. Perſons will tempt and move Others, to <hi>leave their work,</hi> their proper <hi>buſineſs;</hi> to
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:002006_0029_0FBA806A82FEAD88"/>go a <hi>Tipling, Idling, Gaming, Frolicking,</hi> &amp;c. Such <hi>Tempters</hi> are the <hi>Miſſionaries of Hell;</hi> they are promoting Satan's Intereſt, and the ruine of Precious Souls. We juſtly condemn thoſe, who <hi>Ald</hi> and <hi>Supply Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Enemies, Pirates, Robbers,</hi> and ſuch as promote the Publick damage. Surely then, we ſhould be offended with thoſe who tempt others to Vicious Practices; for they promote Treaſon and Rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt GOD: they promote the Devil's Intereſt, and the mine of Souls. Great ſhame and blame, belong to ſuch Tempters to wickedneſs. If we ſhould abominate Sin in Others, then thoſe muſt needs be abominable who tempt Others to do wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly.
<p>Great blame belongs,</p>
                     </item>
                     <item>(3.) <hi>To thoſe who connive at, and delight in the Sins of Others.</hi> Poſſibly ſome vill willingly wink and connive at, thoſe Sins of Others, whether <hi>Children, Servants,</hi> or <hi>Neighbours;</hi> which they ſhould ſervently abhor and teſtifie againſt. It may be they'll ſay little or nothing againſt them; take little or no pains to have the guilty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonned. Such connivance is abominable, hereby Perſons become ſharers and partners as it were, in Treaſon and Rebellion againſt GOD They connive at what's provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to GOD, and ſhould be abhor'd and
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:002006_0030_0FBA806CAB7D5CA0"/>teſtify'd againſt by them. <hi>Civil Rulers</hi> ſhould <hi>puniſh evil doers,</hi> (Rom. 13.3.4.) and <hi>put them to ſhame,</hi> (Judg. 18.7.) but if they connive at their grofs Crimes, and ſuffer em to go Unpuniſhed; they ſo far become Partners in the guilt of them <hi>Ministers</hi> ſhould Preach againſt Mens No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious wickedneſs, and warn them to Repent and Reform; but if they are <hi>Dumb Dogs</hi> (Iſai. 56.10.) and <hi>Dawb with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered mortar,</hi> (Ezek. 13.10, 11.) and <hi>don't warn the wicked from their ways;</hi> then they become guilty of the blood of Souls, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.8. It's Indeed very dangerous to connive at the Notorious Sins of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. nay ſome not only <hi>Connive</hi> at the Sins of Others, when they ſhould zealouſly appear againſt them; but alſo take <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and Delight</hi> in their accurſed Crimes. They take Pleaſure in wickedneſs, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in thoſe things whereby GOD is diſhonoured, the Devil gratifyed, the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Souls of Men unſpeakably Injured, and the Publick greatly endangered. This is an aggravated evil. How greatly are ſome pleas'd with the <hi>Profaneneſs, Drunkenneſs, Uncleanneſs,</hi> and <hi>various Sorts of Wickedneſs</hi> practiſed by Others? It's mention'd as a <hi>high aggravation</hi> of wickedneſs in the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then;</hi> that they not only <hi>did thoſe things which were worthy of death,</hi> but alſo <hi>had Pleaſure</hi> in thoſe that did them, <hi>Rum.</hi> 1.32.

               <p n="3">3. <hi>We ſhould do what we can, to promote Holineſs, in our Selves and Others.</hi> We ſhould be a <hi>Peculiar People, zealous of good works</hi> (Tit. 2.14) <hi>Cleanſing our ſelves from all filthineſs of fleſh and ſpirit, perfecting ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs in the fear of God,</hi> (2 Cor. 7.1.) <hi>being holy in all manner of Converſation,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.15 It's an Infinitely Great, Holy, All ſeeing, Jealous GOD, that is offended with Sin: He can't be deceiv'd, and He won't be mocked. Sin tends directly to our Temporal, Spiritual and Eternal da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.

Mat. 5.8. <hi>The pure in heart ſhall ſee God.</hi> Heb. 12.14. <hi>Without holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi> Iſat. 3.10, 11. <hi>Say ye unto the righteous, that it ſhall

Wo unto the wicked, it ſhall go ill with him; for the reward of his hands ſhall be given him.</hi> Let us therefore be holy our Selves, and prompt Others by our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples to be ſo too. Mat. 5.16. <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee your good works, and glorifie your Father which is in heaven.</hi> Phil. 2.15. <hi>That ye may be blameleſs and harmleſs, the Sons of God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverſe Nation, among whom ye ſhine as lighes in the world.</hi> I ſhall conclude with that awful Text, which refers to the Great and laſt DAY OF JUDGMENT.
