         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

If upon impartial inveſtigation I am wrong (it is not wilful) I wiſh to be convinced of it: if in the right, a legal remedy, ſo as to prevent a future evil of the ſame nature: is all I aſk: I am content to bear my loſſes with fortitude: it is beyond human reach to repair the injury.</p>

            <p>The Mobile Bay, is ſituate between the latitude of 30 degrees 20 minutes and 31 d. 10 m North; and between the longitude of 87 degrees 35 mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, and 87 degrees 55 minutes Weſt from the meridian of London; it makes an excellent and ſafe harbour; the inlet is formed by Dauphin Iſland on the weſt—and a peninſula, or point of land extending from the main on the eaſt;— through which may be carried three fathom water into the Bay.</p>

            <p>It is certain for many years, the exports will paſs down the river Miſſiſſippi—but the imports, if the avenue was admitted to be opened, would now paſs by way of Mobile and Tenneſſee—and the various ſtreams with which the latter communicates.</p>

            <p>To me it appears ſtrange, that any government ſhould deem it good policy, to withhold from a part of her citizens, the uſe of ſtreams formed for their benefit; while the nations having claims on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>I was immediately on my arrival at Natchez, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by ſeveral citizens, that the federal officers had in contemplation, by military power, to confine myſelf and company.</p>
            <p>we continued at Natchez ſeveral days, in peace and harmony with our friends.</p>
            <p>On the 18th inſtant, about the hour of twelve o'clock at night, my lodging was ſurrounded with probably ſome few leſs than a battalion of federal troops, with fixed bayonets. A Mr. Scott, and a Mr Grag came into the house, and without ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny forced the room, where I was in bed with Capt. Wm. L. Cox: I aſked their buſineſs, they, told me they were the unwelcome meſsengers of bad news; their buſineſs was to take me into custody.</p>
            <p>I aſked their authority, they told me it was from Governor Sergeant. I put on my clothes, they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced me at the point of the bayonet to fort Panmuir of Natchez; (as they call it) I demanded their autho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rity—Mr. Grag ſhewed me orders to the following effect—viz.</p>

<pb n="42" facs="unknown:035360_0042_10049FB14196AD60"/>written by me muſt poſitively be done in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. Some few days previous to my departure from confinement I was informed by a friend (who accidentally got an opportunity to ſpeak with me) that every meaſure poſſible was then purſuing, by General Wilkinſon, and the Federal officers, to involve me in inevitable ruin. The moſt ungerous reflections and unfavourable repreſentations were made to thoſe who were unacquainted with us; in fact no abuſe with them was too nefarious to be preſcribed, and that if I reſpected myſelf or friends he adviſed me if poſſible to depart.</p>
                  <p>Under thoſe impreſſions I determined at every riſque to leave my confinement.</p>
                  <p>On the 25th. of Sept. I told the officers of the Fort in the care of whom I was placed; that I would rather not exiſt than to be unjuſtly and ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally confined, my friends would be injured, who had repoſed implicit confidence in me; and I muſt be involved in inevitable ruin; provided I was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from purſuing my lawfull buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>All I aſked was that juſtice the conſtitution and laws of my country entitled me to, and rather than be denied that, I would ceaſe to exiſt in this world.</p>
                  <p>Except ſome few contemptuous grins, the officers made little or no reply to my obſervations and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably thought leſs of them.</p>
                  <p>On the 26th of September 1798 (with conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able riſque) I departed from Fort Panmeur of Natchez, on my way at the diſtance of fifteen leagues from New Orleans, I met a report that myſelf with a conſiderable number of men was on the way to plunder and harraſs the Spaniſh ſettlers; and on my arrival at New Orleans, on the 3d. of October 1798. I was informed of the fact, that a
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:035360_0043_10049FB2D7A14548"/>letter from General Wilkinſon had arrived ſome few days previous, the contents of which will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the following orders, publiſhed by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor general of the Province of Louiſiana viz. I have juſt now received an unqueſtionable proof of the faith of the U. S. in the obſervance of the treaty by which the intereſt of our nations are ſo happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly united.</p>
                  <p>General Wilkinſon informs me that a very large number of people without law or any nation all conſideration have joined in the weſtern part of the U. S. with the perverſe deſign of invading this province, and no other object than that of plundering its inhabitants and committing ſuch exceſſes as may be expected from men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any diſcipline, whoſe exiſtance is only ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as long as their atrocities keep them out of the reach of deſerved puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>The chief of thoſe banditti has under various pretexts deceived the commander of Fort Maſſac and was permitted to paſs with a ſmall party of his people, having purſuaded him that they were going to hunting; but the main body went through the woods out of ſight of the Fort to embark about a league further; ſaid General ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes that theſe may be a part of the forces with which Blount intended to invade this province.</p>
                  <p>He has given me this timely information to the end that I might take ſuch meaſures as can prevent ſo eminant a danger; the executive power of the U. S. has been long purſuing that party of outlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed people ſo far as to ſend troops againſt them.</p>
                  <p>The chief of thoſe vagabonds has been lately ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted in Natchez and I make no doubt but what the vigilence of that Government will continue to

My arrival at New-Orlean the moment I did, gave no ſmall degree of ſurpriſe to the citizens, as well as the Spaniſh officers—and as to my own part I can only leave to my friends and fellow citizens to judge of the unpleaſant ſituation in which I was placed: a lone ſtranger, ſupported only by a conſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious rectitude of my actions, and the profound juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the Spaniſh officers who are diſpoſed to be in amity with the United States, and to treat her citizens with juſtice and reſpect.</p>
            <p>On my arrival at New Orlean, I immediately waited on his excellency governor Gayoſo, to whom I ſtated candidly my ſituation, and the object I had in view for making him a viſit.—,—<note n="*" place="bottom">The impartial can juſtly figure to themſelves, the eſtoniſhment with which I was received, and my embarraſment when the unfavorable repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations which had been officially communicated, was pronounced to me; howeve truth as in all caſes here, had its influence.</note> I was treated politely; and am happy to have it in my power, to inform the world and my friends par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly; that in his excellency Manuel Gayoſo De-lemos, I have had the pleaſure to find every principle that conſtitutes the officer of juſtice, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of honour, humanity and benevolence.</p>

            <p>Some ſhort time after my arrival at New Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans, Wilkinſon, or Sergeant, perhaps both of them, demanded of governor Gayoſo the perſon of Zachr. Cox—in this demand they were not gratified— their communications not being ſo much credited as in the former inſtance; the objects they had in view were too plain, and began to awaken every impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial mind: a reſort to ſome other alternative to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify and carry into effect their malevolence became neceſlary.</p>
            <p>After accompliſhing my buſineſs much to my ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction with his excellency Governor Gayoſo; by his approbation I departed from New Orlean, on the 30th of October for the United States, by way of Mobile, where I arrived in company with Mr. Amos Edwards, on the 8th of November 1798; by the citizens, officers and commander of Mobile <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>On the 11th inſt, we ſet out from Mobile for Samuel Mitchel's <abbr>Eſq</abbr> United States agent in the Chactaw Nation—where we arrived on the 18th inſt. Mr. Mitchel being from home, did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn untill the 19th. I immediately communicated to him my ſituation and deſire to paſs into the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited States, to impartially give that juſtice and ſatisfaction the conſtitution and laws of our country demanded: I further requeſted of Mr. Mitchell (as an officer of the United States) his protection and ſafe conveyance into the State of Tenneſſe, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Some time in the month of June, a man by the name of Medad Mitchel, without authority (as I underſtood) made an attempt to organize the militia—Zachariah Cox being informed of the circumſtance forbid the meaſure—obſerving that he (Mitchel) nor no other perſon there, was veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with that authority.

                        <p>They alſo broke open ſundry ſealed letters, &amp; our goods and property was ſhamefully abuſed, our pocketts picked by military power—my certificate as captain, received from col.

                        <p>I demanded the paper afterwards which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied and never returned to me; we being at length liberated—returned to Smithland.
