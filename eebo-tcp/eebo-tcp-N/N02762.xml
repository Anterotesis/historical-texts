            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE INTEREST OF <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Country</hi> To lay No DUTIES.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEREAS there has been of late much Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe concerning the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties on Merchandize, for Support of Government; ſome being for having Duties continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſome not; ſome being for continuing ſome Duties, and taking off others, and laying ſome New, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:003290_0003_0FF033895CA4EA90"/>I think it may not be amiſs for me to communicate my Thoughts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this Affair, which, I am ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, would be for the Good and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of City and Country, if put in Practice, and no ways detrimental to the Government: For, conſidering the great Benefits that we enjoy, by a well regulated and happy Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I think we ſhould be very Ungrateful, if we did not take Care ſufficiently to ſupport the ſame; which I hope we ſhall all agree to. And therefore all the Queſtion is, <hi>How or after what Manner this may beſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, for the Benefit and Eaſe of the City and Country in general, and with the leaſt Burthen to the People, and with the leaſt Prejudice to Trade and Induſtry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the firſt Place I ſhall ſhew <hi>How that the Laying Duties on Merchandize is very much to the Diſadvantage of both City and Country,</hi> as is found by Experience: And that, on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, <hi>The taking them off, and having Trade free, would be greatly to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:003290_0004_0FF0338B973B5B70"/>
and for the Intereſt of both.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I believe that it will be readily granted, that Trade and Commerce is that which conduces much to the Proſperity and Enriching of both Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Country; and, that whatever hinders and diſcourages Trade, hurts both City and Country: For as the City cannot ſubſiſt without the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, ſo the Country cannot well ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt nor thrive without the City, which they depend on for the taking of their Produce, and furniſhing them with many Neceſſaries, which they cannot well be without: So that whatever hinders the Country from Selling their Produce for a good Price, and likewiſe is a Cauſe of their Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dearer for what they buy, muſt needs be very Prejudicial to them. And that the Duties on Merchandize is a Cauſe of both theſe Evils, I think is undeniable, and can be very eaſily proved, in general and in particular. For although ſome Duties do more affect the Country than others, yet (with Submiſſion to better Judgments)
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:003290_0005_0FF0338E44A10348"/>
I think all are Hurtful. For if we conſider Things rightly, we ſhall find that the Country pays moſt of the Duties, though oftentimes inſenſibly. For though it is true the Merchant pays it firſt, yet he generally takes Care afterwards to ſell his Goods for a Price accordingly: And moſt of the Goods that are Imported and pay Duty, being ſold to, and expended in, the Country, conſequently the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try pays it, by paying ſo much dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than otherwiſe they need to do; which I ſuppoſe very few, if any, will deny. But if any ſhould, it is very eaſily proved in the general, and in divers Particulars, which I ſhall conſider anon. And alſo Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in General are very Prejudicial to the Country, on Account of their ſelling the Produce they raiſe; ſo that if there was a Free Trade, they might ſell what they raiſe at a better Price than otherwiſe they can Expect to do; for as it is well known that the Duties have oftentimes been a Cauſe of driving Trade and Buſineſs
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:003290_0006_0FF03390CD10C9A0"/>
from this Province to our Neighbours, and diſcouraging our Neighbours from coming to trade with us, it muſt needs be hurtful to us in General.</p>
            <p>Now as to the particular Duties that are paid, we may conſider the Hurt that each does to the City and Country in particular. And firſt as to <hi>Wine,</hi> which does not ſo much affect the Country as City, yet it is not all Drunk in the City, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try has ſome Part of it, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently pays ſome Part of the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: Now if ſome Duties muſt be continued, I think this on Wine may as well or better than any other; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is to be ſuppoſed, that, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſpeaking, thoſe that drink the moſt of it are pretty able, both in City and Country; and ſo may be beſt able to pay towards the Support of Government, which it is intended for; and does not fall on the Poorer ſort of People that are not able to bear it, as ſome other Things do. Neither will the Diſcouragement of
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:003290_0007_0FF0339317DCFE58"/>
that be ſo hurtful to the Country o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe as ſome other Things are: ſo I ſhall ſay the leſs againſt it, and proceed to <hi>Rum,</hi> which more affects the Country, the greateſt Part of it being uſed there (whether well uſed or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed, I think not pertinent to my preſent Purpoſe to diſcourſe of) for certain it is that the Country will have it, whether cheap or dear; ſo that conſequently they pay the Duty that Drink it, almoſt in general, both Rich and Poor: For when there is no Duty on it, the Merchant can ſell it cheaper, and when he pays Duty he muſt and does ſell it dearer, as Experience proves; ſo to talk of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging it, by a Duty, is in vain. Beſides it would be a Contradiction, for ſuch as will have the Duty to help ſupport Government, to talk of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging it; for if it ſhould do ſo, <hi>pray how would it anſwer the End for which the Duty is laid? viz.</hi> Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the Government: So that if the Duty ſhould diſcourage the Importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we muſt ſeek for another Way
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:003290_0008_0FF03396D829EDA8"/>
for Support of Government, which we may do without it, as I ſhall after make appear. Now, it may be conſidered, that it would not be any Advantage to the Country to hinder the Importation of <hi>Rum,</hi> conſidering that we purchaſe it with the Produce of the Country, without Money, and thereby encourage Manufacture, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation, and many Trades that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on it, which would Suffer if we diſcouraged the Importation and Trade of <hi>Rum, Moloſſus</hi> and other Things from the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi>: How could we expect they would trade with us, if we refuſe to take of the Produce of thoſe Countries, partly in lieu for our Flour, Bread, Bacon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any ſhould ſay, <hi>Why, bring back Money in Return for our Flour,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and ſo make Money plenty here.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſay, that we do, in Part, already enough to make Money plenty here, if we had not another Way for it; and it may be as much as they can well ſpare us; ſo that if we ſhould inſiſt on having our Returns all in
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:003290_0009_0FF033998E825B00"/>
Money, it might deſtroy our Trade. And as for the Notion of diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Vice by it, I think it frivolous, as not being ſufficient to do it; for thoſe that love ſtrong Drink, will have it one Way or another: ſo that there will need ſome other Method for that of diſcouraging Vice, which I think not proper to diſcourſe of here.</p>
            <p>Now as to the Duty on <hi>Moloſſus,</hi> I think that it is a Hardſhip, that falls moſtly on the Pooreſt Part of the City and Country who moſtly uſe it, and that for very neceſſary Uſes (and not to encourage Vice) and they could not well do without it, for <hi>Honey</hi> is ſcarce here and what <hi>Sweets</hi> might be made of <hi>Cyder</hi> I know not, but I believe little in Compariſon of the <hi>Moloſſus</hi> the Country expends, nor ſo good nor ſuitable neither. So that it would certainly be a great Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip on the Country to diſcourage the Importation, as well as it is ſome Hardſhip to make them pay dearer for it than they need to do, were Trade free without any Duties.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:003290_0010_0FF033AAA56F7730"/>Next as to <hi>Salt,</hi> it is generally agreed on all Hands, <hi>That it were better to have no Duty on that,</hi> ſo I ſhall ſay the leſs to it, we having ſo lately had plentiful Experience to confirm it to general Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>Another conſiderable Branch of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue is <hi>the Duty on Negroes,</hi> which, it is very certain, the Country in general payes the moſt of <hi>viz.</hi> all thoſe that Buy them. For it muſt be the ſame by them as other Things, in that Reſpect, <hi>that though the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant payes it firſt, he, when he ſells them, advances the more on the Price.</hi> If any ſhould ſay, <hi>It may be well to diſcourage the Importation of them, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enough in the Country already.</hi> I ſay, then let the Duty be ſo great as to anſwer that End, otherwiſe the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is frivolous, and then if ſo, it anſwers not the End for which it has been laid, <hi>viz. Support of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> which we are now upon.</p>
            <p>The Duty on <hi>Cocoa</hi> is another Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle which is paid by all thoſe that buy and ſpend <hi>Chocolate,</hi> which though
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:003290_0011_0FF0339B1A071600"/>
it moſtly affects the City, yet the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is alſo partly concerned in it.</p>
            <p>Another is the Duty of 5 <hi>per Ct.</hi> or 7 and an half <hi>per Ct.</hi> on <hi>Britiſh</hi> Goods imported from the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Plantations, and not directly from <hi>Great Britain,</hi> which ſome have thought to be for the Advantage of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, but I am of another Mind: For what does it concern the greateſt Part of the People in this Province (eſpecially the Country) how the Goods are imported hither, whether directly or round about, provided they can have them as cheap as if they all came directly. And if they could not be afforded as cheap when they come from other Places to us, as thoſe that come directly, then that of it ſelf would diſcourage the Trade, without any Duty being laid on them. But I can make it appear that it would be better for this Province in general <hi>not to diſcourage ſuch Importation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe what we have ſo imported does not coſt us Money, whereas our Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation from</hi> Great Britain <hi>drains this
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:003290_0012_0FF033AD8FCCA998"/>
Province of Money which otherwiſe might be plenty.</hi> Now let us conſider, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly <hi>Boſton</hi> and other Parts of <hi>New-England,</hi> takes off largely of the Produce of this Country, but finds it difficult to make us Returns; Money they have not, nor but little elſe that we want, but are often forced to pay us in <hi>Britiſh Goods,</hi> notwithſtanding the Duty. Now it is eaſy to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that if that were taken off, it would encourage our Trade with them. But then it may be objected, <hi>That would leſſen our Trade with</hi> Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. I ſay, <hi>Let it be ſo, the better for the Country; for it would not leſſen our Exportation thither, but only our Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation, which would ſave our Money.</hi> So by what is aboveſaid, without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging, it plainly appears that it would be better for this Province to take off that Duty.</p>
            <p>Another Thing to be conſidered is <hi>The Tunnage on Veſſels not built in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,</hi> which ſeems more difficult to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine than any of the Reſt: But I am entirely of the Mind <hi>that it is beſt to
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:003290_0013_0FF0339DA9804C50"/>
have Trade free and to have no Duties at all.</hi> So I think it beſt to take off this Duty alſo. And although there may be conſiderable Reaſons advanced in favour of this Duty; yet I think I can advance as good againſt it. The moſt conſiderable Arguments for it are, <hi>That it keeps the Trade of Building in our own Province.</hi> This I muſt own conſiderable to the Ship-Carpenters, Smiths and ſome other Trades-men, but does not affect the greateſt Part of the City, nor the Country hardly at all.</p>
            <p>Another Reaſon is, <hi>It keeps out Foreigners, eſpecially the</hi> Bermudians, <hi>who come here to get what they can, and there is little to be got by them,</hi> &amp;c. This I alſo own to be a conſiderable Plea, but I think it chiefly concerns the Builders and ſome owners of Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and not the Country in general. But I am of Opinon. That the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging the <hi>Bermudians,</hi> and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, by a Free Trade, would be for the general Good of City and Country, (though not of every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:003290_0014_0FEFDAE1960F3780"/>
Perſon) as I will endeavour to make appear. But by the Way I think it may not be amiſs to explain what I mean by <hi>a Free Trade,</hi> which is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the Subjects of the King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and <hi>not any Foreigners in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that is People of other Nations or Kingdoms.</hi> For I think that the Word <hi>Foreigners</hi> is improper to the <hi>Bermudians,</hi> or any of our Neighbours and fellow Subjects, though belonging to different Provinces and Plantations or Governments. And now though the <hi>Bermudians,</hi> as aboveſaid, come to get, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet they generaly bring us plenty of <hi>Salt,</hi> and did afford it us cheap, before they were diſcouraged by the <hi>Tunnage</hi> and <hi>Duty on Salt,</hi> which has much hindred them and others of late; and it is well known we have paid for it ſince, which has affected the Country in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, which ought to be more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded than the Advantage of a few particular Perſons. Beſides it very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten hinders our Trade in the Expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Produce of the Country,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:003290_0015_0FF033A02F7D6110"/>
which is undeniably prejudicial to the whole in ſeveral Reſpects.</p>
            <p>I will give you one Inſtance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, to make it appear plain, and that is, <hi>Laſt Year here came a Ship into this Harbour, loaden with</hi> Salt, <hi>which we very much wanted, and would have Traded with us for</hi> Wheat <hi>and</hi> Staves, <hi>&amp;c. but by Reaſon of the Tunnage and Duty being ſo heavy, went away to</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boy, <hi>(and for no other Reaſon,)</hi> which was a conſiderable Diſadvantage to City and Country. And thus our Duties and Impoſitions drive Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and Trade from us to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, who are Gaping for it, and may well Laugh at us for our Pains, ſeeing they could no ways get it from us, did not we give it them. By what is above ſaid, with much more that might be ſaid, we may obſerve, that it is a groundleſs No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which ſome have entertained, <hi>viz. That when the Government is Support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Duties on Trade, that it falls on the Merchants and City, and that the Country pays little of it:</hi> For it will,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:003290_0016_0FF033B1A9F7DDB0"/>
I doubt not, appear plain to thoſe that rightly conſider it, <hi>That the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try pays the moſt of it, and the Diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of Trade, which is, and muſt be the Effects of it, if continued, affects the Country more than ſome of them are aware of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now conſidering that our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Provinces are Free Ports, and Support Government other ways, for to draw Trade thither, is it not high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Reaſonable for us <hi>to be Wiſe and Prudent in this Matter, by taking of all Obſtructions and Hindrances that are already on Trade, and by being carefull of Incouraging it for the future.</hi> We may conſider how that in the next Province they are continually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving and making Laws to increaſe Trade in their own Province, and to draw it from us; which has already proved Effectual ſeveral times, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of which is above obſerved. And ſhall we be ſo far wanting to our ſelves, as not to conſider our own Intereſt in endeavouring to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it, which as yet we may eaſily
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:003290_0017_0FF033A2D1C0FBA0"/>
do, but if we do not do it in time, I doubt we ſhall repent when it is too late; and I am fully of the Mind that there is no other way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it, but by making our Port as Free as theirs. They can Support Government without Duties and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions on Trade, and why may not we; I am ſatisfied we are as well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as they.</p>
            <p>The next Thing to be conſidered is, <hi>how Government ſhall be Supported without the Duties, and that both bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and eaſier for both City and Country in general</hi>; and that is by a general Tax on Mens Eſtates, in both City and Country, which is the moſt juſt and equal Way that has yet been Practiſed, that I know of, for this is no Obſtruction to Trade nor Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture. Nor has it any of thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies attending it, that, more or leſs, attend, or may attend, all other ways that have or can be propoſed. This way the Burthen does not lie on the City alone, nor on the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try alone, but each bears an equal
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:003290_0018_0FF033B551AC6A00"/>
Proportion, according to their Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Neither does the Burthen fall heavy on the Poor, for they that have little, will pay but little: So there will be no juſt cauſe of Complaint either in City or Country, by Poor, Rich or thoſe in a middle Station: Whereas moſt other ways fall heavy on ſome, while others that are better able, go quite free, nay oftentimes make a Gain by their Neighbours Loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which I think needful to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented as much as poſſible. This way of raiſing a Support for Government, is alſo much eaſier and better than by Duties, on ſeveral Accounts; for the Money is raiſed with much leſs Charge and Trouble then the other, and will be more certain, the others having often failed of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> raiſing the Sums ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, and ſo fallen ſhort in anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the End propoſed, partly by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Difficulty and Charge at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the gathering of them in; ſo that I believe we may ſafely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, <hi>That two Thouſand Pounds, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Tax, will bring as much Money,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:003290_0019_0FF033A5559CA378"/>
or more, into the Treaſury clear, as three Thouſand Pounds raiſed by Duties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, is it not much better for the Province to pay <hi>two Thouſand Pounds</hi> than <hi>three Thouſand,</hi> if it will as well anſwer the End? And is it not as good and as well for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>to be ſupported one Way as the other, provided it be as ſufficient and more certain?</hi> Nay we may very well afford a larger Supply this Way than the other, and yet be great Gainers by it.</p>
            <p>If it ſhould be objected, <hi>That the Legiſlature of</hi> Great Britain <hi>have, by long Experience, found that it is the beſt Way to ſupport Government by Duties, and that it is the Practice of other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions alſo.</hi> I ſay, <hi>Suppoſe we allow that, yet it will not prove it to be ſo here; our Caſe differs vaſtly from theirs, conſidering we are only a ſmall Province, ſcituate in the midſt of ſeveral others, which are free of theſe Duties; and ſo we are continually in Danger of looſing our Trade to them, as is already obſerved. It muſt be owned, that if our neighbouring Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:003290_0020_0FF033B776E223F0"/>
paid the like Duties as we, it would not be ſo inconvenient for us to do the ſame, but ſeeing their Ports are Free, ours ought to be ſo too.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I hope our Superiours will take this into Conſideration, and that the Country will be ſenſible that they have been under a Miſtake, in thinking <hi>That if the Government be ſupported by Duties, it is the City does it; and that if by a general Tax, they do it:</hi> For, by what I have ſaid, they may very eaſily ſee it is otherwiſe. And they actually pay a large Share of it when it is paid by Duties, and no more than their Share when by a general Tax on all our Eſtates: For if the City be ſo much richer than the Country, as is ſaid, they will be to pay ſo much the more.</p>
            <p>If any ſhould object and ſay, <hi>This Way of Supporting Government by a general Tax will fall heavy on ſome Men that have large Eſtates in land that is unimproved, and ſo bring in little or no Profit, whilſt other Men that have great Incomes by Money at Intereſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>may pay but little.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:003290_0021_0FF033A832BA4848"/>I anſwer as to the firſt, <hi>The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy is in their own Hands, they may diſpoſe of their Land, or let others im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it if they cannot do it themſelves. Beſides I am of Opinion that it may be well to diſcourage ſuch Engroſers of great Tracts of Land and not improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, it being a Wrong to both King and Country.</hi> As concerning the other whoſe Eſtates lie chiefly in Caſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and not viſible to the Aſſeſſors It may be well to have it ordered for them (and others too) <hi>to give an Account of their own Eſtates.</hi> And indeed if all Men were to give an Account of their own Eſtates to the Aſſeſſors, it might be more equal than it often times now is: For can it be ſuppoſed that the Aſſeſſors can know what all Men's Eſtates are, in a Town or Ward (if they were always impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial;) which may be the Reaſon that there is often ſuch Complaints, <hi>That ſome are over rated, and others under ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>; whereas if every Man gives a true Account of his own Eſtate, or as near as he can well, and be rated accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:003290_0022_0FF033B933F41838"/>
it might prevent ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, and be more equal and juſt.</p>
            <p>But if, notwithſtanding all that can be ſaid, our Legiſlature ſhould think good to continue ſome Duties, though not all, then let them continue the Duties on <hi>Wine</hi> and <hi>Negroes imported,</hi> theſe being leaſt prejudicial to the Trade of the Country, and by all Means take off all other, and make it up by a general Tax. But by no Means lay any <hi>Pole-tax on Negroes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in the Province,</hi> for that would be very hard on ſome and not at all affect ſome others better able.</p>
            <p>Thus I have, in ſhort, given my Sentiments concerning theſe Things, which, I am ſatisfied, may be for the Good of City and Country, if well conſidered and accordingly prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed.</p>
