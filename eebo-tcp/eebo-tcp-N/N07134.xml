            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>PROV. I. 9.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <hi>For they shall be an Ornament of Grace unto thy Head, and Chains about thy Neck.</hi>

            </epigraph>
            <p>AS it is a time in which mankind in general are much concerned to be adorn'd with the most agreeable ornaments, &amp; dress'd in the best fashion; and as it is the earnest enquiry of many of our young people in special,â€”<q>How we shall dressâ€”how shall we adorn ourselves, so as to appear most amiable and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging, most lovely and endearing, to each other, and to the world?</q>â€”So, willing to please and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form myself to the humours and inclinations of my young friends, as far as can be supposed consistent with the glory of God, and the honour and interest of my Master and LORD, I have now chosen a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, which naturally leads me to answer this <hi>important enquiry.</hi>â€”A subject, which leads me to tell you, O
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:009090_0008_0F7001D65EB8F1C8"/>
               <hi>young people,</hi> what ornaments will adorn you, what fashion will become you, and in what garb you will appear with the greatest advantage to each other, and to the world; and, what is more than all what will render you, at the same time, amiable in the sight of the great and glorious GOD of heaven and earth!â€”For once, then, be persuaded to attend and learn the best <hi>fashion</hi> from the <hi>pulpit,</hi> and the <hi>art of dress</hi> from the <hi>word of GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE evident design of the royal penman, in writing the book of <hi>proverbs,</hi> was to instruct all, but especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally young people and children, in the words of wisdom and understanding. And as he was endowed with a spirit of wisdom superior to his fellow-men, the holy Spirit, not willing that his wisdom should die with him, has graciously preserved these excellent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of it, that we, by attending to and practising his directions, might be made wise unto salvation. And as, by the manner of address herein used, it is evident, that these instructions were intended for his own children, as well as other young people: So in our context he informs them what true wisdom and understanding consisted in. <q>The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction.</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Ver. 7.</bibl>
               </note> He then goes on to direct them how to obtain the true wisdom, even by attending to the instructions given them by their parents or teachers. <q>My son, says he, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother.</q>
               <note n="â€ " place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Ver. 8.</bibl>
               </note> And for a motive to excite them to a cordial compliance with this advice, he tells them how amiable and beautiful these attainments will render such as are possess'd of them; as in the words before us.â€”<q>For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:009090_0009_0F7001D70E4E8578"/>By this the wise man intends to recommend <hi>early piety</hi> and <hi>godliness,</hi> as what is most amiable and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental; and as what would make them appear with much greater advantage, than any external orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments whatever: And the cloathing of virtue and religion (if the expression may be admitted,) as what would be most becoming on <hi>young people,</hi> both in the fight of GOD and men.</p>
            <p>HEREIN, therefore, appears the great and real excellency of virtue and religion, as they answer all the reasonable desires of mankind in all their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits, and make them happy in the good esteem of GOD and men.</p>
            <p>PEOPLE are much for <hi>the fashion,</hi> and <hi>young</hi> people for those ornaments which they think beautiful and excellent, and they are apt to set much by them, and value themselves highly upon them, when obtain'd.â€”<q>Can a maid (says the Prophet) forget her orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or a bride her arise?</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Jer. 2. 32.</bibl>
               </note> Now the royal pen-man, wisely considering this fatal fondness for things vain and trilling, and considering also that crowns for the head, <hi>chains</hi> for the neck, and the like, were the richest and choicest ornaments of that day, under these striking metaphors, endeavours to represent how graceful and ornamental the early practice of virtue and religion would be, to such as were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon to engage in it, in youth or childhood.â€”<q>My son hear the instruction of thy father, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake not the law of thy mother: For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck.</q>â€”As if he had saidâ€”<q>Be advised, O ye children and young people, now in youth, which is the best time, to make yourselves for life, for eternity, to hearken to the instructions of those
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:009090_0010_0F7001D797D3D698"/>
that teach you the doctrines and duties of religion, and wisely attend to the law of the LORD, <hi>for they,</hi> the precepts &amp; doctrines of the law of GOD, when sincerely and constantly attended to and put in practice, <hi>shall be</hi> infinitely more beautiful and becoming than all other ornaments, however dear and excellent; yea, they shall be even as <hi>an orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of grace to your heads,</hi> and infinitely more ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and engaging than <hi>chains about your necks.</hi>â€”This will, therefore, be your highest wisdom and greatest glory.</q>
            </p>
            <p>AND now, that the wise man was entirely right in his sentiments, and just in his conclusion, in the text, will be abundantly evident, if we only consider these two things, <abbr>viz.</abbr>
            </p>
            <p>FIRST, That <hi>true</hi> piety, or godliness, is, in itself, the greatest excellency of man.â€”â€”And,</p>
            <p>SECONDLY, That it is most amiable and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in young people.</p>
            <p>To illustrate and improve these two propositions, is, therefore, the design of the ensuing discourse.â€”And I can't but hope, that, by the blessing of GOD, when these truths are well weigh'd and apply'd, you will all, with one consent, be led to aspire after that <hi>art of dress,</hi> which consists not in <q>that outward a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; but in the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even in that adorning, which in the sight of GOD is of great price.</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>1 Pet. 3. 3, 4.</bibl>
               </note> Then will you be amiable in the sight of GOD, and all good men; and even sinners and profane persons, who are, of course,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:009090_0011_0F7001D94D023EF8"/>
enemies to the godly, will not have it in their power to deprive you of true beauty, amiableness and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency; but, "like the rising light," your beauties shall shine with increasing lustre, till they arrive at the meridian of perfection in eternal glory!<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Prov. 4. 18.</bibl>
               </note>â€”But not to digressâ€”â€”</p>
            <p>WE are, in the first place, to prove, that <hi>true</hi> piety, or godliness, is, in itself, the greatest excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of man.</p>
            <p>I SUPPOSE, that it will be readily admitted by all, that seriously weigh and consider the nature and reason of things, in themselves and consequences, that whatever recommends us to the favour of GOD, and renders us acceptable to him, must be in itself, most excellent and worthy:â€”For nothing, but what is intrinsically excellent, can be supposed to be so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable with that GOD, who is most perfectly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the nature and value of things, and esteems or disregards, as they are either valuable or worthless.</p>
            <p>Now, that <hi>true piety</hi> does indeed recommend us to GOD, will be readily acknowledged, by all who consider, that it is this alone which renders us fit for his favour, and worthy his acceptance:â€”For it is only by this, that we are conform'd to his will and image, made holy and humble, and meet to receive the tokens of his love. And hence it is the express declaration of GOD himself,â€”<q>To this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word.</q>
               <note n="â€ " place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Isai. 66. 2.</bibl>
               </note> This poor, humble and contrite spirit is the true, genuine spirit of piety and is not, cannot be, found in any, but such as are pious and godly, but such as <q>tremble

            <p>SECONDLY, To show, that piety is most amiable and ornamental in young people.</p>
            <p>THE virtues and graces of the blessed Spirit, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in the godly lives of those that are young, may be fitly said, in the language of the text, to be "an ornament of grace to the head, and chains about the neck."

<pb n="14" facs="unknown:009090_0014_0F7001DB9047CD08"/>
asserted, it may not be improper to descend to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, under this head, and offer a few things to your serious consideration. And,</p>
            <p>1st, HERE, true piety will cover the spots and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formities of the soul, which have been <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
               </gap> by sin, and render it amiable and lovely; and therefore the earlier practised, the more graceful and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental.</p>
            <p>THE soul of man, though noble and excellent, pure and unspotted in its original make and forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is depraved and deformed, polluted and defil'd by reason of sin.â€”Sin has wounded and disfigured its beautiful features and excellencies; so that it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely necessary that something be done in order to cover and conceal, or rather take away, these spots and blemishes, contracted by sin, and to restore beauty and amiableness to the features of the soul. And this can be effected no other way, but by the grace of GOD ruling in the heart and governing in the life, and influencing to the practice of piety and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, according to the dictates of the divine word. Or, in other words, we can take no better method to bring about this happy change of deformity for beauty, than to devote ourselves, sincerely and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the least reserve, to the practice of virtue and religion.</p>
            <p>WE are quickly sensible of our natural imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, sagacious in finding out deformities in our bodies and disfigurements in our features, and are wise to conceal them from the eye of the world:â€”Yea, and this is one great reason, why we are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally so fond of dress and ornaments.â€”But why so backward, so blind and so unconcern'd about the deformities sin has caused in our souls, the nobler

part?â€”Is it not, because we do not consider, that virtue and religion will not only cover a multitude of sins, conceal the innumerable spots which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by sin, and remove the deformities with which our souls are disfigured, but also adorn them, and render them truly beautiful and amiable?â€”Surely if we realized these things, we could not (one would think) rest contented, while we appeared so hateful and odious, in the sight of GOD and all good men.</p>
            <p>SIN, as we hinted above, has wounded and disfigur'd the beautiful features of the soul:â€”But true piety will rectify these deformities, and restore the beauties of it. The robes of the <hi>Saints</hi> are often compared to fine linen, <hi>white</hi> and clean:â€”That "righteousness," therefore, "which is of GOD by faith in Christ Jesus,"<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Phil. 3. 9.</bibl>
               </note> will thoroughly cleanse the soul from these spots and deformities, and sanctifying grace will take away all these blemishes and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and set a new face on things in it; so that, from being spotted &amp; defiled, deformed and polluted by sin, by the sincere practice of true piety and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, it will become fair and beautiful, white and clean, and be found "without spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing."<note n="â€ " place="bottom">

               </note>â€”O how graceful then, and how ornamental must this be in youth, which is so often defiled and disgraced by unclean and polluting sins!â€” But,</p>
            <p>2<hi rend="sup">dly,</hi> ANOTHER reason, why early piety is so truly amiable, is, because it is of the utmost importance to our happiness, as immortal beings, that we thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote ourselves to the service of GOD.</p>
            <p>IT is the soul that is the principal excellency of man. It is this excellent and immortal <hi>spirit,</hi> which
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:009090_0016_0F7001DCE0DA6298"/>
is in man, that gives him the preheminence to the beasts of the field; <hi>this</hi> which makes him capable of serving and enjoying his Maker, and <hi>this</hi> which made him so highly valued by Christ, as to induce him to give such an invaluable price, as his own most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious blood, for his redemption.â€”Now if we are slothful and negligent about our souls, and do not, in the practice of piety and virtue, seek to have them adorn'd with the graces and virtues of the blessed Spirit, we lose all right and title to this distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preheminence, and sink beneath the very beasts that perish. But if we wisely care for our souls, and early assert our right of superiority, and, by the practice of godliness, keep up the order of things and our dignity in the creation; then do we take the best and most effectual method to honour our Creator and Redeemer, and to secure our own ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting glory and happiness.â€”But I pass to observeâ€”</p>
            <p>3<hi rend="sup">dly,</hi> THAT true piety renders men like their Father, which is in heaven: And therefore the sooner it is practised, the greater the glory. It was the glory, as well as happiness of <hi>Adam,</hi> before <hi>the Fall,</hi> that he was created "in the image of GOD, and after his likeness."<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Gen. 1. 26.</bibl>
               </note> And for this reason, whenever this glorious image of the blessed GOD, is repaired and restored in sinful men, it is their glory, it is their excellency: And, the sooner this is done, the more glorious, the more happy.â€”â€”"The <hi>boary bead,"</hi> says the wise man, "is a crown of glory, if it be found in the way of righteousness."<note n="â€ " place="bottom">

               </gap>, is found walking in the way of righteousness!â€”Surely that is, that must be, our greatest excellency, which early demonstrates us to be "the sons and daughters

               </note>
            </p>
            <p>4<hi rend="sup">thly,</hi> ANOTHER consideration, which argues, that early piety is most amiable and ornamental, is, that this is what GOD himself approves of and takes great delight in.</p>
            <p>GOD is a Being that loves righteousness, and hates iniquity: He takes pleasure in them that fear him, and hope in his mercy: Yea, and <hi>the upright are his delight.</hi> This is evident from many passages of the sacred scriptures; but what puts it beyond all dispute, as to early piety, is his own declaration, in which he expresly says, for our encouragement here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,â€”"I love than that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me."<note n="â€¡" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Prov. 8, 17.</bibl>
               </note>â€”Which abundantly manifests, how pleasing it is to GOD, to have the <hi>Beginning</hi> of life devoted to his service.</p>
            <p>As ornaments are put on to make persons appear lovely, and attracting to others: So, if any would have the great GOD early take delight in them, the only way is to begin early in the practice of virtue and religion, early to seek and serve the LORD. Agreeably we find, that the early piety of <hi>Samuel, Josiah, Timothy,</hi> and others, rendred them, as the word of GOD informs us, objects of the divine complacency and delight.</p>
            <p>WHEN Jesus beheld the <hi>young man,</hi> who had been sober and virtuous from his youth up, it is said, <hi>He loved Him,</hi>

<pb n="18" facs="unknown:009090_0018_0F7001DE58C09410"/>
will love <hi>you</hi> for your piety: For this has a greater excellency.â€”And don't you desire to be beloved by Christ!â€”Don't you desire to be interested in the favour of GOD, thro'a Blessed Redeemer!â€”But not to enlarge here.â€”We must proceed to observeâ€”â€”</p>
            <p>5<hi rend="sup">thly,</hi> THAT early piety is the best ornament for <hi>a youth,</hi> as we are not exposed thereby to those vanities and temptations, to which we are often subjected by others. Ornaments in dress and appearance, as far as decent and becoming christians, are far from being disallowed by the word of GOD:â€”But here is the evil and the iniquity of them,â€”We are apt (especially in youth) to be proud of them, to set our hearts upon them; and so they prove snares to our souls, incentives to our lusts, and moths to our precious time, which ought to be more freely and fully devoted to GOD and his service. But now, as to the ornaments of early piety, they are not only free from all these vanities and temptations, but excellent preventives against them. For they, that wisely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to the advice of our LORD, who exhorts us to "watch and pray," never need to fear being "led into temptation;"<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Mat. 26. 41.</bibl>
               </note> or, at least, they have reason to hope, that they shall not be taken with any temptation, but such as are common to men: For "GOD is faithful,"â€”says St. <hi>Paul,</hi>â€” "who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it."<note n="â€ " place="bottom">

               </note>
            </p>
            <p>6<hi rend="sup">thly,</hi> WE may take notice further here, that the ornaments of true piety are the most lasting orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and therefore, the sooner we are possessed of them, the greater our happiness. Whether it is beauty or strength, sprightliness or wit;â€”whether it
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:009090_0019_0F7001DF24914C30"/>
is the external ornaments of dress and fashion; or whatever it is that youth are apt to value and plume themselves upon; at best, these things are all uncertain, &amp; will quickly fail &amp; vanish away.â€”It is easy with him, who gave, to take away, or cause them all "to consume like a moth."â€”A fit of sickness, a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den casualty, or a Blast from the LORD, may quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly destroy them: And then, where is their boasting, where their joy!â€”It is a world of disappointments in which we live; and therefore, thÃ´ to day we have riches and pleasure, and the ornaments of life at command; yet to morrow, perhaps, an end is put to the pleasing dream,â€”we are stript of all!â€”At farthest, when we die, we must leave these <hi>vanities</hi> behind us, and bid an everlasting adieu to all the pleasures and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments of the present life!â€”But no casualty, no unforeseen event, no <hi>Blast</hi> from the LORD shall ever deprive us of the solid pleasures of religion, of the amiable ornaments of early piety:â€”But early beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with the virtues &amp; graces of the Blessed Spirit, in youth engaged and confirm'd in the service of the LORD, and adorned with the graceful ornaments of religion, the increasing beauties of <hi>early piety</hi> will neither fade in death, nor consume in the grave, but continue to flourish in unfading bloom, through all the scenes of an endless Eternity.</p>
            <p>AND therefore, though we have not so much of the beauty and bravery of the ornaments of dress and fashion, as others; yet, if we have the grace of GOD, and the witness of our consciences, that we have fear'd the LORD from our youth, we have the true wisdom, which is the true riches, and a title to the "durable riches and righteousness," and to the unfading glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the celestial world, which GOD has in store for them that love him; and these "shall be an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament of grace to our head," and infinitely prefer|

able to "chains" of gold "about our neck:" For these shall make our faces to shine, even when the Heavens shall be no more.â€”â€”O let not our youth, then, boast or plume themselves in <hi>this, that,</hi> or <hi>the other</hi> beautiful perfection, or ornament; but let them, that glory, glory in this, that they know the LORD, and have early devoted themselves to his service and glory!<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Jer. 9. 23, 24.</bibl>
               </note>â€”But once more,â€”â€”</p>
            <p>7<hi rend="sup">thly,</hi> WE may observe, that early piety is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly amiable and ornamental, as it is very rare and seldom that we have instances of it. Was it the general practice of the children and youth of GOD's people, as soon as they came to years of moral action, and had capacities of knowing GOD, religion and their duty, to devote themselves to the Fear and Service of God, &amp; sincerely to engage in the practice of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and religion, it would not be so difficult, humane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly speaking, to put on those beautiful ornaments of early piety. But since, in order to this, they must stem the torrent, not only of their own lusts &amp; passions, vicious inclinations and vile affections, but also the same in most, or all their intimates and companions, it renders it peculiarly difficult to become truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious in youth.</p>
            <p>SINCE then, the difficulties to be surmounted, in order to the practice of early piety, are truly great and numerous, it argues an excellent taste, a solid judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, an ardent as well as holy zeal, and a firm and persevering resolution, in such as are truly pious and godly in the morning of life; and that even above their years: Of consequence therefore, as piety in such appears in the melt amiable and advantageous light; so, in proportion to these difficulties, does the beauty, of the ornaments of early piety, shine with an

            <p>IN short, and to sum up all in a word:â€”There is every possible argument, from reason and scripture, of duty and interest, to prove, "that early piety is most amiable, advantageous and ornamental: As it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves the godly youth from innumerable fatal evils, which the profane and thÃ´tless contract and subject themselves to; and as it will save them many bitter reflections, which others must make upon themselves for their folly and madness, in unreasonable delays, when they come to be "ashamed, yea, even confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, because they bear the reproach of their youth:"<note n="â€¡" place="bottom">

nothing more ornamental, nothing more graceful, than early piety.â€”This is spoken for your encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentâ€”But then, least you should think, that I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud you and censure others, you will permit me to deal plainly with you:â€”For I mean not to flatter, but only to encourage the practice of those things, that are excellent &amp; praise-worthy. And therefore, at the same time, that I endeavour to excite in you an holy ambition to appear eminent in the service of the LORD, let me caution and warn you to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and persevering,â€”faithful in the internal, as well as external part of religion;â€”and that you serve the LORD with a perfect heart and willing mind, as well as by an external compliance with your duty.â€”They, and they only, will have a right to <hi>the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of grace</hi> and <hi>crown of glory,</hi> who are found <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere</hi> and <hi>without spot.</hi> O be advised, then, to deal faithfully with yourselves, make diligent search, yea, and frequent researches into your hearts, that you may see what are the springs of action, in your setting yourselves to seek and serve the LORD.â€”<hi>Satan</hi> is a subtil adversary, frequently transforms himself into an angel of light, and, under the guise of religion, ensnares and entraps many unwary souls, and leads them captive at his will, when he could circumvent them no other way.â€”Search and examine critically, then, whether, after all your pretences in religion, this is not your unhappy case?â€”Particularly, ask yourselves, whether you have not, even in your meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for the service of GOD, aim'd more at distinction and notice among <hi>Men,</hi> than at the honour &amp; glory of GOD, in the good of your precious and immortal souls?â€”Whether <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Vanity</hi> are not at the bottom of all your religious services?â€”Verily, Brethren, you are in no small danger from this quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and, alas for you!â€”If you are taken in this

snare, GOD only knows how fatal it may prove:â€”"The end of these things is (oftentimes) Death!"â€”If you have acted from these principles &amp; with these views, in forming yourselves into a <hi>religious Society,</hi> and in meeting together, from time to time, for religious service, you are so far from being the more accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to GOD, that you are more odious and detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: And instead of claiming a right to the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of early piety, you have render'd yourselves utterly unworthy of them.â€”Be advised &amp; exhorted, therefore, as you value your soul's best interest, and as you hope to obtain the rewards of early piety, in a crown of life, which shall never fade away, to see to it, that you are really and truly what you pretend to be; and that you be found <hi>faithful</hi> in the service of the LORD. Then will you find that the rewards of religion are great, and the crown of early piety glorious.

                  <pb n="32" facs="unknown:009090_0032_0F7001E9A5FD0190"/>THIS practice, according to the best information I have had, has been countenanced and encouraged, by the good people of this land, ever since the first settlement of it by the <hi>English</hi> unto this day; and that by some of the best of Ministers, and the best of Men in the Country.â€”Yea, and (if I am not mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken) some of the most <hi>eminent Ministers</hi> of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, to the praise and glory of GOD, have acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the benefit they have received, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency they have made, in such <hi>Schools</hi> of Christ. And thÃ´, in this degenerate age, this practice is too much out of fashion; yet I can't but encourage it, as a thing good in itself, and as what would be much for the glory of GOD, for the honour of Christ, and for the interest of precious and immortal souls.</p>
               <p>SUFFER me then, to propose it to your most seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous consideration,â€”Whether it would not be for your advantage, instruction and edification to join with these your Brethren, in this <hi>Society,</hi> in the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant and profitable work of seeking and serving the LORD?â€”Whether you would not spend the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the Sabbath, after the public exercises were over, more to advantage than you have hitherto done?â€”Whether you would not, in this <hi>School</hi> of Christ, be likely to learn some lessons of instruction, which you would not have so good advantage to learn any where else?â€”And whether these exercises of <hi>Prayer, reading the Scriptures</hi> and books agreeable thereto would not have an happy tendency to lead and assist you in your more private meditations and addresses to subjects, thoughts, words and expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, more agreeable to truth, and to the word of GOD, which is a general transcript of his nature and perfections, and of our duty resulting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from?â€”â€”</p>

                  <pb n="33" facs="unknown:009090_0033_0F7001EA82318600"/>PARTICULARLY, would'nt these exercises of <hi>read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, prayer,</hi> &amp;c. in the presence of your Brethren, be of peculiar advantage to you, to prepare you to act your part well as Christians and Heads of families, when you come to be settled in the world;â€”to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish you with decent expressions, to assist you in a readiness of thought and utterance, when called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to offer morning and evening sacrifices to GOD, in your own houses, to instruct your families, and the like?â€”Next to a total disregard of GOD and religion, the chief reasons, why the great duty of <hi>family prayer</hi> is so frequently neglected, are first, a consciousness of our unacquaintedness with the duty of prayer, and then, a fear that we shall not express ourselves with decency and propriety before others: And so, through pride and ignorance, the duty is neglected. Now attending these meetings, and bearing a part in them, with seriousness and devotion, would, in part, at least, if not wholly remove these difficulties, and have an happy tendency to prepare us for like duties in our own houses and families; and of consequence have a good tendency to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the interest of religion, in our hearts and lives, ever afterwards.</p>
               <p>BUT, perhaps, you look upon these things at a <hi>great distance;</hi> and are ready to say <q>It will be many years before we shall have the care of families, if ever we have; and it will be time enough then to acquaint ourselves with these duties, when we are called to put them in practice. For the present, we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no necessity to perplex ourselves about them.</q> Left some such suggestions as these should take off the force and conclusiveness of this agreement, I shall not rest the matter here, but beg you would seriously weigh one consideration more:â€”And that is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you have not good reason to hope for the divine

               <p>THESE things, then, are proposed to your most serious consideration:â€”I entreat you, as you value your soul's best interest, to given them their due weight in your minds, and calmly judge for yourselves what is right for you to do in this matter, and then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your conduct accordingly.â€”â€”</p>
               <p>BUT whatever is the result of your deliberation, as to this, there is one thing, which demands your at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and I pray you for GOD's sake and your own souls sake to think much upon it, and to real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ize, that the day, the <hi>important day,</hi> is hastning
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:009090_0035_0F7001EBF22D46A0"/>
upon us, when "we must <hi>all</hi> appear before the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment seat of Christ," to give an account of all our ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents &amp; priviledges, of all the means &amp; seasons of grace, "and receive the things done in the body, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what we have done, whether it be good or bad."<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  </note>â€”To be ready for this awfull day is therefore of the greatest importance to you, and to us all. O let this when be our greatest concern!</p>
               <p>AND now, that you, and I, and all of us may be able to give up our account "with joy did not with grief," and that we "may be found of our Judge in peace, without spot, and blameless" at his coming and kingdom. <note n="â€ " place="bottom">
