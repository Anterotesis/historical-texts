            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>THERE are some who would be estemed <hi>the Wits</hi> of the world, that <hi>Ridicule</hi> those as <hi>Superstitious</hi> and Weak persons, which look upon Dreadful Tempests as <hi>Predromous</hi> of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Judgments. Nevertheless, The most Learned and Judicious Writers, not only of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> but amongst <hi>Christians</hi> have Embraced such a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion; their Sentiments therein be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Confirmed by the Experience of many Ages. It may be, it will not be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether Unedifying, for me on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to mention some few Instances of unusual Storms, which have been the forerunners of greater Calamities im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately following them. That such tremendous Dispensations of Providence

The next Year the <hi>Arian</hi> Persecution under the Emperour <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinian</hi> was a terrible Judgment. <hi>A. D.</hi> 1620. There was a fearful Tempest throughout <hi>Switzerland,</hi> immediately up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which horrendous Popish Cruelties ensued. But it has more often been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, that such Tempests have been the forerunners of most bloody Wars, and popular Commotions. I know not whether any History does mention a more dismal Storm than that which hapned in the Low Countries, in the Year 1421 causing a Flood which overwhelmed Seventy Six Villages, and destroyed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove an Hundred Thousand Persons; which J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>These Examples with many more, too long with the Circumstances of them to be here recited, should awaken the world out of its <hi>Lethargy</hi>: which would be the way to avert the <hi>Omen</hi> of such Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentous Providences. For we know that when the most high God sees cause to menace Nations, whether by His Word, or by His awful Works, these Threatnings are Conditional. <hi>When He speaks con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a Nation to destroy it, if that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against whom He has Pronounced turn from their Evils, He will Repent of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil that He thought to do unto them.</hi> However it shall be, Certain it is, that <hi>the Voice of God</hi> who sometimes spoke to <hi>Job</hi> out of <hi>the Whirlwind</hi> is speaking to the Nations in that <hi>Stormy Wind</hi> which has <hi>Fulfilled His Word,</hi> in a manner most terrible.</p>

This man in the Month of <hi>July</hi> 1682. said, he had some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else to do than to Dy as yet: he was resolved to dispatch some business in the Countrey first. The next day after he had thus irreligiously Expressed himself, the Lightning by which he was wont to Swear, Killed him before he could be at leasure to Dy, or could finish his <hi>Rural Affairs.</hi>

But in speaking to them, the Psalmist reflects upon the Idolatry of the Nations in the world, who were won't to Worship the Hosts of Heaven. Whereas if the Stars had Rational Souls, and were able to speak, they were bound to Praise God that made them. Then the Psalmist descends, (in <hi>ver.</hi> 4.) to the Lowest Heavens, <hi>viz.</hi> the Air. He speaks to the <hi>Waters above the Heavens,</hi> viz. <hi>the Clouds</hi> which are above the Air, that they should Praise the Lord. Lastly, He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends to the Earth and Sea, and calls upon all Creatures therein that they should Praise the Lord. In the former part of this Verse, he speaks to the <hi>Fire and the Hail, the Snow and Vapour.</hi> That is to say, both hot and cold Vapours that they should Praise the Lord. And still

Sometimes by Storms at Sea; 'so it was with <hi>Jonah,</hi> and those that were with him Sailing to <hi>Tarshish.</hi> Jon. 1.4. <hi>A great Wind made a mighty Tempest in the Sea</hi>; so as that the Vessel had like to have been broken. Thus the Disciples being on the Sea, Mar, 4.37. there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose a great <hi>Storm of Wind,</hi> and the Waves beat into the Ship, which caused them to Cry to the Lord Jesus Christ, <hi>Carest thou not that we Perish?</hi> The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle <hi>Paul,</hi> when he was at Sea, and an Hundred and Seventy Six persons with him, there was a <hi>Tempest</hi> so great, as that <hi>all Hopes that they should be saved was taken away.

His Providence in raising the Stormy wind. As Rain proceeds from Natural Causes: the Vapour which ariseth out of the Earth by the influence the Sun hath upon it, produces Rain. Job 36.27. <hi>He maketh the Drops of water according to the Vapour thereof.</hi> The Rain is more or less according to the quantity of the Vapour.

Amos 9.6. <hi>The waters of the Sea He pours them on the Earth.</hi> The Rain is generated out of the waters of the Sea, and so pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Earth. And therefore when the Prophet <hi>Elijah</hi> had it revealed unto him that there should be a mighty Rain, he sent his Servant to look towards the Sea. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18.43.

For that He has as much power to dispose of the Wind, as any man has of that which is his Treasure, that he may dispose of as he wi'd. Thus we see that God is <hi>the Lord of Hosts,</hi> and therefore all Creatures are ordered by Him. Well then might the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> speak, as in. Isa. 29.6. <hi>Thou shalt be visited by the Lord of Hosts, with Thunder, with Storm and Tempest, and the Flame of devouring Fire.</hi> God who is the Lord of Hosts, orders such visitation for the Children of men here in the world.</p>
                     <p>PROP. III. <hi>The God of Heaven has Holy Ends in it, when He does visit the Earth with dreadful Storms and Tempests.</hi> He has Infinite Reason for what He does: He does nothing in vain. In the Day of the Revelation of the righteous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, all the world will see that at is so.</p>
                     <p>But more particularly;</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Sometimes God sends dreadful Storms in Mercy.</hi> In mercy to those that are His. Some of the Elect of God, have by such Providences been brought to the acknowledgment of the Great God, so
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:001183_0026_0FB0FF7BE9B78CD8"/>
as to seek and serve Him. Psal. 83.15. <hi>Persecute them with thy Tempest, and make them afraid with thy Storm, that they may seek thy Name.</hi> God sometimes causes Storms and Tempests to make men seek his Name, humbly to fall down before Him, and beg for his Favour. Some Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, Graceless Souls have thereby been Awakened to Pray. <hi>Psal.</hi> 107.23. They that go down to the Sea in Ships, see the wonders of God in the Deep; He raiseth <hi>the Stormy Wind,</hi> they mount up to the Heaven, and go down to the Deep; they reel to &amp; fro, &amp; are at their wits ends: And, ver. 28. <hi>Then they Cry to the Lord,</hi> and He saves them out of their Distresses. Some that have lived without God in the world, yet when they have been in terrible storms at Sea, they have Cryed and Prayed to God. And altho' it be sadly true, that most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly men that have done so, after the Storm is over, and they delivered from their Fears &amp; Dangers, forget the God of their salvation. Nevertheless, it is not so with all. It is not wont to be so with the Elect of God, whom He hath purposes of mercy unto. They will never forget the Storms which they met with at Sea,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:001183_0027_0FB0FF7D31849ED8"/>
and their Sea-Deliverances, and the Vows they have made to God to be His Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. Thus the Marriners that were with <hi>Jonah,</hi> Jon. 1.15. After God had sent a terrible Storm on them, and had wonderfully Delivered them, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>is said, <hi>the men feared the Lord Exceedingly,</hi> and therefore Sacrificed and made Vows. Did they not make Vows that they would be the servants of true God as long as they lived? And indeed that Storm proved a Mercy to the greatest City in the world. It did occasion the Prophet <hi>Jonah,</hi> to go and Preach the Word of God to them, which else he had not done, whereby many of them were brought to Repentance. Many times, that Storm which is a Judgment to some, proves a Mercy to others. The Storm that hapned on our Coast Yesterday and the Day before,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>This was Preached the</hi> 9<hi>th. of April,</hi> 1704.</note> has proved a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy unto us, in that the <hi>French Privateer</hi> designing to do us hurt, has suffered Shipwreck; a Stormy Wind has done more for us in one Day, than we have for a long time done for our selves. But it is the Lord that hath done it. The
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:001183_0028_0FB0FF7EAC984668"/>
same storm that sends some to Hell, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries others to Heaven. The Prophet <hi>Elijah went up by a whirlwind into Heaven.</hi> 2 King. 2.11. Many that belong to God have been translated to Heaven by a stormy Whirlwind, which has then been a Mercy to them. Yea, sometimes a dreadful Storm, has proved a Mercy to a whole Nation. So did that Hail-storm, which fell on the Army of the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> who were the Enemies of the Lords People, in the dayes of <hi>Joshua,</hi> when God did cast down Hail-stones from heaven which discomsited and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed them. A dreadful <hi>Storm</hi> that hapned when the <hi>Israelitish</hi> Nation was under the Government of a Woman as the Chief Ruler, it was a National Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to the People of God. It is said con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their Eenemies, That <hi>the River of Kishan swept them away.</hi> Judg. 5.21 Writers tell us, that the <hi>River Kishon</hi> was fordable; ordinarily men might safely wade over it, but a sudden Storm raised the River so as that when the <hi>Canaanites</hi> in their Flight attempted to pass over it, they were drowned in it. And besides what is mentioned in the Scriptures, I may put you in mind of
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:001183_0029_0FB0FF8029F63000"/>
other instances, in which Storms have proved a great Mercy to the Church of God. So it was in the Dayes of the Emperor <hi>Theodosius,</hi> when he was sorely distressed, and his Christian Army in extream danger of being routed &amp; ruined, the Lord by a Tempest caused the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of the Enemy to turn upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, so that the Good Emperour and the Christians with him obtained a Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Victory. In the Year 719. a stor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my Wind scattered a great Navy of the <hi>Saracens</hi> who were then infecting the Christian world, so that scarce Ten Ships of many Scores escaped that Destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Holland</hi> has often suffered much by Storms and Inundations. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless that which hapned 1574. was a Mercy to that Nation: For it delivered them from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who were then Encamped before <hi>Leyden.</hi> The <hi>English</hi> Nation ought never to forget the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable 1588. when the Spanish <hi>Armada</hi> thought to carry all before them, but they were in part destroyed by Storms; so that the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> blasphemously said upon it, That the Four Elements were become <hi>Lutherans</hi>; and that God Almighty was a <hi>Lutheran</hi> on that Day.
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:001183_0030_0FB0FF82CD78CAA0"/>
So then dreadful Storms have sometimes been a Mercy to the Lords People, and therefore God sent them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>For the most part, such Storms are sent by the Providence of God as a sign of His Displeasure for the Sins of men.</hi> As <hi>Elihu</hi> said, <hi>Job</hi> 37.13. They come <hi>for Correction.</hi> They come as a Judgment. There is a real Truth couched in that Fiction of the Poet, That <hi>Pallas</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed a whole Fleet for the wickedness which one <hi>Ajax</hi> had been Guilty of. We know that Thousands fared the worse for the sin of one <hi>Achan.</hi> And certain it is, that the sin of one man in a Vessel, may cause the most High to send a storm that shall endanger all the Ships Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. Therefore <hi>Jonah</hi> made a most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous Confession, Jon. 1.12. <hi>I know</hi> (said he) <hi>that this great Tempest is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you for my sake.</hi> When there was an unusual <hi>Thunder Storm</hi> in the Land of Israel, <hi>Samuel</hi> told them that it was a sign of Gods displeasure, and that they had been guilty of great Iniquity in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting that <hi>Theocracy</hi> which they had been blest under, and desiring a Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in their Government to the heathen Nations. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.16, 17. When God
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:001183_0031_0FB0FF83EFF661A0"/>
rained down an horrible Tempest on <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha,</hi> it was because there were <hi>Crying Sins</hi> in that place. And as to that dreadful Storm in the Nations of <hi>Europe,</hi> which has occasioned me to Preach on this subject, we may believe that it is come as an intimation of the Displeasure of the most high God, and that He has a <hi>Controversy with the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> The Anger of God is often in Scripture set forth by that <hi>Metaphor</hi> and <hi>Comparison</hi> of <hi>Stormy Winds.</hi> Jer. 23.19. <hi>A whirlwind of the Lord shall go forth in sury.</hi> God said concerning the Wall that the False Prophets had been building, Ezek. 13.13. <hi>I will rend it with a Stormy Wind in my Fury.</hi> Stormy Winds are oftentimes a sign of Gods Fury. And so may we fear with respect to the late Storm in the <hi>European</hi> Nations. The Queen of <hi>England</hi> has Published a Pious Proclamation, <q>In which Shee declares, that the like astonishing Calamity has not befallen that Kingdome in the memory of any person living therein. And that Shee must needs acknowlege it is a <hi>Token of Divine Displeasure,</hi> and that it was the Infinite Mercy of GOD, that the QUEEN and all Her
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:001183_0032_0FB0FF87328EFA58"/>
People were not Destroyed; and has therefore Commanded a FAST, to be observed throughout all the Realm; Charging Her Subjects to Pray to GOD, for the Pardon of the Crying Sins of the Nation, which have drawn down this heavy Judgment.</q> Blessed be God for that Royal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>The Providence of God does some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times send such Storms as Prognostick's and terrible Warnings of Great Iudgments not far off.</hi> Terrible Judgments are used to follow Stormy Winds. When Enemies break in suddenly upon a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, a Storm falls upon them. <hi>David</hi> sayes, Psal. 55.8. Oh! that I had wings like a Dove, that I might hasten my Escape from the <hi>Windy Storm and Tempest.</hi> What is that <hi>Windy Storm</hi>? Was it not <hi>Absoloms</hi> Rebellion? Which put the Land into horrible Confusion. It is said, <hi>Isa.</hi> 28.2. The Lord has <hi>a Tempest and a Destroying Storm.</hi> What was that, but the Army of the King of <hi>Assyria,</hi> who made dreadful Desolation in the Land? The Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> saw <hi>a Whirlwind coming out of the North.</hi> Ezek. 1.4. What was that, but the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi>
                        <pb n="34" facs="unknown:001183_0033_0FB0FF8952FA8D10"/>
and his dreadful Army? So as to these latter Ages, the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> has fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, That <hi>the King of the North shall come like a Whirlwind on the King of the South.</hi> Dan. 11.40. When the <hi>Turks</hi> broke in upon the <hi>Southern</hi> Nations, then was that Whirlwind. Now as Desolating Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are compared to <hi>Stormy Wind,</hi> so dreadful Tempest are signs of such Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and that the Dayes are approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when we must expect <hi>Great Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> That the Day is at hand, when God will <hi>Overturn, Overturn, Overturn</hi>: Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Storms come to be <hi>Prognostick</hi>; and Intimations of it. Yea, the Coming of <hi>JESUS CHRIST the Son of God,</hi> to Judge the world, will have Storms to be the forerunners of it One sign mentioned as Prodromous of it, is, <hi>That there shall be Earthquakes in diverse places.</hi> Luk. 21.11. Many times terrible Storms are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with <hi>Earthquakes</hi>: As we hear that Storm in <hi>November</hi> last, was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with an Earthquake in diverse places. And Earthquakes are usually at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with dreadful Storms. So in that Earthquake in <hi>Sicily,</hi> a few Years ago, when an hundred and forty Thousand fouls went down alive into the Pit in
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:001183_0034_0FB0FF8AACD9D3A8"/>
a moment of Time, there were Dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Stormy Winds, Thunder, Lightning, Rain; such things must be as forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Great Day, when Christ will come to take possession of this lower world. Another sign mentioned of the Lords coming, is, That <hi>the Sea and the Waves shall Roar.</hi> ver. 25. You know it was so in the late dreadful Storm. How did the <hi>Sea and the Waves Roar</hi>? The words may admit of a Mystical Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, that there will be Storms of War among the Nations, which will put them into strange Confusions; the like not known in the world. We may also interpret the words Literally, That fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Storms and Tempests shall be sent as Prognosticks that the Coming of the Lord draws nigh.</p>
                     <p>The late Tempest seems to be the more <hi>Ominous,</hi> in that it comes in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with other awful Providences. At a Time when the Kingdoms are moved, when Nations are shaking. When there is Distress of Nations, with great Perplexity: Mens Hearts failing them with Fear and Expectation of the things that are coming on the Earth. The Almighty God ha's cast the Nations

into Travailing Pains. And is not what we see ARCHE ODINON. Mat. 24.8. <hi>The beginning of Sorrows,</hi> Will not these throws issue in some great Birth? Since the Lord is at this Day shaking the Heavens and the Earth, and the Sea, &amp; the Dry Land, may we not hope that e're long, <hi>The Desire of all Nations will come</hi>?</p>

                        <p n="1">1. <hi>If, Afflictive Storms do not come to pass but by the Providence of God, then the like is to be said concerning all other Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, That there is a Divine Providence Ordering of them.</hi> Affliction comes not

forth of the Dust, nor does Trouble spring out of the Ground. No, It has an higher Original. The hand of Heaven is in it. Indeed as to the Evil of Sin, God is not, nor can He be the Author of it. He can't look upon that Evil. He is of purer Eyes than to behold Iniquity. But as for Evils of Punishment, they are all from Him. Sin is Evil and has no Good in it, but the Punishment of Sin is Good. Thence there is no Punishment, no Affliction whatsoever but it is from Him. Amos 3.6. <hi>Is there any Evil in the City, and the Lord has not done it?</hi> There is no Evil of Affliction but the Lord has done it. If we speak of <hi>Particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal Afflictions,</hi> the Word of the Lord is fulfilled in them. If a man is afflicted in his Body, with painful Diseases; if he is chastened with Pain on his Bed, and the multitude of his Bones with strong Pains, it is the Lord that orders that affliction for him. If he is afflicted by Losses as to his outward Estate, altho' men may be Instruments therein; Pirates, or Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers may take his Estate from him, yet it is the Lord that has done it. Isa. 42.24. <hi>Who gave Jacob to the Spoil, and Israel to the Robbers, did not the Lord, He against
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:001183_0037_0FB0FF90004C04F0"/>

                           </gap>nder, the Word of the Lord is fulfilled in that Affliction also. Therefore when <hi>David</hi> was Reviled by a wicked <hi>Shimei,</hi> he was wonderfully patient, considering as in 2 Sam. 16.10. <hi>The Lord hath said to Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mei, Curse David.</hi> If a man is afflicted by the loss of his Liberty, if he is made a Captive, or a Prisoner, the Word of the Lord is fulfilled in that Affliction. When <hi>Joseph</hi> was sold for a Slave into <hi>Egypt, the Word of the Lord tried him,</hi> and <hi>Joseph</hi> said afterward to his Brethren; Gen. 45.8. <hi>It was God that sent me hither, not you.</hi> There was a mighty Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ordering that Affliction for <hi>Ioseph,</hi> in order to the Salvation of many Lives and Souls. Or, is any afflicted (as many are in these sad Times) with the loss of Friends, of near and dear Relations? It is the Word of the Lord that has or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that Affliction for them. And therefore that Godly Widow <hi>Naomi,</hi> who was in great Bitterness for the death of both her Sons, said, Ruth 1.21. <hi>The Lord has Testified against me, the Almighty has Afflicted me, and dealt very Bitterly
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:001183_0038_0FB0FF9169CCCA58"/>
with me.</hi> So <hi>Iob</hi> when he lost not only his Estate, but his Children too, in one dismal Day, sayes, Job 1.21. <hi>The Lord has taken away, Blessed be the Name of the Lord.</hi> It was a <hi>Stormy Wind</hi> that <hi>took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi> his Children from him, which he was not unacquainted with; but for all that he said, <hi>It is the Lord</hi> that has done it. And if Personal Afflictions are from the Providence of God, then much more may it be said, and ought to be believed concerning Publick Judgments, that <hi>the Word of the Lord</hi> is in them. If a People is Afflicted with scarcity of Provision, it is God that orders such an Affliction for them. Amos 4.6. <hi>I</hi> (sayes the Lord) <hi>have given you cleanness of Teeth, and want of Bread.</hi> If there is want of Rain, it is the Lord that has called for a Drought on the Land: ver. 7. <hi>I witheld the Rain from you, I caused it to Rain on one City, and caused it not to Rain on another City.</hi> Or, if there are Blastings on the Fruits of the Earth, it is the Lord that brings that Affliction. ver. 9. <hi>I have smitten you w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and the Palmer-worm,</hi> (sayes God) <hi>they were my great Army which I sent among you.</hi> So when Contagious, Epidemical and Mortal, Diseases break in upon a People, it is the Lord that has sent that Besome of Destruction among them. When the Pestilence was in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and there was not one House throughout the Land but the Plague was in it, it was God that sent it. Psal 78.50. <hi>He delivered their Lives unto the Petilence.</hi> The like is to be said concerning that Calamity of <hi>War,</hi> it is the Lord that sends it. He makes Peace, and He <hi>Creates Evil.</hi> That Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>the Sword</hi> is by way of Eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy called, <hi>Evil.</hi> Isa. 45.7. When the <hi>Reubenites</hi> made War upon the <hi>Hagarites,</hi> and overcame an hundred Thousand of them, tis said, 1 Chron. 5.22. <hi>The War was of God.</hi> Afterwards, the <hi>Reubenites</hi> were overcome by the <hi>Assyrians,</hi> who Killed many, and Captivated many, now tis said, ver. 26. That <hi>the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of the King of Assyria,</hi> who carried them away. Altho' <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar</hi> in making War upon the <hi>Jews</hi> had his Ambition and Revenge, he fulfilled the Word of the Lord in what he did. It is therefore said, 1 Chron.
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:001183_0040_0FB0FF96BA332B80"/>
6. 15. <hi>The Lord carried away Judah and Jerusalem, by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar.</hi> Twas God that did it, tho' <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi> was the instrument. That <hi>Whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind out of the North,</hi> could never have overset the City of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> if the Word of the Lord had not been in it. Lam. 3 37. <hi>Who is he that sayes and it comes to pass, if the Lord Command it not?</hi> The Emperor of <hi>Babylon</hi> might deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine to lay <hi>Jerusalem</hi> wast, but it would never have come to pass, if the Lord had not Commanded it. But especially when there is (as at this Day there is) a Flame of War broke out among many Nations, the Word of the Lord has done it. When there is a War in which many Nations are concerned, it causes a mighty Storm in the Earth. Thus when the two Greatest Kings in the world fell out, and were engaged in a bloody War. (Namely, the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> and the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi>) it put a great part of the Earth into a Combustion. There was in it a notable fulfilment of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree and Providence of God, and of what the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> had foretold, who had Prophesied of <hi>a Tumultuous noise of Nations, and Kingdoms, the Lord of

Our thoughts should be on Him who Rules in the Armies of Heaven.

It does so in His bringing Rain, especially great <hi>Storms of Rain.</hi> Job 37.7. <hi>The great Rain of His Strength.</hi> God shews his Strength, His Power in great Rains sometimes. So in His overruling the Wind, Isa. 27.8. <hi>He stayes the East-wind, in the day of His Rough-wind.</hi> God has done marvellous things sometimes by <hi>Stormy-winds.</hi> He has rent Mountains thereby.

when all the Earth was overflown, that the highest Mountains were fifteen Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits under water. God by making a wind pass over the Earth, turned back the waters again, and caused the dry Land to appear. Gen. 8.1. So then He is a Great God and greatly to be Feared. It is said of the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> that when God sent an unsual Thunder Storm among them, They <hi>feared the Lord greatly.</hi> 1 Sam. 12.18. And in <hi>Ezra's</hi> time, when there was such a Storm of Rain as did threaten a Famine, Ezr. 10.9. <hi>All the People trembled because of the Great Rain.</hi> You heard the last Lords Day, that when God sent a <hi>mighty Tempest,</hi> the Sea-men who were Sailing to <hi>Tarshish, feared the Lord Exceedingly.</hi> God has made men to stand in awe of Him (and they ought to do so) by such Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations of his Providence. They should fear to offend so Great a God. Psal. 65.8. <hi>They that dwell in the utmost parts of the Earth are afraid at thy tokens.</hi> That is to say, at the tokens of thy Displeasure. And what are those tokens of the Anger of God? Thunder, Lightning, Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes, Stormy Winds, Dreadful Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests, and the like. These are the tokens
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:001183_0046_0FB0FFA069ABB980"/>
of Gods Anger, and the effects of His Power, that should make men afraid. Shall not poor mortal Creatures be afraid to offend that God, who can by a <hi>Stormy Wind</hi> blow them into Everlasting De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction when he pleases. Fear Him, yea, I say unto you, Fear Him.</p>

It is said of a sinner, Job 27.21. <hi>An East wind takes him away, and a Storm hurles him out of his place.</hi> God can soon raise such a Whirlwind as none of his Enemies shall be able to stand before it. As He threatned <hi>Rabbath,</hi> the chief City among the Amonites. Amos 1.14. That it should be destroyed with a <hi>Tempest</hi> in <hi>the Day of the whirlwind.</hi> Such a Whirlwind is coming on the wicked of the Earth Jer. 23.19. <hi>A whirlwind of the Lord shall go forth, and it shall fall grievously on the Head of the wicked.</hi> There is then no standing before that God, who can by His Word do such things.

For some were so wicked as to bid open Defiance to the Judgments of God. That very Day the Storm was, in a Play-house they acted Thunder and Lightning, and the falling down of Chimnies, the Audience clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping their Hands, and making themselves Sport thereat. Be Astonished at this, O ye Heavens! Will not the Lord be aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on such a Nation as this!

Even as the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> were preserved from the destroying Angel, when every house in <hi>Egypt</hi> felt his power, &amp; the anger of God in it. If we are in Christ, why should we fear? We need not fear let the Times be never so dismal: let never such Storms arise in the world we need nor fear. As the Church said, <hi>We will not fear, tho' the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains be removed into the midst of the Sea, &amp; the Waters roar.</hi> So, if we have an interest in Christ, altho' as terrible a Storm should come on the whole Earth, as there was in <hi>Noahs</hi> Flood, we need not fear.

                  <p>THERE are Five Psalms which begin and end with the word <hi>Hallelujah</hi>; that some have styled the <hi>Hallelujatical</hi> Psalms. This is one of them. As for the Penman of it, there is nothing certain to be fixed on. Some have thought it was written by <hi>Nehemiah</hi>; on occasion of the Re-build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the City of <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> The Seventy Greek Interpreters, suppose that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Haggai,</hi> or <hi>Zechariah</hi> were the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of it, whose Names are in their Translation prefixed to it. But they are not in the Hebrew Original, therefore nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may we affirm them to be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:001183_0069_0FB0FFC8362EE150"/>
of it. As for the matter of it, it is <hi>Hortatory.</hi> The Psalmist does call first upon all in General, and then upon <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi> in Special, to Praise the Lord. Several Arguments are mentioned as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements thereunto.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Those Temporal Blessings that God had Graciously favoured them with. In that their City Gates were set up &amp; made strong, and that their Children, that is to say, the Inhabitants of the City were blessed and increased, and that Peace &amp; Plenty was restored to them after much Trouble.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He does Excite them to Praise God on the account of His Providence in the Works of Nature, causing them to be for the benefit of His People. In that He makes the Winter and the Summer, in the several Vicissitudes thereof. The Winter is Described in this, and in the 17. <hi>ver.</hi> The Spring and the Summer are mentioned in the 18. <hi>ver.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. And then he concludes with those pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Spiritual Blessings which <hi>Jerusalem</hi> had above others, <hi>viz.</hi> The Word of God and His Ordinances.</p>
                  <p>The words before us to insist on, fall under the Second of these Particulars,
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:001183_0070_0FB0FFC9AC81C0C8"/>
in which we hear the inspired man of God calling on the Lords People to Praise Him on the account of what He does in the Winter. We are at this Day in the midst of Winter, and therefore I have singled out the words which have been read, as s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>iting with the present works of Divide Providence.</p>
                  <p>DOCT. <hi>That Men ought to Praise the Great GOD because He gives Snow like-Wool.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Three PROPOSITIONS will come under our Consideration, all contained in the Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>PROP. I. <hi>That the Snow is fitly resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to Wool.</hi> Snow like Wool sayes the Psalmist. And not only the Sacred wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but others make use of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison. The Grecians of old were won't to call the Snow, ERIODES HUDOR, <hi>Wooly Water,</hi> or wet Wool. The Latin word <hi>Floccus,</hi> signifies both a Lock of Wool and a Flake of Snow, in that they resemble one another. The aptness of the similitude appears in three things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>In respect of the Whiteness thereof.</hi> Isa. 1.18. The Lord sayes to His People, tho'
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:001183_0071_0FB0FFCB34DFB0B8"/>
your sins have been as Scarlet, they shall be <hi>white as Snow,</hi> tho' red like Crimson, they shall be <hi>as Wool.</hi> Scarlet and Crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son are of a red Colour, and Snow and Wool of a white. Altho' there is Black Wool, and in some parts of the world there is Snow that will turn Red after it has lain long on the Earth, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, usually Whiteness is the Colour of it. It is a Scripture Expression, <hi>white as snow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>In respect of Softness.</hi> Hence is the Proverbial Expression, <hi>As soft as wool.</hi> So as soft as snow. When it first falls on the Ground, if a man should fall on it, he'l receive no more hurt thereby than if he should fall on Wool. It is near akin to water in respect of the softness of it. This our senses confirm I am not ignorant, that some late Enquirers into the works of Nature, suppose a Snowy Cloud to be an infinite Number of Icicles, and that Snow is Ice, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hard. We must then call it woolly Ice.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Third and Chief reason of the Comparison, is, <hi>In respect of that warming Vertue that does attend the Snow.</hi> Wool is warm. We say, <hi>As warm as Wool.</hi> Woolen-cloth has a greater warmth than
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:001183_0072_0FB0FFCE9ED5F778"/>
other Cloathing has. The wool on Sheep keeps them warm in the Winter season. So when the back of the Ground is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with Snow, it keeps it warm. Some mention it as one of the wonders of the Snow, that tho' it is it self cold, yet it makes the Earth warm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalists observe, that there is a saline spirit in it, which is hot, by means whereof Plants under the Snow are kept from freezing. Ice under the snow is sooner melted and broken than other Ice. In some Northern Climates, the wild barbarous People use to cover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves over with it to keep them warm. When the sharp Air has begun to freeze a mans Limbs, Snow will bring heat into them again. If persons Eat much Snow, or drink immoderately of Snow-water, it will burn their Bowels and make them black. So that it has a warming vertue in it, and is therefore fitly compared to Wool.</p>
                  <p>PROP. II. <hi>The Snow is a work of God.</hi> It is He <hi>who gives</hi> Snow like Wool. The Great God owns and challengeth the Snow to be His Creature. Job 38.22, 23. <hi>The treasures of the Snow which I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.</hi> We see God challenges the
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:001183_0073_0FB0FFCFA9C29128"/>
Snow as His property. He and He only has power to dispose of it. As other the like <hi>Meteors</hi> (as they use to be called) are His work. It is said in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text before us, that He <hi>Scattereth the hoar frost like Ashes.</hi> And the Ice is ascribed to God as His Creature. <hi>He casteth forth His Ice like Morsels.</hi> Job 38.29. <hi>Out of whose womb came the Ice, and the Hoary Frost of Heaven, who has gendred it</hi>? It is the mighty God that makes the soft wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hard thereby. So Job. 37.10. <hi>By the Breath of God Frost is given, and the breadth of the Waters is strained.</hi> The Frost drinks up the Waters, and straitens them. The old description of Ice, that it is <hi>Copia Aquae in Augusto,</hi> a great deal of water in a little room; late Philosophers approve not of. But we are certain that the <hi>Breath of God,</hi> that is the <hi>cold freezing Wind,</hi> is the cause of it; which <hi>Wind</hi> proceeding from the Providence of God, is therefore called His <hi>Breath.</hi> So again, the Rain is another <hi>Meteor</hi> that God is said to give. Job 38.28. <hi>Has the Rain a Father? Who has begotten the drops of the Dew</hi>? The meaning is, that it is Gods Creature. The Rain has no Father but that God who is the Creator and Father
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:001183_0074_0FB0FFD406E6A1D0"/>
of all things. Jer. 14. ult. <hi>Can any of the Vanities of the Gentiles,</hi> that is their Idols, <hi>cause Rain? Can the Heavens give Showers</hi>? They cannot of themselves give Showers. It is true that there are Natural causes of the one and the other. For Snow &amp; Rain are no miraculous things, but that which according to the constitued order of Nature useth to happen. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, the concurrence of Second Causes does not hinder, but imply the Effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of the First Cause. God is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the Scripture, said to do that which He does not do by His own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Hand, but which He makes use of Instruments or Secondary Causes in the Effecting of. The Snow is said to be the Gift and Dispensation of God.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>In that the matter out of which it is generated is of Gods making.</hi> The Snow is made out of the Elements: But those Elements God the Almighty made by His own Infinite Power. There is <hi>Fire</hi> and Light in the very Snow. But who made the Fire? It was as all other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are, originally from God. Some late <hi>Astronomers</hi> have observed, that there is a mighty <hi>Ocean of Fire</hi> in the body of the Sun. It is the Great God that has
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:001183_0075_0FB0FFD4EAF40090"/>
made that Fire. He hath placed it in the Heavens: <hi>Nothing can be hid from the heat thereof.</hi> Psal. 19.6. There is <hi>Air</hi> in the Snow, as appears by the Levity of it. God made the Air. There is <hi>Water</hi> in the Snow, you see it melts into Water. God made the Water. There is <hi>Earth</hi> in the Snow, when it is distilled Earthly particles are observed in it. God made the Earth. So then the Snow is Gods work. The Snow is generated as the Rain is, <hi>viz.</hi> by the influence of the Sun and Stars, Exhaling Vapours from the Earth and Sea, which are turned into Clouds of rain, and into Clouds of snow by the Providence of God: And there is a Glorious Providence of God in cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing it to be so. The holy Prophets of old were affected with the Contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it. We see the Prophet <hi>Ieremiah</hi> was so. Jer. 10.13. And hence when there was a sad Drought on the Land of <hi>Israel,</hi> the Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> speaks, as in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos 5.8. <hi>Seek to Him that makes the Seven Stars and Orion.</hi> That is to say, that makes Summer and Winter. The <hi>Seven Stars</hi> are the Summer Constellation, they bring on the spring and summer; and <hi>Orion</hi> is a Winter Constellation, which
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:001183_0076_0FB0FFD68FBB9680"/>
is attended with snow and cold, as at this Day.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The Snow is wholly at Gods Disposal, and therefore His Creature.</hi> There is not a Flake of snow that falls on the Ground without the hand of God. Mat. 10.29, 30. Not a sparrow falls to the Ground without the Will of your Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>all the Hairs of your head are numbred.</hi> So the Great God has numbred all the Flakes of Snow that covers the Earth. Altho' no man can number them, that God that tells the number of the Stars has numbred them all. Who is it that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders where the Snow shall fall? Amos 4.7. (sayes the Lord) <hi>cause it to Rain on one City and not on another.</hi> So the Lord causes it to Snow on one part of the Earth, and not on another. As we often see, in such a place there is but little snow, go but a few miles further there is a mighty snow. It is God that orders as <hi>Where,</hi> so <hi>When</hi> the snow shall fall, and how long it shall continue on the Ground, and what Effects it shall have; all these things are ordered by Him. Job 37.12. <hi>He turns about the Clouds according to His Counsel, they do whatsoever He Commands them in all the Earth.</hi> Psal.
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:001183_0077_0FB0FFD812EF7150"/>
148. 8. <hi>Firs and Hail, Snow and Vapour, and Stormy Wind fulfilling His Word.</hi> If there is a storm of Lightning, or a storm of Hail, or a storm of Snow, or a storm of Wind, all these fulfil His Word. So then this is His work; and indeed His only. Men can't by all their. skill pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce that which is the First matter of the snow: altho' a man when he has the Materials before him may by his Art produce it. He may turn Water into Ice in the hottest day in the summer. By his Philosophy and knowledge in the Nature of things, he may when materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als are before him, produce Hoar-frost and Snow. But as for the first matter, not all the Men on Earth, nor all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in Heaven are able to Create it. Nor can men <hi>give Snow like Wool.</hi> They can't give it in that abundance as to cover the face of the Earth. They can't adorn the Earth with that white Robe. No, it is the Great GOD that has made that Winter-cloathing to keep the Earth warm. Therefore the snow is said to be one of His Treasures. Job 38.22. <hi>Hast thou entred into the Treasures of the Snow</hi>? A Treasure notes a great Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity. The Great God has such Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

of Snow in His Treasures, as that he is able not only to cover the Earth, but to destroy the Earth therewith, if that were his Pleasure.</p>
                  <p>PROP. III. <hi>That God ought to be Praised on the account of this Work of His.</hi> Praise the Lord O <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> Praise thy God O <hi>Zion.</hi> Why? For <hi>He giveth Snow like Wool.</hi>

                  <p>For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>God makes the Snow to be a Benefit to Mankind.</hi> It does sometimes come from Heaven as the Gift of God; so when seasonably, <hi>viz.</hi> in Winter, and not in Summer. For in summer it is prodigious and undesirable. <hi>Solomon</hi> designing to shew how unsuitable and pernicious a thing it is to promote Ungodly men to Honour, compares it to <hi>Snow in Summer.</hi> Prov. 26.1. But when it comes neither too soon, nor too late, nor continues longer than is proper for the Earth, it is a Gift of God, and a Benefit to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. For the Snow has a fructifying Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in it. Isa. 55.10. <hi>The Rain comes down, and the Snow from Heaven, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the Earth, and makes it to bring forth Seed to the Sower, and Bread to the Eater.</hi>
                     <pb n="80" facs="unknown:001183_0079_0FB0FFDC2589F088"/>
If the Scripture did not tell us so, yet common Experience proves it. The Husband-man finds it true, That a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with seasonable Snows, is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly followed with a Fruitful summer. Snow-water is many wayes beneficial. Sometimes Floods caused thereby great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Enriches the Earth. And it has a singular Cleansing Vertue in it. Job 9.30. <hi>If I wash my self with Snow-water, &amp; make my hands never so clean.</hi> Of old, in hot Countreys they made use of snow to cool their Wines in the summer time, which is the meaning of that Scripture, Prov. 25.13. <hi>As the cold of Snow in the time of Harvest, so is a faithful Messenger to them that send him: for he refresheth the Soul of his Master.</hi> He does not mean snow that falls in time of harvest, for that (as I said before) would be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious. It did not rain, much less snow in <hi>Palestine</hi> in time of harvest, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when on <hi>Samuels</hi> Prayer it rain'd, at that time, the People trembled. It was a miracle for it to rain in that Countrey at that time of the Year. So then by snow in harvest is meant that which was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served till summer. At this Day in some hot Countreys, they have their

                     </gap>llurs, where it is kept in summer, and if moderatedly used, is known to be both refreshing and healthful. There are also Medicinal Vertues in the snow. A late Learned Physician, has found that a <hi>Salt</hi> Extracted out of snow, is a sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Remedy against both putrid and pestilential Feavors. Therefore Men should Praise God who giveth Snow like Wool.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The Glory of God is discovered in this work of His.</hi> Indeed all the works of God do manifest his Glory. Psal. 145.10. <hi>All thy works Praise thee.</hi> That is to say, they give just occasion to men to Praise God. All His works, and in particular this of the Snow, discovers the Glorious Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of God before all Mankind.</p>

As for the Clouds that contain the snow, the Wisdom of God does appear in them beyond all Humane Comprehension.

And if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the Weight of the Clouds, we see the Wisdom of GOD in upholding of them. Job 37.16. <hi>Dost thou know the Ballancing of the Clouds, the wondrous works of Him who is perfect in Knowledge</hi>? God shews the Perfection of his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, His infinite Wisdom in this work of his. He weighs the Cloud as it were in a Ballance; He knows its weight. What man can do this? The Clouds, those weighty Bodies hang in the Air, which shows both the Power and the Wisdom of God. And in that the Clouds of Rain distil by Drops on the Earth; and the Clouds of Snow does fall not all at once: Should one Cloud fall down all at once, it would destroy a whole Countrey.

                     </gap>bvious as the Figure of it. The Learned <hi>Kepler,</hi> who lived in this last Age, is acknowledged to be the first that acquainted the world with the <hi>Sexangular</hi> Figure of the snow. Ought not Infinite Wisdom to be Praised? God is Infinite Wisdom: witness every Flake of snow that falls on the Ground, which Proclaims to all Man-kind, that there is a God whose Wisdome is Infinite.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The Power of God that also is seen in the Snow.</hi> As in the Rain, so in the Snow, <hi>Iob</hi> 37.6. the small Rain, and <hi>the Great Rain of His Strength.</hi> Tis called so, because God doth shew his strength, what He can do when great Rain comes.

Fair weather comes out of the North; as when God causes the North wind to blow, there is a marvelous alteration in the weather, this shews that with God there is Terrible Majesty. And the Ice declares the Glorious Power of God. Sometimes there are great floating Islands of Ice terrible to behold. And some of those Islands of Ice have been several scores, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In some <hi>Northern</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, the Sea has been so frozen as that Armies with Horses and Wagons, have passed for scores of Miles over it. Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologers inform us, That in the Year 775. the Sea was frozen for Fifty Leagues, and the Ice was compacted as into a Rock Thirty Cubits deep; also such a quantity of snow falling, as that it was raised to the heighth of Thirty Cubits above the Ice. When God divided the Sea, for the Children <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="85" facs="unknown:001183_0084_0FB0FFE6815AC958"/>
concerning the snow: Especially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering God does cause it to come by a Word. Job 27.6. <hi>He sayes unto the Snow, be thou on the Earth.</hi> God speaks the Word and it is done presently. As in the Context before us, <hi>His word runs very swiftly.</hi> We often see it, when the Ground is bare, if God speaks the word, the Earth is covered with snow in a few Minutes time. Here is the Power of the Great GOD. If all the Princes and Great Ones of the Earth, should send their Commands to the Clouds, not a Flake of snow would come from thence.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>The Goodness and Mercy of God that also is discoverd by His giving Snow as Wool.</hi> Deut. 28.12. <hi>He shall open his Good Treasure.</hi> As the rain, so the snow is part of that good Treasure, which God opens for the Children of men. In some parts of the world, not only the Earth is made Fruitful, but Rivers and Springs are maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the snow, which the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of God are never free from. Jer. 18.14. <hi>Will a man leave the Snow of Lebanon which comes from the Rock
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:001183_0085_0FB0FFE7AD4D6598"/>
of the Field? Or shall the cold flowing Waters that come from another place be forsaken</hi>? In the Field were Rocks, and out of these came springs fed by the snow of <hi>Lebanon.</hi> In some <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern</hi> Countries, the Inhabitants would not be able to subsist, no not in the Winter, if it were not for the snow that covers the Earth like wool. So in <hi>Lapland,</hi> where there is little or no light of the Sun in the depth of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, there are great snows continually on the ground, and by the Light of that they are able to Travel from one place to another. <hi>O that men would Praise the Lord for His wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful works, and for His Goodness to the Children of Men</hi>: Yea, for this good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which appears in this giving Snow like Wool.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Sometimes God makes known His Iustice and His Wrath by the Snow.</hi> He has dreadfully Punished men there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. He brings forth not only Hail, but Snow out of His Treasures in the Day of Battle and War. Sometimes it is a Mercy, and sometimes God makes it to be a Judgment. Tho'
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:001183_0086_0FB0FFE92DD8CD18"/>
the snow fructifies the Earth if seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, yet if it lies too long it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes the Land. In <hi>England</hi> in the Dayes of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Confessor, a great snow continued very long, &amp; destroyed the Fruits of the Earth, that the next summer there was a terrible Famine. So does God sometimes Punish Men. Job 36.31. <hi>By them He judgeth the People.</hi> By the Clouds, Rain, and Snow, and such like things, He Judgeth the People, He thereby Executeth His Judgments on them. Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians have Recorded, that in the Month of <hi>April,</hi> an unseasonable Snow destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the Vines in some Countries, to the exceeding damage of the People there. God can make the Snow as well as the Rain a cause of sickness. Not only the Disease called <hi>Bulimia,</hi> but others more fatal have come out of the Snow. <hi>Geographers</hi> give us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that in some Countries Vapours from the Snow have killed multitudes in less than a Quarter of an Hour. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times both Men and Beasts have been destroyed thereby. Writers speak of no less than Forty Thousand men killed by a great Snow in one Day. So then
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:001183_0087_0FB0FFEBC53D3790"/>
we see the Justice of God sometimes appears in this Work of His. He is therefore to be Praised. Exod. 15.11. <hi>He is Fearful in Praises</hi>: He<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is to be Praised for His fearful awful Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Thus we see the Truth Cleared. For APPLICATION.</p>

                        <hi>If we should Praise God for His giving Snow, surely then we ought to Praise Him for Spiritual Blessings much more.</hi> The Psalmist Praiseth God for Temporal Blessings, but concludes with Praises on the account of Spiritual Ones: They as being the Chief are mentioned in the last place. If we are to Praise God when He causeth the Clouds to drop Rain, or the Snow to fall on the Earth, then if He makes His Doctrine to drop on us as the Rain; if we have showers of His Word falling on us every Week in the Year, Praise the Lord O <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> Praise thy God O <hi>Zion.</hi> We should Praise God for the Snow, because it is by His Blessing instrumental to produce that whereby the Lives of our Bodies are sustained, but the Word of God, the

Are our Souls Enriched with the River of God to make us Fruitful, and shall we not be Thankful to Him? And for Eternal Blessings, these are unspeakable Gifts of God. Grace and Heaven are so; and above all, CHRIST is so. Therefore Praise the Lord, O our Souls, and let all within us Bless His Name.</p>
