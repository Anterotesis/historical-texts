            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>THESE words are very plain, and very full, and very mortifying. Man, a noble and reaſonable creature, of a curious body and an immortal ſpirit, may he not be a little proud of his talents, his capacities, his enjoyments, and his rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions?—No; he is an empty and a brittle thing: <hi>Man is vanity.</hi>—Yes, <hi>ſome men:</hi> perhaps the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality. But are there not others exempted from the character? The wiſe, the learned, the rich and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the beautiful and ſtrong; perſons of wide fame or high authority, princes and emperors at the head of mankind, are theſe ſo too? Yes; <hi>every man</hi> is vanity.—<hi>Sometimes</hi> perhaps, in ſome circumſtances
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:008809_0003_102FF0390B2F9DF0"/>and at ſome certain ſeaſons: But not in his faireſt appearance, and brighteſt glory. The king ſick, or the ſcholar aſleep may be ſo: but is the rich in the midſt of his poſſeſſions, the general at the head of his army.—Yes, every man at his <hi>beſt eſtate</hi> is vanity.— Allow men; <hi>all</hi> men, and all men in their <hi>beſt eſtate,</hi> are <hi>vain:</hi> a little vain it may be. Nay, <hi>vanity</hi> itſelf, in the abſtract. Well, granted, in a <hi>few</hi> things, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in many: But ſure the idea may ſtop here. Nay he is <hi>altogether vanity.</hi> Theſe are aſſertions perhaps: a bear <hi>hypotheſis:</hi> a ſpeculation only, not well ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. A topick of amuſement or diſpute, but not demonſtrated concluſion.—Nay, it is moſt certainly ſo. <hi>Verily</hi> every man at his beſt eſtate, is altogether vanity.</p>
            <p>NEVER was a ſentence more ſtrong and forcible. Every word has an emphaſis upon it. Man, not barely <hi>vain,</hi> but in the abſtract, <hi>vanity.</hi> Not in a little but <hi>altogether vanity.</hi> Not in his worſt condition; but in his <hi>beſt ſtate.</hi> Not ſome few; but <hi>every man.</hi> And all this not a precarious aſſertion, but a moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain truth. VERILY <hi>every man at his beſt eſtate is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vanity.</hi> This lies before us to illuſtrate and improve.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:008809_0004_102FF03A94000690"/>
1ſt THEN; I am to illucidate and demonſtrate the propoſition, that every man at his beſt eſtate, is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vanity. And here I might premiſe, that man, at his firſt creation, was not vanity, in that compleat ſenſe, in which he is ſince. He was made a little lower than the angels and crowned with glory and honour. There was a real glory abiding on him: ſomething ſolid and ſubſtantial; till ſin broke, and ſoften'd, and deſtroyed his frame. By his fall from GOD he became <hi>vain in his imaginations:</hi> and hence he diffuſed vanity and the curſe through the lower cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.— So was the <hi>creature made ſubject to vanity,</hi> by the tranſgreſſion of <hi>Adam,</hi> the lord of this ſubjected earth. He became vain firſt, in that bold attempt after godhead, when he eat the forbidden fruit. The vain man fancied that he had divinity within his reach: and the ſerpent fed the illuſion. Gen. iii. 5. <hi>For</hi> GOD <hi>doth know, that in the day you eat thereof, that your eyes ſhall be opened; and ye ſhall be as gods, knowing good and evil.</hi> Raviſhed with the gaudy phantom, the fooliſh, preſumptuous creature catch'd at it, tried to graſp it to his boſom, and hug and enjoy the bliſs: But how diſappointed was he! It glided from his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, it mocked his careſs, it appeared nothing but a gilded cloud, a fleeting ſhadow; meer vanity. So that even then, at his beſt eſtate indeed; while he ſtood fair as a cedar in the garden of GOD, he was deceived by va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:008809_0005_102FF03D32584670"/>and confeſt himſelf vanity. <hi>Man being in honour abideth not.</hi> But ſince the fall, O what compleat va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is the race of <hi>Adam? Verily every man at his beſt eſtate is altogether vanity.</hi> Let us, if you pleaſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance a little, and ſee if the aſſertion cannot be made out. Take the man in all the fine lights in which your fancy can place him, and let us try what we can make of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt IN his beſt eſtate of <hi>riches,</hi> he is no better than vanity. No worldly man ever did arrive at all the riches which his vain mind wiſh'd for. But form the idea better than the fact.</p>
            <p>SUPPOSE a man poſſeſt of all the wealth of the earth.—Suppoſe him ſeated in the midſt of plenty, his tables cover'd with all kinds of luxuries, and all round ſtand his unnumber'd ſlaves to execute his ſovereign orders. His coffers are mines of gold and ſilver. They teem with coin, and blaze with jewels.—He is <hi>cloathed in purple and fine linen,</hi> he ſets upon an ivory throne, in the midſt of a marble palace. Round about are his gardens, his orchards, his groves and his fields ſpreading in an endleſs proſpect. Iſſuing from theſe, he enters into magnificent cities, and walks through ſtreets of his own houſes; every one, as he paſſes,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:008809_0006_102FF040E71DB3D0"/>bringing in tribute and revenues. In a word, the treaſures of the world pour into his magazines, and he ſhall be the proprietor of all regions where the ſun viſits.</p>
            <p>WELL, here is an ideal rich man: ſuch an one as never was really in the world: but we ſet him in his beſt eſtate, that we may keep to the text, and attend to the concluſion. See the overgrown wretch then: and what do you behold! Why firſt of all, a huge lump of vanity, a proud, haughty, diſdainful mortal, valuing himſelf upon the moſt adventitious and exterior thing in the world. For all this his riches, he may be an ideot, a ſot, a villain without honour or conſcience. He may be ſick and in pain; he may be deſpiſed and hated; no man may have a good thought of him; and at laſt he may die young, after he has loſt all his wealth too, and not have a friend to cloſe his eyes.</p>
            <p>WHAT think you now? Is this beſt eſtate vanity or not? See the ſucceeding verſe of my context: <hi>Surely every man walketh in a vain ſhew: ſurely they are diſquieted in vain: he heapeth up riches and knoweth not who ſhall gather them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:008809_0007_102FF0434D69FD90"/>
THUS you ſee the ſacred concluſion of the HOLY GHOST upon riches, that they alſo are vanity: That man at his beſt eſtate in theſe is no better himſelf than vanity. Never let us call them <hi>ſubſtance</hi> any more.</p>
            <p n="2">2. CONSIDER the man at his beſt eſtate of <hi>honour,</hi> and lo! here he is alſo vanity. Suppoſe he is lifted to the pinnacle of earthly dignity, ſeated upon the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream throne, and gazed up at by a whole world of conquered nations. Suppoſe him rolling in his gilded chariot, thro' a <hi>range</hi> of triumphal arches, with a thouſand fettered monarchs marching in proceſſion, before the raviſh'd victor. Round about are torn ſtandards and broken armour, the trophies of his ſucceſs, and the monuments of his glory. And now, applauded by millions he rides along, while the ſky echoes with his name and his honours. But what is this hero now, but another demonſtration of my doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine: Man at his beſt eſtate, and vanity? Amidſt all this vain pomp and glitter, may not his mind be uneaſy, and his body in pain. May he not think, <q>Theſe people who acclaim me to day, may hiſs me to-morrow.</q> Or may he not remember amidſt all, that in a few hours more death will ſtrip him of all, hurl him from all, and <hi>this poor ſhirt be all the great conqueror carries away,</hi> and ſix foot of earth be all he
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:008809_0008_102FF0452BFD4E88"/>takes up. The dignity of this earth then is no ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty againſt this abaſing character inſcribed upon it, <hi>vanity.</hi> The moſt honourable are no more ſecured than the vileſt and moſt abject: But of both alike it is the ſcripture aſſertion, Pſal. lxii. 9. <hi>Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie: to be laid in the ballance they are altogether lighter than vanity.</hi> Near o'kin to this is the next head.</p>
            <p n="3">3. AT his beſt eſtate of <hi>fame</hi> and <hi>reputation,</hi> man is altogether vanity. Suppoſe the man not only to be raiſed above all in outward marks of reſpect and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: but every one ſhall love him in their hearts; they ſhall reſpect and admire him: They ſhall talk every where of his excellencies, and every one believe what they ſay. They ſhall ſpread his fame far and wide, and he ſhall be univerſally known, and as uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally valued, from the moſt judicious critick to the loweſt plebean.</p>
            <p>WELL; and what can be a fairer picture of vanity in the whole world? What is more uncertain, than the eſteem of men; the breath of common fame? What more ſwelling and more empty? 'Tis vanity in the abſtract: an idle bubble, blown up by the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain breath of others, that breaks in the attempt to catch it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:008809_0009_102FF048C93CE610"/>
A MAN the moſt applauded by others, may be the moſt miferable creature in the world, in the ſenſations of his own mind. All the pompous titles of an oriental monarch, are but great ſwelling words of vanity. A ſmall tranſition will bring us to ſay,</p>
            <p n="4">4. MAN at his beſt eſtate of <hi>power</hi> and <hi>authority,</hi> is altogether vanity. This carries in it a diſtinct idea from honour and fame: For a man may receive the higheſt marks of dignity, and titles of honour, and may be really eſteemed, and univerſally applauded, and yet his authority and command may be very ſmall. He may have great influence to attract, and but ſmall power to oblige.</p>
            <p>BUT ſuppoſe a man advanced to the throne of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream empire; a ſovereign monarch, abſolute and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary in all his edicts.—On his breath hang the ſouls of millions. In his ſecret breaſt is depoſited the march of armies, and the fate of nations. Peace, or battles, retreat, or bloodſhed, or ſafety, or deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wait the mandates of his deſpotick voice.</p>
            <p>SUPPOSE he has not a rebel in his vaſt empire; or if he had thouſands he has power to cruſh them in an inſtant, and only would appear the greater by
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:008809_0010_102FF04B39D7A5D0"/>the bold, ſucceſsleſs oppoſition. And now what's the conſequence? why juſt the ſame ſtill, advanc'd to the beſt eſtate, he ſtill remains vanity. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all his authority, may he not be a ſlave to his own luſts? May not ambition, revenge, luxury, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption and deſpair tyranize over him by turns, and claim a divided government in his ſoul? And after all, may he not, <hi>muſt he not</hi> reſign it in death! At once the blaſt is given, and the bubble breaks.</p>
            <p n="5">5. MAN at his beſt eſtate of <hi>pleaſure</hi> is altogether vanity.—Suppoſe him ſurrounded with every object, fair to the eye, tuneful to the ear, delicate to the touch, fragrant to the ſmell, and delightful to the taſte. Suppoſe the generous wines flow round; and the ſprightly concert ſtrikes up: wit and laughter ſhall wake the genius and ſhake the hall. The gay turn, the ſly remark, the ſmart reply; ingenuity, mirth and good humour ſhall be heard from all corners.</p>
            <p>AND O what a ſcene of abundant vanity have I here open'd! Here's a room full of dying creatures, upon the edges of eternity, juſt ſtepping into it, and O how ſenſeleſs! abandon'd! frantick! Noiſe and clamour, thoughtleſs impertinence, and empty jeſting, ſenſual gratifications and idle game, make up that ſtrange mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:008809_0011_102FF04CC4309608"/>call'd <hi>earthly pleaſure.</hi> O how unfit for the choice of ſuch creatures as we! how unequal to the capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a reaſonable ſoul! how ſhort-liv'd, and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and tranſient! The <hi>pleaſures of ſin are but for a ſeaſon:</hi> and even while they laſt, are vain and unſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial too. Eccle. ii. 1, 2, 3. <hi>I ſaid in my heart, go to now, I will prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure: and behold this alſo is vanity. I ſaid of laughter, it is mad: and of mirth, what doth it? I ſought in mine heart to give myſelf unto wine, and to lay hold on folly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. MAN at his beſt eſtate of <hi>body</hi> is altogether vanity. —In the former trials, I ſuppos'd the man to have all exterior advantages: but now if you pleaſe you ſhall approach to add interior to them. Suppoſe then amidſt all this plenty, this dignity, fame, power, and mirth, the man enjoys a ſtrong and regular guſt of appetite, to taſte the various delights. Suppoſe him ſtrong, lively, active, of a firm conſtitution and warm blood, glowing with the fluſh of youth, and hardy in the vigour of health: yet in this ſenſe is the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſacred, Eccl. xi. 9. <hi>Childhood and youth are vanity.</hi> Suppoſe him in the bloom of years, beauty adorns his cheeks, and proportion ſhapes his limbs, and every one gazes with eyes of approbation and love. Yet then is the concluſion alſo true. Prov. xxxi. 30. <hi>Favour is deceitful, beauty is vain.</hi> Poor vain creature, why are
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:008809_0012_102FF04F85628A40"/>theſe conſcious airs, and that fluttering attire? Muſt not all this beauty fade? In a few moments more, will not thoſe fair colours vaniſh from your face, and the eyes fix, and the lips turn pale? So a bubble ſhines, and dances upon the ſmiling ſurface of the flood, and in an inſtant diſappears, the beautiful round is loſt, and its place is no more found.</p>
            <p n="7">7. MAN, at his beſt eſtate of <hi>ſoul</hi> is altogether vanity. The thought now riſes, and the concluſion grows ſtrong. We may eaſily conceive a plentiful eſtate, outward honours, ſcenes of mirth, and a healthy body, and yet pronounce vanity upon all, while the <hi>mind</hi> was not adapted to taſte the pleaſure: But ſuppoſe it is, yet ſure now the point is made out, and the man is altogether vanity. Suppoſe the owner of ten thouſand volumes has rode poſt through his pages, yet may not the fine library line the walls of a narrow ſoul? Has the man a ſmattering of half a dozen languages; tho' he ſpeaks in the tongues of men and angels, and have not genius, he is but as <hi>ſounding braſs, and a tinkling cymbal.</hi> Nothing ſo empty and noiſy as a vain pedant.</p>
            <p>BUT this reaches not the caſe neither; ſuppoſe then once more, a vaſt <hi>genius,</hi> with all the ideas of learning and ſpeculation laid up in its faithful me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory. Suppoſe a bright imagination, a quick inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:008809_0013_102FF051E8E1BA90"/>a penetrating ſagacity, a correct judgment; a meer SOLOMON, excelling all mortals in wiſdom and knowledge—The firſt thing we obſerve upon this is, <hi>in his much wiſdom is much grief, and as he increaſeth knowledge he increaſeth ſorrow.</hi> How vain muſt the wiſeſt man be, if he is puft up with his own learning? After all his large acquiſitions, how much more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains unknown to him, than he already knows? There's hardly a fool upon earth, but would puzzle the conceited philoſopher, with queſtions upon the moſt common ſubject. And after all, one little turn of brain; one ſmall apartment diſturb'd, one minute cell overthrown, and down falls all this ſtupendous fabrick of intellect, and the poor creature becomes ſtupid, or wanton, or raving. 1 Cor. iii. 20. <hi>And again, the</hi> LORD <hi>knoweth the thoughts of the wiſe, that they are vain. Vain man would be wiſe!</hi> I ſhall attempt but one labour more, and with this trial I ſhall form the concluſion of the whole matter.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Conſider man in his beſt eſtate of virtue and <hi>morality,</hi> deſtitute of the principle of renewed nature, and here too the point will be given, he <hi>is altogether vanity.</hi> You take notice, I here ſay, <hi>virtue</hi> and <hi>mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> as diſtinguiſhed from <hi>holineſs</hi> and <hi>true piety.</hi> 'Tis the pagan ethicks and not the chriſtian ſanctity that is
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:008809_0014_102FF055D561E468"/>the preſent ſubject. Well: but will not morality make us happy? Is not virtue a real good; the <hi>ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum bonum?</hi> The calm philoſopher; who could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate upon ſenſual pleaſure, and deliberately pronounce vanity upon it all: Yet even he, dazzied by falſe lights, and the appearance of truth in his argument, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver conſent to have his beloved virtue pronounced vain too. Let us ſee a little then how far this concluſion will hold. Suppoſe a moraliſt, who indulges no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate appetite or hurtful paſſion: Suppoſe he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours after a generous love to mankind, and of all the ſecond table of the law can ſay, all theſe have I kept from my youth. Yet muſt it be ſaid, there is ſomething wanting, vanity within, ſome chaſm re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining unfill'd. The voice of eternal truth himſelf pronounces, <hi>yet thou lackeſt one thing.</hi> Aye, but ſuppoſe he is even ſuperſtitious in his regards to the firſt table too, ſo far as man in a ſtate of fallen nature proceeds unſanctified by the SPIRIT OF GOD, the vanity ſhall only be better finiſhed, and make a finer ſhow. Would you ſee the very picture of vanity; the very <hi>image and ſuperſcription</hi> of it, I'll ſhow it you. Look into Luk. xviii. 11. <hi>The phariſee ſtood and prayed thus with himſelf;</hi> GOD, <hi>I thank thee that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjuſt, adulterers, or even as this publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can. I faſt twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I poſſeſs.</hi> If one was looking out for an emblem of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:008809_0015_102FF058B116C9A8"/>I know not how it were poſſible to find a better.</p>
            <p>VIRTUE then, and morality, if it go no further is but a vain appearance of good: this may puff a man up, but it can never be ſatisfying, becauſe it can never be compleat. I know not how to help it, but till it is <hi>full</hi> it muſt be <hi>hollow.</hi> Eccl. iv. 4. <hi>Again I conſidered every</hi> RIGHT WORK, <hi>this is alſo vanity and vexation of ſpirit.</hi> The moſt accompliſhed philoſopher among the heathen, and the exacteſt moraliſts they could boaſt, were for the moſt part, the vaineſt things under heaven. They almoſt lived wholly to themſelves. Even their pompous talk upon the publick and the love of one's country, has ſuch evident marks of vain glory upon it, that it is diſcovered in almoſt every page by an attentive eye. Is even the dying ſpeech of a <hi>Socrates</hi> unſtained with it? The luſt of fame ſeems to be the grand ſpring of their gaudy oratory, and hardy undertakings in what they call'd the cauſe of virtue. The modeſt <hi>Virgil</hi> himſelf is eaſily detected. He ſtumbles at the very threſhold of his heroic lines, and the vain <hi>egoliſt</hi> appears full.—<hi>Ille ego qui quondam—</hi> unleſs the vain criticks can prove the lines to be none of his: as ſome of them have attempted.</p>
            <p>AND among thoſe called chriſtians, can the caſe be different? The bare moral man may be lovely in his
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:008809_0016_102FF05A37F19C08"/>accompliſhments, but morality alone will not ſave him. He may <hi>here</hi> loſe it totally, and all his hopes from it <hi>hereafter</hi> will prove as <hi>the ſpider's web.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT I muſt do the argument juſtice. Man in his beſt eſtate of <hi>faith</hi> too, ſhort of ſaving, is ſtill only vanity. He <hi>only ſeems</hi> to be religious, but <hi>that man's religion is vain. If he have all faith, ſo as that he be able to remove mountains,</hi> and it <hi>work not by love,</hi> it is but a thin appearance and empty noiſe. <hi>Wilt thou know, O vain Man, that faith without works is dead!</hi> The ſoul is wanting, and what you ſee is a vain phantom without ſubſtance. A dead thing you know is vain. Hence the ſacred phraſe for the univerſal empire of death, is, <hi>the creature alſo is ſubject to vanity.</hi> I have now conſider'd man in his beſt eſtate indeed, and lo, he is ſtill vanity.</p>
            <p>THUS you have run through the ſeveral diviſions of mankind, and what is the upſhot of the matter? What a mortifying concluſion is drawn from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt premiſes? At his beſt eſtate of <hi>riches</hi> he is vanity, for he may be deſpiſed: add <hi>honour</hi> to his riches, and he is vanity ſtill, for it may reach but a little way. Add extent of <hi>fame</hi> to theſe, and he is ſtill vanity for want of <hi>authority</hi> to ſupport it. If he has all theſe, he may ſtill remain vanity, becauſe he is deſtitute of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:008809_0017_102FF05BC2C7EDE8"/>pleaures. Let him be ſurrounded with joyous objects, yet they will be in vain if he wants <hi>vigour of appetite,</hi> and health of body. If he enjoys theſe, yet he miſſes the nobler <hi>enjoyments of the mind,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is wretched vanity. Suppoſe he has the higheſt pleaſures of <hi>genius,</hi> yet he may be a ſlave to vice: Or if he is a moral and a virtuous man, but not regenerated by the Spirit of GOD; yet in vain does he look for hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, when <hi>death</hi> ſhall proclaim him a <hi>ſinner</hi> againſt GOD. Upon the whole, man at his beſt eſtate, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together vanity. So when our Father Adam had but two ſons in the world, the name of one of them, and the beſt of them too, was <hi>Abel,</hi> that is vanity. And <hi>being dead he yet ſpeaketh</hi> this great truth, that the beſt of the ſons of Adam are vanity, that man at his beſt eſtate is altogether vanity. Vanity! that is a bubble, a bladder of wind and water ſluttering in the air, fair indeed, of moſt correct and perfect ſhape, exactly round, high and ſhining: but hollow, frail, eaſily and ſuddenly broken, gone in a moment, and remembred no more. And <hi>what is your life</hi> but ſuch a gilded va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour, <hi>appearing for a little time and then vaniſhing away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VANITY ! what's that? In the language of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it is a ſtrange ſort of a <hi>thing:</hi> I would rather ſay, of a <hi>word.</hi> A non-entity, more thin than a chimera, more unſubſtantial than a ſhadow: <hi>leſs than nothing
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:008809_0018_102FF062427AD788"/>and vanity.</hi> And yet this is the condition of man; all nations of men! <hi>every man at his beſt eſtate!</hi> Are we now ready to improve the doctrine? And from what we have heard, we infer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. IF in his <hi>beſt eſtate</hi> man is altogether vanity, no wonder he is ſo in his <hi>common</hi> and his <hi>worſt eſtate.</hi> In his ſickneſſes he may well <hi>poſſeſs months of vanity.</hi> Job vii. 3. In pain, ignominy, and reproach; in the viciſſitudes of providence, and the little portions of comfort, with the deep mixtures of afflictions, he may well be called vain, and ſee and acknowledge it himſelf.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Is every man at his beſt eſtate vanity—O the mercy of GOD <hi>to regard man!</hi> What are we before him? Worms! that's too much, duſt and aſhes! that's too much; nothing! that's too much; <hi>leſs than nothing and vanity. What is man that thou art mindful of him, or the ſon of man that thou viſiteſt him?</hi> Even the angels are little before him, and he <hi>charges them with fooliſhneſs:</hi> But man is lower than they, nay altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vanity: And yet, O the amazing notice he takes of us! Herein is goodneſs and condeſcention myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and inconceivable!</p>
            <p n="3">3. Is man at his beſt eſtate vanity—O the grace of
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:008809_0019_102FF063C7991950"/>CHRIST to <hi>become man!</hi> What a wonder was it that he ſhould take this nature into one perſon with the Son of GOD! He took the nature, under all its vain cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, excepting that one article, ſin. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the ſame frail, and brittle, and mortal man that we now are. Here now was man at his beſt eſtate, and yet hear what he ſays, Pſal. xxii. 6. <hi>But I am a worm and no man.</hi> How ſtrange grace was this, that he who was all the fulneſs of the godhead bodily, ſhould thus empty himſelf, and wear ſuch an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of vanity, in the nature of man? And yet ſo it was, and he cries out under it, Pſal. cii. 2. <hi>My days are like a ſhadow that declineth.</hi> Thus our LORD <hi>made himſelf of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a ſervant,</hi> and all this for our ſalvation.</p>
            <p n="4">4. From what we have heard, we infer, <hi>pride was not made for man.</hi> So empty, ſo frail, ſo deceitful a thing, to boaſt and glory, and admire itſelf: This is vanity with a witneſs! A creature dropping to duſt, and falling into a filthy grave, to ſet up for ſtrength and beauty, honour and applauſe! Was ever any thing more abſurd and ridiculous? So might an emmit crawl in ſtate, and value itſelf upon its imaginary poſſeſſions, and conceited accompliſhments: So might a ſhadow, lengthened by the ſetting ſun, admire to find
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:008809_0020_102FF0654E135CF0"/>itſelf grown ſo tall, while in the ſame moment it was going to vaniſh, blended in the gathering twilight, and loſt in night and darkneſs. Far be from ſuch thin appearances pride, ambition, or vain glory.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>WHAT a vain world is this,</hi> when man, the very head of it, is altogether vanity? So ſome read the text: <hi>Surely all is vanity, every man at his beſt eſtate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND methinks it is no unfair concluſion, if man, the nobleſt creature on the earth, is altogether vanity, the earth itſelf muſt needs be a vain empty place. There's the appearance of good here: but 'tis not at all the leſs vain for that; but rather the more ſo.—So Satan ſhew'd our LORD <hi>all the kingdoms of the world, and all the glory of them, in a moment of time;</hi> and it was well he did ſo; for had he not ſeen them in a moment, the ſhow would all have been over. For the <hi>faſhion of this world paſſeth away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. AND to conclude: Let us <hi>not truſt to any thing in this world. Truſt not in man: for wherein is he to be accounted of. Curſed be the man that truſteth in man, and maketh fleſh his arm.</hi> Not the wiſeſt, the greateſt, the beſt of men, are fit for our ſteady confidence: <hi>Truſt not in princes, whoſe breath is in their noſtrils. His
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:008809_0021_102FCB2D6E42D5A0"/>breath goeth forth, be returneth to his earth, and in that very day his thoughts periſh.</hi> Truſt not in uncertain riches, or in a frail life. Jam. iv. 13, 14. <hi>Go to now ye that ſay, to-day or to-morrow we will go into ſuch a city, and continue there a year, and buy, and ſell, and get gain: Whereas ye know not what ſhall be on the morrow: for what is your life? It is even a vapour that appeareth for a little time, and then vaniſheth away.</hi> O awakened ſoul, look back, and reflect inward, and ſay, I have now <hi>ſeen an end of all perfection.</hi> From this time will I ſeek a <hi>better country, that is an heavenly.</hi> O bleſſed JESUS, <hi>from thy ſulneſs let me receive, and grace upon grace.</hi> Theſe things are <hi>but for a ſeaſon:</hi> But <hi>JESUS CHRIST, the ſame yeſterday, to-day, and forever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THUS I have finiſhed what I intend on my ſubject in general: But what an illuſtration and example has the providence of heaven now given of it in the funeral of the Honourable Mr. DUMMER. In him we have, in many reſpects, ſeen <hi>man at his beſt eſtate:</hi> while the great GOD, has, by the dart of death, fixt on it the inſcription, VANITY. How nobly, for a ſhining courſe of years, did he fill the firſt chair of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the province, with ſuperior wiſdom, and, I think, unrivalled acceptance and applauſe! How did he retire from it, followed with the gratitude and bleſſings of a whole people! In the calm leiſure of
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:008809_0022_102FF06CE77F34C0"/>his receſs, in what amiable and venerable lights did he ſhine in his domeſtic and amicable connections! His ſteady family devotions, his ſtated retirements to his cloſet, his applications to the entertaining and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pages of various kinds, his friendly entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and his works of piety and charity, filled up his uſeful hours. This church can witneſs to the conſtancy and ſolemnity of his exemplary attendance on the divine worſhip: while his honors to CHRIST will be ſtill ſeen here, on the communion table, and in the coſtly volume from which the word of GOD is read every Lord's-day. His death was of a piece with his life, in the large donations to publick and pious uſes in his laſt will. So he ſhone living and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: And what a ſtriking inſtance of <hi>man at his beſt eſtate!</hi>—But lift up the lid of the coffin, and ſee what is come of all that was mortal. Is this he whom we remember in the politeneſs and dignity of former years! How broken with long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe! with excruciating pains! with age! with death! Is this the unblemiſhed magiſtrate, the PATRIOT GOVERNOR; loyal to his prince, and the father to his country! How changed from him in the buſy ſcenes and enterprize of active life! now <hi>lying ſtill and quiet, ſleeping and at reſt; with kings and counſellors of the earth, which built deſolate places for themſelves.</hi> Deaf and unconſcious is he to all the honours of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauding
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:008809_0023_102FF06EE18D33F0"/>country. The immortal mind indeed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, and remains to pronounce <hi>vanity</hi> upon all that is not immortal. Duty and affection have obliged me thus much to the deceaſed: But the buſineſs of the pulpit is with the living.</p>
            <p>SEE, <hi>you in the elevated ſtations</hi> of life, the period of all your glory. So you <hi>die like men, and fall as one of the princes.</hi> You in <hi>advanced years,</hi> if you reach four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore, ſee 'tis <hi>labour and ſorrow: ſoon cut off and you fly away.</hi> You, the <hi>mourning relatives</hi> of the departed, will you prepare to mingle your duſt with his? Will you be ambitious to meet him in a fairer inheritance? While <hi>we</hi> who were happy in his friendſhip and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, complain with you, <hi>lover and friend haſt thou put far from me, and my acquaintance into darkneſs.</hi> Will you <hi>all</hi> attend, my brethren, the high and the low, the rich and the poor together; <hi>ſee the end of man, and the living lay it to heart:</hi> while the <hi>preacher him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> upon the ſurvey of the whole, now pronounces, and cloſes all the argument, Eccl. the firſt and the laſt verſes, <hi>Vanity of vanities, ſaith the preacher, vanity of vanities, all is vanity. Let us hear the concluſion of the whole matter; fear GOD, and keep his commandments, for this is the whole of man.</hi>

               <hi>EXTRACT from the</hi> BOSTON NEWS-PAPERS, October 26th, 1761.</head>
            <p>DEPARTED this life, the Honourable WILLIAM DUMMER, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> in the 84th year of his age; and on the 16th his funeral was attended with every mark of reſpect due to ſo eminent a perſon.</p>
            <p>SCARCE any one ever paſs'd thro' life with a more unſpotted character, or perform'd it's various duties with more univerſal eſteem. In the gayeſt ſcenes of youth, he was preſerv'd from the deſtructive paths of vice; and in maturer age, was a ſhining example of the moſt amiable virtues.</p>
            <p>IN the beginning of the reign of GEORGE I. he was appointed our lieutenant governor. Upon the return of Colonel SHUTE to <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> the chief command of the province devolv'd upon him. In this ſtation he appear'd with diſtinguiſhed luſtre. The wiſe, incorrupt, and ſucceſsful adminiſtration of Mr. DUMMER, will always be remembred with honor, and confider'd as a pattern worthy of the imitation of all future governors.—Uninfluenced by party prejudices,
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:008809_0025_102FF0733A5D9AC8"/>ſuperior to all mercenary attachments, he diſcovered no paſſion in his public character, but love to his country, and fidelity to his royal maſter.</p>
            <p>HAVING fill'd the chair for ſeveral years, with dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and uſefulneſs; when a ſucceſſor was appointed, he retir'd to enjoy the unenvied ſatisfactions of a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate life; with the approbation of a good conſcience, and the applauſe of his country.</p>
            <p>IN his domeſtic character, he ever appear'd the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate huſband,—the indulgent maſter,—the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent friend.</p>
            <p>INSPIRED with a profound veneration of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Being—firmly attach'd to the religion of JESUS: he received its doctrines with ſubmiſſion, attended its inſtitutions with reverence, and practiced its precepts with uniformity.</p>
            <p>IN the midſt of human grandeur, he diſcover'd the vanity of the world, in its brighteſt appearances; and made it the great buſineſs of life, to prepare for an holy and happy death.—He perceiv'd his body ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the infirmities of age, without amazement; and waited with patience for the appointed time,
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:008809_0026_102FF07828F2AE68"/>when it ſhould return to its original duſt.—He ſaw eternity approaching, and redoubled his diligence, that he might be ready for the coming of his LORD.— In health and ſickneſs, he often declar'd his hope of the divine acceptance was built upon the merits and mediation of JESUS CHRIST, whom he ador'd as the true GOD, and only SAVIOUR of men.</p>
            <p>WHILE he liv'd, his prayers, and his alms, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually aſcended for a memorial before GOD: At his death, he left a great part of his eſtate to pious and charitable uſes. Having ſerv'd his generation by the will of GOD, he fell aſleep, in a joyful expectation of a reſurrection to etternal life.</p>
