            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IT may be ſuppoſed by many, that the following pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication needs an apology: the author is ſenſible of it, and offers, as ſuch, the reaſons which he gives, in the beginning of the ſubject, for entering upon it.</p>
            <p>He is not fond of religious controverſy; but there are times when a miniſter of religion may feel it neceſſary to bear his teſtimony, feeble as it may be, againſt errors, which, in his view, teem with the moſt pernicious conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences to the intereſts of real piety, and the welfare of ſociety.</p>
            <p>Such a time the author eſteems the preſent to be. Alarmed at the progreſs of the errors which the following Sermons are deſigned to refute, and at the patronage af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded them by ſome diſtinguiſhed characters in our the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ological world, he was willing to contribute his mite to the cauſe of truth, and to hazard his name and (ſome may think) his reputation as a writer, in the ſupport of it.</p>
            <p>He hath treated the ſubject in a general and diffuſive manner, with the deſign, that it may be underſtood by all. He hath treated it practically; for it is, or ought to be, the end of every diſcourſe, to make men not only wiſer, but better. If he can eſtabliſh the wavering mind of one ſerious Chriſtian; if he can arouſe one careleſs ſinner to a ſenſe of his danger, he will eſteem it a rich reward for all his trouble, and a better recompence than the higheſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation as a polemical writer.</p>
            <p>He is not conſcious to himſelf of feeling any bitterneſs againſt thoſe who think differently from him. Though he
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:018207_0004_0FA5BC442CBC06C0"/>
conſiders them as miſtaken, yet he hopes them to be good men, and influenced by the dictates of their conſciences. Perhaps there may ſome warm expreſſions have eſcaped him, in the courſe of the argument; they are not meant for the men, but for the doctrine which they aſſert and patronize.</p>
            <p>The unanimous deſire of thoſe who heard them, and the opinion of ſuch as have read them in manuſcript, have led to the publication of theſe diſcourſes.</p>

                  <bibl>
                     <hi>ISAIAH lxvi. 24.</hi>
                  </bibl>
                  <p>AND they ſhall go forth, and look upon the carcaſes of the men that have tranſgreſſed againſt me: far their worm ſhall not die, neither ſhall their fire be quenched: and they ſhall be an abhorring unto all fleſh.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THIS remarkable denunciation of divine vengeance concludes the prophecy of the princely Iſaiah. He had the cleareſt views of any of the prophets, of the goſpel diſpenſation; he delivered the promiſes and encouragements of the covenant of grace to believers in ſtriking, and animating language, and at the ſame time denounced the judgments of Heaven againſt all <hi>the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The chapter whence our text is taken, contains both promiſes and threatenings; for it evidently refers to the days when all men, then upon the face of the earth, ſhall be made acquainted with the goſpel of Chriſt, and ſubmit truly unto it. And theſe ſhall know the miſery of the men who, in times paſt, have rejected the counſel of God againſt themſelves: they ſhall be made acquainted with this, to excite their gratitude to the great God, for ſaving them from ſuch a ruin, to keep up a lively view of the infinite evil of ſin in their minds, and perhaps to be a
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:018207_0006_0FA5BC45B9226B48"/>
means of preſerving their integrity, and preventing them from deſiring to return unto folly.</p>
            <p>That the prophet was ſpeaking in the text of the future puniſhment of the wicked, a puniſhment which ſhould take place in a ſtate different from the preſent, is evident by the quotation which our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt made of this very paſſage, Mark ix. 43, 44. <hi>And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off; it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never ſhall be quenched: where their worm dieth not, and their fire is not quenched.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The text is metaphorical, and points out the future, endleſs miſery of the impenitent, by the deſtruction which cometh upon the carcaſes of thoſe who fall in battle, and are left unburied. The ſaints ſhall behold the miſery, and ruin of thoſe who die in their ſins, as we behold, with a gloomy melancholy, the unburied carcaſes which cover a field of battle. The accuſations of their conſciences ſhall be to the wicked as a worm which gnaws without ceaſing, and as a fire which no art, nor force can quench; their moral character ſhall be ſuch as to render them an abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to all thoſe who love, and delight in that which is good, in the ſame manner as a corpſe, which is covered with filth, and infeſted with worms, is diſagreeable, and abhorrent to thoſe who behold it.</p>
            <p>Thus is the miſery of the finally impenitent repreſented by the text, in language metaphorical, it is true, but adapted to the deſign of the prophet, and elegantly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive of his meaning. <hi>The worm that dieth not, the fire that ſhall not be quenched,</hi> preſent us with a grand, but alarming idea, of the future ſtate of the impenitent ſinner.</p>
            <p>That there ſhall be a ſtate of puniſhment for the wicked beyond the grave, ſcarce any believer in revelation will doubt. But many ſcruple whether this puniſhment ſhall be eternal in its duration; they ſuppoſe that it ſhall laſt only for a limited time, and then, that all things, and all men ſhall be reſtored to a ſtate of happineſs. Many indulge to theſe ſcruples at the preſent day. The doctrine of the eternal puniſhment of the wicked is openly attacked. Many, and thoſe men of eminence (and, we would hope, of virtue and goodneſs too,) patronize the oppoſers of
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:018207_0007_0FA5BC460A85F458"/>
this doctrines and this conſideration hath led me to make choice of the preſent ſubject.</p>
            <p>This choice needs no apology. The doctrine before us is important, and intereſting to every individual of us. If we are rational and accountable creatures; if we are made for immortality, and muſt be happy or miſerable, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out eternity, as we are righteous or wicked here, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes us to know it; for the knowledge, one would think, muſt have a powerful effect upon our conduct.</p>
            <p>The miniſters of religion <hi>are ſet for the defence of the goſpel.</hi> They are not at liberty to permit their private feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or their worldly intereſt, to reſtrain them from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering <hi>the whole counſel of God.</hi> However diſagreeable their ſentiments may be, to the pride or corruption of the human heart: however painful it may be to them to deliver truths, which will occaſion uneaſineſs, and terror to their hearers; yet they muſt <hi>ſet their faces as flints</hi>; they muſt reſolutely determine to deliver every part of divine truth, let it pleaſe, or diſpleaſe whom it may.</p>
            <p>It hath been obſerved, that men's principles in religion, were often formed by their natural diſpoſition and habit; and that the doctrine of eternal puniſhment, was the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of a dark and gloomy mind. But that mind muſt be gloomy and malevolent indeed, which can delight in cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing needleſs terror to its fellow creatures: and the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt be truly diabolical, which can take pleaſure in reflecting upon human miſery, capriciouſly or unjuſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted. But if this doctrine is really true, it is a part of the warmeſt benevolence, and trueſt friendſhip, to warn men of their danger, and caution them to avoid it. What influence my natural temper may have upon my creed, I determine not; but this I know, that I believe fully, from the word of God, that thoſe muſt be eternally miſerable, who die in their ſins. And therefore I feel, that I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming an act of the trueſt kindneſs, when I am endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to convince you of this truth, and urging you to flee from the wrath to come.</p>
            <p>The deſign of this, and ſome following diſcourſes, is to ſhew,</p>
            <p>DOCT.] <hi>That the puniſhment of the finally impenitent, (meaning thoſe who die ſo) will be eternal in its duration; or, that all nun ſhall not be finally ſaved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:018207_0008_0FA5BC46949F6F28"/>Thoſe propoſitions are ſo cloſely connected with each other, as that the proof of one, neceſſarily confirms and eſtabliſhes the other. We muſt be excuſed, therefore, for blending them together.</p>
            <p>The doctrine before us, we will endeavour, firſt, to prove from ſcripture: and then we will anſwer, and attempt to invalidate, the objections and arguments of its oppoſers.</p>
            <p>And here, we are ready to acknowledge, that this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine depends entirely upon the teſtimony of revelation. We know little of the eternal world, of the nature or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of our exiſtence there, by the light of reaſon, <hi>Life and immortality are brought to light by the goſpel.</hi> We are indebted to revelation for the moſt which we know, concerning the inviſible world, and thoſe who do now, or ſhall hereafter, inhabit it. We are content, therefore, to wave the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the heathen writers; to omit the opinions of their philoſophers, upon the immortality of the ſoul; and to lay aſide their deſcriptions of Elyſium and Tartarus, which might poſſibly tend to prove, that they had an idea of the eternal happineſs of the good, and the eternal miſery of the wicked, in the future-world. But theſe teſtimonies would weigh but little; they are merely the effects of tradition, tranſmitted in a manner ſufficiently dark and doubtful. We are much ſafer when we attend to the dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of revelation. Here we may reſt, with the utmoſt ſecurity. We know this will not deceive us.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Our firſt argument, to prove the doctrine we advance, is taken from the very great difference, which is made in the word of God, between the character, and end of the righteous and the wicked.</p>
            <p>It is moſt certain, that, in every part of the word of God, there is a very plain, and expreſs diſtinction, kept up between ſaints and ſinners. The one are repreſented, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly oppoſite to the other, in diſpoſition, in manners in character and end. The one are ſtyled <hi>children of God:</hi> the other are repreſented as <hi>children of the evil one, at children of wrath, a generation of vipers,</hi> and the like. There is ſuch a difference, in the character and ſtate of the righteous and the wicked, as that the latter are told, that they muſt paſs through a change, great as a natural birth, before they can be numbered with the former. <hi>Except a man be born
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:018207_0009_0FA5BC475B280E90"/>
again,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, Joh. iii. 3. <hi>he cannot ſee the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God.</hi> The ſaints of God are ſtyled his <hi>workmanſhip, created in Chriſt Jeſus unto holineſs and good works.</hi> It is ſaid, that <hi>neither circumciſion availeth any thing, nor uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, but the new creature.</hi> And good men are ſaid to be <hi>born, not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</hi>

            <p>It is true, that regeneration is a metaphorical term; but ſtill it means <hi>ſomething,</hi> and tends to convey an idea ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſimilar to that from which it is taken. The expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions we have but now quoted, muſt (if they mean any thing) ſerve to convey as much as this; that when men are brought to leave their ſins, and turn to God, or, in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture language, are regenerated, the moral frame, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of their minds, are totally changed; their views of things become eſſentially different from what they were, and their conduct and behaviour are altered in conſequence. It ſeems as if a metaphor, taken from a change ſo great as that, from non-exiſtence to exiſtence, could not convey leſs than this.</p>
            <p>This change muſt paſs upon men, while they are in a ſtate of probation, while they are under the influence of thoſe paſſions and affections, which, we have reaſon to think, are peculiar to the preſent ſtate of exiſtence. The ſcripture every where repreſents, the change made upon us by death, as eſſentially altering our ſituation, with reſpect to the things of eternity, and the concerns of our ſouls. The effects of this regeneration, are works of piety, charity and kindneſs, adapted to the preſent ſtate of mankind only. Which things prove, that the idea of a regeneration, beyond the grave, is ridiculous in itſelf; and could be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, only by the neceſſity of getting rid of a powerful argument, which militated with a darling ſcheme.</p>
            <p>The deſign and intention of the goſpel miniſtry is ſaid, Acts xxvi. 18. to be, <hi>to open men's eyes, and to turn them from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveneſs of ſins.</hi> Surely the apoſtle muſt here intend ſomething important! He muſt mean to convey, that there is a very great alteration made, not only in the preſent ſtate of men's minds, by the goſpel, but alſo in their conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with reſpect to eternity. It cannot be imagined that thoſe
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:018207_0010_0FA5BC4815026718"/>
who have experienced the effects of the goſpel, mentioned in this text, are, or will be ever, in the ſame ſituation with thoſe, who are under the influence of darkneſs, and are in a ſtate of death. But if all men are ſaved, they will be as truly, and as eternally happy, as any who ſubmit to the goſpel, and experience its transforming efficacy. The doctrine we are combating, then, hath a tendency to lead men to diſregard the goſpel, and to prevent their being ſo influenced by it, as to partake of its bleſſings.</p>
            <p>The righteous and the wicked are ſaid to be treated differently by God in this world. The firſt are promiſed the light of his countenance, and communion and fellowſhip with him. It is engaged to them, that <hi>all things ſhall work together for their good;</hi> and they are ſaid to <hi>poſſeſs all things:</hi> while it is declared, that <hi>there is no peace to the wicked</hi>—that <hi>they are poor and miſerable, blind and naked.</hi> And a denun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation like this, is pronounced againſt them, Mal. ii. 2. <hi>If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay it to heart, to give glory unto my name, ſaith the Lord of hoſts, I will even ſend a curſe upon you; and I will curſe your bleſſings; yea, I have curſed them already, becauſe ye do not lay it to heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The deaths of the righteous and wicked are repreſented, as eſſentially different: <hi>the wicked is driven away in his wickedneſs; but the righteous hath hope in his death.</hi> In the parable of the rich man and Lazarus, Luke xvi. the beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar is ſaid to have died, and to be carried by the angels into Abraham's boſom. The rich man alſo, we are told, died, and was buried; <hi>and in hell,</hi> goes on the hiſtory, <hi>he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and ſeeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his boſom.</hi> The death of the ſaints is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, to be precious in the ſight of the Lord; while the wicked are repreſented, as dying under his wrath and curſe, and expoſed to his everlaſting diſpleaſure.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, there is, through the whole of the word of God, a plain, and evident diſtinction made between the character, the ſituation, and circumſtances of good and bad men. There are marks, and ſignatures pointed out to us, in the ſcriptures, by which we are to judge, whether we hear the one, or the other character. We are preſſed ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, to examine ourſelves as to this point; and are cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned againſt deception. We are moreover aſſured, that
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:018207_0011_0FA5BC48E3FE8210"/>
this diſtinction ſhall be kept up in the future, as well as the preſent world, in Mal. iii. 18. <hi>Then ſhall ye return, and diſcern between the righteous and the wicked; between him that ſerveth God, and him that ſerveth him not.</hi> An examination of the context, will convince every man, that this declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion refers to the day of judgment; repreſented there, as <hi>the day when God makes up his jewels,</hi> and as <hi>the day that ſhall burn as an oven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, my brethren, why is all this diſtinction made? Why are the characters, the ſtate, and the ends, of good and bad men, repreſented as ſo entirely different, if there is a time coming, when they ſhall both ſtand upon the ſame footing, and both be equally acceptable to God, and happy in the enjoyment of him? Why is all this parade, in the word of God, concerning the neceſſity of a change of heart, the importance of faith, and the indiſpenſable ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of holineſs, in order to our ſeeing God in happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, if we are all to do ſo, ſooner or later, let us be ever ſo unholy, or unbelieving? Why are eternal life, and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, promiſed only to men, of a certain character, if men of all characters are finally to partake of them? Why is it ſaid, <hi>without holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord,</hi> if we ſhall all ſee him, ſooner or later, whether we are holy or no? Why is it ſaid, with ſo much ſolemnity, 1 Cor. vi. 9, 10. <hi>Know ye not, that the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived, neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abuſers of themſelves with man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, ſhall inherit the kingdom of God!</hi> Why is this declaration made, I ſay, if men of theſe characters, be they ever ſo vicious, though they may live and die in the love and conſtant, allowed, deliberate practice of every one of theſe vices, ſhall finally enter the kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? If the man, who wallows in blood, who breaks through every ſocial, and moral obligation; who prevents and deſtroys the happineſs of millions; who wantons in the miſery and wretchedneſs of whole nations, and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of men: if this man, living and dying under the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, and government of theſe ferocious paſſions, is to be finally happy, and glorious to all eternity, what need is there of ſelf-denial, and mortification? Why need we give
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:018207_0012_0FA5BC49988B8DD8"/>
diligence to make our calling and election ſure? Why ſhould we ſtudy, and take pains to be ſaints, and conformed to the image of God? Surely, this is labour loſt, and good men are in this life moſt miſerable!</p>
            <p>If the time is to come, when all men ſhall be admitted to the divine favour and happineſs; then, ſurely, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction, which is ſo carefully made in the ſcriptures of God, between good and bad men, is nugatory and vain! We need take no pains to become Chriſtians, or to live and walk as they are directed to do. We may as well gratify our paſſions and appetites, as not do ſo; for throughout eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, it will be the ſame thing to us, every diſtinction ſhall be levelled, and we ſhall all be happy alike! Perhaps there cannot be concluſions, more natural in themſelves, or which will be more univerſally drawn by mankind, from the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine we are oppoſing, than theſe. And can there be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions, more fatal to the intereſts of virtue and holineſs, or more pernicious to human ſociety? To what purpoſe tend exhortations to ſaints, or alarms to ſinners, if they are to meet at laſt, without diſtinction, in the ſame happy world? And what is there to prevent a believer in the doctrine of univerſal redemption, from committing any crime, which his intereſt, or his paſſions may dictate, if he can eſcape preſent ſhame and puniſhment?</p>
            <p>Brethren, ſolemnly would I caution, and warn you all, as you expect to anſwer it another day, to remember, that the word of God makes a very great diſtinction, between the righteous and the wicked: that the one are to be happy, while the other are to be miſerable: that it is, in this word, repreſented, as above all things neceſſary, to be believers in Jeſus Chriſt, and to be ſanctified by his holy ſpirit. Do not let any thing, any ſentiment or doctrine, diminiſh your concern about <hi>the one thing that is needful</hi>; for the hour is haſtening, when we ſhall every one find, that we could never take too much pains, nor beſtow too much ſolicitude, upon the ſalvation of our immortal ſouls.</p>
            <p n="2">II. A ſecond argument, to prove that the duration of the puniſhment of the impenitent, in the other world, ſhall be eternal; or that all men are not ſaved, ariſes from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ſin. However light ſome may eſteem this, yet we are taught, by the word of God, to view it as an evil and a
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:018207_0013_0FA5BC4A55BF13E0"/>
bitter thing under the ſun. It is there ſpoken of, in terms adapted to convey to us, the moſt formidable ideas of it; and in its conſequences, it is ſaid <hi>to bite like a ſerpent, and ſting like an adder.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is right for us to judge of the nature of an offence, from the dignity, ſituation, and circumſtances of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, againſt whom it is committed; and from the obligations, of the perſon committing it, to a contrary courſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. We cannot arrive at a preciſe idea of the nature of an offence, without taking theſe into view; for they have an intimate connection and relation. An offence of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant againſt his maſter, of a ſubject againſt his king, is greater than the offence of either of them againſt an equal.</p>
            <p>Sin is an offence committed againſt an infinite autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, for it is a violation of the laws of an infinite God. He hath guarded the injunctions of his law, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of his goſpel, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> no leſs a ſanction, than the whole weight of his infinite authority. This every ſinner knows. But notwithſtanding this knowledge, he goes directly in the face of this infinite authority. He commits ſin, though the infinite, and eternal Jehovah forbids it.</p>
            <p>The ſinner is under the higheſt obligations to a contrary courſe of conduct. God is his creator, preſerver, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor. He hath the moſt powerful motives ſet before him, to excite him to his duty, and reſtrain him from ſin. God is daily increaſing the number of his benefits to him. But notwithſtanding all this; notwithſtanding all his light, knowledge, and advantages, he doth that which is entirely wrong—he may juſtly be charged, then, with an infinite offence.</p>
            <p>An infinite offence, merits an infinite puniſhment. But man is a finite creature, he cannot be puniſhed by a ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance infinite in its nature. His puniſhment, therefore, muſt be eternal in its duration, in order to its being ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate to the offence: and thus we ſhall find, that the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of God repreſent it.</p>
            <p>There is no one thing, which all the declarations, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and threatenings of the word of God, hath a more direct tendency to ſhew us, than that God views ſin as a moſt pernicious evil; that it is directly contrary to his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is holineſs itſelf; and hath the moſt pernicious
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:018207_0014_0FA5BC4B2DCE2A70"/>
effects upon human happineſs. The ſcriptures ſpeak of it, as <hi>a great and horrible evil, as exceeding ſinful,</hi> as <hi>that which God's ſoul hateth, that which ſeparateth between God and man,</hi> and <hi>that againſt which his wrath is revealed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The word of God leads us to view ſin, as the cauſe of the death of Chriſt, and as that which produces every ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity to which mankind are ſubject. We are warned againſt it, as our bane. We have every motive, and induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſet before us, to reſtrain us from it; and are directed to make uſe of every occurrence in providence, as a motive <hi>to take away ſin.</hi> Every page of divine revelation furniſhes more or leſs arguments, to reſtrain us from iniquity.</p>
            <p>So directly contrary is ſin repreſented to be to the pure nature of the divinity, and ſo ſubverſive of human happineſs, as that without repentance of it, and turning from it, we are expreſsly told, that we ſhall not enjoy the mercy of God. We read, Prov. xx<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 13. <hi>He that covereth his ſins, ſhall not proſper: but whoſo confeſſeth and forſaketh them, ſhall have mercy.</hi> Without repentance of ſin, which includes forſaking it, we are told, that we ſhall not enjoy eternal life. <hi>Except ye repent,</hi> ſaith our Lord, Luke xiii. 3. <hi>ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh.</hi> At the ſame time that we are called upon to believe the goſpel, Mark i. 15. we are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to repent, which proves, that this is equally neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſalvation, with faith in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>How unſcriptural muſt that doctrine be, then, which tells us, that how many ſoever infinite offences againſt God we may be guilty of, and how long or obſtinately ſoever we may perſiſt in them; though we may live diſobeying the divine authority, and die blaſpheming, and curſing the name, the nature, and the works of the great and dreadful God; perſiſting in our hatred and oppoſition to him; yet we ſhall be happy at laſt: yea, that the time will come, when we ſhall be as really, and truly glorious and happy, as thoſe who have been ever ſo penitent for their offences againſt God, and ever ſo deſirous of conformity to him! Is that doctrine agreeable to ſcripture, which ſaith, that whether a man repents and forſakes ſin or no, yet he ſhall be happy at laſt? Is it not, on the contrary, reprobated by every page of the goſpel?</p>
            <p>It is moſt certain, that our partiality in our own favour,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:018207_0015_0FA5BC4C006C5A48"/>
renders us apt to excuſe, and juſtify ourſelves. Our crimes do not appear ſo heinous to us, as they are in themſelves; neither do we think that they deſerve a very heavy pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. Let a man, who hath been guilty of the moſt capital and atrocious crime, judge of the puniſhment which ought to be inflicted upon him, and we know that it will not be very heavy. Our partiality in our own favour, leads us to ſuppoſe, that we cannot deſerve any great ſuffering, for ſuch trifling offences, as natural men are ready to eſteem their ſins to be. We ought always to take this thought into view, when we are judging upon ourſelves, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to find the light in which we ſtand, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to our Maker.</p>
            <p n="3">III. A third argument, in ſupport of our doctrine, is drawn from the plain, and poſitive declarations of the word of God.</p>
            <p>The whole ſcope of revelation appears to be, to lead us to a view of this truth; and to ſhew us the great and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing difference, which there is, in this world, and which there will be in the next, between thoſe who are ſubjects of the grace of God, and thoſe who remain in their ſins and iniquities. And declarations to this purpoſe, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſperſed in every part of the ſcriptures.</p>
            <p>We ſhall begin with that remarkable declaration of our Lord, concerning the man who betrayed him, Mark xiv. 21. <hi>Good were it for that man, if he had never been born.</hi> The plain meaning of which is, that it would have been far better for Judas never to have had exiſtence at all, than<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by his own folly and wickedneſs, to have expoſed himſelf to everlaſting ruin and deſtruction.</p>
            <p>Now, if the time will come, be it after ever ſo many ages, wherein Judas ſhall be happy and glorious, this declaration cannot be true. The felicity of heaven is ſo exquiſitely great, as to counterbalance every pain, which we can, in this world, or in the <hi>Limbus patrum</hi> of the <hi>pious</hi> church of Rome, undergo. Surely, infinite glory, which can never know an end; <hi>which eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man to conceive of;</hi> this glory, enjoyed eternally, will render it far better for Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das to have been born, than not to have been ſo. He muſt bleſs God, to all eternity, for his exiſtence in ſuch glory,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:018207_0016_0FA5BC4FCBC467C8"/>
let him before have endured ever ſo much anguiſh, and diſtreſs; and it will be better for him to have been born, in exact proportion, between a finite, and infinite duration.</p>
            <p>But, ſurely, that doctrine, which admits Judas Iſcariot, the covetous defrauder of his maſter in life, and the baſe, treacherous betrayer of him to death; whom Jeſus Chriſt himſelf calls, <hi>the ſon of perdition;</hi> and who was ſo filled with horror and deſpair, at his own vileneſs and guilt, as to put an end to his life, with his own hands: this doctrine, I ſay, muſt be friendly to abandoned characters; and muſt ſerve to make every man's conſcience eaſy, let him live and die ever ſo wickedly.</p>
            <p>If it is declared, in the word of God, that there is one ſin, which never ſhall be forgiven to a man: then it follows, that any one, nay, all, who are guilty of this ſin, ſhall fall ſhort of eternal life, and of conſequence be eternally mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable: for no one will be ſo abſurd as to ſay, that men ſhall be ſaved, and glorified, without having their ſins for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given them: but our Lord himſelf hath ſaid, Matt. xii. 31, 32. <hi>Wherefore I ſay unto you, all manner of ſin and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy ſhall be forgiven unto men: but the blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt ſhall not be forgiven unto men. And whoſoever ſpeaketh a word againſt the Son of man, it ſhall be forgiven him: but whoſoever ſpeaketh againſt the Holy Ghoſt, it ſhall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, nor in the world to come.</hi> This is the plain language of ſcripture; and there are other parts of it conſentaneous to this. Now, we cannot ſuppoſe, that ſuch a denunciation ſhould be made againſt a ſin, of which mankind never can be guilty; becauſe this would be trifling with the moſt important concerns of mankind, and would ſerve only to excite uſeleſs terrors. Could no man then, had no man before, and ſhould no one after, be guilty of this offence, we have every reaſon to think, that nothing would have been ſaid concerning it. But if there is a ſin, which never ſhall be forgiven, either in this world, or the other; and any one man, either here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore hath, or hereafter ſhall, be guilty of it; then there is one man who ſhall not be ſaved, and of conſequence the parade made by our adverſaries, with their univerſal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellations, appears to be groundleſs. Thus much, at leaſt, is demonſtrable, that the fear of being utterly denied for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:018207_0017_0FA5BC50544EBB00"/>
either in time or eternity, is held up as a motive to reſtrain us from ſin; which would not have been done, had this motive no exiſtence in reality. Divine revelation deals not in fictitious terrors.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="2" type="sermon">
            <head>SERMON II.</head>
            <p>IN order to prove the eternal duration of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the wicked, or that all men are not finally ſaved, we proceed to obſerve,</p>
            <p>That eternal miſery is ſet againſt eternal happineſs, is the word of God: and the one is ſaid to be commenſurate with the other.</p>
            <p>None pretend to diſpute the eternal duration of the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the ſaints—all agree, that they ſhall be glorious and bleſſed for ever:—indeed, the ſtrongeſt terms are made uſe of, to point out this duration. But terms equally ſtrong are uſed, to repreſent the everlaſting puniſhment of the wicked: —the miſery of the one, is ſet in contraſt with the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the other.</p>
            <p>In Rom. vi. laſt, the apoſtle Paul makes this declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>The wages of ſin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life, through Jeſus Chriſt, our Lord.</hi> Here the miſery and ruin, conſequent upon ſin, are evidently contraſted with the life and happineſs, which will be the reward of the ſaints of God. The one is ſet over againſt the other.</p>
            <p>But this contraſt, and the eternal duration of the ſaint's glory, and the ſinner's puniſhment, are moſt ſtrikingly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played, in the account given of the general judgment, by our Lord himſelf, Matt. xxv. He there deſcribes the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the ſaint and the ſinner: he declares what evidence ſhall be produced, to prove this character: he relates the ſentence which ſhall be paſſed upon both, according to their character and deſerts. The righteous ſhall receive a plaudit from their Judge, and ſhall <hi>inherit the kingdom pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for them from the foundation of the world.</hi> The ſentence of the wicked is to be pronounced in theſe terms—(trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, our ſouls, when ye hear it, leſt it ſhould be your fate!) —<hi>Depart from me, ye curſed, into everlaſting fire, prepared for
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:018207_0018_0FA5BC525DDCB6E0"/>
the devil and his angels.</hi> The whole account is cloſed thus; <hi>And theſe</hi> (i. e. the wicked) <hi>ſhall go away into everlaſting puniſhment, but the righteous into life eternal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And with reſpect to the laſt ſentence quoted, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to obſerve, that the very ſame word is uſed in the Greek, to expreſs <hi>everlaſting</hi> and <hi>eternal,</hi> (the word aioonios) and our tranſlators altered the phraſes, probably, to avoid a too frequent repetition of the ſame term. Here then, without diſpute, the miſery of the wicked is put in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſt with the happineſs of the righteous. The ſame term, preciſely, expreſſes the duration of the happineſs of one, and the miſery of the other: ſo that, according to this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of our Lord, thoſe who die impenitent, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing, ſhall be miſerable as long as thoſe, who obey the goſpel, ſhall be happy. Theſe, our opponents themſelves allow, ſhall be bleſſed and glorious as long as God exiſts: and doth it not follow, then, that the impenitent ſhall be miſerable as long?</p>
            <p>The fire, into which the finally impenitent are to be caſt, is called here, everlaſting fire, (to pur to aioonion); and their puniſhment is ſtyled, an everlaſting puniſhment. This ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument would carry demonſtration with it, were it not true, that the word is ſometimes uſed in a limited ſenſe, in the ſcriptures of divine revelation.</p>
            <p>That it is not always uſed in a limited ſenſe (as ſome have had the hardineſs to aſſert) will be evident to you, when I aſſure you (from a careful examination of the Septuagint tranſlation, and the Greek teſtament) that the word is often, nay, by far oftener (perhaps as much as nine times in ten) uſed to ſignify an unlimited duration. Thus is the word (aioonios) uſed to repreſent the eternity of God, Gen. xxi. 33. Iſai. xl. 28. Rom. vi. 26. It is uſed, likewiſe, to repreſent his attributes, which are ſurely everlaſting, as Pſal. c. 5. His mercy is <hi>everlaſting.</hi> Pſal. cxix. 142. Thy righteouſneſs is an <hi>everlaſting</hi> righteouſneſs. It is uſed to repreſent the duration of the divine govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Dan. iv. 3. His kingdom is an <hi>everlaſting</hi> kingdom.</p>
            <p>This phraſe is almoſt univerſally made uſe of, to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the duration of the ſaint's happineſs, as well as of the ſinner's miſery. Iſai. xxxv. 10. And the ranſomed of the Lord ſhall return, and come to Zion, with ſongs, and <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:018207_0019_0FA5BC529CE05D50"/>
joy upon their heads. Dan. xii. 2. And many of them that ſleep in the duſt of the earth, ſhall awake; ſome to <hi>everlaſting</hi> life, and ſome to ſhame, and <hi>everlaſting</hi> contempt. John iii. 16. For God ſo loved the world, as to give his only begotten ſon, that whoſoever believeth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have <hi>everlaſting</hi> life. Iſai. xxxiii. 14. The ſinners in Zion are afraid, fearfulneſs hath ſurpriſed the hypocrites. Who among us ſhall dwell with devouring fire? Who amongſt us ſhall dwell with <hi>everlaſting</hi> burning? 2 Theſſ. i. 9. Who (ſpeaking of them that know not God, and obey not the goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt) ſhall be puniſhed with <hi>everlaſting</hi> deſtruction, from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lord, and the glory of his power.</p>
            <p>We have proved, that the word (aioonios) refers, often, to an unlimited duration; and in order to prove that it doth ſo in this xxvth Matt. we obſerve, that it is here uſed to expreſs the everlaſting happineſs of the ſaints, which, ſay our opponents, is proved by other phraſes in ſcripture. But if this duration is unlimited, and appears ſo beyond diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, then the duration of the puniſhment of the wicked is ſo, for the ſame phraſe is uſed to repreſent the one, as the other: and the happineſs of the one, is not only here, but in many other parts of ſcripture, contraſted with the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of the other. It is by no means probable, that a phraſe, ſignifying a limited duration, in the beginning of a ſhort verſe, would be uſed, before the concluſion of it, to point out an unlimited one.</p>
            <p>It hath been ſaid, by ſome aſſerters of univerſal ſalvation, that thoſe repreſented as ſtanding on the left hand, are the ſins of mankind, which are to be puniſhed, while the men themſelves eſcape: that men's ſins are the tares, but they are the wheat.</p>
            <p>This is a ſuppoſition almoſt too ridiculous to need any notice; but weak minds have been affected by it: it is proper, therefore, to ſay, that it is impoſſible, in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things, to ſeparate the ſin from the ſinner, becauſe no action can poſſibly exiſt, ſeparate from, or independent of, the agent. Is it poſſible that there ſhould be murder without a murderer? Can the murder be puniſhed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the puniſhment of him who committed it? Is there any perſonality, any conſciouſneſs, any praiſe, or blame,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:018207_0020_0FA5BC54194139A8"/>
in mere ſimple actions, ſeparate from their agent? Let us only <hi>think</hi> a ſingle moment, and we ſhall ſee the fallacy of this idea. Our thoughts, our volitions, our actions, are a part of ourſelves; they depend upon us, and cannot be ſeparated from us.</p>
            <p>Shifting their poſition, the univerſaliſts have again ſaid, that by the goats on the left hand, in this xxv Matth. are intended, the devils; but that the ſheep, on the right hand, point out mankind.</p>
            <p>But we ſhall find, if we look into the account, that both the ſheep, and the goats, are addreſſed as perſons of the ſame nature, under the ſame obligations to the ſame duties, in conſequence of the relations they ſuſtain. The goats are condemned, for the omiſſion of the ſame duties, on account of the performance of which, the ſheep are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded. But the devils are not bound to theſe duties; they are not placed in ſuch a relation to mankind; nor are they ſo converſant among them, as to render it ſuitable for them to perform theſe duties. What man wiſhes the devils to <hi>feed,</hi> or <hi>give him drink</hi>? Who doth not deprecate their taking him in? Who deſires ſuch clothing, as theſe malevolent ſpirits would beſtow upon him? Who deſires their company, or wiſhes the devils to <hi>viſit him,</hi> when he is <hi>ſick, and in priſon</hi>? And who, according to the account given of them, in holy writ, can ſuppoſe theſe duties to be incumbent upon them? And will, we aſk once more, the righteous, and holy Judge of the world, condemn any of his creatures, bad as they may be in themſelves, for not doing that which they are under no obligation to do?</p>
            <p>In proſecution of the argument, drawn from the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to prove the eternal duration of the puniſhment of the wicked, we proceed to quote Matt. xviii. 8. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if thy hand, or the foot offend thee, cut them off, and caſt them from thee. It is better for thee to enter into life halt, or maimed, rather than having two hands, or two feet, to be caſt into everlaſting fire.</hi> In the next verſe, this is ſtyled <hi>hell fire;</hi> which proves plainly, that it refers to that ſtate of puniſhment, upon which the wicked enter after death.</p>
            <p>But this is ſtill more plainly diſcovered, and the truth of our doctrine proved, by the parallel place, Mark ix. 43. Here it is ſtyled; <hi>the fire that never ſhall be quenched;</hi> (eis to
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:018207_0021_0FA5BC5622A60690"/>
pur to aſbeſton). This adjective expreſſes the perpetuity of the puniſhment of the wicked, from its very nature. It hath a principle of ſubſiſtence within itſelf, which can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by no continuance, or perpetuity of diſtreſs. Thus the phraſe, (aſbeſtos,) is made uſe of, by naturaliſts, to expreſs a kind of mineral, which was well known to the ancients, and is to us in theſe days. It is eaſily inflammable; but it never conſumes in the fire. It doth not ſuffer the leaſt diminution, nor ſeparation of its parts, from the fire. Nor doth it decreaſe in its weight, from being burnt ever ſo long. This is a fact well known. And perhaps no one body in nature, can be produced, which more plainly points out, the unquenchable fire of the bottomleſs pit; which is continually burning, but ſtill never exhauſts its fuel; which preys upon the heart-ſtrings of thoſe who endure it, without putting an end to their exiſtence, or diminiſhing their capacity to endure it.</p>
            <p>Our Lord goes on, in verſe 44, to ſpeak of hell, as the place <hi>where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.</hi> The time ſhall never come, when the agony and diſtreſs, which is repreſented by the worm, and the fire, ſhall come to a period. It is plain our Lord meant, to point out the puniſhment of the wicked; of thoſe who followed the dictates of their own corrupt hearts, and who would not deny themſelves for his ſake. It follows, therefore, that the time ſhall never come, when the puniſhment of theſe men (be it what it may) ſhall have a period.</p>
            <p>In order to evade the force of this text, the advocates for univerſal ſalvation, explain it thus: The worm ſhall not die, and the fire ſhall not be quenched, while the wicked continue in purgatory, or a ſtate of puniſhment. But, ſurely, this is to render the text perfectly nugatory: for the language of this interpretation is, as long as the worm lives, it ſhall not die: and as long as the fire burns, it ſhall not be quenched: the wicked ſhall be puniſhed as long as they are puniſhed! This is mere trifling with lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage: and interpretations of this kind, can make the bible mean any thing, or nothing. If theſe perſons will examine the Septuagint tranſlation of our text, they will find, that it expreſſes the ſentiment thus: Where their worm ſhall <hi>never</hi> die, and their fire ſhall <hi>never</hi> be quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:018207_0022_0FA5BC5663E214B8"/>
—which militates, entirely, with the interpretation they give, as well as with their ſentiments at large.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who hold to univerſal ſalvation, in order to evade the force of the argument againſt them, drawn from the happineſs of heaven being repreſented by a term, ſignifying an equal duration with the torments of hell, have obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the ſcriptures ſpeak of the happineſs of heaven, as to its duration, in other terms, beſides that of <hi>everlaſting:</hi> that they ſpeak of it, as incorruptible, &amp;c. but they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, that the ſame argument may be brought to prove, the eternal duration of the puniſhment of the wicked. In our text, in Mark ix. the torments of hell are pointed out, by an unquenchable fire; a fire durable, and laſting in its own nature; and by a worm which knows no period to its exiſtence; but always lives, and lives to gnaw. Surely theſe phraſes convey an idea, of an inheritance for the finally impenitent, equally incorruptible, though far dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, in its nature, from that which is laid up for the ſaints in glory. We may remark, alſo, that the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the wicked, is repreſented to us, as <hi>an everlaſting deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord, and the glory of his power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The nature, the exquiſite nature of the puniſhment of thoſe who die in their ſins, may be gathered from the metaphors, by which they are pointed out in the word of God. There is none of theſe more terrible, than that of fire burning, and conſuming continually, without putting an end to our exiſtence. Perhaps nothing cauſes keener anguiſh to the body, than the application of fire. That muſt, then, be a torment inconceivably great, which can, in any ſenſe, anſwer to this metaphor.</p>
            <p>The <hi>eternity</hi> of the torments of hell, is like viſe conveyed by this metaphor, Rev. xiv. 11. <hi>And the ſmoke of their tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment aſcendeth up</hi> FOR EVER <hi>and</hi> EVER; <hi>and they have no reſt, day nor night, who worſhip the beaſt, and his image, and whoſoever receiveth the mark of his name.</hi> The deſign of this text cannot be miſtaken; we know that it refers to future puniſhment; and it is peculiarly obſervable on this account: the phraſe, by which the duration of this pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment is expreſſed, (eis aioonas aioonoon) is univerſally applied, both in the old, and new teſtament, to an unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:018207_0023_0FA5BC5724D63CA0"/>
duration. It is not, in a ſingle inſtance, uſed to expreſs any other. It is never applied, to point out a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited term. And we would aſk our opponents, whether they know of any Greek phraſe, uſed in the bible, in the writings of the fathers of the church, or profane authors, which conveys a ſtronger idea of eternity? This phraſe is made uſe of, in ſcripture, to ſignify the duration of that Being, who liveth for ever and ever; as alſo the everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miſery of the grand enemy of mankind. It is uſed, alſo, Rev. xix. 3. as well as in this place, to point out, the duration of the puniſhment of ſuch, as die in their ſins; and can mean nothing ſhort of an eternal one.</p>
            <p>In addition to the texts, already quoted, to prove the eternity of hell torments, we will now ſuggeſt to your conſideration, two or three, in which it is, in ſo many words, ſaid, that all men ſhall not be ſaved.</p>
            <p>And the firſt, is the declaration of our Lord himſelf, Matt. xxii. 14. <hi>For many are called, but few are choſen.</hi> This is a moral, drawn from the parable of the marriage feaſt; and of the man, who had not on the wedding gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The expreſſion is plain, and without limitation; and muſt mean, at leaſt, as much as this: that every one, ſaint and ſinner, with the wedding garment, and without it, ſhall not finally inherit the kingdom of heaven. If it means not as much as this, it means nothing: and this is all the uſe, which we purpoſe, at preſent, to make of it.</p>
            <p>More expreſs, if poſſible, is that aſſertion of our Lord, in his ſermon upon the mount, Matt. vii. 13, 14. <hi>Enter ye in at the ſtrait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to deſtruction; and many there be, which go in thereat: becauſe ſtrait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life; and few there be that find it.</hi> Here Chriſt himſelf ſays, that there are but few, comparatively, who find the way to eternal life. How diametrically con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to this, is the propoſition, that all ſhall at laſt find it, and be happy!</p>
            <p>In one of the journeys, made by our Lord, when upon earth, a certain perſon came to him, and aſked a queſtion, highly important: <hi>Lord, are there few that be ſaved</hi>? To this, Chriſt replies, in a manner ſimilar to his declaration upon the mount: Luke xiii. 24. <hi>Strive to enter in at the
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:018207_0024_0FA5BC57EF01B100"/>
ſtrait gate; for many, I ſay unto you, will ſeek to enter in, and ſhall not be able.</hi> He then goes on, in a parabolical manner, to point out, the miſerable fate of thoſe profeſſors of religion, who delay their preparation for death, till it comes upon them; the addition which it will make to their ſufferings, to behold the happineſs of others, and the numbers of Gentiles who ſhall obtain the kingdom of heaven; while the Jews, who thought, they alone ſhould poſſeſs it, are caſt out. Now, if there are any, who ſhall ſeek to enter into the kingdom of heaven at the laſt day, (for to this, Chriſt evidently refers,) and ſhall not be able, then there will be ſome excluded thence, and of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, all will not be finally ſaved.</p>
            <p>Theſe plain, and poſitive aſſertions of our Saviour, ſeem as if they demanded our aſſent, and muſt lead us to be very careful how we indulge to an hope, totally inconſiſtent with them.</p>
            <p>We argue our doctrine,</p>
            <p n="4">IV. From the limitation, with which all the promiſes of the goſpel are attended.</p>
            <p>Theſe promiſes are not made, univerſally, to all men: or, it is not engaged to all men, let their character be what it may, that they ſhall ſhare in the bleſſings, which this goſpel promiſes. It is only to perſons of a certain cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, pointed out in the goſpel; to ſuch as <hi>believe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, are born again, hope, truſt, overcome, are obedient,</hi> or <hi>hold out to the end,</hi> that ſalvation is abſolutely promiſed, and engaged. Men of a different character; ſuch as diſbelieve, and reject the goſpel; ſuch as live, and die in ſin, unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of, and unforſaken, are the objects of goſpel threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enings. Thus, when it is promiſed, <hi>he that believeth, ſhall be ſaved;</hi> it is, at the ſame time, threatened, <hi>he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth not, ſhall be damned.</hi> But it is needleſs to quote texts to this purpoſe; your own conſtant obſervation muſt fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh you with them.</p>
            <p>I aſk, now, what man hath any right, to take any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, from any one of theſe promiſes, unleſs he poſſeſs the character, to which the promiſe is made? I aſk the aſſerters of univerſal ſalvation, whether they can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a ſingle promiſe of the goſpel, made to an unbeliever, a rejecter of goſpel grace, a conſtant, and allowed violater
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:018207_0025_0FA5BC58A2710C10"/>
of every command of God? And if they could, whether this would not, at once, render every diſtinction of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, totally unneceſſary? If the goſpel promiſes ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only to men of a certain character, have any a right to expect it, but ſuch as ſuſtain this character? Or, can a diſpenſation, which confines its benefits, in all its decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and propoſals, to ſuch as ſubmit to it, be extended to all men, without exception? Muſt not the plan of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation, be eſſentially altered, in its nature, before this can be the caſe? What miniſter of <hi>religion</hi> will ſtand up, and tell his people, "whether you accept of the goſpel we preach to you, or no: whether you ſubmit yourſelves to its directions, or not: whether you are good, or bad: righteous, or wicked; yet you ſhall ſhare in goſpel bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, and be happy at laſt?"</p>
            <p>The eternal duration of the puniſhment of the wicked, is argued,</p>
            <p n="5">V. From the nature of vicious habits.</p>
            <p>Theſe are ſtrong, and immovable by any power, ſhort of omnipotence itſelf. When a man hath contracted an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of thinking, and acting in a particular way: when he hath imbibed a love, and ſtrong inclination to it; and thus prefers acting, in this way, to any other, he cannot, without an extraneous power exerted, fall into a different way; becauſe this would be to ſuppoſe, that he could chooſe a thing, and refuſe it, at the ſame time.</p>
            <p>The word of God conſtantly repreſents vicious habits in this light, and points out the neceſſity of an exertion of divine power, in order to overcome them. The ſtrongeſt metaphorical expreſſions, as well as plain, and expreſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations, are uſed to convey to us this truth. <hi>Can the Ethiopian change his ſkin,</hi> aſks the prophet, Jer. xiii. 23. <hi>or the leopard his ſpots? then may ye alſo do good, that are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to do evil.</hi> Our Saviour, in ſo many words, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, John vi. 44. <hi>No man can come to me, except the Father, who hath ſent me, draw him.</hi> Thus do the ſcriptures ſpeak of the inveteracy of vicious habits.</p>
            <p>If they are thus inveterate, and the impenitent die un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the influence of ſuch habits, or inclinations, (as, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſuppoſition, they do,) they muſt remain, for ever, under the influence of them, unleſs a divine pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:018207_0026_0FA5BC59D046AFE0"/>
or is exerted upon them. But in the word of God, (whence all our knowledge of this matter ariſes,) we are not told, that any ſuch power ſhall be exerted: but, on the contrary, are led to conclude, that they will be given over to the influence of their own corrupt, and vicious hearts. Thus is it ſolemnly aſſerted, Rev. xxii. 11. <hi>He that is unjuſt, let him be unjuſt ſtill: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy ſtill: and he that is righteous, let him he righteous ſtill: and he that is holy, let him be holy ſtill.</hi> This text plainly declares, that in whatſoever ſituation, with reſpect to their moral cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, men are found, at the time of which it ſpeaks; in the ſame ſituation, they ſhall remain. That this time is the day of judgment, is evident, from the verſe which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows: <hi>And behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work ſhall be.</hi> Whence it follows concluſively, that in the ſame ſituation as we are found, at the time of judgment; whether holy, or not holy; believing, or unbelieving; in that ſame ſituation ſhall we remain, throughout eternity.</p>
            <p>It is moſt certain, that vicious habits ſtrengthen by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence. The longer we give way to, and are under the influence of them, the more we are attached to them; the leſs willing we are to be diveſted of them, and the more forcible they grow; like a river, ſmall at its ſource, but increaſing as it flows, till its torrent becomes irreſiſtible. If the wicked, then, die under the influence of ſuch ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits; if their ſouls are filled with malevolence to the God who made, and the beings who ſurround them; if, as we have ſeen, no alteration will be made upon them beyond the grave; then they muſt increaſe in this malevolence, and the expreſſions of it, to all eternity. Their ſouls will not be at all more reconciled to God, or one another, by the torments they undergo; but they will be continually increaſing in their rage and enmity.</p>
            <p>We are led to this idea, by an expreſſion uſed by our Lord, in an expoſition of a parable of his, Matt. xiii. 49, 50. <hi>So ſhall it be at the end of the world; the angels ſhall come forth, and ſever the wicked from among the juſt; and ſhall caſt them into the furnace of fire: there ſhall be wailing, and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi> This latter expreſſion is always uſed, in ſcripture, to convey to us, an idea of the higheſt degree
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:018207_0027_0FA5BC5A38073748"/>
of rage, and malevolence; the utmoſt exacerbation of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Thus ſaith Job, xvi. 9. <hi>He teareth me in his wrath, who hateth me; he gnaſheth upon me with his teeth.</hi> The ſame expreſſion is uſed, to expreſs the rage, and cruel paſſion, which filled the breaſts of the Jews againſt Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen, when he had faithfully reproved them for their ſins, Acts vii. 54. <hi>When they heard theſe things, they were cut to the heart; and they gnaſhed on him with their teeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When, therefore, hell is deſcribed as the place of <hi>gnaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of teeth,</hi> we are led to conceive of the rage, and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent reſentment, which fills the breaſts of the miſerable inhabitants, againſt God, and goodneſs. From the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, and unlimited expreſſion of this rage, according to their ability, it will increaſe, and gain ſtrength, inſtead of being diminiſhed, or aboliſhed; and of conſequence, they will, to eternity, remain under the influence, and puniſhment of it. We argue,</p>
            <p n="6">VI. That the doctrine of univerſal ſalvation, is not true, becauſe it hath a tendency to diminiſh, and enervate the motives, by which men are urged to embrace the goſpel.</p>
            <p>No doctrine can come from God, which hath a tendency to introduce licentiouſneſs, or lead men to deſpiſe the law, or goſpel of God: for this would contradict his nature, which is pure, and holy; and would be totally inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with, and oppoſite to, the other doctrines of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Chriſt: for he came into the world, not to deſtroy, but to fulfil, the law of morality.</p>
            <p>We know that one of the moſt ſtrong, and powerful arguments, uſed in the ſcriptures, to quicken men to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the goſpel, and ſubmit to its precepts, is drawn from the fatal conſequences, with which a rejection of them, and diſobedience to it, will be attended. We are warned <hi>to flee from the wrath to come. Knowing the terrors of the Lord,</hi> the miniſters of religion <hi>perſuade men.</hi> Senſible that <hi>the wrath of God is revealed from heaven, againſt all ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and unrighteouſneſs of men,</hi> they <hi>beſeech men, in Chriſt's ſtead, to become reconciled unto God.</hi> And they uſe the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the law, as the moſt powerful inducement, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken ſinners from their ſtupid lethargy, and rouſe them to attend to their moſt intereſting concerns.</p>
            <p>And, in the preſent melancholy ſtate of human nature,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:018207_0028_0FA5BC5B0680E2F0"/>
theſe are the moſt energetic motives, which can be uſed with men; and they are the moſt likely to influence their minds. We know that mankind are not governed by a ſenſe of rectitude: They have not ſuch a reſpect to the Deity, as to cauſe them to follow a courſe of conduct in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with their paſſions, in order to pleaſe, or to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him. We know, on the contrary, that they are univerſally attached to ſinful indulgences: They love iniquity of every kind, and follow it with greedineſs; Nothing, therefore, but the terror of heavy puniſhment, the apprehenſion of endleſs ruin, will excite them to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake their ſinful courſes, and take up with a new courſe of thinking, and acting. Mankind are not affected with a ſenſe of gratitude, for benefits received: neither are they ingenuous enough, to be broken off from vice, and excited to virtue, by any motive, ſhort of ruin and deſtruction.</p>
            <p>That doctrine, then, which hath a tendency to enervate the force of this argument, hath a tendency, likewiſe, to prevent the effect of the goſpel upon the minds of men, and of conſequence to introduce licentiouſneſs. But the doctrine of univerſal reſtitution, hath this tendency, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it aſſures men, that, let them act as they will, be they good or bad, righteous or wicked; although they live and die with the moſt confirmed inveteracy to Jeſus Chriſt, to his goſpel, to his people, and his ways; yet the time will come, when they ſhall get to heaven. Bring men to believe this, and in vain ſhall we urge upon them the deformity of vice, and the excellency of virtue:—in vain ſhall we declare to them, the plain and poſitive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God:—in vain ſhall we addreſs their reaſon, their gratitude, their ingenuity. The voice of criminal incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation will ſound ſtill louder, and will be obeyed. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted of theſe friendly terrors, they will gratify every vicious propenſity, without a check; and will mount to the higheſt pitch of wickedneſs.</p>
            <p>This we know to be the caſe; becauſe even the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of everlaſting puniſhment, is inſufficient to reſtrain depraved man, from criminal indulgences. Though he believes, and knows, that everlaſting miſery, and anguiſh, will be the conſequence of ſin, allowed, and perſiſted in; yet, with all his apprehenſions about him, he ruſhes on the
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:018207_0029_0FA5BC5BA40E1A40"/>
thick boſſes of the divine buckler, and dares almighty vengeance. Though he may feel himſelf ſinged with the flames of the bottomleſs pit; yet, ſtill he ſins, and ſins again. So ſtrong is the force of natural corruption!</p>
            <p>And if apprehenſions of everlaſting puniſhment, are inſufficient to reſtrain the ſinner, how much leſs will the fear of a few ages of purgatory, to be ſucceeded by endleſs bliſs? With how keen a reliſh, will he follow the dictates of every ſinful propenſity? His purgatory will be ſhort; it will be but a point, when compared with eternity; and heaven will make amends for all! Thus will the ſinner reaſon; and indeed, were this doctrine true, his reaſoning would be juſt.</p>
            <p>Doth not this thought prove, to every man's feeling, and conviction, the pernicious conſequences of a doctrine, ſo pleaſing to human nature? Have we any need to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh the force of thoſe motives, by which men are, in any degree, reſtrained from the practice of ſin? Shall we, in this age of licentiouſneſs, throw down any barriers, by which men are kept from ſinful indulgence? Let the friends of the doctrine of reſtitution, reaſon as they may; yet we do know, that men will indulge themſelves more freely in ſin, if they believe it to be puniſhed only for a limited time, than if they thought it would be followed with everlaſting miſery. It is not acting a friendly part to mankind, then, to take away the force of this reſtraint.</p>
            <p>Were men to <hi>act,</hi> univerſally, under the belief of the doctrine of reſtitution, and indulge, without fear, to every propenſity within them, which was not prevented by the force of human laws, in what a ſtate would ſociety ſoon be? Every thing that could eſcape the cenſure of the judge, would be acted without controul; and this would would be a conſtant ſcene of murder, rapine, and theft! Every moral, every religious tie, which interfered with their paſſions, would be burſt aſunder, with equal caſe as Sampſon's flaxen cords; and riot, anarchy, and confuſion, would univerſally prevail!—Bleſſed conſequences of this gentle, lulling doctrine!</p>
            <p>However contemptibly religion, and its conſiderations, may be viewed by ſome, in the preſent day; yet we have every reaſon to believe, that the fear of everlaſting miſery,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:018207_0030_0FA5BC5C6583C280"/>
in the world to come, reſtrains very many, from indulging to courſes, which they would otherwiſe ſtrenuouſly purſue! The apprehenſion of this ruin, keeps hold of many a man's conſcience, which nothing elſe could bind; and makes him ſhudder at the thought of crimes, which he would otherwiſe freely commit! Take away this reſtraint; make him believe, that whatever he does, or ſays, yet he ſhall be happy at laſt; and he will become the moſt abandoned of men! Now he doth much wickedneſs, with eternal deſtruction before his eyes:—to how much more would he indulge, if this reſtraint was taken away!</p>

            <p>HAVING adduced a number of arguments, by which we ſuppoſe it to be proved, that the duration of the puniſhment, of ſuch as die in their ſins, ſhall be eternal; we come now to anſwer the objections, which are produced againſt this doctrine.</p>
            <p>OBJ. 1. And the firſt, to which we ſhall attend, is, That this doctrine is inconſiſtent with the divine mercy.</p>
            <p>Men are very apt to judge of the divine character, and diſpenſations, from their own limited and contracted views. They bring the Almighty down to <hi>their</hi> ſtandard, and pronounce, that he can conſiſtently do this thing, and cannot do the other, with as much confidence, as if <hi>they had known the mind of the Lord, and been his counſellors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it is to be remembered, that <hi>God is in heaven, and we upon earth;</hi> and therefore we cannot form adequate conceptions of him, or his ways. Our knowledge is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly limited—we have no preciſe ideas of the world about us—we have not adequate conceptions of ourſelves, of our own exiſtence, and properties. We dare defy all the philoſophers upon earth, to deſcribe, with preciſion and truth, the manner in which their minds influence their bodies, when they will to move a ſingle finger! And ſhall ſuch creatures, <hi>who are of yeſterday, and know nothing,</hi> ſet themſelves up to determine, what is conſiſtent with the divine mercy, and what is not? Shall they bring the
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:018207_0031_0FA5BC5D2E9C53C8"/>
infinite Jehovah to their ſtandard, and preſume to ſay, that one thing is right for him to do, and another is not? —Surely, this is <hi>a knowledge too wonderful us.</hi> Let us remember, too, that we are parties, intereſted in this caſe; that we are determining, what mercy and favour ſhall be ſhewn to ourſelves: and this circumſtance alone, is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to diſqualify us, from judging rightly in the caſe.</p>
            <p>Let us ſearch the word of God:—if this reveals the doctrine of eternal puniſhment, it is ſufficient to demand our aſſent, and prove to us, alſo, that it is perfectly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with his mercy. When we have once eſtabliſhed in our minds, that the ſcriptures are a revelation from God, we are bound, if we would act rationally, to believe every thing they ſay, how much ſoever it may ſurpaſs our reaſon. We know that the Almighty will not impoſe upon us—we know, too, that he cannot be impoſed upon, or reveal that for truth, which is falſhood—we are aſſured, that he knows what is conſiſtent with his mercy, and will do nothing but what is perfectly right. If, then, the doctrine we have been ſupporting, is founded upon ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, (of which, judge ye!) it muſt ſtand firm, and eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed; and this objection doth not, in the leaſt, affect it.</p>
            <p>But even, on the views of the objectors, we are not ſure, that ſuch a puniſhment, as we have been ſpeaking of, is inconſiſtent with the mercy and goodneſs of God. What ſhould we think of a legiſlator, who guarded his laws with a ſanction inadequate to their importance; and who ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered his lenient diſpoſition, ſo to influence him, as to forbid any capital puniſhment to be inflicted, in any caſe whatever? What ſhould we think of a judge, who was to acquit, and pardon all who were brought before him, were they innocent or guilty? Should we eſteem his character complete, becauſe his tenderneſs of diſpoſition, would not permit him to cauſe any miſery, or unhappineſs, to the moſt abandoned criminal, that was judged by him? What conſequences would this ſoon have upon ſociety; and what crimes would it not occaſion? The anſwer, and the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, is eaſy.</p>
            <p>The welfare of ſociety, requires the puniſhment of thoſe, who violate its laws, in order that they may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded; and that the end, for which government was
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:018207_0032_0FA5BC5DD4BF7E30"/>
inſtituted, may be anſwered. And this puniſhment muſt be adapted to the nature of the offence, in order to its anſwering the purpoſe: if it is not, the law, and the law-makers, will be both of them contemptible. The laws of God are guarded with ſuch a ſanction, as we have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ſhew, in the paſt ſubject. If, then, it is not executed, will it not be diſhonorary to God? If he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces threatenings, which he means not to execute; if he declares abſolutely, that he will do that, which, it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards appears, he never deſigned, nor thought of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; will it not give us the idea of weakneſs, and want of veracity, in him? And muſt not his government be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, in the ſight of all beings?</p>
            <p>We know not of what importance the eternal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the wicked may be, to promote the happineſs, and maintain the order of univerſal being. We know not but that the inhabitants of innumerable worlds, may be reſtrained from ſin and folly, by beholding the miſeries of this. We know not what effect the ſight of the miſery of the wicked, may have upon the ſaints and angels in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to preſerve them in their integrity: for though we are aſſured, that they ſhall preſerve it, yet we know not but that it may be in the way of means and motives. So much as this we know, that the puniſhment of the wicked will diſplay, to all perſons, and all worlds, the glory of the divine juſtice and holineſs.</p>
            <p>If God hath declared to ſinners, that the conſequences of their crimes ſhall be eternal death; and they, with this conſequence before their eyes, freely and voluntarily do that, to which this puniſhment is annexed, can they charge God with injuſtice, and want of mercy, if he inflicts it upon them? Are they not paying the price, which they knew they ſhould have to pay, for their vicious indulgence? What plea will they have to make, to excuſe them from ſuffering it? Will not their <hi>mouths be ſtopped, and their ſouls become guilty before God?</hi> They knew, when they commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſin, that this would be the conſequence of it; and who, but themſelves, can they blame, if they feel this conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence?</p>
            <p>We are always to remember, that God is juſt, as well as merciful. Indiſcriminate mercy, in a judge, is injuſtice.
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:018207_0033_0FA5BC610B1E9E60"/>
God owes ſomething to his rectitude and holineſs, to his averſion from ſin, as well as to his mercy. One perfection is not to ſwallow up another, or crowd it out from exerciſe.</p>
            <q>"A God all mercy, is a God unjuſt."</q>
            <p>Strict, inflexible juſtice, requires the everlaſting puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſinner, who here refuſes and rejects offered ſalvation. This, our antagoniſts will not deny. And is it right, that mercy ſhould overcome the dictates of juſtice, in every inſtance whatever? The anſwer is eaſy.</p>
            <p>Our antagoniſts aſk, whether we wiſh, or deſire, the worſt enemy we have in the world, to be eternally miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? We anſwer, with truth, in the negative!—They aſk again, is not God more compaſſionate than you? We re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, without doubt; but he is more juſt too. A man of true humanity, never beheld a criminal executed, without wiſhing to reprieve him, if it could be done with ſafety to ſociety. But his compaſſion would be weakneſs, if he wiſhed to ſpare him, and let him looſe again, to murder, rob, and deſtroy. It may be ſaid, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon does not hold: but we aſk, who firſt introduced it?</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, if we conſider our utter incapacity to judge, with preciſion, upon the divine nature and will; the certainty with which we may depend upon what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation declares; if we realize, again, what, even in our view, belongs to the character of a juſt judge; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that the divine juſtice is as truly amiable as his mercy; we ſhall ſee the objection to have no weight.</p>
            <p>OBJ. 2. It is objected again, that no puniſhment can be juſt, but that which is calculated for the good of the offender.</p>
            <p>This is not true; for capital puniſhments, for certain offences, are preſcribed by the law of God, and adopted by every nation. Such capital puniſhments, reaching to the life of the offendér, cannot be calculated to promote his good. Let men (if they will be governed by their own ideas) only reaſon upon the doctrine before us, as they do in other caſes, and many difficulties will vaniſh, which now obſtruct the truth from their view.</p>
            <p>We reject, with horror, the idea, that the Almighty puniſhes any, from the ſame principle, which, in man, is revenge, or reſentment—we know, that he hath no male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:018207_0034_0FA5BC630BD61720"/>
in his nature; and we may be aſſured, that, if he puniſhes any of his creatures with an infinite puniſhment, it is becauſe he ſees it neceſſary, fit and right, that he ſhould do ſo. God will do no wrong, nor injury, to any of his creatures; but will manifeſt himſelf to be juſt, and merciful in his conduct, towards them.</p>
            <p>OBJ. 3. We will now proceed to conſider thoſe texts of ſcripture, which are produced to prove, that all men ſhall be ſaved.</p>
            <p>And here we muſt remark, that no ſcripture is of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate interpretation—that we are not to form our ideas of a doctrine, from a ſingle text of ſcripture, or from ſeveral ſuch, how plauſible ſoever they may appear, if that doctrine contradicts the general run of ſcripture, and is inconſiſtent with the univerſal ideas held out by the word of God. The Holy Ghoſt is the beſt interpreter of his own mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing—he beſt knows what he intended by his own decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations—<hi>for what man knoweth the things of a man, ſave the ſpirit of a man which is in him? Even ſo, the things of God knoweth no man, but the ſpirit of God.</hi> 1. Cor ii. 11.</p>
            <p>The firſt text produced by the univerſaliſts, which we ſhall mention, is, 1 Tim. ii. 4. <hi>Who will have all men to be ſaved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.</hi> This, our antagoniſts ſay, proves, that God is willing that all men ſhall enjoy eternal life; and that they ſhall actually do ſo.</p>
            <p>We agree with them, that there is ſalvation for all men: that this is freely offered to the chief of ſinners in the goſpel: that it is God's will, that they ſhould accept of it; nay, his poſitive commandment.</p>
            <p>It is the will of God, that all men ſhould both now, and hereafter, obey his commands, and be perfectly holy. Who will ſay, that God doth not will all men to do as, he requires them? But we know, that they do not comply with his will; neither doth he exert his almighty power, to make them do ſo. All men are not holy, and yet the apoſtle ſaith, 1 Theſſ. iv. 3. <hi>This is the will of God, even your ſanctification.</hi> God never wills men to be any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than holy, for he commands them all to be ſo: but we ſee he leaves them to their own choice; and if they will not obey his commandments, he will puniſh them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. There is nothing in the text produced, which
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:018207_0035_0FA5BC6352715BF8"/>
proves more than this, that God commands, and therefore wills, all men to believe, to be holy, and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This is agreeable to him; and he <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

               </gap> agreeableneſs, by the pains which he <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

               </gap>, in every age of the world.</p>
            <p>Beſides, this text hath a direct connection with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation of the apoſtle, v. 1, 2, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>I exhort therefore, that firſt of all, ſupplications, prayers, interceſſions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men; for kings, and for all in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life, in all godlineſs and honeſty: for this is good and acceptable in the ſight of God our ſaviour, who will have all men to be ſaved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.</hi> As a motive to quicken the Chriſtian miniſter, to whom he wrote, to pray for the progreſs of the goſpel, and the happineſs of mankind in conſequence, the apoſtle declares, that ſuch prayers would be acceptable in the ſight of God; it was grateful to him, to have prayers made for the progreſs of the goſpel, becauſe God willed, and commanded all men to ſubmit to it, and be ſaved. He was not to confine his good wiſhes and prayers to one nation, or part of the world only, becauſe God did not mean thus to confine the bleſſings of it; but willed all men to believe, and obey it. The ſubſequent context proves this interpretation to be right—<hi>for there is one God, and one mediator between God and man, the man Chriſt Jeſus, who gave himſelf a ranſom for all, to be teſtified in due time.</hi> Men ought not to worſhip idols, when there is but one God—they ought not to deſpair of pardon and acceptance, becauſe there is one mediator between God and man—they may be aſſured, that, let their nation or character be what they may, they are ſtill welcome to his mediation, for <hi>he died a ranſom for all;</hi> and he ſhall be teſtified as a ſaviour to all, in due time—the period ſhall arrive, when the goſpel ſhall be preached to every creature, and have an univerſal ſpread.</p>
            <p>Coming to the knowledge of the truth, is mentioned, in this text, as neceſſary to ſalvation: but if all men ſhall enjoy it at laſt, let them be ever ſo ignorant, or ever ſo wicked, then how can this knowledge be neceſſary to ſalvation?</p>
            <p>When it is ſaid, 1 Tim. iv. 10. that <hi>God is the ſaviour of
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:018207_0036_0FA5BC64F14BA4E8"/>
all men, eſpecially of thoſe that believe,</hi> it evidently refers to a temporal ſalvation; to ſupport under, and deliverance from, outward affliction; becauſe it is thus introduced— <hi>for therefore, we both labour and ſuffer reproach, becauſe we truſt in the living God, who,</hi> &amp;c. All men, in every age, and every country, experience a greater or leſs degree of this ſalvation: but thoſe who believe; and are thus ſavingly intereſted in goſpel bleſſings, may depend upon ſpecial, and peculiar ſupports, under troubles of every kind.</p>
            <p>The latter part of the 5th Rom. is quoted by our oppoſers, to ſupport their ſentiments: but if we conſider it atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, and compare it with the connection in which it ſtands, and other declarations of the ſame apoſtle, we ſhall find, that the general truths, meant to be conveyed by St. Paul, are theſe—that, although one ſin involved the whole world of mankind in miſery, yet, under the goſpel, many and aggravated offences, ſhould not prevent any man's ſalvation:—that we are placed, by the grace of God, in a ſtate of probation, far preferable to that of Adam, becauſe one fall ruined him, but we may be pardoned many offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:—that believers, under the goſpel, are entitled to greater privileges here, and greater glory hereafter, than Adam was, in innocence; and therefore the grace and goodneſs of Chriſt hath abounded far above the ſin of Adam:—we were loſt in one, we may be ſaved in one, if our own folly and perverſeneſs prevent not.—If every ill conſequence of the fall of Adam, is removed from every man, and he is in a better ſituation than he would have been if Adam had retained his innocence, (as the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the apoſtle muſt prove, as it is interpreted by the univerſaliſts); then why do ſo many troubles and diſtreſſes remain among men; and why is any puniſhment inflicted upon them even here—why is not this world a paradiſe— and what right hath death to deprive us of exiſtence here? It may be ſaid, with truth, that theſe are neceſſary; that the happineſs of the whole, is promoted by the ſufferings of a part. But if it is neceſſary, that puniſhment and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering ſhould take place now, who can ſay, it will not be equally neceſſary to eternity? For, the ſame reaſons, which make it right and fit for God to inflict temporary puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will make it equally right and fit, for ought we, or the univerſaliſts know, to inflict eternal puniſhment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:018207_0037_0FA5BC6709698BC0"/>The aſſertion of the apoſtle, 1 Cor. xv. 22. <hi>For as in Adam all die, even ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive,</hi> is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other text, upon which some unthinking aſſerters of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal redemption, found their belief:—but if we examine the chapter, from beginning to end, we ſhall find, that it is addreſſed only to, and ſpeaks only of, ſaints, or believers in Jeſus Chriſt; ſuch as believed, as were not yet <hi>in their ſins,</hi> as ſhould be <hi>the firſt fruits of Chriſt at his coming.</hi> But was not this the caſe, the apoſtle is ſpeaking, for ought that appears, of nothing more, nor leſs, than a reſurrection from temporal death. The idea, conveyed by his words, is ſimply this:—As all men are ſubject to temporal death, in conſequence of the fall of the firſt Adam, ſo all men ſhall be raiſed to natural life again, at the reſurrection, in conſequence of the ſufferings of the ſecond Adam. Of the reſurrection of the body, and of that only, is the apoſtle diſcourſing, in this chapter; and to make the text quoted, refer to eternal ſalvation, is neither more, nor leſs, than wreſting its ſenſe.</p>
            <p>The declaration of the apoſtle, with reſpect to the time when Chriſt ſhall deliver up the mediatorial kingdom to the Father, is another text, quoted by our oppoſers, to prove their ſentiments: <hi>Then cometh the end, when he ſhall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the father; when he ſhall have put down all rule, and all authority, and power: for he muſt reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet:— the laſt enemy, that ſhall be deſtroyed, is death.</hi> If we examine theſe texts, in the connexion wherein they ſtand, we ſhall find, that the apoſtle is ſtill ſpeaking of the day of the reſurrection, when a final period ſhall be put to all the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to his deſigns, which Chriſt hath met with, from men and devils: that death, which now reigns over all, both good and bad, ſhall then be ſubdued: he ſhall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh all that he had in deſign, when he took upon him the human nature: he ſhall appear to have glorified his Father's mercy, and his juſtice, and ſhall give up the office of a mediator, ſo as that he will plead no more for the pardon of the ſins of any, who then remain without an intereſt in him; but will leave them to the conſequences of their perverſe rejections of him. Theſe things ſhall take place at the day of judgment; for <hi>then,</hi> which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduces
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:018207_0038_0FA5BC67965D4FB0"/>
the text we are conſidering, immediately ſucceeds, and of conſequence hath reference to, the time of Chriſt's <hi>coming:</hi> by which phraſe, the day of judgment is frequently pointed out in the new-teſtament; and therefore hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect unto it. Now, if there are any, who are declared to be rejected of Chriſt, in the judgment day (and that there are, Matth. xxv. and other places of ſcripture, aſſure us), then they will be for ever rejected of him, for he will act no longer in the character of a mediator—there will be none to ſave them. This declaration, then, inſtead of proving the contrary, aſſerts, implicitly, the eternal dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the puniſhment of the wicked.</p>
            <p>In 1 Joh. iii. 8. it is ſaid, <hi>He that committeth ſin, is of the devil; for the devil ſinneth from the beginning: for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, the Son of God was manifeſted, that he might deſtroy the works of the devil.</hi> This, ſtrange as it may appear, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be a ſtrong proof, that all men ſhall be finally ſaved. But who, without a favourite ſyſtem to ſupport, would have thought of putting any other interpretation upon the words, than ſimply this?—All who live in ſin, and will not forſake it, are of the devil: Chriſt came into the world, to deſtroy ſin, to bring men off from it: no man is, therefore, ſubject to Chriſt, or can be entitled to his bleſſings, who lives in ſin.—View it in its connexion, and in its plain, obvious meaning, you will find it to be parallel to thoſe—<hi>No man can ſerve two maſters.—Do we, then, make void the law, through faith? God forbid: yea, we eſtabliſh the law.</hi>—But, even in the ſenſe of our op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers, it proves nothing in their favour: if we ſuppoſe ſinners to be meant, by the works of the devil, we know that they ſhall be puniſhed with an everlaſting deſtruction, from the preſence of the Lord, and the glory of his power. Their puniſhment is pointed out in the word of God, by the term, deſtruction: and the text will, in this ſenſe, prove no more nor leſs than this, that Chriſt came to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, and deſtroy the finally impenitent.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid, that if the devil puniſhes men to all eternity, then ſo many as are ſubject to it, are ſuffered to live in rebellion againſt God; and he is deprived of their ſervice to all eternity. But this is ſurely begging the queſtion, becauſe we ſuppoſe, and believe, that God's juſtice is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:018207_0039_0FA5BC686A445FA0"/>
and his glory promoted, by the puniſhment of the wicked, as truly, as by the rewards of the righteous. No one imagines, that the devil holds a ſovereignty inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of the divine permiſſion: he is no more than the executioner of the divine juſtice, upon thoſe who merit puniſhment. Let his enmity be ever ſo great, againſt God and goodneſs, he may ſtill be made uſe of, contrary to his will, or purpoſe, to anſwer the ends of both. Sin is now permitted, to fulfil wiſe and good purpoſes. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, Omnipotence could prevent its exiſtence—it doth not—he hath ſufficient reaſons for this permiſſion now; and who can tell, but that theſe reaſons may exiſt for eternity?</p>
            <p>It is moſt certain, that God will procure his tribute of praiſe, from all created beings, in one way or another: if they will not glorify his mercy, they ſhall glorify his juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. He will be defrauded of his praiſe by none of them; but they ſhall all anſwer, one or other valuable purpoſe, to this end. In this ſenſe, ſhall every creature, that is in heaven, and upon earth, and under the earth, worſhip and praiſe God.</p>
            <p>We ought, when we go about to examine the ſcriptures, to do it with a mind open to conviction. The misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and the ſin of many, is, that they firſt embrace a doctrine, and then go thither to find proof and ſupport for it; whereas, we ought to go, with minds open, and unprejudiced, to this fountain of inſtruction, and gather thence, what is truth or falſehood.</p>
            <p>Again, we repeat, that one ſcripture is to be compared with another; and we are not to take detached parts of it, or ſingle phraſes, and thence raiſe our ſentiments; but we are to examine into the general run of its declarations, and form a judgment according to them. Thus, as to the ſubject concerning which we have been treating, when we find, that there is ſuch a ſtriking difference made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the characters of the righteous and wicked; when we ſee ſo many plain aſſertions, that the wicked ſhall be everlaſtingly puniſhed; when we know, that the bleſſings of the goſpel are promiſed to thoſe only, who ſubmit to, and obey it; when we find it alſo expreſsly declared, that <hi>many are called, but few choſen</hi>; or, in other words, that
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:018207_0040_0FA5BC6917F00958"/>
there are few who are ſaved; we ſhould not, becauſe ſome ſingle, detached expreſſions ſeem to favour a contrary ſuppoſition, give up ſo important a truth. We know, that all men, without exception, reap ſome benefit from the ſufferings of Chriſt; that all men are offered an intereſt in them; and that it will be their own fault, if any reject ſuch an intereſt, and fall ſhort of eternal life. We ſhould therefore, to keep up the analogy of faith, underſtand the general expreſſions of all, &amp;c. in ſome ſuch ſenſe as this.</p>
            <p>We ought always to examine the connexion, in which any text of ſcripture ſtands; for this muſt be taken into view, in order to determine its true meaning. We may prove any thing from the bible, or any other book, if we take only detached ſentences, without reſpect to their connexion.</p>
            <p>The ſentiments and opinions of ſome of the fathers, and others in later times, who are ſtyled eminent, diſtinguiſhed characters, are brought to prove, that there ſhall be a reſtitution of all things, (in the ſenſe of the univerſaliſts). But this doth not appear to be a very cogent argument. Had <hi>we</hi> made uſe of it; had <hi>we</hi> (as we might) have produced the univerſal teſtimony of all thoſe, who were ſtyled the orthodox part of the church, we ſhould have heard a loud outcry, about a bigoted, ſuperſtitious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to long received notions: we ſhould have been directed to examine, and judge for ourſelves, and informed, that the ſentiments of no man influenced the judgments of our oppoſers. But thus it is, when a reflection ſuits one ſide of the queſtion, it is adopted with eagerneſs, and it is very right: but if it is, with equal propriety, uſed on the other, it is matter of ſcorn and ridicule.</p>
            <p>Some divines of England—men, indeed, of a very wandering, unſettled turn of mind—with two of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who wrote in the early ages of Chriſtianity, have been cited, as holding the doctrine which we have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated. <hi>Origen,</hi> and <hi>Clemens of Alexandria,</hi> are theſe two fathers; both of them perſons deeply immerſed in the Platonic philoſophy, and ſubject to ſtrange whims and conceits. Thoſe who are acquainted with eccleſiaſtical hiſtory, know, that neither of them were eſteemed right, by the contemporary church, in this, and in other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:018207_0041_0FA5BC69D488BAA8"/>
               <hi>Origen</hi> held to the recovery of all the devils, as well as all fallen men; and perhaps he had as much reaſon for the one ſentiment, as the other.</p>
            <p>No one means to diſpute the antiquity of this doctrine; ſome believe it to have been one of the firſt which was preached to Adam:—he heard, and, unhappily for us, he believed it. Satan, many think, delivered it to our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon parents in this language, <hi>Ye ſhall not ſurely die.</hi> He tempted them to think, that God could not, with juſtice, or that he did not deſign to execute his threatenings upon them. He perſuaded them to believe, that they ſhould not ſuffer the death denounced againſt them. The artifice ſucceeded, and Adam was undone.</p>
            <p>Let us not be lulled to ſleep in the ſame manner. We muſt not flatter ourſelves, that, let us live as we liſt, all will be well at laſt. We muſt not flatter ourſelves that God will not execute his threatenings. He is juſt; he is true; he is upright, as well as merciful. Let who will tell us, that, though we live in ſin, and die impenitent, yet we ſhall be happy at laſt, we may be aſſured, that it is the ſyren ſong, which beguiled Adam to his ruin; and that, if we heed it, it will iſſue in the ſame manner, as to us.</p>
            <p>You will extend your patience a little longer, while we make a few obſervations upon the purgatory, to which ſome univerſaliſts have had recourſe, in order to avoid the diſagreeable conſequences, which may be drawn from their doctrine.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the phraſe, <hi>purgatory,</hi> may be deemed invidious; but there can be no word which will expreſs the idea of a ſtate of purgation more conciſely. It is a phraſe, adopted by the church of Rome, to point out a ſituation ſimilar to that upon which wicked men (according to our oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents) enter at death. "It is," ſaith cardinal Bellarmine, "a certain place, in which, as in a priſon, thoſe ſouls are purged, after this life, which were not fully purged in it; that being ſo purged, they may be able to enter into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, into which no unclean thing can enter." <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <q>Locus quidam, in quo, tanquam in carcere, poſt hanc vitam, purgantur animae, quae, in hac, non plené purgatae fue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt; ut nimirum ſic purgatae, in coelum ingredi valeant, quó nihil intrabit conquinotum. <bibl>

this definition agrees with the ideas of the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaliſts, they, and we, muſt judge for ourſelves.</p>
            <p>This purgatory muſt be a new ſtate of probation, or only a ſtate of temporary puniſhment. If it is conſidered as another ſtate of probation, the conſequence will imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately follow, that, let a man live as he may; let him neglect every religious and moral duty; let him live and die ever ſo abandoned; it will have no effect upon his eternal happineſs, becauſe he is to enter upon another ſtate, in which he ſhall have opportunity to rectify the miſtakes committed in this, and ſecure his eternal felicity. This ſtrikes at the root of ſociety, and hath a tendency to deprive men of ſome of the moſt ſalutary reſtraints, which deter them from acts of outrage and wickedneſs. It is a conſequence, which our opponents themſelves, do not love ſhould follow.</p>
            <p>But whatever conſequences might follow from it, yet, if it was a ſcripture doctrine, we ought to embrace it, and leave conſequences with him, who is able to take care of them. But this is not the caſe: the ſcriptures, on the contrary, lead us to conſider the preſent, as a ſtate of exiſtence, in which our characters are to be form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for eternity: that the preſent, is the only time, in which we can ſecure an intereſt in the goſpel ſalvation: that if we let ſlip this opportunity, the door will be ſhut upon us, and we ſhall be finally excluded from all title to goſpel benefits. The ſame ſcriptures repreſent death, as putting an end to our opportunities of doing, and getting good: we are charged, <hi>whatſoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wiſdom, in the grave, whither thou goeſt.</hi> Eccl. ix. 10. Our ſtate of exiſtence beyond the grave, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented as a ſtate of inactivity, with reſpect to the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of our ſouls; as the place <hi>where no man can work.</hi> One of the principal arguments, to excite us to exertion in the concerns of our ſouls, urged in the word of God, is that drawn from the preſent's being the only time for us to do ſo, and our immediate entrance, at death, upon a ſtate of fixed happineſs, or miſery. We are no where told, that we ſhall have opportunity to repent, believe, and perform good works, after death: it is no where ſaid,
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:018207_0043_0FA5BC6D179E0540"/>
that, let us miſtake as we may now, we ſhall have oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to rectify it hereafter: but it is poſitively ſaid, <hi>It is appointed unto all men once to die, and after death is the judgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We all agree, that it is lawful to pray for thoſe who are in a ſtate of probation: but if ſouls are ſo after death; if they are not finally fixed in weal or woe, why may not we fall to praying for the dead; praying, either that they may be preſerved through the next ſtate of probation, or ſpeedily delivered from the pains and penalties of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory? But this would ſmell too ſtrongly of old mother church.</p>
            <p>If we view this purgatory as a ſtate of temporary pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, to be certainly ſucceeded by an eternity of glory and happineſs, we ſhall conſider the damned in hell, as in the ſame ſituation with good men here upon earth: they are enduring affliction and diſtreſs, in order to qualify them the better for glory and happineſs: they may, with the higheſt propriety, adopt the language of the apoſtle, and ſay, 2 Cor. iv. 17, 18. <hi>For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; while we look not at the things which are ſeen, but at the things which are not ſeen: for the things which are ſeen, are temporal,</hi> (or temporary); <hi>but the things which are not ſeen, are eternal.</hi> They muſt view their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent puniſhment, as neceſſary to their future happineſs: they may ſubmit to it with great patience, becauſe they know it to be temporary; and may look beyond it, with ineffable tranſport, to an eternity of happineſs and glory. Theſe ſame motives ſupport good men, under the ſufferings of human life; ſo that ſaints in this world, and ſinners in hell, in the next, will be in the ſame ſituation: the latter, indeed, will have one great advantage—they are ſure of heaven at laſt: they may paſs their ſtate of ſuffering with great content, becauſe they have a full aſſurance of eternal life; while many precious ſaints of God, upon earth, go mourning, all the day long, under doubts and uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as to their future ſtate.</p>
            <p>Theſe abſurdities follow, upon the doctrine of a purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory. And, indeed, when we once take up our foot from the doctrine of eternal puniſhment, we know not where to
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:018207_0044_0FA5BC6F079715B0"/>
ſet it down; we know not of what nature, or duration, the puniſhment of the wicked will be: indeed, we know not that they will have any at all; for much more may be ſaid, with probability, to prove, that they ſhall be annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, than that they ſhall be ſubject only to a temporary puniſhment.</p>

               <p n="1">1. We are led, by the paſt ſubject, to admire and adore the holineſs and ſovereignty of the great God.</p>
               <p>The holineſs of God is manifeſted, in his excluding, for over, from his preſence, all ſuch as reſolutely perſiſt in ſin. This diſcovers, how incompatible it is with his nature: he cannot endure the ſociety, nor will he permit the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of ſuch as <hi>love darkneſs rather than light.</hi> He gives them all a ſpace for repentance: but if they will not make uſe of it; if they will deſpiſe free and rich mercy; if they will cleave to their own iniquity; he hath ſworn, that they ſhall <hi>never enter into his reſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God, my brethren, is a ſovereign agent: he doth his pleaſure in heaven above, and upon earth beneath: we are all entirely in his hands: we cannot, with effect, reſiſt his will, nor ſet aſide his purpoſes. We may here reaſon as we pleaſe. We may, in the fulneſs of our pride, and our ignorance, declare, that one thing is right for God to do, and another wrong: we may ſay, that one thing is conſiſtent with his mercy, and another is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent: but when we have done all, he will diſpoſe of us as he ſeeth to be right and beſt. Poor, contemptible worms of the duſt, as we are, we cannot alter a ſingle purpoſe of his, relating to us; nor prevent it from being carried into execution, a ſingle moment. If <hi>he</hi> ſees it right, to ſentence us to eternal miſery, neither angels, men, nor devils, can prevent the execution. We may feel rage, and enmity, againſt the God that made us; but the expreſſions of it will return upon ourſelves, and increaſe, inſtead of alleviating, our miſery. Let us always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that God is in heaven, and we upon earth; and therefore it becomes us, that our words ſhould be few.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We diſcern the reaſon we have to be thankful for Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="unknown:018207_0045_0FA5BC6F42C7CEA8"/>It is certain, that we cannot entertain too exalted ideas of the obligations we are under to Chriſt, our redeemer. But perhaps nothing hath a more natural tendency to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large theſe, than a reflection upon our ruined, deplorable ſtate, without him. It is ſaid, that we cannot have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete ideas of happineſs, without viewing its oppoſite mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery: ſurely, then, our paſt ſubject will repreſent the happineſs enjoyed by the ſaints, and purchaſed by Chriſt, in the ſtrongeſt point of light, as it paints the miſery of ſinners in ſuch vivid colours. <hi>Glory be to God in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt; on earth, peace and good will to man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Let the paſt ſubject make us afraid of ſin.</p>
               <p>It is to be lamented, that mankind are no more under the influence of ingenuous principles; that a ſenſe of kindneſs and obligation hath no more effect upon them. But it is the fact, that we are not thankful as we ſhould be; and that our conduct is not governed by gratitude, and affection, ſo much as it is by hope or fear.</p>
               <p>But, as this is the caſe, we have reaſon to be thankful, that theſe latter motives are ſet before us, in ſuch a ſtrong and powerful light, in the word of God. Sin is our bane: —it is our miſery in this world, and, unrepented of, will be our ruin in the next. It is well for us, therefore, that ſuch terrors, as the paſt ſubject preſents, are brandiſhed before our eyes. We are warned, and cautioned, to flee from the wrath to come; aſſured that we may eſcape it, if we will apply to the only Saviour.</p>
               <p>Let us, then, fear ſin. Let us dread thoſe principles and practices, which will provoke God to anger here, and expoſe us to eternal vengeance hereafter. Nothing is ſo truly pernicious to us, or ought ſo much to be dreaded by us, as offending the great God, and thus ruining our own ſouls. And it is truly amazing, that we have no more ſenſe of the evil of ſin now, and the conſequences of it hereafter, that we can play, as it were, upon the brink of ruin, and ſport ourſelves with that miſery, which is ſhortly to overtake the impenitent. Had we but a realizing ſenſe of that puniſhment, which ſin will meet with, in the world to come; did we but feel the worth of our ſouls, and the weight of an eternity, we ſhould not dare to trifle, as we do now, with our deareſt intereſts: we ſhould flee from ſin,
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:018207_0046_0FA5BC70E2B81790"/>
as from our utmoſt deſtruction; we ſhould turn a deaf ear to the ſyren ſong of ſinful pleaſure, and ſhould give our firſt and principal <hi>diligence, to make our calling and election ſure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brethren,</hi> beware of indulging to any reflections, or em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing any ſentiments, which have a tendency to dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh your fear of ſin. We are too inſenſible, too little cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of it now; we need not be leſs fearful of it. Thoſe who endeavour to make us view ſin as an evil leſs perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious than it really is, will not do us any good. Their opinions are not friendly (to ſay no more) to the intereſts of real religion, and the welfare of ſociety.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Let us be cautioned againſt thoſe errors, which the paſt ſubject hath been deſigned to refute.</p>
               <p>The doctrine of univerſal ſalvation is, in the higheſt degree, grateful to corrupt human nature; it flatters our pride; it favours our indolence; it takes off a reſtraint from our gratifications; it calms our conſciences; and hath a tendency to diminiſh, yea, to deſtroy, our moſt lively fears, as to futurity. This doctrine ſinks into our hearts inſenſibly; and is ſo grateful to us, as that it <hi>will</hi> make a greater or leſs impreſſion upon us.</p>
               <p>This is a ground of caution to us; we are always ready to believe what we wiſh; we try to find it true; we give every thing, advanced in its favour, a partial hearing; while we turn a deaf ear to the arguments ſuggeſted againſt it. We know this to be the caſe, not only in matters of religion, but alſo in things pertaining to this life.</p>
               <p>But we are to remember, that our wiſhing things to be true, will not make them ſo; nor if they are falſe in their nature, will their convenience to us, make them true: yet our wiſhes and deſires may, and will, have a great tendency to warp our judgment—to make us ſhut our eyes againſt the light, and expoſe us to embrace error, inſtead of truth. When we have ſomething within us, which whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, that its being true, will make us happy; and its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing falſe, will render us miſerable; we ſhall, in almoſt every caſe, believe, let it be ever ſo glaringly abſurd.</p>
               <p>Let us apply this reflection to the ſubject before us. Let us be afraid of embracing ſuch a lulling, fleſh-pleaſing doctrine. We wiſh it to be true, and this will be apt to make us believe it: we are partial in favour of what is
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:018207_0047_0FA5BC72E233A168"/>
ſaid for it: we are prejudiced againſt what is produced to controvert it: we are liable, therefore, very liable to error; to fall in with it, though it be ever ſo contrary to ſcripture and reaſon.</p>
               <p>It is to be wiſhed, that thoſe who have embraced this doctrine, would look into their hearts, and ſeriouſly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, whether their deſires, or their needs, that it may be true, have not led them to fall in with it, and blinded their eyes to the plain dictates of their underſtanding and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. Let them remember, that it is for their ſouls, and eternity; and that a miſtake may be fatal to them.</p>
               <p>And let thoſe of us, who are ſearching for the truth, in this matter, always take this thought with us, and let it make us <hi>jealous over ourſelves, with a godly jealouſy,</hi> leſt we be drawn away, and enticed, by our eager wiſhes and deſires, to embrace an error, which may be fatal to us. Our hearts are deceitful, and wicked; they are <hi>apt to put ſweet for bitter, and bitter for ſweet;</hi> and to lead us into ſuch errors, as flatter our pride, our avarice, and our ſenſuality.</p>
               <p>Let us remember, again, that to believe, and act under the fear of eternal puniſhment, or aſſenting to this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and acting under the influence of it, is much ſafer than the other way. If the ſentiments of our oppoſers are true, we are perfectly ſafe, becauſe all will be happy at laſt: but what will become of them, if <hi>our</hi> ſentiments are true? What if, when they come into the eternal world, they ſhould find, that they are to be placed in weal or woe for ever, according as their character here hath been; and they have conducted as careleſsly as their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine leads them to conduct? What a diſappointment! What horror and diſmay, what inexpreſſible anguiſh, will the reflection, that it is too late to rectify the miſtake, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to them! We could heartily with, that all the friends, favourers, and preachers of this doctrine, would ſeriouſly reflect upon this conſideration.</p>
               <p>Religious controverſies are not friendly to the intereſts of real piety. Perhaps they injure it in no way more, than by introducing a ſpirit of bitterneſs and rancour, of cenſure and raſh judging. Let us be careful againſt this ſpirit, in the ſubject we have been upon. We may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn,
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:018207_0048_0FA5BC73BB98E1B8"/>
and reprobate the doctrine; but we have no right to condemn the men who hold it. Their hearts may be better than their heads; nay, we know they are ſo; for not one of them lives, and conducts, ſo wickedly as his religious tenets will admit him to do. Their conſciences are too tender to be affected with their theories; and they live as well, perhaps, and ſome of them better, than their neighbours, who hold to the truth. Let this make us careful of judging, or cenſuring them:—to their own maſter, they ſtand or fall! It is the command of Chriſt, <hi>judge not, that ye be not judged.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly. Let us all be exhorted to ſtrive, that we may avoid everlaſting miſery.</p>
               <p>You will not, my brethren, view the paſt ſubject as a mere queſtion of ſpeculation, controverted with a deſign to gratify an inquiſitive mind, or gain a victory over its oppoſers. Let us, on the contrary, bring home to our boſoms, a ſenſe of our perſonal intereſt in it. Let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alize, that you and I muſt be eternally miſerable, if we die with the weight of our ſins upon us, without pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace and mercy.</p>
               <p>We can have no adequate conception of the miſery, which the finally impenitent endure in hell: they are puniſhed to the utmoſt extent of their capacities: they experience the utmoſt exacerbation of anguiſh. All is darkneſs, miſery, and deſpair around them! Hope, the laſt, the beſt companion of the miſerable, hath now for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken them! They have nothing before them but accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulated anguiſh; for the iron gates of a long eternity are ſhut upon them, never to be opened!</p>
               <p>Shudder, O my ſoul, at the tremendous idea, and be quickened to <hi>flee from the wrath to come!</hi> Realize, that this is the firſt, and moſt important concern! What are all the faſcinating pleaſures of time and ſenſe; of what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence are the moſt exquiſite guilty enjoyments, when compared with the <hi>one thing that is needful!</hi> Away, then, with delays, and deſigns, that interfere with this! <hi>Now</hi> may a bliſsful eternity be ſecured;—by and by it will be for ever too late! <hi>Now</hi> are propoſals of peace and pardon made;—by and by they will be offered no more! Heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate not, then, a ſingle moment; tarry no longer, my
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:018207_0049_0FA5BC745BB51BF0"/>
ſpirit, in a ſituation ſo dangerous; but <hi>turn to the ſtrong hold, as a priſoner of hope!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Offers of deliverance from the miſery we have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing, and of an entrance upon an eternity of felicity, are made to every one of us, in the goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt! No one is excluded from it; we are <hi>all</hi> invited to partake of it. The will, the command of God to us, is, to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and believe the goſpel;</hi> and we are aſſured of the heartieſt welcome to every benefit of the Redeemer's purchaſe; for the proclamation of the goſpel, to <hi>every one that thirſteth,</hi> is, <hi>to come and buy wine and milk, without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and without price.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us then, every one, renounce our ſins, and ſubmit ourſelves to the teachings and guidings of the divine ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; that thus we may be made <hi>partakers of the divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> that <hi>our feet may take hold upon eternal life,</hi> and our ſouls be for ever happy, in the preſence of God—<hi>where is fulneſs of joys; and at his right hand, where are pleaſures for ever more.</hi>
