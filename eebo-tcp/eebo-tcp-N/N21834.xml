            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     <p>MY life has for ſeveral years been a theatre of calamity. I have been a mark for the vigilance of tyranny, and I could not eſcape. My faireſt proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects have been blaſted. My enemy has ſhown himſelf inacceſſible to intreaties and untired in perſecution. My fame, as well as my happineſs, has become his victim. Every one, as far as my ſtory has been known, has refuſed to aſſiſt me in my diſtreſs, and has execrated my name. I have not deſerved this treatment. My own conſcience witneſſes in behalf of that innocence my pretenſions
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:028752_0004_0FDBEF4938E29388"/>
to which are regarded in the world as incredible. There is now however little hope that I ſhall eſcape from the toils that univerſally beſet me. I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited to the penning of theſe memoirs, only by a deſire to divert my mind from the deplorableneſs of my ſituation, and a faint idea that poſterity may by their means be induced to render me a juſtice which my contemporaries refuſe. My ſtory will at leaſt appear to have that conſiſtency, which is ſeldom attendant but upon truth.</p>
                     <p>I was born of humble parents in a remote coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of England. Their occupations were ſuch as uſually fall to the lot of peaſants, and they had no portion to give me but an education free from the uſual ſources of depravity, and the inheritance, long ſince loſt by their unfortunate progeny! of an honeſt fame. I was taught the rudiments of no ſcience, except reading, writing and arithmetic. But I had an inquiſitive mind, and neglected no means of information from converſation or books. My improvement was greater than my condition in life afforded room to expect.</p>
                     <p>Our reſidence was within the manor of Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinando Falkland, a country ſquire of conſiderable opulence. At an early age I attracted the favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able notice of Mr. Collins, this gentleman's ſteward, who uſed to call in occaſionally at my father's. He obſerved the particulars of my progreſs with approbation, and made a favourable report to his maſter of my induſtry and genius.</p>
                     <p>In the ſummer of the year <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">
                           <desc> _____ </desc>
                        </gap> Mr. Falk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land viſited his eſtate in our county after an abſence of ſeveral months. This was a period of misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to me. I was then eighteen years of age. My father lay dead in our cottage. I had loſt my mother ſome years before. In this forlorn ſituation I was ſurpriſed with a meſſage from the ſquire,
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:028752_0005_0FDEB4598DB10528"/>
ordering me to repair to the manſion-houſe the morning after my father's funeral.</p>
                     <p>Though I was not a ſtranger to books, I had no practical acquaintance with men. I had never had occaſion to addreſs a perſon of this elevated rank, and I felt no ſmall uneaſineſs and awe on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent occaſion. I found Mr Falkland a man of ſmall ſtature, with an extreme <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> of form and appearance. In place of the hard-favoured and inflexible viſages I had been accuſtomed to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, every muſcle and petty line of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance ſeemed to be in an inconceivable degree pregnant with meaning. His manner was kind, attentive and humane. His eye was full of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, but there was a grave and ſad ſolemnity in his air, which for want of experience I imagined was the inheritance of the great, and the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by which the diſtance between them and their inferiors was maintained. His look beſpoke the unquietneſs of his mind, and frequently wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with an expreſſion of diſconſolateneſs and anxiety.</p>
                     <p>My reception was as gracious and encouraging as I could poſſibly deſire. Mr. Falkland queſtioned me reſpecting my learning, and my conceptions of men and things, and liſtened to my anſwers with condeſcenſion and approbation. This kindneſs ſoon reſtored to me a conſiderable part of myſelf-poſſeſſion, though I ſtill felt reſtrained by the graceful, but unaltered dignity of his carriage. I have already ſaid that I was not unacquainted with books. I had not failed to derive advantage from the opportunities which offered themſelves, and ſome of thoſe opportunities were of very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate occurrence. But it is not my purpoſe to draw out this narrative by unneceſſary detail; I leave the reader to collect what my acquiſitions had been from the incidents which followed. When
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:028752_0006_0FDBEF4C79362DE0"/>
Mr. Falkland had ſufficiently ſatisfied his curioſity, he proceeded to inform me that he was in want of a ſecretary, that I appeared to him ſufficiently qualified for that office, and that, if in my preſent change of ſituation occaſioned by the death of my father I approved of the employment, he would take me into his family.</p>
                     <p>I felt highly flattered by the propoſal, and was warm in the expreſſion of my acknowledgements. I ſet eagerly about the diſpoſal of the little property my father had left, in which I was aſſiſted by Mr. Collins. I had not now a relation, upon whoſe kindneſs and interpoſition I had any direct claim, in the world. But far from regarding this deſerted ſituation with terror, I formed golden viſions of the ſtation I was about to occupy. I little ſuſpected that the gaiety and lightneſs of heart I had hitherto enjoyed were upon the point of leaving me for ever, and that the reſt of my days were devoted to miſery and alarm.</p>
                     <p>My employment was eaſy and agreeable. It conſiſted partly of the tranſcribing and arranging certain papers, and partly of writing from my maſter's dictation letters of buſineſs, as well as ſketches of literary compoſition. Many of theſe latter conſiſted of an analytical ſurvey of the plans of different authors, and conjectural ſpeculations upon hints they afforded, tending either to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of their errors or the carrying forward their diſcoveries. All of them bore powerful marks of a profound and elegant underſtanding, well ſtored with literature, and poſſeſſed of an uncommon ſhare of activity and diſcrimination.</p>
                     <p>My ſtation was in that part of the houſe which was appropriated for the reception of books, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my duty to perform the functions of librarian as well as ſecretary. Here my hours would have glided in tranquillity and peace, had not my ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:028752_0007_0FDEB433B683E308"/>
included in it circumſtances totally different from thoſe which attended me in my father's cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. In early life my mind had been almoſt wholly engroſſed by reading and reflexion. My intercourſes with my fellow mortals were occaſional and ſhort. But in my new reſidence I was excited by every motive of intereſt and curioſity to ſtudy my maſter's character, and I found in it an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple field for ſpeculation and conjecture.</p>
                     <p>His mode of living was in the utmoſt degree recluſe and ſolitary. He had no inclination to ſcenes of revelry and mirth. He avoided the buſy haunts of men; nor did he ſeem deſirous to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſate for this privation by the confidence of friendſhip. He appeared a total ſtranger to every thing which uſually bears the appellation of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. His features were ſcarcely ever relaxed into a ſmile, nor did that air which beſpoke the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of his mind, at any time forſake them. Yet his manners were by no means ſuch as denoted moroſeneſs and miſanthropy. He was compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate and conſiderate for others, though the ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of his carriage and the reſerve of his temper were at no time interrupted. His appearance and general behaviour might have ſtrongly intereſted all perſons in his favour; but the coldneſs of his addreſs and the impenetrableneſs of his ſentiments ſeemed to forbid thoſe demonſtrations of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to which one might otherwiſe have been prompted.</p>
                     <p>Such was the general appearance of Mr. Falk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; but his temper was extremely unequal. The diſtemper which afflicted him with inceſſant gloom, had its paroxyſms. Sometimes he was haſty, peeviſh and tyrannical; but this proceeded rather from the torment of his mind than an unfeeling diſpoſition, and, when reflexion recurred, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared willing that the weight of his misfortune
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:028752_0008_0FDBEF4E5372D220"/>
ſhould fall wholly upon himſelf. Sometimes he entirely loſt his ſelf poſſeſſion, and his behaviour was changed into frenzy. He would ſtrike his forehead, his brows became knit, his features diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted, and his teeth ground one againſt the other. When he felt the approach of theſe ſymptoms, he would ſuddenly riſe, and, leaving the occupation whatever it was in which he was engaged, haſten into a ſolitude upon which no perſon dared to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude.</p>
                     <p>It muſt not be ſuppoſed that the whole of what I am deſcribing was viſible to the perſons about him; nor indeed was I acquainted with it in the extent here ſtated, but after a conſiderable time, and in gradual ſucceſſion. With reſpect to the domeſtics in general, they ſaw but little of their maſter. None of them, except myſelf from the nature of my functions, and Mr. Collins from the antiquity of his ſervice and the reſpectableneſs of his character, approached Mr. Falkland, but at ſtated ſeaſons and for a very ſhort interval. They knew him only by the benevolence of his actions and the principles of inflexible integrity by which he was ordinarily guided; and, though they would ſometimes indulge their conjectures reſpecting his ſingularities, regarded him upon the whole with veneration as a being of a ſuperior order.</p>
                     <p>One day when I had been about three months in the ſervice of my patron, I went into a cloſet or ſmall apartment which was ſeparated from the library by a narrow gallery that was lighted by a ſmall window near the roof. I had conceived that there was no perſon in the room, and went only to put any thing in order that I might find out of its place. As I opened the door, I heard at the ſame inſtant a deep groan expreſſive of intolerable an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh. The ſound of the door in opening ſeemed to alarm the perſon within; I heard the lid of a
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:028752_0009_0FDEB4353B01BA68"/>
cheſt haſtily ſhut, and the noiſe as of faſtening a lock. I immediately conceived that Mr. Falkland was there, and was going haſtily to retire; but at that moment a voice that ſeemed ſupernaturally tremendous exclaimed, Who is there? The voice was Mr. Falkland's. The ſound of it thrilled my very vitals. I endeavoured to anſwer, but my ſpeech failed, and being incapable of any other reply, I inſtinctively advanced within the door into the room. Mr. Falkland was juſt riſen from the floor upon which he had been ſitting or kneeling. His countenance betrayed ſtrong ſymptoms of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion. With a violent effort however theſe ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms ſuddenly vaniſhed, and inſtantaneouſly gave place to a countenance ſparkling with rage. Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, cried he, what has brought you here? I he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated a confuſed and irreſolute anſwer. Wretch, interrupted Mr. Falkland with uncontrolable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience, you want to ruin me. You ſet yourſelf as a ſpy upon my actions. But bitterly ſhall you repent your inſolence. Do you think you ſhall watch my privacies with impunity? I attempted to defend myſelf. Begone, devil! rejoined he. Quit the room, or I will trample you into atoms. Saying this, he advanced towards me. But I was already ſufficiently terrified, and vaniſhed in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I heard the door ſhut after me with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and thus ended this extraordinary ſcene.</p>
                     <p>I ſaw him again in the evening, and he was then tolerably compoſed. His behaviour, which was always kind, was now doubly attentive and ſooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. He ſeemed to have ſomething of which he wiſhed to diſburthen his mind, but to want words in which to convey it. I looked at him with anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iety and affection. He made two unſucceſsful efforts, ſhook his head, and then, putting five guineas into my hand, preſſed it in a manner that I could feel proceeded from a mind pregnant with
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:028752_0010_0FDBEF53206B6C58"/>
various emotions, though I could not interpret them. Having done this, he ſeemed immediately to recollect himſelf, and to take refuge in the uſual diſtance and ſolemnity of his manner.</p>
                     <p>I eaſily underſtood that ſecrecy was one of the things expected from me, and indeed my mind was too much diſpoſed to meditate upon what I had heard and ſeen, to make it a topic of indiſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate communication. Mr. Collins however and myſelf happened to ſup together that evening, which was but ſeldom the caſe, his avocations obliging him to be much abroad. He could not help obſerving an uncommon dejection and anxiety in my countenance, and affectionately enquired into the reaſon. I endeavoured to evade his queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but my youth and ignorance of the world gave me but little advantage for that purpoſe. Beſide this, I had been accuſtomed to view Mr. Collins with conſiderable attachment, and I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the nature of his ſituation that there could be but ſmall impropriety in making him my confident in the preſent inſtance. I repeated to him minutely every thing that had paſſed, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with a ſolemn declaration that, though treated with caprice, I was not anxious for my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: no inconvenience or danger to myſelf ſhould ever lead me to a puſillanimous behaviour; and I felt only for my maſter, who, with every advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage for happineſs, and being in the higheſt degree worthy of it, ſeemed fated to undergo unmerited diſtreſs.</p>
                     <p>In anſwer to my communication Mr. Collins in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed me that ſome incidents of a nature ſimilar to that which I related had fallen under his own knowledge, and that from the whole he could not help concluding that our unfortunate patron was at times diſordered in his intellects. Alas, continued he, it was not always thus! Ferdinando

Falkland was once the gayeſt of the gay. Not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of that frothy ſort, who excite contempt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of admiration, and whoſe levity argues thoughtleſsneſs rather than felicity. His gaiety was always accompanied with dignity. It was chaſtened with reflexion and ſenſibility, and never loſt ſight either of good taſte or humanity. Such as it was however, it denoted a genuine hilarity of heart, gave an inconceivable brilliancy to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and converſation, and rendered him the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual delight of the diverſified circles he then wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly frequented. You ſee nothing of him, my dear Williams, but the ruin of that Falkland, who was courted by ſages, and adored by the fair. His youth, diſtinguiſhed in its outſet by the moſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous promiſe, is tarniſhed. His ſenſibility is ſhrunk up and withered by events the moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtful to his feelings. His mind was fraught with all the rhapſodies of viſionary honour; and in his ſenſe nothing but the gro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>er part, the mere ſhell of Falkland, was capable to ſurvive the wound that his pride has ſuſtained.</p>
                     <p>Theſe reflexions of my friend Collins ſtrongly tended to inflame my curioſity, and I requeſted him to enter into a more copious explanation. With this requeſt he readily complied; as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that whatever delicacy it became him to exerciſe in ordinary caſes, it would be out of place in my ſituation, and thinking it not improbable that Mr. Falkland, but for the diſturbance and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation of his mind, would be diſpoſed to a ſimilar communication. I ſhall join to Mr. Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins's ſtory various information which I afterwards received from other quarters, that I may give all poſſible perſpicuity to the ſeries of events. To the reader it may appear at firſt ſight as if this detail of the preceding life of Mr. Falkland were foreign to my hiſtory. Alas, I know from bitter experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:028752_0012_0FDBEF5455C48A50"/>
that it is otherwiſe. My heart bleeds at the recollection of his misfortunes as if they were my own. How can it fail to do ſo? To his ſtory the whole fortune of my life was linked; becauſe he was miſerable, my happineſs, my name, and my exiſtence have been irretrievably blaſted.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. II.</head>
                     <p>AMONG the favourite authors of his early years were the heroic poets of Italy. From them he imbibed the love of chivalry and romance. He had too much good ſenſe to regret the times of Charlemagne and Arthur. But, while his imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation was purged by a certain infuſion of philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, he conceived that there was in the manners depicted by theſe celebrated poets, ſomething to imitate, as well as ſomething to avoid. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that nothing was ſo well calculated to make men delicate, gallant and humane, as a temper perpetually alive to the ſentiments of birth and honour. The opinions he entertained upon thoſe topics were illuſtrated in his conduct, which was aſſiduouſly conformed to the model of heroiſm that his fancy ſuggeſted.</p>
                     <p>With theſe ſentiments he ſet out upon his tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels at the age at which the grand tour is uſually made, and they were rather confirmed than ſhaken by the adventures that be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>el him. By inclination he was led to make his longeſt ſtay in Italy, and here he fell into company with ſeveral young no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen whoſe ſtudies and principles were congenial to his own. By them he was aſſiduouſly courted and treated with the moſt diſtinguiſhed applauſe. They were delighted to meet with a foreigner who had imbibed all the peculiarities of the moſt liberal and honourable among themſelves. Nor was he leſs favoured and admired by the ſofter ſex. Though his ſtature were ſmall, his perſon had an air of uncommon dignity. His dignity was then
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:028752_0014_0FDBEF5A6EABCCB8"/>
heightened by certain additions which were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards obliterated, an expreſſion of frankneſs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity and unreſerve, and a ſpirit of the moſt ardent enthuſiaſm. Perhaps no Engliſhman was ever in an equal degree idoliſed by the inhabitants of Italy.</p>
                     <p>It was not poſſible for him to have drank ſo deeply of the fountain of chivalry without being engaged occaſionally in affairs of honour, all of which were terminated in a manner that would not have diſgraced the chevalier Bayard himſelf. In Italy the young men of rank divide themſelves into two claſſes, thoſe who adhere to the pure principles of ancient gallantry, and thoſe who, being actuated by the ſame acute ſenſe of injury and inſult, accuſtom themſelves to the employment of hired bravoes as their inſtruments of vengeance. The whole difference indeed conſiſts in the preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious application of a generally received diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The moſt generous Italian ſtill conceives that there are certain perſons whom it would be contamination to call into the open field. He ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs believes that an indignity cannot be expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated but with blood, and is perſuaded that the life of a fellow creature is a very trifling conſideration in compariſon with the indemnification to be made to his injured honour. There is therefore ſcarcely any Italian that would upon ſome occaſions ſcruple aſſaſſination. Men of ſpirit among them, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the prejudices of their education, cannot fail to have a ſecret conviction of its baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and will be deſirous of extending as far as poſſible the cartel of honour. Real or affected arrogance teaches others to regard almoſt the whole human ſpecies as their inferiors, and of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence incites them to gratify their vengeance without danger to their perſons. Mr. Falkland fell in with ſome of theſe. But his undaunted ſpirit
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:028752_0015_0FDEB4409DC18208"/>
and reſolute temper gave him a deciſive advantage even in ſuch perilous rencounters. One inſtance among many of his manner of conducting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf among this proud and high-ſpirited people, it may be proper to relate. Mr. Falkland is the principal agent in my hiſtory; and Mr. Falkland, in the autumn and decay of his vigour ſuch as I found him, cannot be completely underſtood with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a knowledge of his previous character as it was in all the gloſs of youth, yet unaſſailed by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, and unbroken in upon by anguiſh or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe.</p>
                     <p>At Rome he was received with particular diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction at the houſe of marquis Piſani, who had an only daughter, the heir of his immenſe fortune, and the admiration of all the young nobility of that metropolis. Lady Lucretia Piſani was tall, of a dignified form and uncommonly beautiful. She was not deficient in amiable qualities, but her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>oul was haughty, and her carriage not unfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently contemptuous. Her pride was nouriſhed by the conſciouſneſs of her charms, by her ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated rank and the univerſal adoration ſhe was accuſtomed to receive.</p>
                     <p>Among her numerous lovers count Malveſi was the individual moſt favoured by her father, nor did his addreſſes ſeem indifferent to her. The count was a man of conſiderable accompliſhments, and of great integrity and benevolence of diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. But he was too ardent a lover to be able always to preſerve the affability of his temper. The admirers, whoſe addreſſes were a ſource of gratification to his miſtreſs, were a perpetual tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to him. Placing his whole happineſs in the poſſeſſion of this imperious beauty, the moſt trifling circumſtances were capable of alarming him for the ſecurity of his pretenſions. But moſt of all he was jealous of the Engliſh cavalier. The marquis
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:028752_0016_0FDBEF5BD2CF8D40"/>
Piſani, who had ſpent many years in France, was by no means partial to the ſuſpicious precautions of Italian fathers, and indulged his daughter in conſiderable freedoms. His houſe and his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, within certain judicious reſtraints, were open to the reſort of male viſitants. But above all Mr. Falkland, as a foreigner, and a perſon little likely to form pretenſions to the hand of Lucretia, was received upon a footing of great familiarity. The lady herſelf, conſcious of her innocence, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained no ſcruple about trifles, and acted with the confidence and frankneſs of one who is ſuperior to ſuſpicion.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Falkland, after a reſidence of ſeveral weeks at Rome, proceeded to Naples. Mean while cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain incidents occurred that delayed the intended nuptials of the heireſs of Piſani. When he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to Rome count Malveſi was abſent. Lady Lucretia, who had been conſiderably amuſed before with the converſation of Mr. Falkland, and who had an active and enquiring mind, had conceived in the interval between his firſt and ſecond reſidence at Rome a paſſion for learning the Engliſh lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, inſpired by the lively and ardent encomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums of our beſt authors that ſhe had heard from their countryman. She had provided herſelf with the uſual implements for that purpoſe, and made ſome progreſs during his abſence. But upon his return ſhe was deſirous of making uſe of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity which, if miſſed, might never occur again with equal advantages, of reading ſelect paſſages of our poets in company with an Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of uncommon taſte and capacity.</p>
                     <p>This propoſal neceſſarily led to a more frequent intercourſe. When count Malveſi returned, he found Mr. Falkland eſtabliſhed almoſt as an inmate of the Piſani palace. His mind could not fail to be ſtruck with the criticalneſs of the ſituation. He
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:028752_0017_0FDEB442212C33E8"/>
was perhaps ſecretly conſcious that the qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Engliſhman were ſuperior to his own, and he trembled for the progreſs that each of them might have made in the affection of the other, even before they were aware of the danger. He believed that the match was in every reſpect ſuch as to flatter the ambition of Mr. Falkland, and he was ſtung even to madneſs by the idea of being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the object deareſt to his heart by this inſolent upſtart.</p>
                     <p>He had however a ſufficient ſhare of diſcretion to go firſt to demand an explanation of lady Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretia. She in the gaiety of her heart trifled with his anxiety. His patience was already exhauſted, and he proceeded in his expoſtulation in language that it was by no means poſſible for her to endure with apathy. Lady Lucretia had always been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to deference and ſubmiſſion; and having got over ſomething like terror that was firſt inſpired by the imperious manner in which he was now ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſed, her next feeling was that of the warmeſt reſentment. She diſdained to ſatisfy ſo inſolent a queſtioner, and even indulged herſelf in ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique hints calculated to ſtrengthen his ſuſpicions. For ſome time ſhe deſcribed his folly and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in terms of the moſt ludicrous ſarcaſm, and then ſuddenly changing her ſtyle, bid him never let her ſee him more except upon a footing of the moſt diſtance acquaintance, as ſhe was determined never again to ſubject herſelf to ſo unworthy and inexcuſable a treatment. She was happy that he had at length diſcloſed to her his true character, and would well know how to profit of her preſent experience to avoid a repetition of the ſame danger. All this paſſed in the full career of the paſſions on both ſides, and lady Lucretia had no time to reflect what might be the conſequence of having thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperated her lover.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="16" facs="unknown:028752_0018_0FDBEF5FCF0C7E48"/>
Count Malveſi left her in all the torments of hell. He believed that this was a premeditated ſcene to find a pretence for breaking off an engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that was already all but concluded; or rather his mind was racked with a thouſand conjectures, he alternately thought that the injuſtice might be hers or his own, and he quarrelled with lady Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretia, himſelf and all the world. In this temper of mind he haſtened to the hotel of the Engliſh cavalier. The moment of expoſtulation was now over, and he found himſelf irreſiſtibly impelled to juſtify his precipitate conduct with the lady, by taking for granted that the proſperous amours of Falkland were beyond the reach of doubt.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Falkland was at home. The firſt words of the count were an abrupt accuſation of dupli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city in the affair of lady Lucretia, and a challenge. The Engliſhman had an unaffected eſteem for Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſi, who was in reality a man of conſiderable merit, and who had been one of Mr. Falkland's earlieſt Italian acquaintance, they having originally met at Milan. But more than this, the poſſible conſequences of a duel in the preſent inſtance burſt upon his mind. He had the warmeſt admiration for lady Lucretia, though his feelings were not thoſe of a lover: and he knew that, however her haughtineſs might endeavour to diſguiſe it, ſhe was impreſſed with a tender regard for count Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſi. He could not bear to think that any miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of his ſhould interrupt the proſpects of ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving a pair. Guided by theſe ſentiments he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to expoſtulate with the Italian. But all his attempts in this reſpect were ineffectual. His antagoniſt was drunk with choler, and would not liſten to a word that tended to check the impetuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of his thoughts. He traverſed the room with perturbed ſteps, and even foamed with anguiſh and fury. Mr. Falkland, finding that every thing
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:028752_0019_0FDEB449865B0B70"/>
elſe was to no purpoſe, told the count that, if he would return tomorrow at the ſame hour, he would attend him to any ſcene of action he would think proper to ſelect.</p>
                     <p>From count Malveſi Mr. Falkland immediately proceeded to the palace of Piſani. Here <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e found a conſiderable difficulty in appeaſing the indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of lady Lucretia. Honour forbad him to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe the cartel he had received, though he was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly determined never to draw his ſword in the preſent quarrel; otherwiſe that diſcloſure would immediately have operated as the ſtrongeſt motive with this diſdainful beauty. But, though ſhe fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſimilar defiance, yet the vague apprehenſion was not ſtrong enough to induce her without qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification to ſurrender all the ſtatelineſs of her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment. Mr. Falkland however drew <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a picture of the diſturbance of count Malveſi's mind, and accounted in ſo flattering a manner for the abruptneſs of his conduct, that this, together with the arguments he adduced, completed the conqueſt of lady Lucretia's reſentment. Having thus far accompliſhed his purpoſe, he proceeded to diſcloſe to her every thing that had paſſed.</p>
                     <p>The next day count Malveſi appeared, punctual to his appointment, at Mr. Falkland's hotel. Mr. Falkland came to the door to receive him, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted him to enter the houſe for a moment, as he had ſtill an affair of three minutes to diſpatch. They proceeded to a parlour. Here Mr. Falkland left him, and preſently returned leading in lady Lucretia herſelf adorned in all her charms, and thoſe charms heightened upon the preſent occaſion with a conſciouſneſs of the ſpirited and generous condeſcenſion ſhe now exerted. Mr. Falkland led her up to the aſtoniſhed count; and ſhe, gently laying her hand upon the arm of her lover, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed with the moſt attractive grace, Will you
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:028752_0020_0FDBEF639D50C6A8"/>
allow me to retract the precipitate haughtineſs into which I was betrayed? The enraptured count, ſcarcely able to believe his ſenſes, threw himſelf upon his knees before her, and ſtammered out a reply, ſignifying that the precipitation had been all his own, that he only had any forgiveneſs to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and, though they might pardon, he could never pardon himſelf for the ſacrilege he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt her and this god-like Engliſhman. As ſoon as the firſt tumults of his joy were ſubſided, Mr. Falkland addreſſed him thus:</p>
                     <p>"Count Malveſi, I feel the utmoſt pleaſure in having thus by peaceful means diſarmed your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment, and effected your happineſs. But I muſt confeſs you put me to a ſevere trial. My temper is not leſs impetuous and fiery than your own, and it is not at all times that I ſhould have been thus able to ſubdue it. But I conſidered that in reality the original blame was mine. Though your ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion was groundleſs, it was not abſurd. We have been trifling too much in the face of danger. I ought not, under the preſent weakneſs of our nature and forms of ſociety, to have been ſo aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous in my attendance upon this enchanting wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. It would have been little wonder, if, having ſo many opportunities, and playing the preceptor with her as I have done, I had been entangled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I was aware, and harboured a wiſh which I might not afterwards have had the courage to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due. I owed you an atonement for this impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
                     <p>"But the laws of honour are in the utmoſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree rigid, and there was reaſon to fear that, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever anxious I were to be your friend, I might be obliged to be your murderer. Fortunately the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of my courage is ſufficiently eſtabliſhed, not to expoſe it to any impeachment by my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining your preſent defiance. It was lucky how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:028752_0021_0FDEB44C366BC340"/>
that in our interview of yeſterday you found me alone, and that accident by that means threw the management of the affair entirely into my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal. If the tranſaction ſhould become known, the concluſion would now become known along with the provocation, and I am ſatisfied. But, if the challenge had been public, the proofs I had formerly given of my courage would not have excuſed my preſent moderation; and though de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to have avoided the combat, it would not have been in my power. Let us hence each of us learn to avoid haſte and indiſcretion, the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of which may be inexpiable but with blood; and may heaven bleſs you in a conſort of whom I deem you every way worthy!"</p>
                     <p>I have already ſaid that this was by no means the only inſtance in the courſe of his travels in which Mr. Falkland acquitted himſelf in the moſt bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant manner as a man of gallantry and virtue. He continued abroad during ſeveral years, every one of which brought ſome freſh acceſſion to the eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in which he was held, as well as to his own impatience of ſtain or diſhonour. At length he thought proper to return to England, with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of ſpending the reſt of his days at the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his anceſtors.</p>

                     <p>FROM the moment of his taking a ſtep like this, dictated as it probably was by an unaffected principle of duty, his misfortunes took their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement. All I have farther to ſtate of his hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory is one uninterrupted perſecution of a malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant deſtiny, a ſeries of adventures which ſeemed to take their riſe in various accidents, but pointing to one termination. Him they overwhelmed with an anguiſh he was of all others leaſt qualified to bear; and theſe waters of bitterneſs, extending beyond him, powered their deadly venom upon others, I myſelf being the moſt unfortunate of their victims.</p>
                     <p>The perſon in whom theſe calamities principally originated, was Mr. Falkland's neareſt neighbour, a man of eſtate equal to his own, by name, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas Tyrrel. This man one might at firſt have ſuppoſed of all others leaſt qualified from inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or inclined by the habits of his life, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfere with and diſturb the enjoyments of a mind ſo richly endowed as that of Mr. Falkland. Mr. Tyrrel might have paſſed for a true model of the Engliſh ſquire. He was very early left under the tuition of his mother, a woman of very narrow capacity, and who had no other child. This mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeemed to think that there was nothing in the world ſo precious as her hopeful Barnabas. Every thing muſt give way to his accommodation and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; every one muſt yield the moſt ſervile obedience to his commands. He muſt not be teaſed or reſtricted by any forms of inſtruction;
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:028752_0023_0FDEB44DC068CC20"/>
and of conſequence his proficiency even in the arts of writing and reading was extremely ſlender. From his birth he was muſcular and ſturdy; and, confined to the <hi>ruelle</hi> of his mother, he made much ſuch a figure as the whelp-lion that a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barian might have given for a lap-dog to his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs. But he ſoon broke looſe from theſe tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels, and formed an acquaintance with the groom and the game-keeper. Under their inſtruction he proved as ready a ſcholar as he had been indocile and reſtive to the pedant who held the office of his tutor. It was now evident that his ſmall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency in literature was by no means to be aſcribed to want of capacity. He diſcovered no contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſagacity and quick-wittedneſs in the ſcience of horſe-fleſh, and was eminently expert in the arts of ſhooting, fiſhing and hunting. Nor did he confine himſelf to theſe, but added the theory and practice of boxing, cudgel-play and quarter-ſtaff. Theſe exerciſes added tenfold robuſtneſs and vigour to his former qualifications. His ſtature, when grown, was ſomewhat more than ſix feet, and his form might have been ſelected by a painter as a model for that hero of antiquity, whoſe proweſs conſiſted in felling an ox with his fiſt, and then devouring him at a meal. Conſcious of his advantage in this reſpect, he was inſupportably arrogant, tyrannical to his inferiors, and inſolent to his equals. The activity of his mind, being diverted from the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine field of utility and diſtinction, ſhowed itſelf in the rude tricks of an overgrown lubber. Here, as in all other qualifications, he roſe above his competitors; and, if it had been poſſible to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look the callous and unrelenting diſpoſition in which they were generated, you would not have denied your applauſe to the invention theſe freaks diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the rough, ſarcaſtic wit with which they were accompanied.</p>

Mr. Tyrrel was by no means inclined to permit theſe extraordinary merits to reſt in oblivion. There was a weekly aſſembly at the neareſt market-town, the reſort of all the rural gentry. Here he had hitherto figured to the greateſt advantage, as grand maſter of the <hi>cotérie,</hi> no one among them having an equal ſhare of opulence, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority, though ſtill pretending to the rank of gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, greatly his inferiors in this eſſential article. The young men in this circle looked up to this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent baſhaw with timid reſpect, conſcious of the comparative eminence that unqueſtionably belonged to the powers of his mind; and he well knew how to maintain his rank with an inflexible hand. Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently indeed he relaxed his features, and aſſumed a temporary appearance of affableneſs and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity; but they found by experience, that, if any one, encouraged by his condeſcenſion, forgot the deference which Mr. Tyrrel conſidered as his due, he was ſoon taught to repent his preſumption. It was a tyger that, thought proper to toy with a mouſe, the little animal every moment in danger of being cruſhed by the fangs of his ferocious aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate. As Mr. Tyrrel had a conſiderable copiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſpeech and a rich but undiſciplined ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, he was always ſure of an audience. His neighbours crowded round, and joined in the ready laugh, partly from obſequiouſneſs, and partly from unfeigned admiration. It frequently happened however that in the midſt of his good humour a characteriſtic refinement of tyranny would ſuggeſt itſelf to his mind. When his ſubjects, encouraged by his familiarity, had diſcarded their precaution, the wayward fit would ſeize him, a ſudden cloud overſpread his brow, his voice transform from the pleaſant to the terrible, and a quarrel of a ſtraw immediately enſue with the firſt man whoſe face he did not like. The pleaſure that reſulted to
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:028752_0025_0FDEB44F425127A8"/>
others from the exuberant ſallies of his imagination was therefore not unalloyed with ſudden qualms of apprehenſion and terror. It may be believed that this deſpotiſm did not gain its final aſcendancy without being conteſted in the outſet. But all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition had been quelled with a high hand by this rural Antaeus. By the aſcendancy of his fortune, and his character among his neighbours, he always reduced his adverſary to the neceſſity of encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering him at his own weapons, and did not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs him without making him feel his preſumption through every joint in his frame. The tyranny of Mr. Tyrrel would not have been ſo patiently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured, had not his colloquial accompliſhments per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually come in aid of that authority which his rank and proweſs originally obtained.</p>
                     <p>The ſituation of our ſquire with the fair was ſtill more enviable than that which he maintained among perſons of his own ſex. Every mother taught her daughter to conſider the hand of Mr. Tyrrel as the higheſt object of her ambition. Every daughter regarded his athletic form and his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged proweſs with a favourable eye. As no man was adventurous enough to conteſt his ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority, ſo hardly any woman in this provincial circle would have ſcrupled to prefer his addreſſes to thoſe of any other admirer. His boiſterous wit had peculiar charms for them; and there was no ſpectacle more flattering to their vanity than the ſeeing this Hercules exchange his club for a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taff. It was pleaſing to them to conſider that the fangs of this wild beaſt, the very idea of which inſpired trepidation into the boldeſt hearts, might be played with by them with the utmoſt ſecurity.</p>
                     <p>The arrival of Mr. Falkland gave a dreadful ſhock to the authority of Mr. Tyrrel. The diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the former by no means inclined him to withhold himſelf from ſcenes of faſhionable reſort;
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:028752_0026_0FDBEF6C5BF71A78"/>
and he and his competitor were like two ſtars fated never to appear at once above the horizon. The advantages that Mr. Falkland poſſeſſed in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon are palpable; and, had it been otherwiſe, the ſubjects of his ruſtic neighbour were ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently diſpoſed to revolt againſt his mercileſs domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. They had hitherto ſubmitted not from love, but fear; and, if they had not actually rebelled, it was only for want of a leader. Even the ladies regarded Mr. Falkland with particular complacence. His poliſhed manners were admirably in uniſon with feminine delicacy. The ſallies of his wit were far beyond thoſe of Mr. Tyrrel in variety and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour; in addition to which they had the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of having their ſpontaneous exuberance guided and reſtrained by the ſagacity of a cultivated mind. The graces of his perſon were enhanced by the elegance of his deportment; and the benevolence and liberality of his temper were upon all occaſions conſpicuous. It was common indeed to Mr. Tyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel together with Mr. Falkland to be little acceſſible to ſentiments of awkwardneſs and confuſion. But for this Mr. Tyrrell was indebted to a ſelf-ſatisfied effrontery and a boiſterous and over-bearing elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution by which he was accuſtomed to diſcomfit his aſſailants; while Mr. Falkland, with great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity and candour of mind, was enabled, by his extenſive knowledge of the world and acquaintance with his own reſources, to perceive almoſt inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneouſly the proceeding it moſt became him to adopt.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Tyrrel contemplated the progreſs of his rival with uneaſineſs and averſion. He often comment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon it to his particular confidents as a thing altogether inconceivable. Mr. Falkland he deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as an animal that was beneath contempt. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minutive and dwarfiſh in his form, he wanted to ſet up a new ſtandard of human nature adapted to
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:028752_0027_0FDEB456C9B2AE68"/>
his own miſerable condition. He wiſhed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade people that the human ſpecies were made to be nailed to a chair and to pore over books. He would have them exchange thoſe robuſt exerciſes which made us joyous in the performance and vigorous in the conſequences, for the wiſe labour of ſcratching our heads for a rhyme and counting our fingers for a verſe. Monkeys were as good men as theſe. A nation of ſuch animals would have no chance with a ſingle regiment of the old Engliſh votaries of beef and pudding. For his own part he never ſaw any thing come of learning but to make people foppiſh and impertinent; and a ſenſible man would not wiſh any worſe calamity to the enemies of his nation than to ſee them run mad after ſuch pernicious abſurdities. It was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that people could ſeriouſly feel any liking for ſuch a ridiculous piece of goods as this out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landiſh, foreign-made Engliſhman. But he knew very well how it was; it was all a miſerable piece of mummery that was played only in ſpite to him. But G—for ever blaſt his ſoul, if he were not bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly revenged upon them all!</p>
                     <p>If ſuch were the ſentiments of Mr. Tyrrel, his patience found ample exerciſe in the language which was held by the reſt of his neighbours on the ſame ſubject. While he ſaw nothing in Mr. Falkland but matter for contempt, they appeared to be never weary of recounting his praiſes. Such dignity, ſuch affability, ſo perpetual an attention to the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of others, ſuch delicacy of ſentiment and expreſſion! Learned without oſtentation, refined without foppery, elegant without effeminacy! Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually anxious to prevent his ſuperiority either in wealth or accompliſhments from being painfully felt, it was felt ſo much the more certainly, and excited congratulation inſtead of envy in the ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator. It is hardly neceſſary to remark that the
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:028752_0028_0FDBEF7157C718E0"/>
revolution in this caſe belongs to one of the moſt obvious features of the human mind. The rudeſt exhibition of art is at firſt admired; till a nobler is preſented, and we are taught to wonder at the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility with which before we had been ſatisfied. Mr. Tyrrel thought there would be no end to the commendation; and expected when their common acquaintance would fall down and adore him. The moſt inadvertent expreſſion of applauſe towards his rival inflicted upon him the torment of demons. He writhed with agony, his features became diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted, and his looks inſpired terror. Such ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing would probably have ſoured the kindeſt tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; what muſt have been its effect upon Mr. Tyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel's, always fierce, unrelenting and abrupt?</p>
                     <p>The advantages of Mr. Falkland ſeemed by no means to diminiſh with their novelty. Every new ſufferer from Mr. Tyrrel's tyranny immediately went over to the ſtandard of his adverſary. The ladies, though treated by their ruſtic ſwain with more gentleneſs than the men, were occaſionally expoſed to his capriciouſneſs and inſolence. They could not help remarking the contraſt between theſe two leaders in the fields of Venus, the one of whom paid no attention to any one's pleaſure but his own, while the other ſeemed all good humour and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence. It was in vain that Mr. Tyrrel endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to reſtrain the ruggedneſs of his character. His motive was impatience, his thoughts were gloomy, and his courtſhip was like the pawings of an elephant. It appeared as if his temper were more human while he had indulged it in its free bent, than now that he ſullenly endeavoured to put fetters upon its exceſſes.</p>
                     <p>Among the ladies of the village aſſembly already mentioned there was none that ſeemed to engage more of the kindneſs of Mr. Tyrrel than Miſs Hardingham. She was alſo one of the few that
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:028752_0029_0FDEB43225F0D460"/>
had not yet gone over to the enemy, either becauſe ſhe really preferred the gentleman who was her oldeſt acquaintance, or conceiving from calculation that this conduct would beſt inſure ſucceſs to her object in a huſband. One day however ſhe thought proper, probably only by way of temporary expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment, to ſhow Mr. Tyrrel that ſhe could engage in hoſtilities, if he ſhould at any time give her ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient provocation. She accordingly ſo adjuſted her manoeuvres as to be engaged by Mr. Falkland as his partner for the dance of the evening, though without the ſmalleſt intention on the part of that gentleman of giving offence to his country neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
                     <p>A ſhort time before the dances began, Mr. Tyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel went up to his fair inamorata, and entered into ſome trifling converſation with her to fill up the time, as intending in a few minutes to lead her forward to the field. He had accuſtomed himſelf to neglect the ceremony of ſoliciting beforehand a promiſe in his favour, as not ſuppoſing it poſſible that any one ſhould dare to diſpute his beheſts; and, had it been otherwiſe, he would have thought the formality unneceſſary in this caſe, his general preference to Miſs Hardingham being ſufficiently notorious.</p>
                     <p>While he was thus engaged, Mr. Falkland came up. Mr. Tyrrel always regarded him with aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and loathing. Mr. Falkland however <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lided in a graceful and unaffected manner into the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation that was already begun, and the well-mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ingenuouſneſs of his manner was ſuch, as might for the time have diſarmed the devil of his malice. Mr. Tyrrel probably conceived that his accoſting Miſs Hardingham might be only an accidental piece of general ceremony, and expected every moment when he would withdraw to another part of the
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:028752_0030_0FDBEF717A764348"/>
room. Still he ſtaid, as if determined to tire out the patience of the ruſtic.</p>
                     <p>The company now began to be in motion for the dance, and Mr. Falkland informed Miſs Harding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham that it was time to advance.—Sir, interrupted Mr. Tyrrel abruptly, that lady is my partner.—I think not, ſir: I apprehend the lady has done me that favour, and I am very ſure ſhe has not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed herſelf to both.—I tell you, ſir, ſhe is mine: I pretend to think that I have ſome intereſt in that lady's affections; and I will ſuffer no man to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude upon my claims.—The lady's affections are not the ſubject of the preſent queſtion.—And pray, what is the ſubject? Obſerve, ſir, I will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede.—Mr. Tyrrel, there is no need of altercation in the preſent buſineſs: the maſter of the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies is the proper perſon to decide; and, as neither of us can intend to diſturb the good humour of the aſſembly, or exhibit our valour before the ladies, we ſhall either of us chearfully ſubmit to his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict.—Damn me, ſir, if I underſtand—Softly, Mr. Tyrrel. It really is not worth the while of either of us to quarrel about a queſtion that the forms of good company have long ago decided. I intended you no offence. But, ſir, I ſhall be abſolute in aſſerting that to which I have once acquired a claim. And you will pleaſe to obſerve that it is not my cuſtom to ſubmit to any unbecoming liberties.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Falkland uttered theſe words with the moſt even temper in the world. There was not in his manner the ſlighteſt appearance of defiance. The words, delivered with a certain tone, might have had the appearance of an a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ront. But they were uttered with the tone of a remonſtrance, calm, unaſſuming, and benevolent, without being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuous. Miſs Hardingham had begun to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of her experiment, but her alarm was ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly quieted by the irreſiſtible compoſure of her
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:028752_0031_0FDEB45B1135BF18"/>
new partner. Mr. Tyrrel walked away without anſwering a word. He muttered curſes as he went, which the laws of honour did not oblige Mr. Falk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land to overhear, and which indeed it would have been no eaſy taſk to have overheard with accuracy. Mr. Tyrrel would not perhaps have ſo eaſily given up his point, had not his own good ſenſe preſently taught him that, however eager he might be for revenge, this was not the ground he ſhould deſire to occupy. Add to this, that unaccuſtomed as he was to ſtrenuous oppoſition, he was leſs prepared inſtantaneouſly to encounter it; and indeed there was ſomething in Mr. Falkland's manner that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted aſſent for the preſent, however prejudice might reaſſume its dominion. But, though Mr. Tyrrel could not openly reſent this rebellion againſt his authority, he brooded over it in the receſſes of a malignant mind; and it was evident enough that he was accumulating materials for a bitter account, to which he truſted that his adverſary ſhould one day be brought.</p>

                     <p>THIS was only one out of innumerable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that every day ſeemed to enlarge, of petty mortifications which Mr. Tyrrel was deſtined to endure on the part of Mr. Falkland. In every one of them Mr. Falkland conducted himſelf with ſuch propriety and unaffected mildneſs, as perpetually to make ſome addition to the ſtock of his reputation. The more Mr. Tyrrel ſtruggled with his misfortune, the more conſpicuous and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate it became. A thouſand times he curſed his ſtars, which took, as he apprehended, a mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pleaſure in making Mr. Falkland at every turn the inſtrument of his humiliation. Smarting as he was under a ſucceſſion of untoward events, he appeared to feel in the moſt exquiſite manner the diſtinctions paid to his adverſary, even in thoſe particulars to which he had not the ſlighteſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions. An inſtance of this ſpeedily occurred.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Clare, a poet whoſe works have done im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal honour to the country that produced him, had lately retired, after a life ſpent in the ſublimeſt e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>orts of genius, to enjoy the produce of his economy and the reputation he had acquired, in this very neighbourhood. Such an inmate was looked up to by the country gentlemen with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of adoration. They felt a conſcious pride in recollecting that the boaſt of England was a native of their vicinity, and they were by no means defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient in gratitude to him, when they ſaw him who had left them an adventurer, return into the midſt of them in the cloſe of his days crowned with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:028752_0033_0FDEB45C94F87050"/>
and opulence. The reader is acquainted with his works; he has probably dwelt upon them with tranſport: and I need not remind him of their excellence. But he is perhaps a ſtranger to his perſonal qualifications. He does not know that his productions were ſcarcely more admirable than his converſation. In company he ſeemed to be the only perſon ignorant of the greatneſs of his fame. To the world his writings will long remain a kind of ſpecimen of what the human mind is capable of performing; but no man perceived their defects ſo acutely as he, or ſaw ſo diſtinctly how much yet remained to be effected. He alone appeared to look upon his works with ſuperiority and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference. One of the features that moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently diſtinguiſhed him was a perpetual ſuavity of manners, a comprehenſiveneſs of mind, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded the errors of others without a particle of reſentment, and made it impoſſible for any one to be his enemy. He pointed out to men their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes with frankneſs and unreſerve: his remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances produced aſtoniſhment and conviction, but without uneaſineſs to the party to whom they were addreſſed: they felt the inſtrument that was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to correct their irregularities, but it never mangled what it was intended to heal. Such were the moral qualities that diſtinguiſhed him among his acquaintance. The intellectual accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he exhibited were principally a tranquil and mild enthuſiaſm, and a richneſs of conception that dictated ſpontaneouſly to his tongue, and flowed with ſo much eaſe, that it was only by retroſpect you could be made aware of the amazing variety of ideas that had been preſented.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Clare certainly found few men in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote ſituation that were capable of participating in his ideas and amuſements. It has not ſeldom been the weakneſs of great men to fly to ſolitude,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:028752_0034_0FDBEF76DA07F0C0"/>
and converſe with woods and groves, rather than with a circle of ſtrong and comprehenſive minds like their own. From the moment of Mr. Falk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land's arrival in the neighbourhood Mr. Clare diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed him in the moſt flattering manner. To ſo penetrating a genius there was no need of long experience and patient obſervation to diſcover the merits and defects of any character that preſented itſelf. The foundations of his judgment had long ſince been accumulated, and at the cloſe of ſo il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious a life he might almoſt be ſaid to ſee through nature at a glance. What wonder that he took ſome intereſt in a mind in a certain degree congenial with his own? But to Mr. Tyrrel's diſeaſed imagination every diſtinction beſtowed on another ſeemed to be expreſsly intended as an inſult to him. On the other hand Mr. Clare, though gentle and benevolent in his remonſtrances to a degree that made the taking of offence impoſſible, was by no means parſimonious of praiſe, or ſlow to make uſe of the deference that was paid him, for the purpoſe of doing juſtice to merit. The pain which Mr. Tyrrel endured from this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in the preſent inſtance was extreme.</p>
                     <p>It happened at one of thoſe public meetings at which Mr. Falkland and Mr. Tyrrel were preſent, that the converſation, in one of the moſt numerous knots into which the company was broken, turned upon the poetical talents of the former. A lady, who was preſent, and was diſtinguiſhed for the acuteneſs of her underſtanding, ſaid, ſhe had been favoured with the ſight of a poem he had juſt written, entitled, an Ode to the Genius of Chivalry, which appeared to her of exquiſite merit. The curioſity of the company was immediately excited, and the lady added, ſhe had a copy in her pocket, which would be very much at their ſervice, provided its being thus produced would not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:028752_0035_0FDEB463A3345828"/>
to the author. The whole circle imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately intreated Mr. Falkland to comply with their wiſhes, and Mr. Clare, who was one of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, inforced their petition. Nothing gave this gentleman ſo much pleaſure as to have an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of witneſſing and doing juſtice to the exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of intellectual excellence. Mr. Falkland had no falſe modeſty or affectation, and therefore readily yielded his conſent. If their kindneſs led them to expect too much, the loſs, he ſaid, was theirs. What he ought moſt to deſire was to be ſet right, and he hoped he had fortitude enough tranquilly to abide the verdict of juſtice.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Tyrrel accidentally ſat at the extremity of this circle. It cannot be ſuppoſed that the turn the converſation had taken was by any means agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to him. He ſeemed to wiſh to withdraw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but there was ſome unknown power that as it were by enchantment retained him in his place, and made him conſent to drink to the dregs the bitter potion which envy had prepared from him.</p>
                     <p>The poem was read to the reſt of the company by Mr. Clare, whoſe elocution was ſcarcely inferior to his other accompliſhments. Simplicity, diſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination and energy conſtantly attended him in the act of reading, and it is not eaſy to conceive a more refined delight than fell to the lot of thoſe who had the good fortune to be his auditors. The beauties of Mr. Falkland's poem were accordingly exhibited with every advantage. The ſucceſſive paſſions of the author were communicated to the reader. Every word was impreſſed with its true value, and none was brought forward with diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned and elaborate emphaſis. The pictures conjured up by the creative <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ancy of the poet were placed full to view, at one time overwhelming the ſoul with ſuperſtitious awe, at another tranſporting it with luxuriant beauty.</p>

The character of the hearers upon this occaſion has already been deſcribed. They were for the moſt part plain, unlettered, and of little refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Poetry in general they read, when read at all, from the mere force of imitation and with few ſenſations of pleaſure; but this poem had a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar vein of glowing inſpiration. This very poem would probably have been ſeen by many of them with little effect; but the rhetoric of Mr. Clare carried it home to the heart. He ended; and, as the countenances of his auditors had before gone along with the paſſions of the compoſition, ſo now they emulated each other in giving language to their approbation. They were ſurpriſed into a ſort of applauſe to which they were little accuſtomed. One ſpoke and another followed by a ſort of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controulable impulſe; and the rude and broken manner of their commendations rendered them the more ſingular and remarkable. But what was leaſt to be endured was the behaviour of Mr. Clare. He returned the manuſcript to the lady from whom he had received it, and then turning to Mr. Falk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land ſaid with emphaſis and animation: Why, this is well, ſir. It is of the right ſtamp; none of your hard eſſays ſtrained from the ninefold labour of a pedant, or of your paſtoral ditties moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally diſtreſſed in ſearch of a meaning. We want ſuch people as you. But remember, young man, the muſe was not given to add new refinements to idleneſs, but for the deliverance of the world.</p>
                     <p>A moment after Mr. Clare had thus expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf, he quitted his ſeat, and with Mr. Falkland and two or three more withdrew. As ſoon as they were gone, Mr. Tyrrel edged farther into the circle. He had ſat ſilent ſo long that he ſeemed ready to burſt with gall and indignation. Mighty pretty verſes, ſaid he, half talking to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and not addreſſing any particular perſon:
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:028752_0037_0FDEB46651545338"/>
why, aye, the verſes were well enough. Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! I ſhould like to know what a ſhip-load of ſuch ſtuff is good for.</p>
                     <p>Why, ſurely, ſaid the lady who had introduced Mr. Falkland's ode on the preſent occaſion, you muſt allow that poetry is a very agreeable and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant amuſement.</p>
                     <p>Elegant, quotha!—Why, look at this Falkland! A puny bit of a thing! In the devil's name, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, do you think he would write poetry if he could do any thing better?</p>
                     <p>The converſation did not ſtop here. The lady expoſtulated. Several other perſons, freſh from the ſenſation they had felt, put in their ſhare. Mr. Tyrrel grew more violent in his invectives, and found eaſe in uttering them. The perſons who were able in any degree to check his vehemence were withdrawn. One ſpeaker after another ſhrunk back into ſilence, too timid to oppoſe, or too indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to contend with the fierceneſs of his paſſion. He found the appearance of his old aſcendancy; but he felt its deceitfulneſs and uncertainty, and was gloomily diſſatisfied.</p>
                     <p>In his return from this aſſembly he was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by a young man whom ſimilitude of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners had rendered one of his principal confidents, and whoſe road home was in part the ſame as his own. One would have thought that Mr. Tyrrel had ſufficiently vented his ſpleen in the dialogue he had juſt been holding with the lady and her aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates. But he was unable to diſmiſs from his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection the anguiſh he had endured. Damn Falkland! ſaid he. What a pitiful ſcoundrel is here to make all this buſtle about! But women and fools always will be fools; there is no help for that! Thoſe that ſet them on have moſt to anſwer for; and moſt of all Mr. Clare. He is a man that ought to know ſomething of the world, and paſt
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:028752_0038_0FDBEF804E6E88C8"/>
being duped by gewgaws and tinſel. He ſeemed too to have ſome ſenſe of juſtice: I ſhould not have ſuſpected him of hallooing to a cry of mongrels without honeſty or reaſon. But the world is all alike. Thoſe that ſeem better than their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours are only more artful. They mean the ſame thing, though they take a different road. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived me for a while, but it is all out now. They are the makers of all the miſchief. Fools might blunder, but they would not perſiſt, if people that ought to ſet them right, did not encourage them to go wrong.</p>
                     <p>A few days after this adventure Mr. Tyrrel was ſurpriſed to receive a viſit from Mr. Falkland. It was the firſt that had ever paſſed, they having never before ſeen each other but at a third place. Mr. Falkland proceeded without ceremony to explain the motive of his coming.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Tyrrel, ſaid he, I am come to have an ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable explanation with you.</p>
                     <p>Explanation! What is my offence?</p>
                     <p>None in the world, ſir; and for that reaſon I conceive this the fitteſt time for us to come to a right underſtanding.</p>
                     <p>You are in the devil of a hurry, ſir. Are you clear that this haſte will not mar, inſtead of make an underſtanding?</p>
                     <p>I think I am, ſir. I have great faith in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of my intentions, and I will not doubt that, when you perceive the view with which I come, you will willingly co-operate with it.</p>
                     <p>Mayhap, Mr. Falkland, we may not agree about that. One man thinks one way, and another man thinks another. Mayhap I do not think I have any great reaſon to be pleaſed with you already.</p>
                     <p>It may be ſo. I cannot however charge myſelf with having giving you reaſon to be diſpleaſed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="37" facs="unknown:028752_0039_0FDEB467D6757B30"/>
Mr. Tyrrel, proceeded Mr. Falkland, you will readily imagine that the cauſe that brought me hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was not a ſlight one. I would not have trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled you with a viſit but for important reaſons. My coming is a pledge how deeply I am myſelf impreſſed with what I have to communicate.</p>
                     <p>We are in a critical ſituation. We are upon the brink of a whirlpool which, if once it get hold of us, will render all farther deliberation impotent. Shall we be enemies? What benefit will be derived from that? Who ever found in gall, malice, ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion and hatred the materials of happineſs? No; to the breaſt where they enter, happineſs is for ever a ſtranger. They haunt our relaxations, they poiſon our pleaſures, they hardly allow us a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of unmixed ſatisfaction. A brow of care, a cankered heart, a boſom burſting with rage, theſe are their retinue.—If we be enemies, who ſhall tell where our enmity ſhall ſtop? Every new event will feed it; it will ſwell beyond imagination or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit; ever ſeeming enlarged to its utmoſt ſize, it will ſtill become more monſtrous, more intolerable!</p>
                     <p>Upon my ſoul, you are an extraordinary man,—an impertinent man! Why intrude upon me your prophecies and forebodings?</p>
                     <p>Becauſe it is neceſſary to your happineſs. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it becomes me to tell you of our danger now, rather than wait till my character will permit me to be ſilent no longer.</p>
                     <p>Sir, I mean to take care of my own happineſs. I do not thank you for your interference. Damn me, if I think this is any thing elſe but a trick to put a new feather in your cap at your neighbour's expence.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Tyrrel, it is to provide againſt ſuch miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions on either part that I have ſought you. I know the infirmity of my temper, but at leaſt upon this occaſion I am determined not to take any
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:028752_0040_0FDBEF815B345B00"/>
thing ill. If my intention had been to outſhine you, ſhould I have come alone?</p>
                     <p>Well, ſir, you have no right to put me out of humour with myſelf. If you come to play upon me, and try what ſort of a fellow you ſhall have to deal with, damn me, if you ſhall have any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to hug yourſelf upon the experiment.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Tyrrel, nothing is more eaſy for us than to quarrel. If you deſire that, there is no fear that you will find opportunities.</p>
                     <p>Damn me, ſir, if I do not believe you are come to bully me.</p>
                     <p>Good God, Mr. Tyrrel, be leſs unjuſt! My character is too well known to allow it to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that I fear any man, and I do not in the leaſt ſuſpect you of a weakneſs in that reſpect to which I am myſelf a ſtranger.</p>
                     <p>Well, ſir, that is thereafter as it may be.</p>
                     <p>By quarrelling we ſhall but imitate the great maſs of mankind who could eaſily quarrel in our place. Let us do better. Let us ſhow that we have the wiſdom to avoid vulgar errors, and the magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to condemn petty miſunderſtandings. We are formed in different habits; why ſhould we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfere? The world is wide enough for both. By thus judging we ſhall do ourſelves moſt ſubſtantial honour. By a contrary conduct we ſhall be our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the ſufferers, and merely preſent a comedy for the amuſement of our acquaintance.</p>
                     <p>Do you think ſo? There may be ſomething in that. Damn me, if I conſent to be the jeſt of any man living.</p>
                     <p>You are right, Mr. Tyrrel. Let us each act in the manner beſt calculated to excite reſpect. We neither of us wiſh to change roads with the other; let us each ſuffer the other to purſue his own track unmoleſted. Be this our compact; and by mutual forbearance let us preſerve mutual peace.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="39" facs="unknown:028752_0041_0FDEB46A28F7BF48"/>
Saying this, Mr. Falkland put out his hand in token of fellowſhip. But the geſture was too ſignificant. The wayward Tyrrel, who ſeemed to have been ſomewhat impreſſed by what had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded, taken as he was now by ſurpriſe, ſhrunk back.</p>
                     <p>All this is very unaccountable, cried he. What the devil can have made you ſo forward, if you had not ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ly purpoſe to anſwer by which I am to be overreached?</p>
                     <p>My purpoſe, replied Mr. Falkland, is a manly and an honeſt purpoſe. Why ſhould you refuſe a propoſition dictated by reaſon, and an equal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the intereſt of each?—Mr. Tyrrel had had an opportunity for pauſe, and fell back into his habitual character.</p>
                     <p>Well, ſir, in all this I muſt own there is ſome frankneſs. Now I will return you like for like. It is no matter how I came by it, my temper is rough, and will not be controuled. Mayhap you may think it a weakneſs, but I do not deſire to ſee it altered. Till you came, I found myſelf very well: I liked my neighbours, and my neighbours hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured me. But now the caſe is entirely alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and, as long as I cannot ſtir abroad without meeting with ſome mortification in which you are directly or remotely concerned, I am determined to hate you. Now, ſir, if you will only go out of the county or the kingdom, to the devil if you pleaſe, ſo as I may never hear of you any more, I will promiſe never to quarrel with you as long as I live. Your poetry and your delicacy, your quirks and your conundrums may then be the very paragon of excellence for what I care.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Tyrrel, attend to reaſon. I might as well deſire you to leave the county, as you deſire me. I came here to you, not as to a maſter, but an equal. In the ſociety of men we muſt have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:028752_0042_0FDBEF865EF811F0"/>
to bear, as well as to perform. No man muſt think that the world was made for him alone. Let us then take things as we find them; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate ourſelves with prudence to unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able circumſtances.</p>
                     <p>True, ſir, all that is very fine talking. But I return to my text; we are as God made us. I am neither a philoſopher nor a poet, to ſet out upon a wild-gooſe chaſe of making myſelf a different man from what you find me. As for conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, what muſt be muſt be. As we brew, we muſt bake. And ſo, do you ſee, I ſhall not trouble myſelf about what is to be, but ſtand up to it with a ſtout heart when it comes. Only this I can tell you, that, as long as I find you thruſt into my diſh every day, I ſhall hate you as bad as ſenna and valerian. And damn me, if I do not think I hate you the more for coming to-day in this prag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical way when nobody ſent for you, on purpoſe to ſhow how much wiſer you are than all the world beſides.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Tyrrel, I have done. I foreſaw conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, and came as a friend to adviſe you. I did hope that by mutual explanation we ſhould each of us have improved in the good opinion of the other. I am partly diſappointed; but I ſtill believe that when you coolly reflect on what has paſſed, you will give me credit for the honeſty of my intentions, and be diſpoſed to think of me with the ſame conſideration and liberality as I am determined to exerciſe towards you.</p>
                     <p>Having ſaid this, Mr. Falkland departed; and Mr. Tyrrel had recourſe to his old friend, to whom he unburthened the tumult of his thoughts. This, cried he, is a new artifice of the fellow to prove his imagined ſuperiority. We know very well that he has the gift of the gab. To be ſure, if the world were to be governed by words, he would
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:028752_0043_0FDEB47108758AE8"/>
be in the right box. Oh, yes, he had it all hollow before him! But what ſignifies prating? Buſineſs muſt be done in an other-gueſs way than that. I wonder what poſſeſſed me that I did not kick him! But that is all to come. This is only a new debt added to the ſcore which he ſhall one day richly pay. This Falkland haunts me like a demon. I cannot wake, but I think of him. I cannot ſleep, but I ſee him. He poiſons all my pleaſures. I ſhould be glad to ſee him torn with tenter-hooks, and to grind his heart-ſtrings with my teeth. I ſhall know no joy, till I ſee him ruined. There may be ſome things right about him; but he is my perpetual torment. The thought of him preſſes like a dead weight upon my heart, and I have a right to throw it off. Does he think I will feel all that I endure for nothing?</p>
                     <p>In ſpite of the acerbity of Mr. Tyrrel's feelings, it is probable however he did ſome juſtice to his rival. Upon ordinary occaſions at leaſt he ſeemed diſpoſed to treat him with an involuntary defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. He was no longer equally voluble in mixed companies in his abuſe of him; a part of the topics of his invective ſeemed to be gone. He was no longer eager to treat him with random hoſtility; if he regarded him with equal diſlike, he at leaſt appeared to regard him as a formidable foe. He avoided his encounter; he forbore to contradict his opinions; he ſeemed to lie in wait for his victim, and to collect his venom for a mortal aſſault.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. V.</head>
                     <p>IT was not long after that a malignant contagious diſtemper broke out in the neighbour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ood, which proved fatal to many of the inhabitants, and was of unexampled rapidity in its effects. One of the firſt perſons that was ſeized with it was Mr. Clare. It may be believed that this incident ſpread grief and alarm through the vicinity. Mr. Clare was conſidered by them as ſomething more than a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. The equanimity of his behaviour, his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſuming carriage, his exuberant benevolence and goodneſs of heart, joined with his talents, his inoffenſive wit, and the comprehenſiveneſs of his intelligence made him the idol of all that knew him. In the ſcene of his rural retreat at leaſt he had not an enemy. All mourned the danger that now threatened him. He appeared to have the proſpect of long life, and of going down to his grave full of years and of honour. Perhaps theſe appearances were deceitful. Perhaps the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual efforts he had exerted, which were occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally more ſudden, violent and unintermitted than a ſtrict regard to health would have dictated, had laid the ſeeds of future diſeaſe. But a ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine obſerver would infallibly have predicted, that his good ſenſe, preſence of mind and unaltered chearfulneſs would be able even to keep death at bay for a time and baffle the attacks of diſtemper, provided this univerſal foe did not take him by ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe. The general affliction therefore was doubly pungent upon the preſent occaſion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="43" facs="unknown:028752_0045_0FDEB473CECDBFC8"/>
But no one was ſo much affected as Mr. Falk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. Perhaps no man living ſo well underſtood the value of the life that was now at ſtake. He immediately haſtened to the ſpot; but he found ſome difficulty in gaining admiſſion. Mr. Clare, aware of the infectious nature of his diſeaſe, had given directions that as few people as poſſible ſhould approach him. Mr. Falkland ſent up his name. He was told that he was included in the general orders. He was not however of a temper to be eaſily repulſed; he perſiſted with obſtinacy, and at length carried his point, being only reminded in the firſt inſtance to employ thoſe precautions which experience has approved as moſt effectual for coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teracting infection.</p>
                     <p>He found Mr. Clare in his bedchamber, but not in bed. He was ſitting in his night-gown at a bureau near the window. His appearance was compoſed and chearful, but death was in his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance. I had a great inclination, Mr. Falkland, ſaid he, not to have ſuffered you to come in; and yet there is not a perſon in the world it could give me more pleaſure to ſee. But upon ſecond thoughts I believe there are few people that could run into a danger of this kind with a better proſpect of eſcaping. In your caſe, at leaſt the garriſon will not be taken through the treachery of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander. I cannot tell how it is that I, who can preach wiſdom to you, have myſelf been caught. But do not be diſcouraged by my example. I had no notice of my danger, or I would have acquitted myſelf better. Theſe ſtrange ſeeds of diſtemper ſeem to float in the air, and to faſten upon the frame without its being poſſible for us to tell what was the method of their approach.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Falkland, having once eſtabliſhed himſelf in the apartment of his friend, would upon no terms conſent to retire. Mr. Clare conſidered that there
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:028752_0046_0FDBEF8D3174B888"/>
was perhaps leſs danger in this choice than in a frequent change from the extremes of a pure to a tainted air, and deſiſted from his expoſtulation. Falkland, ſaid he, when you came in, I had juſt finiſhed making my will. I was not pleaſed with what I had formerly drawn up upon that ſubject, and I did not chooſe in my preſent ſituation to call in an attorney. In fact it would be ſtrange if a man of ſenſe with pure and direct intentions ſhould not be able to perform ſuch a function for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Clare continued to act in the ſame eaſy and diſengaged manner as in perfect health. To judge from the chearfulneſs of his tone and the firmneſs of his manner, the thought would never once have occurred to you that he was dying. He walked, he reaſoned, he jeſted, in a way that argued the moſt perfect ſelf-poſſeſſion. But his appearance changed perceptibly for the worſe every quarter of an hour. Mr. Falkland kept his eye perpetually fixed upon him with mingled ſentiments of anxiety and admiration.</p>
                     <p>Falkland, ſaid he, after having appeared for a ſhort period abſorbed in thought, I feel that I am dying. This is a ſtrange diſtemper of mine. Yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday I ſeemed in perfect health, and to-morrow I ſhall be an inſenſible corpſe. How curious is the line that ſeparates life and death to mortal men! To be at one moment active, gay, penetrating, with immenſe ſtores of knowledge at one's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, capable of delighting, inſtructing and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating mankind, and the next, lifeleſs and loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, an incumbrance upon the face of the earth. Such is the hiſtory of many men, and ſuch will be mine.</p>
                     <p>I feel as if I had yet much to do in the world; but it will not be. I muſt be contented with what is paſt. It is in vain that I muſter all my ſpirits to
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:028752_0047_0FDEB475567FB848"/>
my heart. The enemy is too mighty and too mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileſs for me; he will not give me time ſo much as to breathe. Theſe things are not yet in our power. They are parts of a great ſeries that is perpetually flowing. The general welfare, the great buſineſs of the univerſe, will go on, though I bear no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhare in promoting it. That taſk is reſerved for younger ſtrengths, for you, Falkland, and ſuch as you. We ſhould be contemptible indeed, if the proſpect of human improvement did not yield us a pure and perfect delight, independently of the queſtion of our exiſting to partake of it. Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind would have little to envy to future ages, if they had all enjoyed a ſerenity as perfect as mine.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Clare ſat up through the whole day, indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf in eaſy and chearful exertions, which were perhaps better calculated to refreſh and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorate the frame, than if he had ſought repoſe in its direct form. Now and then he was viſited with a ſudden pang; but it was no ſooner felt, than he ſeemed to riſe above it, and ſmiled at the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the attack. Three or four times he was bedewed with profuſe ſweats, and theſe again were ſucceeded by an extreme dryneſs and burning heat of the ſkin. He was next covered with ſmall livid ſpots. Symptoms of ſhivering followed, but theſe he drove away with a determined reſolution. He then became tranquil and compoſed, and after ſome time determined to go to bed, it being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready night. Falkland, ſaid he, preſſing his hand, the taſk of dying is not ſo difficult, as ſome people imagine. When one looks back from the brink of it, one wonders that ſo total a ſubverſion can take place at ſo eaſy a rate.</p>
                     <p>He had now been ſome time in bed, and, as every thing was ſtill, Mr. Falkland hoped that he ſlept. But in that he was miſtaken. Preſently Mr. Clare threw back the curtain, and looked in
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:028752_0048_0FDBEF8E172DE238"/>
the countenance of his friend. I cannot ſleep, ſaid he. No, if I could ſleep, it would be the ſame thing as to recover; and I am fated to have the worſt in this battle.</p>
                     <p>Falkland, I have been thinking about you. I do not know any one whoſe future uſefulneſs I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template with greater hope. Take care of your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Do not let the world be defrauded of the benefit of your virtues. I am well acquainted with your weakneſs as well as your ſtrength. You have an impetuoſity and an impatience of imagined diſhonour, that, if once ſet wrong, may make you as eminently miſchievous, as you will otherwiſe be uſeful. Would to God you would think ſeriouſly of exterminating this error!</p>
                     <p>But, if I cannot, in the brief expoſtulation my preſent ſituation will allow, work this deſirable change in you, there is at leaſt one thing I can do. I can put you upon your guard againſt a miſchief I foreſee to be imminent. Beware of Mr. Tyrrel. Do not commit the miſtake of deſpiſing him as an unequal opponent. Petty cauſes may produce great miſchiefs. Mr. Tyrrel is boiſterous, rugged and unfeeling; and you are too paſſionate, too acutely ſenſible of injury. It would be truly to be lamented, if a man ſo inferior, ſo utterly unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be compared with you, ſhould be capable of changing your whole hiſtory into miſery and guilt. Think of this. I exact no promiſe from you. I would not ſhackle you with the fetters of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition; I would have you be governed by reaſon and juſtice.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Falkland was deeply affected with this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulation. His ſenſe of the generous attention of Mr. Clare at ſuch a moment as this, was ſo great as almoſt to deprive him of utterance. He ſpoke in ſhort ſentences and with viſible effort. I will behave better, replied he. Never fear me! Your
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:028752_0049_0FDBEFD25A458660"/>
kind admonitions ſhall not be thrown away upon me.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Clare adverted to another ſubject. I have made you my executor; you will not refuſe me this laſt office of friendſhip. It is but a ſhort time that I have had the happineſs of knowing you; but in that ſhort time I have examined you well, and ſeen you thoroughly. Do not diſappoint the ſanguine hope I have entertained!</p>
                     <p>I have left ſome legacies. My former connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, while I lived amidſt the buſy haunts of men, as many of them as were intimate, are all of them dear to me. I have not had time to ſummon them about me upon the preſent occaſion, nor did I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it. The remembrances of me will, I hope, anſwer a better purpoſe than ſuch as are uſually thought of on ſimilar occaſions.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Clare, having thus unburthened his mind, ſpoke no more for ſeveral hours. Towards morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mr. Falkland quietly withdrew the curtain, and looked at the dying man. His eyes were open, and were now gently turned towards his young friend. His countenance was ſunk, and of a death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like appearance. I hope you are better, ſaid Falk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land in a half-whiſper, as if afraid of diſturbing him. Mr. Clare drew his hand from the bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clothes, and ſtretched it forward; Mr. Falkland advanced, and took hold of it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> Much better, ſaid Mr. Clare in a voice, inward and hardly articulate: the ſtruggle is now over; I have finiſhed my part: farewel; remember! Theſe were his laſt words. He lived ſtill a few hours; his lips were ſometimes ſeen to move; he expired without a groan</p>
                     <p>Mr. Falkland had witneſſed the ſcene with much anxiety. His hopes of a favourable criſis, and his fear of diſturbing the laſt moments of his friend, had held him dumb. For the laſt half hour he had ſtood up with his eyes intently fixed upon Mr.
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:028752_0050_0FDBEF9366046430"/>
Clare. He witneſſed the laſt gaſp, the laſt little convulſive motion of the frame. He continued to look; he ſeemed ſometimes to imagine that he ſaw life renewed. At length he could deceive himſelf no longer, and exclaimed with a diſtracted accent, And is this all? He would have thrown himſelf upon the body of his friend; the attendants with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, and would have forced him into another apartment. But he ſtruggled from them, and hung fondly over the bed. Is this the end of genius, virtue and excellence? Is the luminary of the world thus for ever gone? Oh, yeſterday! yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day! Clare, why could not I have died in your ſtead? Dreadful moment! Irreparable loſs! Loſt in the very maturity and vigour of his mind! Cut off from a uſefulneſs ten thouſand times greater than any he had already exhibited! Oh, his was a mind to have inſtructed ſages, and guided the moral world! This is all we have left of him! The eloquence of thoſe lips is gone! The inceſſant activity of that heart is ſtill! The beſt and wiſeſt of men is gone, and the world is inſenſible of its loſs!</p>
                     <p>Mr. Tyrrel heard the intelligence of Mr. Clare's death with emotion, but of a very different kind. He avowed that he had not forgiven him his partial attachment to Falkland, and therefore could not recal his remembrance with kindneſs. But, if he could have overlooked his paſt injuſtice, ſufficient care was taken to employ means to keep alive his reſentment. Falkland forſooth attended him on his death-bed, as if nobody elſe was worthy to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of his confidential communications. But what was worſt of all was this executorſhip. In every thing this pragmatical raſcal throws me behind. Contemptible wretch, that has nothing of the man about him! Muſt he perpetually trample on his betters? Is every body incapable of reaſon, and
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:028752_0051_0FDBEFD40F9B4CE0"/>
making a right eſtimate of the merits of men? caught with mere outſide? chooſing the flimſy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſubſtantial? And upon his death-bed too! [Mr. Tyrrel with his uncultivated brutality mixed, as uſually happens, certain rude notions of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.] Sure the ſenſe of his ſituation might have ſhamed him. Poor wretch! his ſoul has a great deal to anſwer for. He has made my pillow un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy; and whatever may be the conſequences, it is him we have to thank for them.</p>
                     <p>The death of Mr. Clare removed the perſon who could moſt effectually have moderated the animoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the contending parties, and took away the great operative check upon the exceſſes of Mr. Tyrrel. This ruſtic tyrant had been held in invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary reſtraint by the intellectual aſcendancy of his celebrated neighbour; and, notwithſtanding the general ferocity of his temper, did not appear till lately to have entertained a hatred againſt him. In the ſhort time that had elapſed from the period in which Mr. Clare had fixed his reſidence in the neighbourhood to that of the arrival of Mr. Falk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land from the Continent, the conduct of Mr. Tyrrel had even ſhown certain tokens of improvement. Such was the felicity of Mr. Clare's manners that, even while he corrected, he conciliated, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited no angry emotions in thoſe whoſe actions were moſt curbed by the apprehenſion of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure. The effects of his ſuavity however, ſo far as related to Mr. Tyrrel, had been in a certain degree ſuſpended by conſiderations of rivalſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this gentleman and Mr. Falkland. And, now that the influence of Mr. Clare's preſence and virtues were entirely removed, Mr. Tyrrel's temper broke out into more criminal exceſſes than at any former period, having the additional ſtimulus of mortified pride and diſappointed ambition.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. VI.</head>
                     <p>THE conſequences of all this ſpeedily manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves. The very next incident in the ſtory was in ſome degree deciſive of the cataſtrophe. Hitherto I have ſpoken only of preliminary matters, ſeemingly unconnected with each other, though leading to that ſtate of mind in both parties, which had ſuch fatal effects. But all that remains is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid and tremendous. The death-dealing miſchief advances with an accelerated motion, appearing to defy human wiſdom and human ſtrength to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct its operation.</p>
                     <p>There was a tenant of Mr. Tyrrel, one Hawk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ins;—I cannot mention his name without recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting the painful tragedies that are annexed to it! This Hawkins had originally been taken up by Mr. Tyrrel with a view of protecting him from the arbitrary proceedings of a neighbouring ſquire, though he had now in his turn become an object of perſecution to Mr. Tyrrel himſelf. The firſt ground of their connection was this. Hawkins, beſide a farm which he rented under the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned ſquire, had a ſmall freehold eſtate that he inherited from his father. This of courſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled him to a vote in the county elections; and, a warmly conteſted election having occurred, he was required by his landlord to vote for the candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date in whoſe favour he had himſelf engaged. Hawkins refuſed to obey the mandate, and ſoon after received notice to quit the farm he at that time rented.</p>
                     <p>It happened that Mr. Tyrrel had intereſted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſtrongly in behalf of the oppoſite candidate;
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:028752_0053_0FDBEFD75FEB5B30"/>
and, as Mr. Tyrrel's eſtate bordered upon the ſeat of Hawkins's reſidence, the ejected countryman could think of no better expedient than that of riding over to this gentleman's manſion, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the caſe to him. Mr. Tyrrel heard him through with attention. Well, friend, ſaid he, it is very true that I wiſhed Mr. Jackman to carry his election; but you know it is uſual in theſe caſes for tenants to vote juſt as their landlords pleaſe. I do not think proper to encourage rebellion.—All that is very right, and pleaſe you, replied Hawkins; and I would have voted at my landlord's bidding for any other man in the three kingdoms but ſquire Marlow. You muſt know one day his huntſman rode over my fence, and ſo through my beſt field of ſtanding corn. It was not above a dozen yards about, if he had kept the cart-road. The fellow had ſerved me the ſame ſauce, an it pleaſe your honour, three or four times before. So I only aſked him, What he did that for, and whether he had not more conſcience than to ſpoil people's crops a' that faſhion? Preſently the ſquire came up. He is but a poor, weazen-face chicken of a gentleman, ſaving your honour's reverence. And ſo he flew into a woundy paſſion, and threatened to horſewhip me. I will do as much in reaſon to pleaſure my landlord as arr a tenant he has; but I will not give my vote to a man that threatens to horſewhip me. And ſo, your honour, I and my wife and three children are to be turned out of houſe and home, and what I am to do to maintain them God knows. I have been a hard-working man, and have always lived very well, and I do think the caſe is main hard. Squire Underwood turns me out of my farm; and, if your honour do not take me in, I know none of the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gentry will, for fear as they ſay of encouraging their own tenants to run ruſty too.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="52" facs="unknown:028752_0054_0FDBEF9A14C69E68"/>
This repreſentation was not without its effect upon Mr. Tyrrel. Well, well, man, replied he, we will ſee what can be done. Order and ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination are very good things; but people ſhould know how much to require. As you tell the ſtory, I cannot ſee that you are greatly to blame. Marlow is a coxcombical prig, that is the truth on't; and, if a man will expoſe himſelf, why, he muſt even take what follows. I do hate a Frenchified fop with all my ſoul; and I cannot ſay that I am much pleaſed with Mr. Underwood for taking the part of ſuch a raſcal. Hawkins, I think is your name? You may call on Barnes, my ſteward, to-morrow, and he ſhall ſpeak to you.</p>
                     <p>While Mr. Tyrrel was ſpeaking, he recollected that he had a farm vacant of nearly the ſame va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue as that which Hawkins at preſent rented under Mr. Underwood. He immediately conſulted his ſteward, and, finding the thing ſuitable in every reſpect, Hawkins was admitted out of hand into the catalogue of Mr. Tyrrel's tenants. Mr. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwood extremely reſented this proceeding, which indeed, as being contrary to the underſtood con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions of the country gentlemen, few people but Mr. Tyrrel would have ventured upon. He ſaid that there was an end to all regulation, if tenants were to be encouraged in ſuch inexcuſable diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. It was not a queſtion of this or that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didate, ſeeing that any gentleman, who was a true friend to his country, would rather loſe his elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than do a thing which if once eſtabliſhed into a practice, would deprive them for ever of the power of managing any election. The labouring people were ſturdy and reſolute enough of their own accord; it became every day mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> difficult to keep them under any ſubordinations and, if the gentlemen were ſo ill-adviſed as to neglect the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:028752_0055_0FDBEFD859B782E8"/>
good, and encourage them in their inſolence, there was no foreſeeing where it would end.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Tyrrel was not of a ſtamp to be influenced by theſe remonſtrances. Their general ſpirit was ſufficiently conformable to the ſentiments he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf entertained; but he was of too vehement a temper to maintain the character of a conſiſtent politician; and, however wrong his conduct might be, he would by no means admit of its being ſet right by the ſuggeſtions of others. The more his patronage of Hawkins was criticiſed, the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexibly he adhered to it; and he was at no loſs in clubs and other aſſemblies to overbear and ſilence, if not to confute his cenſurers. Beſide which, Hawkins had certain accompliſhments which qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified him to be a favourite with Mr. Tyrrel. The bluntneſs of his manner and the ruggedneſs of his temper gave him ſome reſemblance to his landlord; and, as theſe qualities were likely to be more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently exerciſed on ſuch perſons as had incurred Mr. Tyrrel's diſpleaſure than upon Mr. Tyrrel him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, they were not obſerved without ſome degree of complacency. In a word, he every day receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed new marks of diſtinction from his patron, and after ſome time was appointed coadjutor to Mr. Barnes in the capacity of bailiff. It was about the ſame period that he obtained a leaſe of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>arm of which he was tenant.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Tyrrel was determined, as occaſion offered, to promote every part of the family of this favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed dependent. Hawkins had a ſon, a lad of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteen, of a very agreeable perſon, a ruddy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, and of quick and lively parts. This lad was in an uncommon degree the favourite of his father, who ſeemed to have nothing ſo much at heart as the future welfare of his ſon. Mr. Tyrrel had noticed him two or three times with approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and the boy, being fond of the ſports of the
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:028752_0056_0FDBEF9EC2123278"/>
field, had occaſionally followed the hounds, and diſplayed various inſtances both of agility and ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city in preſence of the ſquire. One day in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular he exhibited himſelf with uncommon advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; and Mr. Tyrrel without farther delay propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to his father to take him into his family, and make him whipper-in to his hounds, till he could provide him with ſome more lucrative appointment in his ſervice.</p>
                     <p>This propoſal was received by Hawkins with various marks of mortification. He excuſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with heſitation for not accepting the offered favour; ſaid the lad was in many ways uſeful to him; and hoped his honour would not inſiſt upon depriving him of his aſſiſtance. This apology might perhaps have been ſufficient with any other man than Mr. Tyrrel; but it was frequently obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of this gentleman that, when he had once form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a determination however ſlight in favour of any meaſure, he was never afterwards known to give it up, and that the only effect of oppoſition was to make him eager and inflexible in purſuit of that to which he had before been nearly indifferent. At firſt he ſeemed to receive the apology of Hawkins with good humour, and to ſee nothing in it but what was reaſonable; but afterwards every time he ſaw the boy his deſire of retaining him in his ſervice was increaſed, and he more than once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated to his father the good diſpoſition in which he felt himſelf towards him. At length he obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the lad was no more to be ſeen mingling in his favourite ſports, and he began to ſuſpect that this originated in a determination to thwart him in his projects.</p>
                     <p>Rouſed by this ſuſpicion, which was not of a nature with Mr. Tyrrel to brook a delay, he ſent for Hawkins to confer with him. Hawkins, ſaid he, in a tone of diſpleaſure, I am not ſatisfied with
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:028752_0057_0FDBEFD9D2D37928"/>
you. I have ſpoken to you two or three times about this lad of yours, whom I am deſirous of taking into favour. What is the reaſon, ſir, that you ſeem unthankful and averſe to my kindneſs? You ought to know that I am not to be trifled with. I ſhall not be contented, when I offer my favours to have them rejected by ſuch fellows as you. I made you what you are; and, if I pleaſe, can make you more helpleſs and miſerable than you were when I found you. Have a care!</p>
                     <p>An it pleaſe your honour, ſaid Hawkins, you have been a very good maſter to me, and I will tell you the whole truth. I hope you will na be angry. This lad is my favourite, my comfort and the ſtay of my age.</p>
                     <p>Well, and what then? Is that a reaſon you ſhould hinder his preferment?</p>
                     <p>Nay, pray your honour, hear me. I may be very weak for aught I know in this caſe, but I cannot help it. My father was a clergyman. We have all of us lived in a creditable way; and I cannot bear to think that this poor lad of mine ſhould go to ſervice. For my part, I do not ſee any good that comes of ſervants. God forgive me, if I am unjuſt! But this is a very dear caſe, and I cannot bear to riſk my poor boy's welfare, when I can ſo eaſily, if you pleaſe, keep him out of harm's way. At preſent he is ſober and induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious, and, without being conceited or ſurly, knows what is due to him. I know, your honour, that it is main fooliſh of me to talk to you thus; but your honour has been a good maſter to me, and I cannot bear to tell you a lie.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Tyrrel had heard the whole of this harangue in ſilence, becauſe he was too much aſtoniſhed to open his mouth. If a thunderbolt had fallen un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly at his feet, he could not have teſtified greater ſurpriſe. He had thought that Hawkins
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:028752_0058_0FDBEFA0160F7218"/>
was ſo fooliſhly fond of his ſon that he could not bear to truſt him out of his preſence, but had never in the ſlighteſt degree ſuſpected what he now found to be the truth.</p>
                     <p>Oh, oh, you are a gentleman, are you? A pretty gentleman truly! Your father was a cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyman! Your family is too good to enter into my ſervice! Why, you impudent raſcal! was it for this that I took you up, when Mr. Underwood diſmiſſed you for your inſolence to him? Have I been nurſing a viper in my boſom? Pretty maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's manners will be contaminated truly! He will not know what is due to him, but will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to obey orders! You inſufferable vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain! Get out of my ſight! Depend upon it, I will have no gentlemen on my eſtate! I will off with them, root and branch, bag and baggage! So, do you hear, ſir? come to me to-morrow morning, bring your ſon, and aſk my pardon; or take my word for it, I will make you ſo miſerable, you ſhall wiſh you had never been born</p>
                     <p>This treatment was too much for Hawkins's patience. There is no need, your honour, that I ſhould come to you again about this affair. I have taken up my determination, and no accident or time can make any change in it. I am main ſorry to diſpleaſe your worſhip, and I know very well that you can do me a great deal of miſchief. But I hope you will not be ſo hard hearted, as to ruin a father only for being fond of his child, even if ſo be that his fondneſs ſhould make him do a fooliſh thing. But I cannot help it, your honour: you muſt do as you pleaſe. The pooreſt ſlave in the world has ſome point that he does not part with. I will loſe all that I have, and go to day-labour, and my ſon too, if needs muſt; but I will not make a gentleman's ſervant of him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="57" facs="unknown:028752_0059_0FDBEFDEB3932BB8"/>
Very well, friend; very well! replied Tyrrel, foaming with rage. Depend upon it, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member you! Your pride ſhall have a downfal! G—damn it! is it come to this? Shall a louſy raſcal, that farms his forty acres, pretend to beard the lord of the manor? I will tread you into paſte! Let me adviſe you, ſcoundrel, to ſhut up your houſe, and quit my eſtate, and fly as if the devil was behind you! You may think yourſelf happy, if I be not too quick for you yet, if you eſcape in a whole ſkin! I would not ſuffer ſuch a villain to remain upon my land a day longer, if I could gain the Indies by it!</p>
                     <p>Not ſo faſt, your honour, anſwered Hawkins ſturdily. I hope you will think better of it, and ſee that I have not been to blame. But, if you ſhould not, there is ſome harm that you can do me, and ſome harm that you cannot. Though I am a plain working man, your honour, do you ſee? yet I am a man ſtill. No; I have got a leaſe of my farm, and I ſhall not quit it o'thaten. I hope there is ſome law for poor folk, as well as for rich ones.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Tyrrel, unuſed to contradiction, was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked beyond bearing at the courage and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſpirit of his retainer. There was not a tenant upon his eſtate, or at leaſt not one of Hawkins's mediocrity of fortune, whom the general policy of land-owners, and ſtill more the arbitrary and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controulable temper of Mr. Tyrrel, did not effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally reſtrain from acts of open defiance.</p>
                     <p>Excellent, upon my ſoul! G—damn my blood! but you are a rare fellow. You have a leaſe, have you? You will not quit, not you! A pretty paſs things are come to, if a leaſe can protect ſuch fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows as you againſt the lord of a manor! But you are for a trial of ſkill, are you? Oh, very well, friend, very well! With all my ſoul! Since it is
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:028752_0060_0FDBEFA1646F4540"/>
come to that, we will ſhow you ſome pretty ſport before we have done! But get you out of my ſight, you raſcal! I have not another word to ſay to you! Never darken my doors again!</p>
                     <p>Hawkins, to borrow the language of the world, was guilty in this affair of a double imprudence. He talked to his landlord in a more peremptory manner than the conſtitution and practices of this country allow a dependent to aſſume. But above all, having been thus hurried away by his reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he ought to have foreſeen the conſequences. It was mere madneſs in him to think of conteſting with a man of Mr. Tyrrel's eminence and fortune. It was a fawn contending with a lion. Nothing could have been more eaſy to predict, than that it was of no avail for him to have right on his ſide, when his adverſary had influence and wealth, and therefore could ſo victoriouſly juſtify any extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies that he might think proper to commit. This maxim was completely illuſtrated in the ſequel. Wealth and deſpotiſm eaſily know how to engage thoſe laws, which were perhaps at firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended [witleſs and miſerable precaution!] for the ſafeguards of the poor, as the coadjutors of their oppreſſion.</p>
                     <p>From this moment Mr. Tyrrel was bent upon Hawkins's deſtruction; and he left no means un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>employed that could either haraſs or injure the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his perſecution. He deprived him of his appointment of bailiff, and directed Barnes and his other dependents to do him ill offices upon all occaſions. Mr. Tyrrel by the tenure of his manor was impropriator of the great tithes, and this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance afforded him frequent opportunities of petty altercation. The land of one part of Haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins's farm, though covered with corn, was lower than the reſt; and conſequently expoſed to occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional inundations from a river by which it was
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:028752_0061_0FDBEFDFE2AAD8F0"/>
bounded. Mr. Tyrrel had a dam belonging to this river privately cut about a fortnight before the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of harveſt, and laid the whole under water. He ordered his ſervants to pull away the fences of the higher ground during the night, and to turn in his cattle to the utter deſtruction of the crop. Theſe expedients however applied to only one part of the property of this unfortunate man. But Mr. Tyrrel did not ſtop here. A ſudden morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity took place among Hawkins's live ſtock, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with very ſuſpicious circumſtances. Haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins's vigilance was ſtrongly excited by this event, and he at length ſucceeded in tracing the matter ſo accurately that he conceived he could bring it home to Mr. Tyrrel himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Hawkins had hitherto carefully avoided, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the injuries he had ſuffered, attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to right himſelf by a legal proceſs, being of opinion that law was better adapted for a weapon of tyranny in the hands of the rich, than for a ſhield to protect the humbler part of the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity againſt their uſurpations. In this laſt inſtance however he conceived that the offence was ſo atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious as to make it impoſſible that any rank could protect the culprit againſt the ſeverity of juſtice. In the ſequel he ſaw reaſon to applaud himſelf for his former inactivity in this reſpect, and to repent that any motive had been ſtrong enough to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade him into a contrary ſyſtem.</p>
                     <p>This was the very point to which Mr. Tyrrel wanted to bring him, and he could ſcarcely credit his good fortune, when he was told that Hawkins had entered an action. His congratulation upon this occaſion was immoderate, as he now conceived that the ruin of his late favourite was irretrievable. He conſulted his attorney, and urged him by every motive he could deviſe to employ the whole ſeries of his ſubterfuges in the preſent affair. The direct re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:028752_0062_0FDBEFA46536A450"/>
of the charge exhibited againſt him was the leaſt part of his care; the buſineſs was, by affida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vits, motions, pleas, demurrers, flaws and appeals, to protract the queſtion from term to term and from court to court. It would, as Mr. Tyrrel ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued, be the diſgrace of a civilized country, if a gentleman, when inſolently attacked in law by the ſcum of the earth, could not convert the cauſe into a queſtion of the longeſt purſe, and ſtick in the ſkirts of his adverſary till he had reduced him to beggary.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Tyrrel however was by no means ſo far en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed by his law-ſuit, as to neglect other methods of proceeding offenſively againſt his tenant. Among the various expedients that ſuggeſted themſelves there was one, which, though it tended rather to torment than irreparably injure the ſufferer, was not rejected. This was derived from the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſituation of Hawkins's houſe, barns, ſtacks and out-houſes. Theſe were placed at the extremity of a ſtrip of land connecting them with the reſt of the farm, and were ſurrounded on three ſides by fields in the occupation of one of Mr Tyrrel's tenants moſt devoted to the pleaſures of the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord. The road to the market town ran at the bottom of the largeſt of theſe fields, and was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly in view of the front of the houſe. No in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience had yet ariſen from that circumſtance, as there had been a broad path time out of mind, that interſected this field, and led directly from Hawkins's houſe to the road. This path, or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate road, was now by concert of Mr. Tyrrel and his obliging tenant ſhut up, ſo as to make Hawkins a ſort of priſoner in his own domains, and oblige him to go near a mile about for the purpoſes of his traffic.</p>
                     <p>Young Hawkins, the lad who had been the original ſubject of diſpute between his father and
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:028752_0063_0FDBEFE5DA468448"/>
the ſquire, had much of his father's ſpirit, and felt an uncontroulable indignation againſt the ſucceſſive acts of deſpotiſm of which he was a witneſs. His reſentment of them was the greater, becauſe the ſufferings to which his parent was expoſed, all of them, flowed from affection to him, at the ſame time that he could not propoſe removing the ground of diſpute, as by ſo doing he would ſeem to fly in the face of his father's paternal kindneſs. Upon the preſent occaſion, without aſking any counſel but of his own impatient reſentment, he went in the middle of the night and removed all the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions that had been placed in the way of the old path, broke the padlocks that had been fixed, and threw open the gates. In theſe operations he did not proceed unobſerved, and the next day a warrant was iſſued for apprehending him. He was accordingly carried before a bench of juſtices, and by them committed to the county jail, to take his trial for the burglary at the next aſſizes.</p>
                     <p>This was the finiſhing ſtroke to Hawkins's mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries: as he was not deficient in courage, he had ſtood up againſt his other perſecutions without flinching. He was not unaware of the advantages which our laws and cuſtoms give to the rich over the poor in contentions of this kind. But, being once involved, there was a ſtubbornneſs in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that would not allow him to retract, and he ſuffered himſelf to hope rather than expect a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable iſſue. But in this laſt event he was wounded in the point that was neareſt his heart. He had feared to have his ſon contaminated and debaſed by a ſervile ſtation, and he now ſaw him transferred to the ſeminary of a jail. He was even uncertain as to the iſſue of his impriſonment, and trembled to think what the tyranny of wealth might effect to blaſt his hopes for ever.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="62" facs="unknown:028752_0064_0FDBEFA554090358"/>
From this moment his heart died within him. He had truſted to perſevering induſtry and ſkill to ſave the wreck of his little property from the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar ſpite of his landlord. But he had now no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger any ſpirit to exert thoſe efforts which his ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation more than ever required. Mr. Tyrrel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded without remiſſion in his machinations; Hawkins's affairs every day grew more deſperate; and the ſquire, watching the occaſion, took the earlieſt opportunity of ſeizing upon his remaining property in the mode of a diſtreſs for rent.</p>
                     <p>It was preciſely in this ſtage of the affair that Mr. Falkland and Mr. Tyrrel accidentally met in a private road near the habitation of the latter. They were on horſeback, and Mr. Falkland was going to the houſe of the unfortunate tenant who ſeemed upon the point of periſhing under his land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord's malice. He had been juſt made acquainted with the tale of this perſecution. It had indeed been an additional aggravation of Hawkins's cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity that Mr. Falkland, whoſe interference might otherwiſe have ſaved him, had been abſent from the neighbourhood for a conſiderable time. He had been three months in London, and from thence had gone to viſit his eſtates in another part of the iſland. The proud and ſelf-confident ſpirit of this poor fellow always diſpoſed him to depend as long as poſſible upon his own exertions. He had avoided applying to Mr. Falkland, or indeed indulging himſelf in any manner in communicating and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing his hard hap, in the beginning of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; and, when the extremity grew more urgent, and he would have been willing to recede in ſome degree from the ſtubbornneſs of his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, he found it no longer in his power. After an abſence of conſiderable duration Mr. Falkland at length returned ſomewhat unexpectedly; and, having learned among the firſt articles of country
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:028752_0065_0FDBEFE6972AAA00"/>
intelligence the diſtreſſes of this unfortunate yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e reſolved to ride over to his houſe the next morning, and ſurprize him with all the relief it was in his power to beſtow.</p>
                     <p>At ſight of Mr. Tyrrel in this unexpected ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, his face reddened with indignation. His firſt feeling, as he afterwards ſaid, was to avoid him; but, finding that he muſt paſs him, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that it would be a want of ſpirit and deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of duty not to acquaint him with his feelings on the preſent occaſion.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Tyrrel, ſaid he ſomewhat abruptly, I am ſorry for a piece of news which it has juſt been my fortune to hear.</p>
                     <p>Well, ſir, and what is that? What have I to do with your ſorrow?</p>
                     <p>A great deal, ſir. It is cauſed by the diſtreſſes of a poor tenant of your's, Hawkins. If your ſteward have proceeded without your authority, I think it right to inform you of what he has done; and, if he has had your authority, I would gladly perſuade you to think better of it.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Falkland, it would be quite as well if you would mind your own buſineſs, and leave me to mind mine. I want no monitor, and I will have none.</p>
                     <p>You miſtake, Mr. Tyrrel; I am minding my own buſineſs. If I ſee you fall into a pit, it is my buſineſs to draw you out, and ſave your life. If I ſee you purſuing a wrong line of conduct, it is my buſineſs to ſet you right and ſave your honour.</p>
                     <p>Zounds, ſir, do not think to put any of your conundrums upon me! Is not the man my tenant? Is not my eſtate my own? What ſignifies calling it mine, if I am not to have the direction of it? Sir, I pay for what I have; I owe no man a penny; and I will not put my eſtate to nurſe to you, nor the beſt he that wears a head.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="64" facs="unknown:028752_0066_0FDBEFA6D4C254C0"/>
Mr. Tyrrel, I do not diſpute your authority; I do not deſire to dictate to you; I ſimply wiſh to do you a good office.</p>
                     <p>Do not deſire to dictate! no, nor you ſhall not, ſir. How dare you attempt to ſtop me upon the king's highway!</p>
                     <p>Sir, I know that you bear me no good will. I am but an ill mediator in this caſe, and ſhould not have ſought you. But, thus thruſt by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in your way, I muſt have leave to tell you my thoughts.</p>
                     <p>True, ſir, I hate you. And what I hate you moſt for is this damned impertinence of pretending to be wiſer than every body elſe. Is not this a free country, and may not every body do as he likes?</p>
                     <p>Mr. Tyrrel, I know your humour, and will bear as much as I can. What do you mean, ſir, by a free country? I put no compulſion upon you. There is room enough; ride by me, if you pleaſe! Sir, I defy you not to hear me, while I tell you coolly and firmly, you are greatly to blame, and muſt change your mode of proceeding!</p>
                     <p>This is very extraordinary uſage! Sir, I am not to blame. You know nothing about the matter. Do you think I will let a paltry fellow like this Hawkins inſult me for nothing? Damn my ſoul, if I will not have the heart's blood of him!</p>
                     <p>It is very true, Mr. Tyrrel, that there is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of ranks. I believe that diſtinction to be a good thing. But, however neceſſary it may be, we muſt acknowledge that it puts ſome hardſhips upon the lower orders of ſociety. It makes one's heart ache to think that one man is born to the inherit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of every ſuperfluity, while the whole ſhare of another, without any demerit of his, is drud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery and ſtarving; and that all this is indiſpenſable. We that are rich, Mr. Tyrrel, muſt do every thing in our power to lighten the yoke of theſe unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:028752_0067_0FDBEFECD798A640"/>
people. We muſt not uſe the advantage that accident has given us, with an unmerciful hand. Poor wretches! they are preſſed almoſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond bearing as it is; and if we unfeelingly give another turn to the machine, they will be cruſhed into atoms.</p>
                     <p>This picture was not without its effect even upon the obdurate mind of Mr. Tyrrel.—Well, ſir, I am no tyrant. I know very well that tyranny is a bad thing. But you do not infer from thence that theſe people are to do as they pleaſe, and never to meet with their deſerts?</p>
                     <p>Mr. Tyrrel, I ſee that you are ſhaken in your animoſity. Suffer me to hail the new-born bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence of your nature. Go with me to Hawkins. Do not let us talk of his deſerts! poor fellow! he has ſuffered almoſt all that human nature can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure. Let your forgiveneſs upon this occaſion be the earneſt of good neighbourhood and friendſhip between you and me.</p>
                     <p>No, ſir, I will not go. I own there is ſomething in what you ſay. I always knew you had the wit to make good your own ſtory, and tell a plauſible tale. But I will not be come over thus. It has always been my character, when I had once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a ſcheme of vengeance never to forego it; and I will not change that character. I took up Hawkins when every body forſook him, and made a man of him; and the ungrateful raſcal has only inſulted me for my pains. Curſe me, if ever I forgive him! It would be a good jeſt indeed, if I were to forgive the inſolence of my own creature, at the deſire of a man like you that has been my perpetual plague.</p>
                     <p>For God's ſake, Mr. Tyrrel, have ſome reaſon in your reſentment! Let us ſuppoſe that Hawkins has behaved unjuſtifiably, and inſulted you. Is that an offence that can never be expiated? Muſt
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:028752_0068_0FDBEFAD0291A760"/>
the father be ruined, and the ſon hanged, to glut your reſentment?</p>
                     <p>Damn me, ſir, but you may talk your heart out; you ſhall get nothing of me. I ſhall never forgive myſelf for having liſtened to you for a moment. I will ſuffer nobody to ſtop the ſtream of my reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; if I ever were to forgive him, it ſhould be at nobody's intreaty but my own. But, ſir, I never will. If he and all his family were at my feet, I would order them all to be hanged the next minute, if my power were as good as my will.</p>
                     <p>Very well, ſir, I have done. I have only to tell you beforehand that ſuch tyranny as your's will make you the univerſal abhorrence of mankind. You may hug yourſelf in your wealth and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but be ſure the genuine ſenſe of the world will pierce through all your intrenchments, and fully avenge thoſe for whoſe blood you ſo cruelly thirſt. Good day to you.</p>
                     <p>Such was the conference of Mr. Falkland and Mr. Tyrrel reſpecting this odious tranſaction. In one part it ſeemed to promiſe a more favourable iſſue. But the rooted depravity of the one, and perhaps the haughty impatience of the other, ſoon put an end to this agreeable proſpect. For Mr. Tyrrel, the averſion he entertained for his accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed neighbour hourly increaſed. It ſeemed as if, the more inconteſtibly his excellencies diſplayed themſelves, the more bitter and inexpiable was the abhorrence he conceived for him. Having ſet out with contempt, and perſuaded himſelf of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable injuſtice of thoſe by whom Mr. Falk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land was eſteemed, he was probably anxious to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the evidence of his worth; and, as that evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence went on to increaſe, the ſtruggle became more painful, and the ſituation more excruciating. In this reſpect the ſtate of Mr. Tyrrel's mind was perhaps peculiarly critical; and, if we ſhould allow
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:028752_0069_0FDBEFEED31139C0"/>
ourſelves to judge from the appearances exhibited in the preſent caſe, we ſhould be apt to lay it down as a ſort of general maxim, that the greateſt cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal, when he perpetrates the moſt atrocious act, is upon the very eve of yielding to the energy of truth, and relinquiſhing for ever his odious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Falkland departed from this conference with a confirmed diſapprobation of the conduct of his neighbour, and an unalterable reſolution to do every thing in his power to relieve the diſtreſſes of Hawkins. But he was too late. When he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, he found the houſe already evacuated by its maſter. The family was removed nobody knew whither; Hawkins was abſconded; and, what was ſtill more extraordinary, the boy Hawkins had eſcaped on the very ſame day from the county jail. The enquiries Mr. Falkland ſet on foot after them were fruitleſs; no traces could be found of the cataſtrophe of theſe unhappy people. That cataſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trophe I ſhall have occaſion ſhortly to relate; and it will be found pregnant with horror, beyond what the blackeſt miſanthropy could readily have ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted.</p>
                     <p>I go on with my tale. I go on to relate thoſe incidents in which my own fate was ſo myſteriouſly involved. The temper of Mr. Tyrrel, ſoured with perpetual diſappointment, became every day more peeviſh, arrogant and moroſe. The reader has ſeen what it was in the commencement. But every thing has its limits beyond which it can aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment no farther. I lift the curtain, and bring for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the laſt act of the tragedy.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. VII.</head>
                     <p>THE vices of Mr. Tyrrel, in their preſent ſtate of augmentation, were peculiarly exerciſed upon his domeſtics and dependents. But the principal ſufferer was Miſs Emily Melvile, the orphan daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his father's ſiſter. Miſs Melvile's mother had married unfortunately, or rather imprudently, againſt the conſent of her relations, all of whom had agreed to withdraw their countenance from her in conſequence of that precipitate ſtep. Her huſband had turned out to be no better than an adventurer; had ſpent her fortune, which in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of the irreconcilableneſs of her family was leſs than he expected, and broken her heart. Her infant daughter was left without any reſource upon the wide world. In this ſituation the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the people with whom ſhe happened to be placed prevailed upon Mrs. Tyrrel, the mother of the ſquire, to receive her into her family. In equity perhaps ſhe was entitled to that portion of fortune which her mother had for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eited by her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence, and which had gone to ſwell the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the male repreſentative. But this idea had never entered into the conceptions of either mother or ſon. Mrs. Tyrrel conceived that ſhe performed an act of the moſt exalted benevolence in admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Miſs Emily into a ſort of amphibious ſituation, which was neither preciſely that of a domeſtic, nor yet marked with the treatment that might ſeem due to one of the family.</p>
                     <p>She had not however at firſt been ſenſible of all the mortifications that might have been expected
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:028752_0071_0FDBEFF469267838"/>
from her condition. Mrs. Tyrrel, though proud and imperious, was not ill-natured. The female, who lived in the family in the capacity of houſe-keeper, was a perſon who had ſeen better days, and whoſe diſpoſition was extremely upright and amiable. She early contracted a friendſhip for the little Emily, who was indeed for the moſt part committed to her care. Emily on her ſide fully repaid the affection of her inſtructreſs, and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with great docility the little accompliſhments Mrs. Jakeman was able to communicate. But moſt of all ſhe imbibed her chearful and artleſs temper, that extracted the agreeable and encouraging from all events, and prompted her to communicate her ſentiments, which were never of the cynical caſt, without modification or diſguiſe. Beſide the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages Emily derived from Mrs. Jakeman, ſhe was permitted to take leſſons from the maſters who came to Tyrrel Place for the inſtruction of her couſin; and, indeed, as the young gentleman was moſt frequently indiſpoſed to attend to them, they would commonly have had nothing to do, had it not been for the fortunate preſence of Miſs Melvile. Mrs. Tyrrel therefore encouraged the ſtudies of Emily on that ſcore; in addition to which ſhe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined that this living exhibition of inſtruction might operate as an indirect allurement to her dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Barnabas, the only ſpecies of motive ſhe would ſuffer to be preſented.</p>
                     <p>Emily, as ſhe grew up, diſplayed an uncommon degree of ſenſibility, which under her circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces would have been a ſource of perpetual diſſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, had it not been qualified with an extreme ſweetneſs and eaſineſs of temper. She was far from being entitled to the appellation of a beauty. Her perſon was <hi>petite</hi> and trivial; her complexion favoured of the <hi>brunette;</hi> and her face was marked with the ſmall pox, ſufficiently to deſtroy its even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:028752_0072_0FDBEFB1F73A2348"/>
and poliſh, though not enough to annihilate its expreſſion. But, though her appearance was not beautiful, it did not fail to be in a high degree engaging. Her complexion was at once healthful and delicate; her long dark eye-brows adapted themſelves with facility to the various conceptions of her mind; and her looks bore the united im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of an active diſcernment and a good-hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured frankneſs. The inſtruction ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, as it was entirely of a caſual nature, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted her from the evils of untutored ignorance, but not from a ſort of native wildneſs, arguing a mind incapable of guile itſelf, or of ſuſpecting it in others. She amuſed, without ſeeming conſcious of the refined ſenſe which her obſervations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained: or rather having never been debauched with applauſe, ſhe ſet light by her own qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and talked from the pure gaiety of a youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful heart acting upon the ſtores of a juſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and not with any expectation of being diſtinguiſhed and admired.</p>
                     <p>The death of her aunt made very little change in her ſituation. This prudent lady, who would have thought it little leſs than ſacrilege to have conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed miſs Melvile as a branch of the ſtock of the Tyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, took no other notice of her in her will, than barely putting her down for a hundred pounds in a catalogue of legacies to her ſervants. She had never been admitted into the intimacy and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Mrs. Tyrrel; and the young ſquire, now that ſhe was left under his ſole protection, ſeemed inclined to treat her with even more liberality than his mother had done. He had ſeen her grow up under his eye, and therefore, though there were but ſix years difference between their ages, he felt a kind of paternal intereſt in her welfare. Habit had rendered her in a manner neceſſary to him, and in every receſs from the occupations of the
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:028752_0073_0FDBEFF654298F60"/>
field and the pleaſures of the table, he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſolitary and forlorn without the ſociety of miſs Melvile. Nearneſs of kindred and Emily's want of perſonal beauty prevented him from ever look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on her with the eyes of deſire. Her accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments were chiefly of the cuſtomary and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial kind, dancing and muſic. Her ſkill in the firſt led him ſometimes to indulge her with a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant corner in his carriage when he went to the neighbouring aſſembly; and, in whatever light he might himſelf think proper to regard her, he would have imagined his chambermaid, introduced by him, entitled to an undoubted place in the moſt ſplendid circle. Her muſical talents were frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly employed for his amuſement. She had the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour occaſionally of playing him to ſleep after the fatigues of the chace; and as he had ſome reliſh for harmonious ſounds, ſhe was frequently able to ſoothe him by their means from the perturbations of which his gloomy diſpoſition was ſo eminently a ſlave. Upon the whole ſhe might be conſidered as in ſome ſort his favourite. She was the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to whom his tenants and domeſtics, when they had incurred his diſpleaſure, were accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to apply; the privileged companion that could handle this lion with impunity in the midſt of his roarings. She ſpoke to him without fear; her ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitations were always good-natured and diſinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted; and when he repulſed her, he diſarmed himſelf of half his terrors, and was contented to ſmile at her preſumption.</p>
                     <p>Such had been for ſome years the ſituation of Miſs Melvile. Its precariouſneſs had been beguil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by the chearfulneſs of her own temper, and the uncommon forbearance with which ſhe was treated by her ſavage protector. But his diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, always brutal, had acquired a new degree of ferocity ſince the ſettlement of Mr. Falkland in his
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:028752_0074_0FDBEFB3941C1628"/>
neighbourhood. He occaſionally forgot the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with which he had been accuſtomed to treat his good-natured couſin. Her little playful arts were not always ſucceſsful in ſoftening his rage; and he would ſometimes turn upon her blandiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with an impatient ſternneſs that made her tremble. The careleſs eaſe of her diſpoſition how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſoon effaced theſe impreſſions, and ſhe fell without variation into her old habits.</p>
                     <p>A circumſtance occurred about this time which put an end to the felicity, that miſs Melvile in ſpite of the frowns of fortune had hitherto enjoyed. Emily was exactly ſeventeen when Mr. Falkland returned from the Continent. At this age ſhe was peculiarly ſuſceptible of the charms of beauty, grace and moral excellence, when united in a perſon of the other ſex. She was imprudent, preciſely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe her own heart was incapable of guile. She had never yet felt the ſting of the poverty to which ſhe was condemned, and had not reflected on the inſuperable diſtance that fortune has placed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the opulent and the poorer claſſes of the community. She beheld Mr. Falkland, whenever he was thrown in her way at any of the public meetings with admiration; and, without having preciſely explained to herſelf the ſentiments ſhe indulged, her eyes followed him through all the changes of the ſcene with eagerneſs and impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. She did not ſee him, as the reſt of the aſſembly did, born to one of the ampleſt eſtates in the county, and qualified to aſſert his title to the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt heireſs. She thought only of Falkland, with thoſe advantages which were moſt intimately his own, and of which no perſecution of adverſe fortune had the ability to deprive him. In a word ſhe was tranſported when he was preſent; he was the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual ſubject of her reveries and her dreams; but
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:028752_0075_0FDBEFFC11B003E0"/>
his image excited no ſentiment in her mind beyond that of the immediate pleaſure annexed to the idea.</p>
                     <p>The notice Mr. Falkland had taken of her in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn appeared ſufficiently encouraging to a mind ſo full of prepoſſeſſion as that of Emily. There was a particular complacency in his looks when direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards her. He had ſaid in a company, of which one of the perſons preſent repeated his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks to Miſs Melvile, that ſhe appeared to him amiable and intereſting, that he felt for her unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided and deſtitute ſituation, and that he ſhould have been glad to be more particular in his notice of her, had he not been apprehenſive of doing her a prejudice in the ſuſpicious mind of Mr. Tyrrel. All this ſhe treated as the raviſhing condeſcenſion of a ſuperior nature; for, if ſhe did not recollect with ſufficient aſſiduity his gifts of fortune, ſhe was on the other hand filled with reverence for his unrivalled accompliſhments. But, while ſhe thus ſeemingly diſclaimed all compariſon between Mr. Falkland and herſelf, ſhe probably cheriſhed a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed idea that ſome event was yet in the womb of fate which might reconcile things apparently the moſt incompatible. Fraught with theſe prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, the civilities that had once or twice oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred in the buſtle of a public circle, the reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her fan which ſhe had dropped, or the diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moding her of an empty tea-cup, made her heart palpitate, and gave birth to the wildeſt chimeras in her deluded imagination.</p>
                     <p>About this time an event happened that helped to give a preciſe determination to the fluctuations of Miſs Melvile's mind. One evening, a ſhort time after the death of Mr. Clare, Mr. Falkland had been to the houſe of his deceaſed friend in his quality of executor, and by ſome accidents of little intrinſic importance had been detained three or
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:028752_0076_0FDBD6C1F69C54D8"/>
four hours later than he intended. He did not ſet out upon his return till two o'clock in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. At this time, in a ſituation ſo remote from the metropolis, every thing is as ſilent as it would be in a region wholly uninhabited. The moon ſhone bright, and the objects around, being mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſtrong variations of light and ſhade at the ſame time that they were not diſtinctly ſeen, gave a kind of ſacred ſolemnity to the ſcene. Mr. Falk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land had taken Collins with him, the buſineſs to be ſettled at Mr. Clare's being in ſome reſpects ſimilar to that to which this faithful domeſtic had been accuſtomed in the routine of his ordinary ſervice. They had entered into ſome converſation, for Mr. Falkland was not then in the habit of obliging the perſons about him by formality and reſerve to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect who he was. The attractions of the ſcene made them break off the talk ſomewhat abruptly, that they might enjoy it without interruption. They had not rode far, before a hollow wind ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to riſe at a diſtance, and they could hear the hoarſe roarings of the ſea. Preſently the ſky on one ſide aſſumed the appearance of a reddiſh brown, and a ſudden angle in the road placed this phenomenon directly before them. As they proceeded it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came more diſtinct, and it was at length ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently viſible that it was occaſioned by a fire. Mr. Falkland put ſpurs to his horſe; and, as they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, the object preſented every inſtant a more tremendous appearance. The flames aſcended with fierceneſs; they embraced a large portion of the horizon; and, as they carried up along with them numerous little fragments of the materials that fed them, impregnated with fire, and of an extremely bright and luminous colour, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented no inadequate image of the eruption of a volcano.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="75" facs="unknown:028752_0077_0FDBF0002A609A30"/>
The flames proceeded from a village directly in their road. There were eight or ten houſes already on fire, and the whole ſeemed to be threatened with immediate deſtruction. The inhabitants were in the utmoſt conſternation, having had no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious experience of a ſimilar calamity. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed with haſte their moveables and furniture into the adjoining fields, the whole ſurface of which was heated to an uncommon degree. When any of them had effected this as far as it could be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted with ſafety, they were unable to conceive any farther remedy, but ſtood wringing their hands and contemplating the ravages of the fire in an agony of powerleſs deſpair. The water that could be procured in any mode practiſed in that place, was but as a drop contending with a whole element in arms. The wind in the mean time was riſing, and the flames ſpread with more and more ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Falkland contemplated this ſcene for a few minutes, as if ruminating with himſelf as to what could be done. He then directed ſome of the country people about him to pull down a houſe, next to one that was wholly on fire, but which it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was not yet touched. They ſeemed aſtoniſhed at a direction which implied a voluntary deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of property, and conſidered the taſk as too much in the heart of the danger to be undertaken. Obſerving that they were motionleſs, he diſmount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from his horſe, and called upon them in an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative voice to follow him. He aſcended the houſe in an inſtant, and preſently appeared upon the top of it as if in the midſt of the flames. Having, with the aſſiſtance of two or three of the perſons that followed him moſt cloſely, and who by this time had ſupplied themſelves with whatever tools came next to hand, looſened the ſupport of a ſtack of chimnies, he puſhed them headlong into
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:028752_0078_0FDBEFB8CC8830E0"/>
the midſt of the fire. He paſſed and repaſſed along the roof; and, having ſet people to work on all parts, deſcended in order to ſee what could be done in any other quarter.</p>
                     <p>At this moment an elderly woman burſt from the midſt of a houſe in flames. The utmoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation was painted in her looks; and, as ſoon as ſhe could recollect herſelf enough to have a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per idea of her ſituation, the ſubject of her anxiety ſeemed in an inſtant to be totally changed. Where is my child? cried ſhe, and caſt an anxious and piercing look among the ſurrounding crowd. Oh, ſhe is loſt! ſhe is in the midſt of the flames! Save her! ſave her! my child! She filled the air with heart-rending ſhrieks. She turned towards the houſe. The people that were near endeavoured to prevent her, but ſhe ſhook them off in a moment. She entered the paſſage; viewed the hideous ruin; and was then going to plunge into the blazing ſtair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe. Mr. Falkland ſeized her arm; it was Mrs. Jakeman. Stop! he cried, with a voice that ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more than human. Stay you here! I will ſeek, I will ſave her! He charged the attendants to detain Mrs. Jakeman; he enquired which was the apartment of Emily. Mrs. Jakeman was upon a viſit to a ſiſter who lived in the village, and had brought Emily along with her. Mr. Falkland aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended a neighbouring houſe; entered that in which Emily was, by a window in the roof; and in two minutes re-appeared with his lovely burthen in his arms. Having reſtored her to her affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate protector ſnatched from the immediate graſp of death, from which, if he had not, none would have delivered her, he returned to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer taſk. By his preſence of mind, by his inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable humanity and inceſſant exertions, he ſaved three-fourths of the village from deſtruction. The conflagration being at length abated, he ſought
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:028752_0079_0FDBF00253ACC228"/>
again Mrs. Jakeman and Emily. He diſplayed the tendereſt ſolicitude for the young lady's ſafety, and directed Collins to go with as much ſpeed as he could, and ſend his chariot to attend her. More than an hour elapſed in this interval. Miſs Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile had never ſeen ſo much of Mr. Falkland upon any former occaſion, and the ſpectacle of ſuch hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, delicacy, firmneſs and juſtice in the form of man, as he crowded into this ſmall ſpace, was both altogether new to her, and in the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree faſcinating.</p>
                     <p>Emily no ſooner arrived at the family manſion, than Mr. Tyrrel ran out to receive her. He had juſt heard of the melancholy accident that had taken place at the village, and was terrified for the ſafety of his good-humoured couſin. He diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe unpremeditated emotions which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to almoſt every individual of the human race. He was greatly ſhocked at the ſuſpicion that Emily might poſſibly have become the victim of a cataſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trophe which had thus broken out in the very dead of night. His ſenſations were of the moſt pleaſing ſort, when he folded her in his arms, and fearful apprehenſion was inſtantaneouſly converted into joyous certainty. Emily no ſooner entered the well-known roof, than ſhe forgot all ſhe had ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; her ſpirits were briſk, and her tongue inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant in deſcribing her danger and her deliverance. Mr. Tyrrel had formerly been tortured with the innocent eulogiums ſhe pronounced of Mr. Falk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. But theſe were tameneſs itſelf, compared with the rich and various eloquence that now flowed from her lips. She deſcribed his activity and his reſources, the promptitude with which every thing was conceived, and the cautious, but daring wiſdom with which it was executed. All was fairy-land and enchantment in the tenour of her artleſs tale; you ſaw a beneficent genius ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:028752_0080_0FDBEFBA529CA600"/>
and controuling the whole, but could have no notion of any human means by which his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes were effected.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Tyrrel liſtened for a while to theſe innocent effuſions with patience; he could even bear to hear the man applauded by whom he had juſt obtained ſo conſiderable a benefit. But the theme by am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plification became nauſeous, and he was at length obliged with ſome roughneſs to put an end to the tale. Probably upon recollection it appeared ſtill more inſolent and intolerable than while it was paſſing; the ſenſation of gratitude wore off, but the hyperbolical praiſe that had been beſtowed ſtill haunted his memory, and ſounded in his ear: Emily ſeemed to have entered into the confederacy that diſturbed his repoſe. As for the young lady herſelf, ſhe was wholly unconſcious of the offence that had been given, and upon every occaſion quoted Mr. Falkland as the model of elegant man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and true wiſdom. She was a total ſtranger to diſſimulation; and ſhe could not conceive that any body beheld the object of her admiration with leſs partiality than her inexperienced heart had enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. Meanwhile her artleſs love became more fervent than ever. She flattered herſelf that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs than a reciprocal paſſion could have prompted Mr. Falkland to the deſperate attempt of ſaving her from the flames; and ſhe truſted that this paſſion would ſpeedily burſt the barriers of ſilence, as well as induce the object of her affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to overlook her comparative unworthineſs.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Tyrrel endeavoured at firſt to check Miſs Melvile in her applauſes, and to convince her by various tokens that the ſubject was diſagreeable to him. Emily was accuſtomed to yield implicit and unreluctant obedience, and therefore it was not difficult to reſtrain her; but upon the very next occaſion her favourite topic would force its way to
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:028752_0081_0FDBF007D35A1DE8"/>
her lips. Her obedience was the acquieſcence of a frank and benevolent heart; but it was the moſt difficult thing in the world to inſpire her with fear. Conſcious herſelf that ſhe would not hurt a worm, ſhe could not conceive that any one would harbour cruelty and rancour againſt her. Her temper pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved her from obſtinate contention with the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons under whoſe protection ſhe was placed; and, as her compliance was unheſitating, ſhe had had no experience of a ſevere and rigorous treatment. As Mr. Tyrrel's objection to the very name of Falkland became more palpable and uniform, Miſs Melvile increaſed in her precaution. She would ſtop herſelf in the half-pronounced ſentences that were meant to his praiſe. This circumſtance had neceſſarily an ungracious effect; it was a cutting ſatire upon the imbecility of her kinſman. Upon theſe occaſions ſhe would ſometimes venture upon a good-humoured expoſtulation: Dear ſir! well, I wonder how you can be ſo ill-natured! I am ſure Mr. Falkland would do you any good office in the world: till ſhe was checked by ſome geſture of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience and fierceneſs.</p>
                     <p>At length ſhe wholly conquered her heedleſſneſs and inattention. But it was now too late. Mr. Tyrrel already ſuſpected the exiſtence of that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which ſhe had thoughtleſsly imbibed. His imagination, ingenious in torment, ſuggeſted to him all the different openings in converſation in which ſhe would have introduced the praiſe of Mr. Falkland, had ſhe not been placed under this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural reſtraint. Her preſent reſerve upon the ſubject was more inſufferable than even her former loquacity. All his kindneſs for this unhappy or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan gradually ſubſided. Her partiality for the man who of all others was moſt the object of his hatred, appeared to him as the laſt perſecution of a malicious deſtiny. He figured himſelf as about
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:028752_0082_0FDBEFBE8255F238"/>
to be deſerted by every creature in human form, all men under the influence of a fatal enchantment approving only what was ſophiſticated and arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial, and holding the rude and genuine offspring of nature in mortal antipathy. Impreſſed with theſe gloomy preſages, he ſaw miſs Melvile with no ſentiments but thoſe of rancorous abhorrence; and, accuſtomed as he was to the uncontrouled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence of all his propenſities, determined to wreak upon her a ſignal revenge.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. VIII.</head>
                     <p>MR. TYRREL conſulted his old confident re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the plan he ſhould purſue, who on his part felt no compunction upon the ſubject, nor had any idea that an inſignificant girl, without either wealth or beauty, ought to be allowed for a moment to ſtand in the way of the gratifications of a man of Mr. Tyrrel's importance. The firſt idea of her now-unrelenting kinſman was to thruſt her from his doors, and leave her to ſeek her bread in the wide world. But he was conſcious that this proceeding would involve him in conſiderable obloquy; and he at length fixed upon a ſcheme which, at the ſame time that he believed it would ſufficiently ſhelter his reputation, would much more certainly ſecure her mortification and puniſhment.</p>
                     <p>For this purpoſe he fixed upon a young man of twenty, the ſon of one Grimes, who occupied a ſmall farm the property of his confident. This fellow he reſolved to impoſe as a huſband on Miſs Melvile, who he ſhrewdly ſuſpected, guided by the tender ſentiments ſhe had unfortunately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived for Mr. Falkland, would liſten with reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to any matrimonial propoſal. Grimes he ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected as being in all reſpects the diametrical reverſe of Mr. Falkland. He was not preciſely a lad of vicious propenſities, but in an inconceivable degree booriſh and uncouth. His complexion was ſcarcely human; his features were coarſe, and ſtrangely diſcordant and disjointed from each other. His lips were thick, and the tone of his voice broad
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:028752_0084_0FDBEFBF99641770"/>
and unmodulated. His legs were of equal ſize from one end to the other, and his feet miſhapen and clumſy. He had nothing ſpiteful or malicious in his diſpoſition, but he was a total ſtranger to tenderneſs; he could not feel for thoſe refinements in others, of which he had no experience in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. He was an expert boxer; his inclination led him to ſuch amuſements as were moſt boiſterous; and he delighted in a ſort of manual ſarcaſm, which he could not conceive to be very injurious, as it left no traces behind it. His general manners were noiſy and obſtreperous; inattentive to others; and obſtinate and unyielding, not from any cruelty and ruggedneſs of temper, but from an incapacity to conceive thoſe finer feelings that make ſo large a part of the hiſtory of perſons who are caſt in a gentler mould.</p>
                     <p>Such was the uncouth and half-civiliſed animal which the induſtrious malice of Mr. Tyrrel fixed upon as moſt happily adapted to his purpoſe. Emily had hitherto been in an unuſual degree ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from the oppreſſion of deſpotiſm. Her happy inſignificance had ſerved her as a protection. No one thought it worth his while to fetter her with thoſe numerous petty reſtrictions, with which the daughters of opulence are commonly tormented. She had the wildneſs as well as the delicate frame of the bird that warbles unmoleſted in its native groves.</p>
                     <p>When therefore ſhe heard from her kinſman the propoſal of Mr. Grimes for a huſband, ſhe was for a moment ſilent with aſtoniſhment at ſo unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected a ſuggeſtion. But, as ſoon as ſhe recovered her ſpeech, ſhe replied: No, ſir, I thank you. Bleſs me! I do not want a huſband: I am but a child.</p>
                     <p>You are a woman! Are not you always han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kering after the men? It is high time you ſhould be ſettled.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="83" facs="unknown:028752_0085_0FDBF00E75AC3430"/>
Mr. Grimes is ſuch a ſtrange man. Why, I do not know what he is like! He is like for all the world a great huge porpuſs. No, I thank you! when I do have a huſband, it ſhall not be ſuch a man as Grimes neither.</p>
                     <p>Be ſilent! How dare you give your tongue ſuch unaccountable liberties?</p>
                     <p>Well, I wonder what I ſhould do with him. Why, it is like as if you ſhould give me your great rough water-dog, and bid me make him a ſilk cuſhion to lie on in my dreſſing-room. Beſide, ſir, Grimes is a common labouring man, and I am ſure I have always heard my aunt ſay that ours is a very great family.</p>
                     <p>It is a lie. Our family! Have you the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to think yourſelf one of our family?</p>
                     <p>Lord, ſir! was not your grandpapa my grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>papa? And how then can we be of a different family?</p>
                     <p>For a damned ſtrong reaſon. You are the daughter of a raſcally Scotchman, who ſpent every ſhilling of my aunt Hannah's fortune, and left you a beggar. You have got a hundred pounds, and Grimes's father promiſes to give him as much. How dare you look down upon your equals?</p>
                     <p>Nay, now, ſir, I am ſure I am not proud. But indeed and indeed, ſir, I can never love Mr. Grimes. Dear, dear! he is more like a cart-horſe than a huſband. I am very happy as I am. I love you, and I love Mrs. Jakeman: why ſhould I be married?</p>
                     <p>Ceaſe your prating! Grimes will be here this afternoon. Look that you behave well to him. If you do not, he will remember and repay when you leaſt like it.</p>
                     <p>Now, I am ſure, ſir, you—you are not in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="84" facs="unknown:028752_0086_0FDBEFC170723CA8"/>
Not in earneſt! Damn me but we will ſee that. I can tell what you would be at. You had rather be Mr. Falkland's miſs, than the wife of a plain downright yeoman. But I ſhall take care of you.—Aye, this comes of indulgence. You muſt be taken down, miſs. You muſt be taught the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between high-flown notions and realities. Mayhap you may take it a little in dudgeon or ſo. But never mind that. Pride always wants a little ſmarting. If you ſhould be brought to ſhame, it is I that ſhall bear all the blame of it.</p>
                     <p>The tone in which Mr. Tyrrel ſpoke was ſo different from any thing to which Miſs Melvile had been accuſtomed, that ſhe felt herſelf wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to determine what conſtruction to put upon it. Sometimes ſhe thought he had really formed a plan for impoſing upon her a condition, that ſhe could not bear ſo much as to think of. But pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſhe rejected this idea as an unworthy impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation upon her kinſman, and concluded that it was only his way, and that all he meant was to try her. To be reſolved however ſhe determined to conſult her conſtant adviſer, Mrs. Jakeman, and accordingly repeated to her what had paſſed. Mrs. Jakeman ſaw the whole in a very different light from that in which Emily had conceived it, and trembled for the future peace of her beloved ward.</p>
                     <p>Lord bleſs me, my dear mamma! cried Emily, (this was the appellation ſhe delighted to beſtow upon the good houſe-keeper) ſure you cannot think ſo. But I do not care. I will never marry Grimes let them do as they will.</p>
                     <p>But how will you help yourſelf? My maſter will oblige you.</p>
                     <p>Nay, now you think you are talking to a child indeed. It is I am to have the man, not Mr. Tyrrel. Do you think I will let any body elſe
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:028752_0087_0FDBF00FD4D0FEA8"/>
chooſe a huſband for me? I am not ſuch a fool as that neither.</p>
                     <p>Ah, Emily! you little know the diſadvantages of your ſituation. Your couſin is a violent man, and perhaps will turn you out of doors, if you oppoſe him.</p>
                     <p>Oh, mamma, it is very wicked of you to ſay ſo. I am ſure Mr. Tyrrel is a very good man, though he be a little croſs now and then. He knows very well that I am right to have a will of my own in ſuch a thing as this, and nobody is puniſhed for doing what is right.</p>
                     <p>Nobody ought, my dear child. But there are very wicked and tyrannical men in the world.</p>
                     <p>Well, well, I will never believe that my couſin is one of thoſe.</p>
                     <p>I hope he is not.</p>
                     <p>And, if he were, what then? To be ſure I ſhould be very ſorry to make him angry.</p>
                     <p>What then? Why then my poor, dear Emily would be a beggar. Do you think I could bear to ſee that?</p>
                     <p>No, no. Mr. Tyrrel has juſt told me that I have a hundred pounds. But, if I had no fortune at all, is not that the caſe with a thouſand other folks? Why ſhould I grieve, for what they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ear and are merry? Do not make yourſelf uneaſy, mamma. I am determined that I will do any thing rather than marry Grimes however; that is what I will.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Jakeman could not bear the uneaſy ſtate of ſuſpenſe in which this converſation left her mind, and went immediately to the ſquire to have her doubts reſolved. The manner in which ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the queſtion ſufficiently indicated the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhe had formed of the match in queſtion.</p>
                     <p>That is true, ſaid Mr. Tyrrel, I wanted to ſpeak to you about this affair. The girl has got unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:028752_0088_0FDBEFC2AC875678"/>
notions in her head, that will be the ruin of her. You perhaps can tell where ſhe had them. But, be that as it may, it is high time ſomething ſhould be done. The ſhorteſt way is the beſt, and to keep things well while they are well. In ſhort, I am determined ſhe ſhall marry this lad: you do not know any harm of him, do you? You have a good deal of influence with her, and I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, do you ſee! that you will employ it to lead her to her good: you had beſt, I can tell you. She is a pert vixen! By and by ſhe would be a whore, and at laſt no better than a common trull, and rot upon a dunghill, if I were not at all theſe pains to ſave her from deſtruction. I would make her an honeſt farmer's wife, and my pretty miſs cannot bear the thoughts of it!</p>
                     <p>In the afternoon Grimes came according to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, and was left alone with the young lady. Well, miſs, ſaid he, it ſeems the ſquire has a mind to make us man and wife. For my part, I cannot ſay I ſhould have thought of it. But, being as how the ſquire has broke the ice, if ſo be as you like of the match, why I am your man. Say the word; a nod is as good as a wink to a blind horſe; and then, do you ſee, why there is no more to be ſaid.</p>
                     <p>Emily was already ſufficiently mortified at the unexpected propoſal of Mr. Tyrrel. She was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded at the novelty of the ſituation, and ſtill more at the uncultivated rudeneſs of her lover, which even exceeded her expectation. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion was interpreted by Grimes into diffidence.</p>
                     <p>Come, come, never be caſt down. Put a good face upon it. What though? My firſt ſweetheart was Bet Butterfield, but what of that? What muſt be muſt be; grief will never fill the belly. She was a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

trooper. Oh, ſhe would do a power of work! Up early and down late; milked ten cows with her own hands; on with her cardinal, rode to market between her panniers, fair weather and foul, hail, blow or ſnow. It would have done your heart good to have ſeen her froſt-bitten cheeks, as red as a beefen from her own orchard! Ah, ſhe was a maid of mettle; would romp with the harveſt men, ſlap one upon the back, wreſtle with another, and had a rogue's trick and a joke for all round. Poor girl! ſhe broke her neck down ſtairs at a chriſtening. To be ſure I ſhall never meet with her fellow! But never you mind that! I do not doubt that I ſhall find more in you upon farther acquaintance. As coy and baſhful as you ſeem, I dare ſay you are rogue enough at bottom. When I have touzled and rumpled you a little, we ſhall ſee. I am no chicken, miſs, whatever you may think me. I know what is what, and can ſee as far into a milſtone as another. Ay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ay; you will come to. The fiſh will ſnap at the bait, never doubt it. Yes, yes, we ſhall rub on main well together.</p>
                     <p>Emily by this time had in ſome degree muſtered up her ſpirits, and began, though with heſitation, to thank Mr. Grimes for his good opinion, but to confeſs that ſhe could never be brought to favour his addreſſes. She therefore intreated him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt from all farther application. This remonſtrance on her part would have become more intelligible, had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

acquainted with each other's inclinations. Grimes of conſequence attributed all the reluctance of miſs Melvile to maiden coyneſs, and the ſkittiſh ſhyneſs of an unbroken colt. Indeed had it been other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, it is not probable that it would have made any effectual impreſſion upon him; as he was always accuſtomed to talk of women as made for the recreation of the men, and to exclaim againſt the ill-judged weakneſs of people who taught them to imagine that they were entitled to judge for themſelves.</p>
                     <p>As the ſuit proceeded and miſs Melvile ſaw more of her new admirer, her antipathy increaſed. But, though her character was unſpoiled by thoſe falſe wants which frequently make people of family miſerable while they have every thing that nature requires within their reach, yet ſhe had been little uſed to oppoſition, and was really terrified by the growing ſternneſs of her kinſman. Sometimes ſhe thought of flying from a houſe which was now become her dungeon; but the habits of her youth, and her ignorance of the world made her ſhrink from this project when ſhe contemplated it more nearly. Mrs. Jakeman indeed could not think with patience of young Grimes as a huſband for her darling Emily, but her prudence determined her to reſiſt with all her might the idea on the part of the young lady of proceeding to extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. She could not believe that Mr. Tyrrel would perſiſt in ſuch an unaccountable perſecution, and ſhe exhorted miſs Melvile to forget for a moment the unaffected independence of her character, and pathetically to deprecate Mr. Tyrrel's obſtinacy. She had great confidence in the ingenuous elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of her ward. Mrs. Jakeman did not know what was paſſing in the mind of the tyrant.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Melvile complied with the ſuggeſtion of her mamma. One morning immediately after break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:028752_0091_0FDBF017DB87C678"/>
ſhe went to the harpſichord, and played one after another ſeveral of thoſe airs that were moſt the favòurites of Mr. Tyrrel. Mrs. Jakeman was retired; the ſervants were gone to their reſpective employments. Mr. Tyrrel would have gone alſo; his mind was untuned, and he did not take the pleaſure he had been accuſtomed to take in the muſical performances of Emily. But her finger was now more taſteful than common. Her mind was probably wrought up to a firmer and bolder tone by the recollection of the cauſe ſhe was going to plead, at the ſame time that it was exempt from thoſe incapacitating tremors which would have been felt by one that dared not look poverty in the face. Mr. Tyrrel was unable to leave the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Sometimes he traverſed it with impatient ſtep; then he hung over the poor innocent whoſe powers were exerted to pleaſe him; at length he threw himſelf in a chair oppoſite, with his eyes turned towards Emily. It was eaſy to trace the progreſs of his emotions. The furrows into which his countenance was contracted were gradually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxed; his features were brightened into a ſmile; the kindneſs with which he had upon former occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions contemplated Emily ſeemed to revive in his heart.</p>
                     <p>Emily watched her opportunity. As ſoon as ſhe had finiſhed one of the pieces, ſhe roſe and went to Mr. Tyrrel.</p>
                     <p>Now have I not done it nicely? And after all this will not you give me a reward?</p>
                     <p>A reward! Ay, come here, and I will give you a kiſs.</p>
                     <p>Pooh! no, that is not it. And yet you have not kiſſed me this many a day. Formerly you ſaid you loved me, and called me your Emily. I am ſure you did not love me better than I loved you. You would not make me miſerable, would you?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="90" facs="unknown:028752_0092_0FDBEFC8DC5985C8"/>
Miſerable! how can you aſk ſuch a queſtion? But have a care! Do not put me out of humour. Do not come with any of your romantic notions now.</p>
                     <p>No, no. I had no romantic notions in my head. I want to ſpeak to you about ſomething upon which the happineſs of my life depends.</p>
                     <p>I know what you would be at. Be ſilent. You know it is to no purpoſe to plague me with your ſtubbornneſs. You will not let me be in good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour with you for a moment. What my mind is determined on about Grimes, all the world ſhall not move me to give up.</p>
                     <p>Dear, dear couſin, why do but conſider now. Grimes is a rough ruſtic lout, like Orſon in the ſtory-book. He wants a wife like himſelf. He would be as uneaſy and as much at a loſs with me, as I with him. Why ſhould we both of us be forced to do what neither of us is inclined to? I cannot think what could ever have put it in your head. But now, for goodneſs' ſake, give it up. Marriage is a ſerious thing. You ſhould not think of join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two people for a whim, who are neither of them fit for one another in any reſpect in the world. We ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>eel mortified and diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all our lives. Month would go after month, and year after year, and I could never hope to be my own but by the death of a perſon I ought to love. I am ſure, ſir, you cannot mean me all this harm. What have I done, that I ſhould deſerve to have you for this enemy?</p>
                     <p>I am not your enemy. I tell you that it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to put you out of harm's way. But, if I were your enemy, I could not be a worſe torment to you than you are to me. Are not you conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually ſinging the praiſes of Falkland? Are not you in love with Falkland? That man is a legion of devils to me! Plauſible and empty himſelf, he

I might as well have been a beggar! I might as well have been a dwarf or a monſter! Time was when I was thought entitled to reſpect. But now, debauched by this Frenchified raſcal, they call me rude, ſurly, brutal, a tyrant! It is true that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not talk in theſe finical phraſes, flatter people with hypocritical praiſe, or ſuppreſs the real feelings of my mind! The ſcoundrel knows all his pitiful ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, and inſults me upon them without cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. He is my rival and my perſecutor.

If I were your enemy, ſhould I not have reaſon? Could I ever inflict upon you ſuch injuries as you have made me ſuffer? And who are you? The lives of twenty ſuch as you cannot atone for an hour of my uneaſineſs. If you were to linger for twenty years upon the rack, you would never feel what I have felt. But I am your friend. I ſee which way you are going, and I am determined to ſave you from the thief, the hypocritical deſtroyer of us all. Every moment that the miſchief is left to itſelf it does but make bad worſe, and I am determined to ſave you out of hand.</p>
                     <p>The angry expoſtulations of Mr. Tyrrel ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed new ideas to the tender mind of miſs Melvile. He had never confeſſed the emotions of his ſoul ſo explicitly before; but the growing tempeſt of his thoughts ſuffered him to be no longer maſter of himſelf. She ſaw with aſtoniſhment that he was
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:028752_0094_0FDBEFCC5FDC3830"/>
the irreconcilable foe of Mr. Falkland, whom ſhe fondly imagined it was the ſame thing to know and admire; and that he harboured a deep and rooted reſentment againſt herſelf. She recoiled without well knowing why before the ferocious paſſions of her kinſman, and was convinced that ſhe had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to hope from his implacable temper. But her alarm was the prelude of firmneſs and not of cowardice.</p>
                     <p>No, ſir, replied ſhe, indeed I will not be driven any way that you happen to like. I have been uſed to obey you, and in any thing that is reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able I will obey you ſtill. But you urge me a little too far. Why do you tell me of Mr. Falkland? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Mr. Tyrrel was not a little aſtoniſhed at the ſpirit which Emily diſplayed upon this occaſion. He had calculated too ſecurely upon the general mildneſs and ſuavity of her diſpoſition. He now endeavoured to qualify the harſhneſs of his former ſentiments.</p>
                     <p>G—damn my ſoul! And ſo you can ſcold can you? You expect every body to turn out of his way, and fetch and carry, juſt as you pleaſe? I could find in my heart to break your heart. But you know my mind. I inſiſt upon it that you let Grimes court you, and that you lay aſide your ſulks, and give him a fair hearing. Will you do that? If then you perſiſt in your wilfulneſs, why there, I ſuppoſe, is an end of the matter. Do not think that any body is going to marry you, whether you will or no. You are no ſuch mighty prize, I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you. If you knew your own intereſt, you

would be glad to take the young fellow, while he is willing.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Melvile rejoiced in the proſpect which the laſt words of her kinſman afforded her, of a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination at no great diſtance to her preſent perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions. Mrs. Jakeman, to whom ſhe communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated them, congratulated Emily on the returning moderation and good ſenſe of the ſquire, and her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on her prudence in having urged the young lady to this happy expoſtulation. But their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual felicitations laſted not long. Mr. Tyrrel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Mrs. Jakeman of the neceſſity in which he found himſelf of ſending her to a diſtance upon a buſineſs which would not fail to detain her ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral weeks; and, though the errand by no means wore an artificial or ambiguous face, the two friends drew a melancholy preſage from this ill-timed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration. Mrs. Jakeman in the mean time exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her ward to perſevere, reminded her of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction which had already been manifeſted by her kinſman, and encouraged her to hope every thing from her courage and good temper. Emily on her part, though grieved at the abſence of her protector and counſellor at ſo intereſting a criſis, was unable to ſuſpect Mr. Tyrrel of ſuch a degree either of malice or duplicity as could afford ground for ſerious alarm. She congratulated herſelf upon her delivery from ſo alarming a perſecution, and drew a prognoſtic of future ſucceſs from this happy termination of the firſt ſerious affair of her life. She exchanged a ſtate of fortitude and alarm for her former pleaſing dreams reſpecting Mr. Falk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. Theſe ſhe bore without impatience. She was even taught by the uncertainty of the event to deſire to prolong rather than abridge a ſituation, which might be deluſive, but was not without its pleaſures.</p>

                     <p>NOTHING could be farther from Mr. Tyrrel's intention than to ſuffer his project to be thus ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated. No ſooner was he wholly freed from the fear of his houſekeeper's interference, than he changed the whole ſyſtem of his conduct. He ordered Miſs Melvile to be cloſely confined to her own apartment, and deprived of all the means of communicating her ſituation to any one out of his own houſe. He placed over her a female ſervant in whoſe diſcretion he could confide, and who, having formerly been honoured with ſome amorous notices from the ſquire, conſidered the diſtinctions that were paid to Emily at Tyrrel Place as an uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation upon her more reaſonable claims. The ſquire himſelf did every thing in his power to blaſt the young lady's reputation, and repreſented to his attendants all theſe precautions as neceſſary, to prevent her from eloping to his neighbour, and plunging herſelf in total ruin.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as Miſs Melvile had been twenty-four hours in durance, and there was ſome reaſon to ſuppoſe that her ſpirit might be ſubdued to the emergency of her ſituation, Mr. Tyrrel thought proper to go to her, to explain the grounds of her preſent treatment, and acquaint her with the only means by which ſhe could hope for any change. Emily no ſooner ſaw him, than ſhe turned towards him with an air of greater firmneſs than perhaps ſhe had ever aſſumed in her life, and accoſted him thus:</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="95" facs="unknown:028752_0097_0FDBF021D3C43228"/>
Well, ſir, is it you? I wanted to ſee you. It ſeems I am ſhut up here by your orders? What does this mean? What right have you to make a priſoner of me? What do I owe you? Your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther left me a hundred pounds: have you ever offered to make any addition to my fortune? But, if you had, I do not want it I do not pretend to be better than the children of other poor parents; I can maintain myſelf as they do I prefer liberty to wealth. I ſee you are ſurpriſed at the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I exert. But ought I not to turn again, when I am trampled upon? I ſhould have left you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now, if Mrs. Jakeman had not overperſuaded me, and if I had not thought better of you than by your preſent behaviour I find you deſerve. But now, ſir, I intend to leave your houſe this moment, and I inſiſt upon it that you do not endeavour to prevent me.</p>
                     <p>Thus ſaying, ſhe aroſe, and went towards the door, while Mr. Tyrrel ſtood thunderſtruck at her magnanimity. Seeing however that ſhe was upon the point of being out of the reach of his power, he recovered himſelf, and pulled her back.</p>
                     <p>What is in the wind now? Do you think, you naſty ſtrumpet, that you ſhall get the better of me by ſheer impudence? Sit down! reſt you ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied!—So you want to know by what right you are here, do you? By the right of poſſeſſion. This houſe is mine, and you are in my power. There is no Mrs. Jakeman now to ſpirit you away; no, nor no Mr. Falkland to bully for you. Damn me, I have countermined you, and blown up all your ſchemes. Do you think I want any other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="96" facs="unknown:028752_0098_0FDBF05E94724C78"/>
am not come to that neither.—I have not given you a fortune? Damn you, who brought you up? I will make you a bill for clothing and lodging. Do not you know that every creditor has a right to ſtop his runaway debtor? You may think as you pleaſe; but here you are till you marry Grimes. Heaven and earth ſhall not prevent but I will get the better of your obſtinacy yet.</p>
                     <p>Ungenerous, unmerciful man! and ſo it is enough for you that I have nobody to defend me! But I am not ſo helpleſs as you may imagine. You may impriſon my body, but you cannot conquer my mind. Marry Mr. Grimes! And is this the way to bring me to your purpoſe? Every hardſhip I ſuffer puts ſtill farther diſtant the end for which I am thus unjuſtly treated. You are not uſed to have your will contradicted! When did I ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict it? And in an affair that is ſo completely my own concern ſhall my will go for nothing? Are you not aſhamed of laying down this rule for yourſelf, and ſuffering no other creature to take the benefit of it? I want nothing of you; how dare you refuſe me the privilege of a reaſonable being, and deny me to live unmoleſted in poverty and innocence? What ſort of man do you ſhow yourſelf in this caſe, you who lay claim to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and applauſe of every one that knows you?</p>
                     <p>The ſpirited reproaches of Emily had at firſt the effect to fill Mr. Tyrrel with aſtoniſhment, and make him feel abaſhed and overawed in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of this unprotected innocent. But his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion was the reſult of ſurpriſe. When the firſt emotion wore off, his habitual paſſion returned. He curſed himſelf for an aſs in being moved be her expoſtulations, and was ten times more exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated againſt Emily for daring to talk to him in this provoking language, at a time when ſhe had every thing to fear from his power. His deſpotic
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:028752_0099_0FDBF027D8290730"/>
and unforgiving propenſities were ſtimulated to a degree little ſhort of madneſs. At the ſame time his manners, which were gloomy and thoughtful, led him to meditate a variety of ſchemes for the puniſhment of her obſtinacy. He began to ſuſpect that there was little hope of ſucceeding by open force; he therefore determined to have recourſe to treachery.</p>
                     <p>He found in Grimes an inſtrument ſufficiently adapted to his purpoſe. This fellow, who would not perhaps intentionally have hurt a worm, was fitted by the mere coarſeneſs of his perceptions for the perpetration of the greateſt injuries. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded both injury and advantage merely as they related to the gratifications of appetite; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered it as an eſſential part of true wiſdom to treat with contempt the effeminacy of thoſe who ſuffer themſelves to be tormented with ideal mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes. He conceived that no happier deſtiny could befal a young woman than to be his wife, and believed that that termination would be an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple compenſation for any calamines ſhe might ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe herſelf to undergo in the interval. He was therefore eaſily prevailed upon by certain tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which Mr. Tyrrel knew how to employ, to take a part in the plot into which Miſs Melvile was meant to be betrayed.</p>
                     <p>Matters being thus prepared, Mr. Tyrrel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded through the means of the jailor, (for the experience he had already had of perſonal diſcuſſion did not incline him to repeat his viſits) to play upon the fears of his priſoner. This woman, ſometimes under pretence of friendſhip, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with open malice, informed Emily from time to time of the preparations that were making for conſummating her fate. One day the ſquire had rode over to look at a neat little farm which was deſtined for the habitation of the new-married cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:028752_0100_0FDBD6D06D069898"/>
and at another a quantity of live ſtock and houſhold furniture was procured that every thing might be ready for their reception. She then told her of a licence that was bought, a parſon in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs, and a day fixed for the nuptials. When Emily endeavoured, though with increaſing miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings, to ridicule theſe proceedings as abſolutely nugatory without her conſent, her artful gouver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nante told her various ſtories of forced marriages, and aſſured her that neither proteſtations, nor ſilence, nor fainting would be of any avail, either to ſuſpend the ceremony, or to ſet it aſide when once performed.</p>
                     <p>The ſituation of Miſs Melvile was in an eminent degree pitiable. She had no intercourſe but with her perſecutors. She had not a human being with whom to conſult, and who might afford her the ſmalleſt degree of conſolation and encouragement. She had courage; but it was neither confirmed nor directed by the dictates of experience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It could not therefore be expected to be ſo inflexible as with better information it would no doubt have been found. She had a clear and noble ſpirit; but ſhe had ſome of her ſex's errors. Her mind ſunk un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the uniform terrors with which ſhe was aſſailed, and her health became viſibly impaired.</p>
                     <p>Her firmneſs being thus far undermined, Grimes, in purſuance of his inſtructions, took care in his next interview to throw out an inſinuation, that for his own part he never cared much for the match, and, ſince ſhe was ſo averſe to it, would be very well contented that it ſhould never take place. Emily was rejoiced to find her admirer in ſo favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a diſpoſition; and earneſtly preſſed him to give effect to this humane declaration. Her repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations to him on this ſubject were full of elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and energy. Grimes appeared to be moved at the fervency of her manner; but objected the
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:028752_0101_0FDBF07104D33EA8"/>
reſentment of Mr. Tyrrel and his landlord, who would infallibly ruin him upon the leaſt appearance of backwardneſs on his part, as poor Hawkins had been ruined before. At length however he ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted a project in conſequence of which he might aſſiſt her in her eſcape, without its ever coming to their knowledge, as indeed there was no likelihood their ſuſpicions in this caſe would fix upon him. To be ſure, ſaid he, you have refuſed me in a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainful ſort of a way, as a man may ſay. Mayhap you thought I was no better than a brute. But I bear you no malice, and I will ſhow you that I am more kind-hearted than you have been willing to believe. It is a ſtrange ſort of a vagary you have taken, to ſtand in your own light, and diſoblige all your friends. But, if you are reſolute to be off, do you ſee, I ſcorn to be the huſband of a laſs that is not every bit as willing as I; and ſo I will even help to put you in a condition to be free and follow your own inclinations.</p>
                     <p>Emily liſtened to theſe ſuggeſtions at firſt with eagerneſs and approbation. But her fervency was ſomewhat abated, when they came to diſcuſs the minute parts of the undertaking<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It was neceſſary, as Grimes informed her, that her eſcape ſhould be effected in the dead of the night. He would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal himſelf for that purpoſe in the garden, and be provided with falſe keys by which to deliver her from her priſon Theſe circumſtances were by no means adapted to calm her perturbed ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination. To throw herſelf into the arms of the man, whoſe intercourſe ſhe was employing every method to avoid, and whom under the idea of a partner for life ſhe could leaſt of all men endure, was no doubt an extraordinary proceeding. The attendant circumſtances of darkneſs and ſolitude aggravated the picture. The ſituation of Tyrrel Place was uncommonly lonely: it was three miles
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:028752_0102_0FDBF029593B59C0"/>
from the neareſt village, and no leſs than ſeven miles from that in which Mrs. Jakeman's ſiſter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided, into whoſe protection Miſs Melvile was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of throwing herſelf. The ingenuous cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Emily did not allow her to ſuſpect Grimes of intending to make an ungenerous and brutal ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of theſe circumſtances; but her mind in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntarily revolted againſt the idea of committing herſelf alone to the diſpoſal of a man whom ſhe had lately been accuſtomed to conſider as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of her treacherous relation.</p>
                     <p>After having for ſome time revolved theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, ſhe thought of the expedient of deſiring Grimes to engage Mrs. Jakeman's ſiſter to wait for her at the outſide of the garden. But this Grimes peremptorily refuſed. He even flew into a paſſion at the propoſal. It ſhowed very little gratitude, to deſire him to diſcloſe to other people his concern in this dangerous affair. For his part he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in conſideration of his own ſafety never to appear in it to any living ſoul. If Miſs did not believe him, when he made this propoſal out of pure good nature, and would not truſt him, a ſingle inch, ſhe might even ſee to the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences herſelf. He was reſolved to condeſcend no farther to the whims of a perſon who in her treatment of him had ſhown herſelf as proud as Lucifer himſelf.</p>

She deſired till the next day to conſider of it. The day after was fixed by Mr. Tyrrel for the marriage ceremony. In the mean time ſhe was peſtered with intimations in a thouſand dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent forms of the fate that ſo nearly awaited her. The preparations were ſo continued, methodical and regular, as to produce in her the moſt painful
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:028752_0103_0FDBF0721303FF08"/>
and aching anxiety. If her heart attained a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's intermiſſion upon the ſubject, her female attendant was ſure by ſome ſly hint or ſarcaſtical remark to put a ſpeedy termination to her tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity. She felt herſelf, as ſhe afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked, alone, uninſtructed, juſt broken looſe as it were from the trammels of infancy, without one ſingle creature to concern himſelf in her fate. She, who till then had never known <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n enemy, had now for three weeks not ſeen the glimpſe of a human countenance that ſhe had not good reaſon to conſider as wholly eſtranged to her. She now for the firſt time experienced the anguiſh of never having known her parents, and being caſt entirely upon the charity of people with whom ſhe had too little equality to hope to receive from them the dues of friendſhip.</p>
                     <p>The ſucceeding night was filled with the moſt anxious thoughts. When a momentary oblivion ſtole upon her ſenſes, her diſtempered imagination conjured up a thouſand images of violence and falſhood, ſhe ſaw herſelf in the hands of her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined enemies, who did not heſitate by the moſt unintermitted treachery to complete her ruin. Her waking thoughts were not more conſoling. The ſtruggle was too great for her conſtitution. As morning approached, ſhe reſolved at all hazards to put herſelf into the hands of Grimes. This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination was no ſooner made, than ſhe felt her heart ſenſibly lightened. She could not conceive of any purpoſes of injuſtice that might not be perpetrated by him with even more ſecurity at preſent than under any change of her ſituation.</p>
                     <p>When ſhe communicated her determination to Grimes, it was not poſſible to ſay whether he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived pleaſure or pain from the intimation. He ſmiled indeed, but his ſmile was accompanied by a certain abrupt ruggedneſs of countenance, ſo that
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:028752_0104_0FDBF02F427739C0"/>
it might equally well be the ſmile of ſarcaſm or of congratulation. He however renewed his aſſurance of fidelity to his engagements and punctuality of execution. Meanwhile the day was interſperſed with nuptial preſents and preparations, all indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating the firmneſs as well as ſecurity of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors of the ſcene. Emily had hoped that, as the criſis approached, they might have remitted ſomething of their uſual diligence. She was reſolved in that caſe, if a fair opportunity had offered, to give the ſlip both to her jailors, and to her new and half truſted confederate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But, though extremely vigilant for that purpoſe, ſhe found the execution of this idea impracticable.</p>
                     <p>At length the night ſo critical to her happineſs approached. The mind of Emily could not fail on this occaſion to be extremely agitated. She had firſt exerted all her perſpicacity to elude the vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of her attendant. This inſolent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeling tyrant, inſtead of any relentings, had only ſought to make ſport of her anxiety. Accordingly in one inſtance ſhe hid herſelf, and, ſuffering Emily to ſuppoſe that the coaſt was clear, met her at the end of the gallery, near the top of the ſtair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe. How do you do, my dear? ſaid ſhe, with an inſulting tone. And ſo the little dear thought itſelf cunning enough to outwit me, did it? Oh, it was a ſly little gipſey! Go, go back, love; troop! Emily felt deeply the trick that was played upon her. She ſighed, but diſdained to return any anſwer to this low vulgarity. Being once more in her chamber, ſhe ſat down in a chair, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained buried in reverie for more than two hours. After this ſhe went to her drawers, and turned over in a hurrying, confuſed way her linen and clothes, having in her mind the proviſion it would be neceſſary to make for her elopement. Her jailor officiouſly followed her from place to place
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:028752_0105_0FDBF07395822250"/>
and obſerved what ſhe did for the preſent in ſilence. It was now the hour of reſt. Good night, child, ſaid this ſaucy girl, in the act of retiring. It is time to lock up. For the few next hours the time is your own. Make the beſt uſe of it! Do'ee think you can creep out at the key hole, lovey? At eight o'clock you ſee me again. And then, and then, added ſhe, clapping her hands, it is all over. The ſun is not ſurer to riſe, than you and your honeſt man to be made one.</p>
                     <p>There was ſomething in the tone with which this ſlut uttered her farewel, that for a moment ſuggeſted the queſtion to Emily, What does ſhe mean? Is it poſſible ſhe ſhould know what has been planned for the few next hours? If ſhe do, what will become of me then? But ſurely her manner of ſpeaking was very unlike that of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and reprimand!—With an aching heart ſhe folded up the few neceſſaries ſhe thought proper to take with her. She then liſtened with an anxiety that would almoſt have enabled her to hear the ſtirring of a leaf. From time to time ſhe thought her ear was ſtruck with the ſound of feet; but the treading, if treading it were, was ſo ſoft, that ſhe could never aſcertain whether it were a real ſound or the mere creature of the fancy. Then all was ſtill as if the univerſal motion had been at reſt. By and by ſhe conceived ſhe overheard a noiſe as of buzzing and low muttered ſpeech. Her heart palpitated; ſhe ſaid, Am I betrayed? Am I the dupe of baſe artifice and deceit? Preſently ſhe heard the ſound of a key in her chamber door, and Grimes made his appearance. She ſtarted, and cried, Are we diſcovered? did not I hear you ſpeak? Grimes advanced on tiptoe with his finger to his lip. No, no, replied be, all is ſafe! He took her by the hand, led her in ſilence out of the houſe and then acroſs the garden. Emily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined

                        </gap>oor of the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den already unlocked, that led into an unfrequented lane. There ſtood two horſes ready equipped for the journey, their bridles hung to a poſt not ſix yards diſtant from the garden. Grimes puſhed the door after them. By Gemini, ſaid he, my heart was in my mouth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As I comed along, I ſaw Mun, coachey, pop along from the back door to the ſtables. He was within a hop, ſtep, and jump of me. But he had a lanthorn in his hand, and he did not ſee me, being as I was darkling.—Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>, he aſſiſted Miſs Melvile to mount. He troubled her little during the route. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, he was remarkably ſilent and contemplative, a circumſtance by no means diſagreeable to Emily, to whom his converſation had never been accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
                     <p>After having proceeded about two miles, they turned into a wood, through which the road lay that led to the place of their deſtination. The night was extremely dark, at the ſame time that the air was ſoft and mild, it being now the middle of ſummer. Under pretence of exploring the way, Grimes contrived, when they had already penetrated into the midſt of this gloomy ſolitude, to get his horſe abreaſt with that of Miſs Melvile, and then ſuddenly reaching out his hand, to ſeize hold of her bridle. I think we may as well ſtop here a bit, ſaid he.</p>
                     <p>Stop, exclaimed Emily with ſurpriſe. Why ſhould we ſtop? Mr. Grimes, what do you mean?</p>
                     <p>Come, come, ſaid he, never trouble yourſelf to wonder. Did you think I was ſuch a gooſe, as to take all this trouble merely to gratify your whim? I' faith, nobody ſhall find me a pack horſe, to go
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:028752_0107_0FDBF074442E5BB8"/>
of other folks' errands, without knowing a reaſon why. I cannot ſay that I much minded to have you at firſt; but your ways are enough to ſtir the blood of my grandad. Far fetched and dear bought is always reliſhing. Your conſent was ſo hard to gain, that ſquire thought it was ſureſt aſking in the dark. A' ſaid however a' would have no ſuch doings in his houſe, and ſo, do you ſee? we are comed here.</p>
                     <p>For God's ſake, Mr. Grimes, think what you are about! You cannot be baſe enough to ruin a poor creature who has put herſelf under your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection!</p>
                     <p>That is all bother. Ruin! no, no, I will make an honeſt woman of you, when all is done. Nay, none of your airs; no tricks upon travellers! I have you here as ſafe as a horſe in a pound; there is not a houſe nor a ſhed within a mile of us; and, if I miſs the opportunity, you ſhall call me ſpade. Faith, you are a delicate morſel, and there is no time to be loſt!</p>
                     <p>Miſs Melvile had but an inſtant in which to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect her thoughts. She felt that there was but little hope of ſoftening the obſtinate and inſenſible brute in whoſe power ſhe was placed. But the preſence of mind and intrepidity, ſo peculiar to her character, did not now deſert her. Grimes had ſcarcely finiſhed his harangue, when with a ſtrong and unexpected jerk ſhe diſengaged the bridle from his graſp, and at the ſame time put her horſe upon full ſpeed. She had ſcarcely advanced twice the length of her horſe, when Grimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered from his ſurpriſe, and purſued her, inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſibly mortified at being ſo eaſily overreached. The ſound of his horſe behind ſerved but to rouſe more completely the mettle of that of Emily; whether by accident or ſagacity the animal purſued
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:028752_0108_0FDBF036D3149CF0"/>
without a fault the narrow and winding way; and the chace continued the whole length of the wood.</p>
                     <p>At the extremity of this wood there was a gate. The recollection of this ſoftened a little the cutting diſappointment of Grimes, as he thought himſelf ſecure of putting an end by its aſſiſtance to the career of Emily, nor was it very probable that they ſhould find any body to interrupt him there in the dead and ſilence of the night. By the moſt extraordinary accident however they ſound a man on horſeback in wait at this gate. Help, help! exclaimed the affrighted Emily! thieves! murder! help! The man was Mr. Falkland. Grimes knew his voice, and therefore, though he attempted a ſort of ſullen reſiſtance, it was feebly made. Two other men, whom by reaſon of the darkneſs he had not at firſt ſeen, and who were Mr. Falkland's ſervants, hearing the buſtle of the rencounter, and alarmed for the ſafety of their maſter, rode up; and then Grimes, diſappointed at the loſs of his gratification, and admoniſhed by conſcious guilt, ſhrunk from farther parley and rode off in ſilence.</p>
                     <p>It may ſeem ſtrange that Mr. Falkland ſhould thus a ſecond time have been the ſaviour of Miſs Melvile, and that under circumſtances the moſt unexpected and ſingular. But in this inſtance it is very eaſily to be accounted for. He had heard of a man who lurked about this wood for robbery or ſome other bad deſign, and that it was conjectured this man was Hawkins. Mr. Falkland's compaſſion had already been ſtrongly intereſted in behalf of this victim of rural tyranny; he had in vain en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to find him, and do him good; and he eaſily conceived that, if the conjecture which had been made in this inſtance proved true, he might have it in his power not only to do what he had always intended, but farther to ſave from a peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous offence againſt the laws <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

<pb n="107" facs="unknown:028752_0109_0FDBF076F73F3428"/>
appeared to have ſtrongly imbibed the principles of juſtice and virtue. He took with him two ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, becauſe, going with the expreſs deſign of encountering robbers, if robbers ſhould be found, he believed he ſhould be inexcuſable if he did not go provided againſt poſſible accidents. But he had directed them, at the ſame time that they kept within call, to be out of the reach of being ſeen; and it was only the eagerneſs of their zeal that had brought them up thus early in the preſent encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Mr. Falkland had a little before had the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to convince himſelf that the village con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture in relation to Hawkins was untrue; and was now upon the point of returning home, with no other ſatisfaction than that of having intended an act of benevolence, when Grimes and Emily came up to the ſpot upon which he had poſted himſelf.</p>
                     <p>This new adventure promiſed ſomething extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary. Mr. Falkland did not immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogniſe Miſs Melvile, and the perſon of Grimes was that of a total ſtranger whom he did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect to have ever ſeen. But it was eaſy to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the merits of the caſe, and the propriety of interfering. The reſolute manner of Mr. Falk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, combined with the dread which Grimes, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with a ſenſe of wrong, entertained of the oppoſition of ſo elevated a perſonage, ſpeedily put the raviſher to flight. Emily was leſt alone with her deliverer. He found her much more collected and calm than could reaſonably have been expected from a perſon who had been a moment before in the moſt alarming ſituation. She told him of the place to which ſhe deſired to be conveyed, and he immediately undertook to eſcort her. As they went along, ſhe recovered that ſtate of mind which inclined her to make a perſon to whom ſhe had ſuch repeated obligations, and who was ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:028752_0110_0FDBF0385351B1A8"/>
the object of her admiration, acquainted with the events that had recently befallen her. Mr. Falkland liſtened with eagerneſs and ſurpriſe. Though he had already known various inſtances of Mr. Tyrrel's mean jealouſy and unfeeling tyranny, this ſurpaſſed them all, and he could ſcarcely credit his ears while he heard the tale. His brutal neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour ſeemed to realiſe all that had ever been told of the paſſions of fiends. Miſs Melvile was obliged to repeat in the courſe of her tale her kinſman's rude accuſation againſt her of entertaining a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for Mr. Falkland; and this ſhe did with the moſt bewitching ſimplicity and charming confuſion. Though this part of the tale was a ſource of real pain to her deliverer, yet it is not to be ſuppoſed but that the flattering partiality of this unhappy girl increaſed the intereſt he felt in her welfare and the indignation he conceived againſt her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal kinſman.</p>
                     <p>They arrived without accident at the houſe of the good lady under whoſe protection Emily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to place herſelf. Here Mr. Falkland willingly left her as in a place of ſecurity. Such conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies as that of which ſhe was intended to have been the victim, depend for their ſucceſs upon the perſon againſt whom they are formed being out of the reach of help, and the moment they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected they are annihilated. Such reaſoning will no doubt be generally found ſufficiently ſolid, and it appeared to Mr. Falkland perfectly applicable to the preſent caſe. But he was miſtaken.</p>

                     <p>MR. TYRREL heard with aſtoniſhment of the miſcarriage of an expedient, of the ſucceſs of which he had not previouſly entertained the ſlighteſt ſuſpicion. He became frantic with vexation. Grimes had not dared to ſignify the event of his expedition in perſon, and the footman whom he deſired to announce to his maſter that Miſs Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile was loſt, the moment after fled from his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with the moſt dreadful apprehenſions. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently he bellowed for Grimes, and the young man at laſt appeared before him, more dead than alive. Grimes he compelled to repeat the particulars of the tale, which he had no ſooner done than he once again ſlunk away, ſhocked at the execrations with which Mr. Tyrrel overwhelmed him. Grimes was no coward; but he reverenced the inborn divinity that attends upon rank, as Indians worſhip the devil. Nor was this all. The rage of Mr. Tyrrel was ſo ungovernable and fierce, that few hearts could have been found ſo ſtout as not to have trembled before it with a ſort of unconquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able inferiority.</p>
                     <p>He no ſooner obtained a moment's pauſe than he began to recal to his tempeſtuous mind the various circumſtances of the caſe. His complaints were bitter; and in a tranquil obſerver might have produced the united feeling of pity for his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and horror at his depravity. He recollected all the precautions he had uſed; he could ſcarcely find a flaw in the proceſs; and he curſed that blind and malicious power that delighted to croſs his moſt deep laid deſigns. Of this malice he was
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:028752_0112_0FDBF03C795DAF28"/>
beyond all other human beings the object. He was mocked with the ſhadow of power; and, when he lifted his hand to ſmite, it was ſtruck with ſudden palſy. To what purpoſe had heaven given him a feeling of injury and an inſtinct to reſent, while he could in no caſe make his reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment felt! It was only neceſſary for him to be the enemy of any perſon, in order to that perſon's being inſured againſt the reach of misfortune. What inſults, the moſt ſhocking and repeated, had he not received from this paltry girl? And by whom was ſhe now torn from his indignation? By that devil that haunted him at every moment, that croſſed him at every ſtep, that fixed at pleaſure his arrows in his heart, and made <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ows and mockery at his inſufferable tortures.</p>
                     <p>There was one other reflexion that increaſed his anguiſh, and made him careleſs and deſperate as to his future conduct. It was in vain to conceal from himſelf that his reputation would be cruelly wounded by this event. He had imagined that, while Emily was forced into this odious marriage, ſhe would be obliged by decorum, as ſoon as the event was decided, to draw a veil over the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion ſhe had ſuffered. But this ſecurity was now loſt, and Mr. Falkland would take a pride in publiſhing his diſhonour. Though the provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he had received from Miſs Melvile would in his opinion have juſtified him in any treatment he ſhould have thought proper to inflict, he was ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the world would ſee the matter in a very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent light. This reflection augmented the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of his reſolutions, and determined him to refuſe no means by which he could transfer the anguiſh that now preyed upon his own mind to that of another.</p>
                     <p>Meanwhile the compoſure and magnanimity of Emily had conſiderably ſubſided, the moment ſhe
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:028752_0113_0FDBF0799DAC38D0"/>
believed herſelf in a place of ſafety. While dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and injuſtice aſſailed her with their menaces, ſhe found in herſelf a courage that diſdained to yield. The ſucceeding appearance of calm was more fatal to her. There was nothing now power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to foſter her courage, or excite her energy. She looked back at the trials ſhe had paſſed, and her ſoul ſickened at the recollection of that which, while it was in act, ſhe had had the fortitude to endure. Till the period at which Mr. Tyrrel had been inſpired with this cruel antipathy, ſhe had been in all inſtances a ſtranger to anxiety and fear. Uninured to misfortune, ſhe had ſuddenly and without preparation been made the ſubject of the moſt infernal malignity. When a man of robuſt and vigorous conſtitution has a fit of ſickneſs, it produces a much more powerful effect than the ſame indiſpoſition upon a delicate valetudinarian. Such was the caſe with Miſs Melvile. She paſſed the ſucceeding night ſleepleſs and uneaſy, and was found in the morning with a high fever. Her diſtemper reſiſted for the preſent all attempts to aſſuage it, though there was reaſon to hope that the goodneſs of her conſtitution, aſſiſted by tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity and the kindneſs of thoſe about her, would ultimately ſurmount it. On the ſecond day ſhe was delirious. On the night of that day ſhe was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted at the ſuit of Mr. Tyrrel for a debt contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for board and neceſſaries for the fourteen laſt years.</p>
                     <p>The idea of this arreſt, as the reader will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps recollect, firſt occurred in the converſation between Mr. Tyrrel and Miſs Melvile ſoon after he had thought proper to confine her to her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. But at that time he had probably had no ſerious conception of ever being induced to carry it into execution. It had merely been mentioned by way of threat, and as the ſuggeſtion of a mind whoſe
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:028752_0114_0FDBF03D95E62BB0"/>
habits had been long familiariſed to the recollection of every poſſible medium of tyranny and revenge. But now that the unlooked-for reſcue and eſcape of his poor kinſwoman had wrought up the thoughts of Mr. Tyrrel to a degree of inſanity, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in the gloomy reſources of his mind how he might moſt effectually ſhake off the load of diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment that oppreſſed him, the idea recurred with double force. He was not long in forming his reſolution; and, calling for Barnes, his ſteward, immediately gave him directions in what manner to proceed.</p>
                     <p>Barnes had been for ſeveral years the inſtrument of Mr. Tyrrel's injuſtice. His mind was hardened by uſe, and he could without remorſe officiate as the ſpectator, or even as the immediate author and director of a ſcene of vulgar diſtreſs. But even he was ſomewhat ſtartled upon the preſent occaſion. The character and conduct of Emily in Mr. Tyrrel's family had been without a blot. She had not a ſingle enemy; and it was impoſſible to contemplate her youth, her harmleſs vivacity, her guileleſs innocence, without emotions of ſympathy and compaſſion.</p>
                     <p>Your worſhip?—I do not underſtand you!—Arreſt miſs!—miſs Emily!</p>
                     <p>Yes, I tell you! What is the matter with you? Go immediately to Swineard, the lawyer, and bid him finiſh the buſineſs out of hand!</p>
                     <p>Lord love your honour! Arreſt her! Why, ſhe does not owe you a braſs farthing; ſhe always lived upon your charity!</p>
                     <p>Aſs! Scoundrel! I tell you ſhe does owe me, owes me—eleven hundred pound.—The law juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies it.—What do you think laws were made for?—I do nothing but right, and my rights I will have.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="113" facs="unknown:028752_0115_0FDBF08065735760"/>
Your honour, I never queſtioned your orders in my life; but I muſt now. I cannot ſee you ruin miſs Emily, poor girl! nay, and yourſelf too, for the matter of that, and not ſay which way you are going. I hope you will bear with me. Why if ſhe owed you ever ſo much, ſhe cannot be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted. She is not of age.</p>
                     <p>Will you have done, ſir? Do not tell me of It cannot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and It can. To my knowledge it has been done before, and it ſhall be done again. Let him diſpute it that dares. I will do it now, and ſtand to it afterwards. Tell Swineard, if he make the leaſt boggling, it is as much as his life is worth; he ſhall ſtarve by inches.</p>
                     <p>Pray, your honour, think better of it. Upon my life, the whole country will cry ſhame of it.</p>
                     <p>Barnes?—What do you mean? I am not uſed to be talked to, and I will not bear it!—They have driven me already with their parleying and their diſobedience to the very end of my patience. You have been a good fellow to me upon many occaſions. But, if I find you out for making one with them that diſpute my authority, damn my ſoul, if I do not make you ſick of your very life!</p>
                     <p>I have done, your honour. I will not ſay ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther word, except this. I have heard as how that miſs Emily is ſick a-bed. You are determined, you ſay, to put her in jail. You do not mean to kill her, I take it.</p>
                     <p>Let her die, if ſhe will! I will not ſpare her for an hour. I will not always be inſulted. She had no conſideration for me, and I have no mercy for her. I am in for it! They have provoked me paſt all bearing, and they ſhall feel me! Tell Swineard, in bed or up, day or night, I will not have him hear of a minute's delay.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="114" facs="unknown:028752_0116_0FDBF03F1B77C4D0"/>
Such were the directions of Mr. Tyrrel, and in ſtrict conformity to his directions were the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of that reſpectable limb of the law he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed upon the preſent occaſion. Miſs Melvile had been delirious through a conſiderable part of the day on the evening of which the bailiff and his follower arrived. By the direction of the phyſician whom Mr. Falkland had ordered to attend her, a compoſing draught was adminiſtered; and, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted as ſhe was by the wild and diſtracted images that for ſeveral hours had haunted her fancy, ſhe was now ſunk into a refreſhing ſlumber. Mrs. Hammond, the ſiſter of Mrs. Jakeman, was ſitting by her bed-ſide, full of compaſſion for the lovely ſufferer, and rejoicing in the calm tranquillity that had juſt taken poſſeſſion of her, when a little girl, the only child of Mrs. Hammond, opened the ſtreet-door to the tap of the bailiff. He ſaid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e wanted to ſpeak with miſs Melvile, and the child anſwered that ſhe would go tell her mother. So ſaying, ſhe advanced to the door of the back-room upon the ground-floor in which Emily lay; but the moment it was opened, inſtead of waiting for the appearance of the mother, the bailiff entered along with the girl.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Hammond looked up. Who are you, ſaid ſhe? Why do you come in here? Huſh! be quiet!</p>
                     <p>I muſt ſpeak with miſs Melvile.</p>
                     <p>Indeed, but you muſt not. Tell me your buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The poor lady has been light-headed all day. She is juſt fallen aſleep, and muſt not be diſturbed.</p>
                     <p>That is no buſineſs of mine. I muſt obey orders.</p>
                     <p>Orders? Whoſe orders? What is it you mean?</p>
                     <p>At this moment Emily opened her eyes. What noiſe is that? I wiſh you would let me be quiet.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="115" facs="unknown:028752_0117_0FDBF081D6588520"/>
Miſs, I want to ſpeak with you. I have got a writ againſt you for eleven hundred pound at the ſuit of ſquire Tyrrel.</p>
                     <p>At theſe words both Mrs. Hammond and Emily were dumb. The latter was ſcarcely able to annex any meaning to the intelligence; and, though Mrs. Hammond was ſomewhat better acquainted with the ſort of language that was employed, yet in this ſtrange and unexpected connexion it was almoſt as myſterious to her, as to poor Emily herſelf.</p>
                     <p>A writ! How can ſhe be in Mr. Tyrrel's debt? A writ againſt a child!</p>
                     <p>It is no ſignification putting your queſtions to us. We only do as we are directed. There is our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. Look at it.</p>
                     <p>Lord Almighty! exclaimed Mrs. Hammond, what does this mean? It is impoſſible Mr. Tyrrel ſhould have ſent you.</p>
                     <p>Good woman, none of your jabber to us! Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not you read?</p>
                     <p>This is all a trick! This paper is forged! It is a vile contrivance to get the poor lady out of the hands of thoſe with whom only ſhe can be ſafe. Proceed upon it at your peril!</p>
                     <p>Reſt you content; that is exactly what we mean to do. Take it at my word, we know very well what we are about.</p>
                     <p>Why, you would not tear her from her bed? I tell you, ſhe is in a high fever; ſhe is light-headed; it would be death to remove her! You are bailiffs, are not you? You are not murderers?</p>
                     <p>The law ſays nothing about that. We have or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to take her ſick or well. We will do her no harm; except ſo far as we muſt perform our office, be it how it will.</p>
                     <p>Where would you take her? What is it you mean to do?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="116" facs="unknown:028752_0118_0FDBF04352B29F00"/>
To the county jail. Bullock, go, order a poſt-chaiſe from the Griffin!</p>
                     <p>Stay, I ſay! Give no ſuch orders! Wait only three hours; I will ſend off a meſſenger expreſs to ſquire Falkland, and I am ſure he will ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy you as to any harm that can come to you, without its being neceſſary to take the poor lady to jail.</p>
                     <p>We have particular directions againſt that. We are not at liberty to loſe a minute. Why are not you gone? Order the horſes to be put to imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately!</p>
                     <p>Emily had liſtened to the courſe of this conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, which had ſufficiently explained to her whatever was enigmatical at the firſt appearance of the bailiffs. The painful and incredible reality that was thus preſented, effectually diſſipated the illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of frenzy to which ſhe had juſt been a prey. My dear madam, ſaid ſhe to Mrs. Hammond, do not haraſs yourſelf with uſeleſs efforts. I am very ſorry for all the trouble I have given you. But my misfortune is inevitable. Sir, if you will ſtep into the next room, I will dreſs myſelf, and attend you immediately.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Hammond began to be equally aware that her ſtruggles were to no purpoſe; but ſhe could not be equally patient. At one moment ſhe raved upon the brutality of Mr. Tyrrel, whom ſhe affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be a devil incarnate, and not a man. At another ſhe expoſtulated with bitter invective againſt the hard-heartedneſs of the bailiff, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted him to mix ſome humanity and moderation with the diſcharge of his duty; but he was impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrable to all ſhe could urge. In the mean while Emily yielded with the ſweeteſt reſignation to an inevitable evil. Mrs. Hammond inſiſted that at leaſt they ſhould permit her to attend her young lady in the chaiſe; and the bailiff, though the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:028752_0119_0FDBF08762EE17C8"/>
he had received were ſo peremptory that he dared not exerciſe his diſcretion as to the execution of the writ, began to have ſome apprehenſions of danger, and was willing to admit of any precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that was not in direct hoſtility to his func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. For the reſt he underſtood, that it was in all caſes dangerous to allow ſickneſs, or apparent unfitneſs for removal as a ſufficient cauſe to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt a direct proceſs, and that accordingly in all doubtful queſtions and preſumptive murders the practice of the law inclined [with a laudable par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality] to the vindication of its own officers. In addition to theſe general rules he was influenced by the poſitive injunctions and aſſurances of Swine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, and the terror which univerſally through a circle of many miles was annexed to the name of Tyrrel. Before they departed Mrs. Hammond diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched a meſſenger with a letter of three lines to Mr. Falkland informing him of this extraordinary event. Mr. Falkland was from home when the meſſenger arrived, and not expected to return till the ſecond day; accident ſeeming in this inſtance to favour the vengeance of Mr. Tyrrel, for he had himſelf been too much under the dominion of an uncontroulable fury to have leiſure to take a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of this ſort into his eſtimate.</p>
                     <p>The forlorn ſtate of theſe poor women, who were conducted, the one by compulſion, the other as a volunteer, to a ſcene ſo little adapted to their accommodation as that of a common jail, may eaſily be imagined. There were however a maſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line courage and impetuoſity of ſpirit in Mrs. Hammond, eminently neceſſary in the difficulties they had to encounter. She was in ſome degree ſitted by a ſanguine temper and an impaſſioned ſenſe of injuſtice for the diſcharge of thoſe very offices which ſobriety and calm reflexion might preſcribe. The health of miſs Melvile, as might
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:028752_0120_0FDBF044528B19D0"/>
have been expected, was very materially affected by the ſurpriſe and removal ſhe had undergone, at the very time when repoſe was moſt neceſſary for her preſervation. Her fever became more violent than ever; her delirium was ſtronger; and the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of her imagination were in ſome degree pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned to the extreme unfavourableneſs of the ſtate in which the removal had been effected. It was highly improbable ſhe could at all recover.</p>
                     <p>In the moments of ſuſpended reaſon ſhe was perpetually calling on the name of Mr. Falkland. Mr. Falkland, ſhe ſaid, was her firſt and only love, and he ſhould be her huſband. A moment after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſhe exclaimed upon him in a diſconſolate, yet reproachful tone, for his unworthy deference to the prejudices of the world. It was very cruel of him to ſhew himſelf ſo proud, and tell her that he would never conſent to marry a beggar. But, if he were proud, ſhe was determined to be proud too. He ſhould ſee that ſhe would not demean herſelf like a ſlighted maiden, and that, though he could reject her, it was not in his power to break her heart. At another time ſhe imagined ſhe ſaw Mr. Tyrrel and his engine Grimes, their hands and garments dropping with blood, and the pathetic reproaches ſhe vented againſt them might have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected a heart of ſtone. Then the figure of Falk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land preſented itſelf to her diſtracted fancy, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with wounds and of a deadly paleneſs, and ſhe ſhrieked with agony, while ſhe exclaimed that ſuch was the general hard-heartedneſs, that no one would make the ſmalleſt exertion for his reſcue. In ſuch viciſſitudes of pain, perpetually imagining to herſelf unkindneſs, inſult, conſpiracy and murder, ſhe paſſed a conſiderable part of two days.</p>
                     <p>On the evening of the ſecond Mr. Falkland ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, accompanied by doctor Arnold, the phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian by whom ſhe had previouſly been attended.
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:028752_0121_0FDBF08954C18D88"/>
The ſcene he was called upon to witneſs was ſuch as to be moſt exquiſitely agonizing to a man of his acute ſenſibility. The news of the arreſt had given him an inexpreſſible ſhock; he was tranſported out of himſelf at the unexampled malignity of its author. But, when he ſaw the figure of Miſs Melvile, haggard, and a warrant of death written in her countenance, a victim to the diabolical paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of her kinſman, the ſcene ſeemed too much to be endured. When he entered, ſhe was in the midſt of one of her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>its of delirium, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately miſtook her viſitors for two aſſaſſins. She aſked, where they had hid her Falkland, her lord, her life, her huſband! and demanded that they ſhould reſtore to her his mangled corpſe, that ſhe might embrace him with her dying arms, breathe her laſt upon his lips, and be buried in the ſame grave. She reproached them with the ſordidneſs of their conduct in becoming the tools of her vile couſin, who had deprived her of her reaſon, and would never be contented, till he had murdered her. Mr. Falkland tore himſelf away from this painful ſcene, and, leaving doctor Arnold with his patient, deſired him when he had given the neceſſary di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections to follow him to his inn.</p>
                     <p>The perpetual hurry of ſpirits in which Miſs Melvile had for ſeveral days been kept by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of her indiſpoſition was extremely exhauſting to her; and in about an hour from the viſit of Mr. Falkland her delirium ſubſided, and left her in ſo low a ſtate as to render it difficult to perceive any marks of life. Doctor Arnold, who had before withdrawn, to ſoothe, if poſſible, the diſturbed and impatient thoughts of Mr. Falkland, was ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned afreſh upon this change of ſymptoms, and ſat by the bed-ſide during <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> remainder of the night. The ſituation of his patient was ſuch as to keep him in momentary apprehenſion of her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe.
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:028752_0122_0FDBF0493A8EF780"/>
While Miſs Melvile lay in this feeble and exhauſted condition, Mrs. Hammond betrayed every token of the tendereſt, anxiety. Her ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility was habitually of the acuteſt ſort, and the qualities of Emily were ſuch as powerfully to fix her affection. She loved her like a mother, Upon the preſent occaſion every ſound, every motion made her tremble. Doctor Arnold had introduced another nurſe in conſideration of the inceſſant fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue Mrs. Hammond had undergone; and he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured by repreſentations and even by autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to compel her to quit the apartment of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient. But ſhe was uncontroulable; and he at length found that he ſhould probably do her more injury by the violence that would be neceſſary to ſeparate her from the ſuffering innocent, than by allowing her to follow her own inclinations. Her eye was a thouſand times turned with the moſt eager curioſity upon the countenance of doctor Arnold, without her daring to breathe a queſtion reſpecting his opinion, leſt he ſhould anſwer her by a communication of the moſt fatal tidings. In the mean time ſhe liſtened with the deepeſt atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to every thing that dropped either from the phyſician or the nurſe, hoping as it were to collect from ſome oblique hint the intelligence which ſhe had not courage expreſsly to require.</p>
                     <p>Towards morning the ſtate of the patient ſeemed to take a favourable turn. She dozed for near two hours, and, when ſhe awoke, appeared perfectly calm and ſenſible. Underſtanding that Mr. Falk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land had brought the phyſician to attend her, and was himſelf in the neighbourhood, ſhe requeſted to ſee him. Mr. Falkland had gone in the mean time with one of his tenants to bail the debt, and now entered the priſon to enquire whether the young lady might be ſafely removed from her preſent mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable reſidence to a more airy and commodious
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:028752_0123_0FDBF08D751E6F38"/>
apartment. When he appeared, the ſight of him revived in the mind of Miſs Melvile an imperfect rencollection of the wanderings of her delirium. She covered her face with her hand, and betrayed the moſt expreſſive confuſion, while ſhe thanked him with her uſual unaffected ſimplicity for all the trouble he had taken. She hoped ſhe ſhould not give him much more; ſhe thought ſhe ſhould get better. It was a ſhame, ſhe ſaid, if a young and lively girl as ſhe was, could not contrive to outlive the trifling misfortunes to which ſhe had been ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected. But, while ſhe ſaid this, ſhe was ſtill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely weak. She tried to aſſume a chearful countenance; but it was a faint effort, which the feeble ſtate of her frame did not ſeem ſufficient to ſupport. Mr. Falkland and the doctor joined to requeſt her to keep herſelf quiet, and to avoid for the preſent all occaſions of exertion.</p>
                     <p>Encouraged by theſe appearances, Mrs. Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond now ventured to follow the two gentlemen out of the room in order to learn from the phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian what hopes he entertained. Doctor Arnold acknowledged that he had found his patient at firſt in a very unfavourable ſituation, that the ſymptoms were changed for the better, and that he was not without ſome expectation of her recovery. He added however, that he could anſwer for nothing, that the next twelve hours would be exceedingly critical, but that, if ſhe did not grow worſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore morning, he would then undertake to anſwer for her life. Mrs. Hammond, who had hitherto ſeen nothing but deſpair, now became frantic with joy. She burſt into tears of tranſport, bleſſed the phyſician in the moſt emphatic and impaſſioned terms, and uttered a thouſand extravagancies. Doctor Arnold ſeized this opportunity to preſs her to give herſelf a little repoſe, to which ſhe conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, a chamber being firſt procured for her next to
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:028752_0124_0FDBF04B14B61FC0"/>
that of Miſs Melvile, and ſhe having charged the nurſe to give her notice of any alteration in the patient.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Hammond enjoyed an uninterrupted ſleep of ſeveral hours, when towards the afternoon, ſhe was alarmed by an unuſual buſtle in the next room. She liſtened for a few moments, and then deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to go and ſee what was the occaſion of it. As ſhe opened her door for that purpoſe, ſhe met the nurſe who was coming to her. The counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the meſſenger told her what it was ſhe had to communicate, without the uſe of words. She hurried to the bed ſide, and found Miſs Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile expiring. The appearances that had at firſt been ſo encouraging were but of ſhort duration. The calm of the morning proved to be only a ſort of lightning before death. In a few hours the patient grew worſe. The bloom of her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance faded; ſhe drew her breath with difficulty; and her eyes became fixed. Doctor Arnold had come in at this period, and had immediately per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that all was over. She was for ſome time in convulſions; but, theſe ſubſiding, ſhe addreſſed the phyſician with a compoſed, though feeble voice. She thanked him for his attention; and expreſſed the moſt lively ſenſe of her obligations to Mr. Falkland. She ſincerely forgave her couſin, and hoped he might never be viſited by too acute a recollection of his barbarity to her. She would have been contented to live; few perſons had a ſincerer reliſh of the good things of life; but ſhe was well pleaſed to die rather than have become the wife of Grimes. As Mrs. Hammond entered, ſhe turned her countenance towards her, and with an affectionate expreſſion repeated her name. Theſe were her laſt words; in leſs than two hours from that time ſhe breathed her laſt in the arms of this faithful friend.</p>

                     <p>SUCH was the fate of Miſs Emily Melvile. Perhaps tyranny never exhibited a more painful memorial of the deteſtation in which it deſerves to be held. The idea irreſiſtibly excited in every ſpectator of the ſcene was that of regarding Mr. Tyrrel as the moſt diabolical wretch that had ever diſhonoured the human form. The very attendants upon this houſe of oppreſſion, for the ſcene was acted upon too public a ſtage not to be generally underſtood, expreſſed their aſtoniſhment and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt at his unparalleled cruelty. If ſuch were the feelings of men bred to the commiſſion of injuſtice, it is eaſy to conceive what muſt have been thoſe of Mr. Falkland. His whole life had tended to culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate in him a mind tremblingly alive to moral good and evil. Upon ſuch occaſions he was unable ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely to collect his thoughts and firmly reſolve upon the proceeding which the nature of the caſe required. His habits urged him to madneſs and ungovernable fury. He could not think of ſuch complicated depravity but with ſentiments of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural loathing and horror. Perhaps the ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the wretch broken upon the wheel, whom the very firſt ſight of that engine of torture had thrown into convulſions, did not exceed thoſe of Mr. Falkland in the preſent ſituation. He was therefore deprived for a time of all that compoſure of mind which is requiſite to enable us to act with diſcretion. It was neceſſary to guard him like a madman. The whole office of judging what was
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:028752_0126_0FDBF05189AC70C0"/>
proper to be done under the preſent circumſtances devolved upon doctor Arnold.</p>
                     <p>The doctor was a man of cool and methodical habits of acting. One of the firſt ideas that ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted itſelf to him was, that Miſs Melvile was a branch of the family of Tyrrel. He did not doubt of the willingneſs of Mr. Falkland to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge every expence that might be farther incident to the melancholy remains of this unfortunate victim; but he ſuſpected that the laws of faſhion and decorum required that ſome notification of the event ſhould be made to the head of the family<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> His manners were formal, his temper phlegmatic, and his whole character was ſuch as to render him little ſuſceptible of thoſe impetuous impulſes which have ſo conſiderable a ſhare in the hiſtory of the maſs of mankind. Perhaps too he had an eye to his own intereſt in his profeſſion, and was reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant to expoſe himſelf to the reſentment of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Mr. Tyrrel's conſideration in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. Inacceſſible to the ſympathies of the mind, he was little qualified to calculate their operation in the preſent inſtance. But, with this weakneſs, he had nevertheleſs ſome feelings in common with the reſt of the world, and muſt have ſuffered a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable degree of violence before he could have perſuaded himſelf to be the meſſenger; beſide which he did not think it right in the preſent ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation to leave Mr. Falkland.</p>
                     <p>Doctor Arnold no ſooner mentioned theſe ideas, than they ſeemed to make a ſudden impreſſion on Mrs. Hammond, and ſhe earneſtly requeſted that ſhe might be permitted to carry the intelligence. The propoſal was unexpected; but the doctor did not very obſtinately refuſe his aſſent. She was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, ſhe ſaid, to ſee what ſort of impreſſion the cataſtrophe would make upon the author of it; and ſhe promiſed to comport herſelf with modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and civility. The journey was ſoon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="125" facs="unknown:028752_0127_0FDBF0941E2C0790"/>
I am come, ſir, ſaid ſhe to Mr. Tyrrel, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you that your couſin, Miſs Melvile, died this afternoon.</p>
                     <p>Died! Is it poſſible? are you ſerious?</p>
                     <p>Yes, ſir. I ſaw her die. She died in my arms.</p>
                     <p>Dead! Who killed her? What do you mean?</p>
                     <p>Who killed her? Is it for you to aſk that queſtion? It was your cruelty and malice that killed her?</p>
                     <p>Me?—my?—Poh! ſhe is not dead—it cannot be—it is not a week ſince ſhe left this houſe.</p>
                     <p>Will you not believe me? I ſay ſhe is dead!</p>
                     <p>Have a care, woman! this is no jeſting matter. No: though ſhe uſed me <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ll, I would not believe her dead for all the world!</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Hammond ſhook her head in token of the truth of her aſſertion.</p>
                     <p>No, no, no, no!—I will never believe that!—No, never!</p>
                     <p>Will you come with me, and convince your own eyes? It is a ſight worthy of you, and will be a feaſt to ſuch a heart as yours!—Saying this, Mrs. Hammond offered her hand, as if to conduct him to the ſpot.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Tyrrel ſhrunk back.</p>
                     <p>If ſhe be dead, what is that to me? Am I to anſwer for every thing that goes wrong in the world?—What do you come here for? Why bring your meſſages to me?</p>
                     <p>To whom ſhould I bring them, but to her kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,—and her murderer?</p>
                     <p>Murderer!—Did I employ knives or piſtols? Did I give her poiſon? I did nothing but what the law allows. If ſhe be dead, nobody can ſay that I am to blame!</p>
                     <p>To blame!—All the world will abhor and curſe you. Were you ſuch a fool as to think, becauſe in ſome caſes men pay reſpect to wealth and rank,
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:028752_0128_0FDBF05291E46608"/>
that this excuſe would extend to ſuch a deed? They will laugh at ſo barefaced a cheat. The meaneſt beggar will ſpurn and ſpit at you. Aye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you may well ſtand confounded at what you have done. I will proclaim you to the whole world, and you will be obliged to fly the very face of a human creature!</p>
                     <p>Good woman, ſaid Mr. Tyrrel, extremely hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, talk no more in this ſtrain!—Emmy is not dead! I am ſure—I hope—ſhe is not dead!—Tell me that you have only been deceiving me, and I will forgive you every thing.—I will forgive her—I will take her into favour—I will do any thing you pleaſe!—I never meant her any harm!</p>
                     <p>I tell you, ſir, ſhe is dead! You have murdered the ſweeteſt lady that lived! Can you bring her back to life, as you have driven her out of it? If you could, I would kneel to you twenty times a day!—What is it you have done? Miſerable wretch! did you think you could do and undo, and change the laws of nature, as you pleaſe?</p>
                     <p>If ſhe is dead,—what care I? It is no concern of mine. Did I tell her to run away? I meant every thing for her good. If ſhe took things to heart ſo, as to die of the pip like a chicken, is that my fault?</p>
                     <p>The reproaches of Mrs. Hammond were the firſt inſtance in which Mr. Tyrrel was made to drink the full cup of retribution. This was however only a ſpecimen of a long ſeries of contempt, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence and inſult that was reſerved for him. The words of Mrs. Hammond were prophetic. It evidently appeared that, though wealth and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary elevation operate as an apology for many delinquencies, there are ſome which ſo irreſiſtibly addreſs themſelves to the indignation of mankind, that, like death, they level all diſtinctions, and reduce their perpetrator to an equality with the
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:028752_0129_0FDBF0961380C088"/>
moſt indigent and ſqualid of his ſpecies. Againſt Mr. Tyrrel, as the tyrannical and unmanly mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer of Emily, thoſe who dared not venture the unreſerved avowal of their ſentiments, muttered curſes, deep, not loud; while the reſt joined in an univerſal cry of abhorrence and execration. He himſelf ſtood aſtoniſhed at the novelty of his ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. Accuſtomed as he had been to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and trembling homage of mankind, he had imagined they would be perpetual, and that no exceſs on his part would ever be potent enough to break the enchantment. Now he looked round and ſaw ſullen deteſtation in every face, which with difficulty reſtrained itſelf, and upon the ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt provocation broke forth with an impetuous tide, and ſwept away all the mounds of ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and fear. His large eſtate could not n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>w purchaſe civility from the gentry, the peaſantry, ſcarcely from his own ſervants. In the indignation of all around him he found a ghoſt that haunted him with every change of place, and a remorſe that ſtung his conſcience and exterminated his peace. The neighbourhood appeared more and more every day to be growing too hot for him to endure the fierceneſs of its temperature, and it became evident that he would ultimately be obliged to quit the country. Urged by the flagitiouſneſs of this laſt example, people learned to recollect every other inſtance of Mr. Tyrrel's exceſſes, and upon the whole it was no doubt a fearful cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of wanton injuſtice that now roſe up in judgment againſt him. It ſeemed as if the ſenſe of public reſentment had been long gathering ſtrength unperceived, and now at length burſt forth into inextinguiſhable violence.</p>
                     <p>There was ſcarcely a human being upon whom this ſort of retribution could have ſat more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſily than upon Mr. Tyrrel. Though he had not
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:028752_0130_0FDBF056D6014148"/>
a conſciouſneſs of innocence prompting him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually to recoil from the deteſtation of mankind as a thing totally unallied to his character, yet the imperiouſneſs of his temper and the conſtant ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience he had had of the pliability of other men, prepared him to feel the general and undiſguiſed condemnation into which he was ſunk with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common emotions of anger and impatience. That he, at the beam of whoſe eye every countenance fell, and whom in the fierceneſs of his wrath no one was daring enough to anſwer, ſhould now be regarded with avowed diſlike and treated with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceremonious cenſure, was a thing he could not endure to recollect or believe. Symptoms of the univerſal diſguſt ſmote him at every inſtant, and at every blow he writhed with intolerable anguiſh. His rage was unbounded and raving. He repelled every attack with the fierceſt indignation; while the more he ſtruggled, the more deſperate his ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation appeared to become. At length he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to collect his ſtrength for a deciſive effort, and to meet the whole tide of public opinion in a ſingle ſcene.</p>
                     <p>In purſuance of theſe thoughts he reſolved to repair without delay to the rural aſſembly which I have already mentioned in the courſe of my hiſtory. Miſs Melvile had now been dead one month. There was a ſort of buſtle that took place at his entrance, it having been agreed by a private vote among the gentlemen of the aſſembly that Mr. Tyrrel was to be refuſed admittance, as a perſon with whom they did not chooſe to aſſociate. This vote had already been notified to him by letter by the maſter of the ceremonies, but the intelligence was rather calculated to a man of Mr. Tyrrel's diſpoſition to excite defiance than to overawe. At the door of the aſſembly he was perſonally met by the maſter of the ceremonies, who had perceived
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:028752_0131_0FDBF09C18148D00"/>
the arrival of an equipage, and who now endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to repeat his prohibition; but he was thruſt aſide by Mr. Tyrrel with an air of native autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and ineffable contempt. As he entered, every eye was turned upon him. Preſently all the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen in the room aſſembled round him. Some endeavored to huſtle him, and others began to expoſtulate. But he found the ſecret effectually to ſilence the one ſet, and to ſhake off the other. His muſcular form, the well-known eminence of his intellectual powers, the long habits to which every man was formed of acknowledging his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendancy, were all in his favour. He conſidered himſelf as playing a deſperate ſtake, and had rouſed all the energies he poſſeſſed to enable him to do juſtice to ſo intereſting a tranſaction. Diſengaged from the inſects that had at firſt peſtered him, he paced up and down the room with a magiſterial ſtride, and flaſhed an angry glance on every ſide. He then broke ſilence. "If any one had any thing to ſay to him, he ſhould know where and how to anſwer him. He would adviſe any ſuch perſon however to conſider well what he was about. If any man imagined he had any thing perſonally to complain of, it was very well. But he did expect that nobody there would be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and raw enough to meddle with what was no buſineſs of theirs, and intrude into the concerns of any man's private family".</p>
                     <p>This being a ſort of defiance, one and another gentleman advanced to anſwer it. He that was firſt began to ſpeak; but Mr. Tyrrel, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of his countenance and a peremptory tone, by well-timed interruptions and pertinent inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, cauſed him firſt to heſitate, and then to be ſilent. He ſeemed to be faſt advancing to the triumph he had promiſed himſelf. The whole company were aſtoniſhed. They felt the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ame ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:028752_0132_0FDBF057D67F8D50"/>
and condemnation of his character; but they could not help admiring the courage and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources he diſplayed upon the preſent occaſion. They could without difficulty have concentred afreſh their indignant feelings, but they ſeemed to want a leader.</p>
                     <p>At this critical moment Mr. Falkland entered the room. He had been abſent the laſt week in a diſtant part of the country, and was now return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed two or three days ſooner than he expected, Mr. Tyrrel had willingly embraced this oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, truſting that, if he could now effect his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhment, he ſhould eaſily preſerve the ground he had regained even in the face of his moſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable rival. Mr. Tyrrel was certainly not defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient in courage; but he conceived that the preſent was too important an epocha in his life to allow him to make any unneceſſary riſk in his chance for future eaſe and importance. He would gladly have diſpenſed with the arrival of the new comer.</p>
                     <p>Both he and Mr. Falkland reddened at ſight of each other. Mr. Falkland advanced towards him without a moment's pauſe, and in a peremptory voice aſked him, what he did here?</p>
                     <p>Here! What do you mean by that? This place is as free to me as you, and you are the laſt perſon to whom I ſhall deign to give an account of myſelf.</p>
                     <p>Sir, the place is not free to you. Do not you know you have been voted out? Whatever were your rights, your infamous conduct has forfeited them.</p>
                     <p>Mr. what do you call yourſelf, if you have any thing to ſay to me, chooſe a proper time and place. Do not think to put on your bullying airs under ſhelter of this company! I will not endure it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="131" facs="unknown:028752_0133_0FDBF09D92A6EAE8"/>
You are miſtaken, ſir. This public ſcene is the only place where I can have any thing to ſay to you. If you would not hear of the univerſal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation of mankind, you muſt not come into the ſociety of men. Miſs Melvile! Shame upon you, inhuman, unrelenting tyrant! Can you hear her name, and not ſink into the earth? Can you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire into ſolitude, and not ſee her pale and patient ghoſt riſing to reproach you? Can you recollect her virtues, her innocence, her ſpotleſs manners, her unreſenting temper, and not run diſtracted with remorſe? Have you not killed her in the firſt bloom of her youth? Can you bear to think that ſhe now lies mouldering in the grave through your curſed contrivance, that deſerved a crown, ten thouſand times more than you deſerve to live? And do you expect that mankind will ever forget, or forgive ſuch a deed? Go, miſerable wretch; think yourſelf too happy that you are permitted to fly the face of man! Why, what a pitiful figure do you make at this moment! Do you think that any thing could bring ſo hardened a wretch as you are, to ſhrink from reproach, if your conſcience were not in confederacy with him that reproached you? And were you fool enough to believe that any obſtinacy however determined could enable you to deſpiſe the keen rebuke of juſtice? Go, go, ſhrink into your miſerable ſelf! Begone, and let me never be blaſted with your fight again!</p>
                     <p>And here, however incredible it may appear, Mr. Tyrrel began to obey his imperious cenſurer. His looks were full of wildneſs and horror; his limbs trembled; and his tongue refuſed its office. He felt no power of reſiſting the impetuous tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of reproach that was poured upon him. He heſitated; he was aſhamed of his own defeat; he ſeemed to wiſh to deny it. But his ſtruggles were ineffectual; every attempt periſhed in the moment
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:028752_0134_0FDBF05C685EA7E0"/>
it was made. The general voice was eager to abaſh him. As his confuſion became more viſible, the outcry increaſed. It ſwelled gradually to hoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, tumult, and a deafening noiſe of indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. At length he willingly retired from the public ſcene, unable any longer to endure the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations it inflicted.</p>
                     <p>In about an hour and a half he returned. No precaution had been taken againſt this incident, for nothing could be more unexpected. In the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval he had intoxicated himſelf with large draughts of brandy. In a moment he was in a part of the room where Mr. Falkland was ſtanding, and with one blow of his muſcular arm levelled him with the earth. The blow however was not ſtunning, and Mr. Falkland roſe again immediately. It is obvious to perceive how unequal he muſt have been to this ſpecies of conteſt. He was ſcarcely riſen, before Mr. Tyrrel repeated his blow. Mr. Falkland was now upon his guard, and did not fall. But the blows of his adverſary were redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with a rapidity difficult to conceive, and Mr. Falkland was once again brought to the earth. In this ſituation Mr. Tyrrel kicked his proſtrate enemy, and ſtooped, apparently with the intention of drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging him along the floor. All this paſſed in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the gentlemen preſent had not time to recover their ſurpriſe. They now interfered, and Mr. Tyrrel once more quitted the apartment.</p>
                     <p>It is difficult to conceive of any event more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to the individual upon whom it fell, than the treatment which Mr. Falkland in this inſtance ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced. Every paſſion of his life was calculated to make him feel it more acutely He had repeated<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exerted the moſt uncommon energy and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to prevent the miſunderſtanding between Mr. Tyrrel and himſelf from proceeding to extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities; but in vain! It was cloſed with a cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrophe
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:028752_0135_0FDBF0A241BAA080"/>
exceeding all that he had feared, or that the moſt penetrating foreſight could have ſuggeſted. To Mr. Falkland diſgrace was worſe than death. The ſlighteſt breath of diſhonour would have ſtung him to the very ſoul. What muſt it have been with this complication of ignominy, baſe, humiliating and public? Could Mr. Tyrrel have underſtood the evil he inflicted, even he under all his circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of provocation could hardly have perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated it. Mr. Falkland's mind muſt have been full of uproar like the war of contending elements, and of ſuch ſuffering as caſts contempt on the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finements of inventive cruelty. He wiſhed no doubt for annihilation, to lie down in eternal obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion, in an inſenſibility, which compared with what he experienced was ſcarcely leſs enviable than beatitude itſelf. Horror, deteſtation, revenge, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible longings to ſhake off the evil, and a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion that in this caſe all effort was powerleſs, muſt have filled his ſoul even to burſting.</p>
                     <p>One other event cloſed the tranſactions of this memorable evening. Mr. Falkland was baffled of the vengeance that yet remained to him. Mr. Tyrrel was found by ſome of the company dead in the ſtreet, having been murdered at the diſtance of a few yards from the aſſembly houſe.</p>

                     <p>I SHALL endeavour to ſtate the remainder of this narrative in the words of Mr. Collins. The reader has already had occaſion to perceive that Mr. Collins was a man of no vulgar order; and his reflections on this ſubject were uncommonly judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.</p>
                     <p>"This day was the criſis of Mr. Falkland's hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory. From hence took its beginning that gloomy and unſociable melancholy of which he has ſince been the victim. No two characters can be in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain reſpects more ſtrongly contraſted, than the Mr. Falkland of a date prior and ſubſequent to theſe events. Hitherto he had been attended by a fortune perpetually proſperous. His mind was ſanguine; full of that undoubting confidence in its own powers which proſperity is qualified to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce. Though the habits of his life were thoſe of a ſerious and ſublime viſionary, they were never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs full of chearfulneſs and tranquillity. But from this moment his pride and the lofty adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turouſneſs of his ſpirit were effectually ſubdued. From an object of envy he was changed into an object of compaſſion. Life, which hitherto no one had ſo exquiſitely enjoyed, became a burthen to him. No more ſelf-complacency, no more rapture, no more ſelf-approving and heart-tranſporting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence! He, who had lived beyond any man upon the grand and animating reveries of the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, ſeemed now to have no viſions but of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh and deſpair. His caſe was peculiarly worthy of ſympathy, ſince no doubt, if rectitude and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:028752_0137_0FDBF0A39660A728"/>
of diſpoſition could give a title to happineſs, few men could exhibit a more conſiſtent and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful claim than Mr. Falkland.</p>
                     <p>"He was too deeply pervaded with the idle and groundleſs romances of chivalry ever to forget the ſituation, humiliating and diſhonourable according to his ideas, in which he had been placed upon this occaſion. There is a myſterious ſort of divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity annexed to the perſon of a true knight, that makes any ſpecies of brute violence committed upon it indelible and immortal. To be knocked down, cuffed, kicked, dragged along the floor! ſacred heaven, the memory of ſuch a treatment was intolerable! No future luſtration could ever remove the ſtain: and, what was perhaps ſtill worſe in the preſent caſe, the offender having ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to exiſt, the luſtration which the laws of knight-errantry preſcribe was rendered impoſſible.</p>

If Mr. Falkland had reflected with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect accuracy upon the caſe, he would probably have been able to look down with indifference upon a wound which, as it was, pierced to his very vitals. How much more dignity than in the modern duel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt do we find in Themiſtocles, the moſt gallant of the Greeks; who, when Eurybiades, his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in chief, in anſwer to ſome of his remonſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, lifted his cane over him with a menacing air, accoſted him in that noble apoſtrophe, Strike, but hear?</p>

"Theſe reaſonings, however ſimple and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible they muſt be found by a diſpaſſionate en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirer, are little reflected on by the world at large, and were moſt of all uncongenial to the prejudices of Mr. Falkland. But the public diſgrace and chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement that had been impoſed upon him, intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable as they were to be recollected, were not the whole of the miſchief that redounded to our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate patron from the tranſactions of that day. It was preſently whiſpered that he was no other than the murderer of his antagoniſt. This rumour was of too much importance to the very continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his life, to juſtify its being concealed from him. He heard it with inexpreſſible aſtoniſhment and horror; it formed a dreadful addition to the load of intellectual anguiſh that already oppreſſed him. No man had ever held his reputation ſo dear to him as Mr. Falkland; and now in one day he was fallen under the moſt exquiſite calamities, a complicated perſonal inſult, and the imputation of the fouleſt of crimes. He might have fled; for no one was forward to proceed againſt a man ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored as Mr. Falkland, or in revenge of one ſo univerſally execrated as Mr. Tyrrel.

as ſoon as he arrived at it, and, when they enquired for him of the waiters, they were given to underſtand that he had mounted his horſe and rode home. In conſideration of theſe particulars the magiſtrates concluded that they could not be juſtified but in committing Mr. Falkland to priſon. His defence was manly, logical, and impreſſive. But, though they entertained the ſtrongeſt preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his innocence, they conceived that they were obliged in their capacity to proceed upon the unfortunate circumſtances that appeared againſt the accuſed, and commit him for his deliverance to a trial by his country. In all this Mr. Falkland was nearly paſſive. He ſeemed to fear by too direct an appeal to judicature to render more preciſe an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation the memory of which he deprecated, at the ſame time that he was ſufficiently willing to meet the ſevereſt ſcrutiny, and, if he could not hope to have it forgotten that he had ever been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, to prove in the moſt ſatisfactory manner that the accuſation was unjuſt.</p>

You ſeem never to have heard of this memorable tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action; and indeed that is little to be wondered at, ſince the good nature of the world is intereſted in ſuppreſſing it, and it is deemed a diſgrace to a man to have held up his hand at a criminal bar, though acquitted with circumſtances the moſt ſatisfactory and honourable. It may be ſuppoſed that this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion is particularly acceptable to Mr. Falkland; and I ſhould not have acted in contradiction to his modes of thinking in communicating the ſtory to you, had there not been circumſtances of peculiar urgency that ſeemed to render the communication deſirable.</p>

                     <p>"My lord, and gentlemen of the jury,</p>
                     <p>"I ſtand here accuſed of a crime the moſt black that any human creature is capable of perpetrating. I am innocent. I have no fear that I ſhall fail to make every perſon in this court acknowledge my innocence. In the mean time what muſt be my feelings? Conſcious as I am of deſerving approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and not cenſure, of having paſſed my life in acts of juſtice and philanthropy, can any thing be more deplorable than for me to ſtand here to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer a charge of murder? So wretched is my ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that I cannot accept your gratuitous acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, if you ſhould be diſpoſed to beſtow it. I muſt anſwer to an imputation, the very thought of which is ten thouſand times worſe than death. I muſt exert the whole energy of my mind to prevent my being ranked with the vileſt of men.</p>
                     <p>"Gentlemen, this is a ſituation in which a man may be allowed to boaſt. Accurſed ſituation! No man need envy me the vile and polluted triumph I am now to gain! I have called no witneſſes to my character. Great God! what ſort of a character is that which muſt be ſupported by witneſſes? But, if I muſt ſpeak, look round the court, aſk of every one preſent, enquire of your own hearts!
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:028752_0142_0FDBF06552F0EC38"/>
Not one word of reproach was ever whiſpered againſt my character. I do not heſitate to call upon thoſe who have known me moſt to afford me the moſt honourable teſtimony.</p>
                     <p>"My life has been ſpent in the keeneſt and moſt unintermitted ſenſibility to reputation. I am almoſt indifferent as to what ſhall be the event of this day. I would not open my mouth upon the occaſion, if my life were the only thing that was at ſtake. It is not in the power of your verdict to reſtore to me my unblemiſhed reputation, to obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate the diſgrace I have ſuffered, or to prevent it from being remembered that I have been brought to trial upon a charge of murder. Your verdict can never have the efficacy to prevent the miſerable remains of my exiſtence from being the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable of all burthens.</p>
                     <p>"I am accuſed of having committed murder upon the body of Barnabas Tyrrel. I would moſt joyfully have given every farthing I poſſeſs, and devoted myſelf to perpetual beggary, to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved his life. His life was precious to me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond that of all mankind. In my opinion the greateſt injuſtice committed by his unknown aſſaſſin was that of defrauding me of my juſt revenge. I confeſs that I would have called him out to the field, and that our encounter ſhould not have been terminated but by the death of one or both of us. This would have been a pitiful and inadequate compenſation for his unparalleled inſult, but it was all that remained.</p>
                     <p>"I aſk for no pity, but I muſt openly declare that never was any misfortune ſo horrible as mine. I would willingly have taken refuge from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection of that night in a voluntary death. Life was now ſtripped of all thoſe recommendations for the ſake of which it was dear to me. But even this conſolation is denied me. I am com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:028752_0143_0FDBF0AB1EE03C60"/>
to drag for ever the intolerable load of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence, upon penalty, if at any period however remote I ſhake it off, of having that impatience regarded as confirming a charge of murder. Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, if by your verdict you could take away my life, without that act being connected with my diſgrace, I would bleſs the cord that ſuſpended the breath of my exiſtence for ever.</p>
                     <p>"You all know how eaſily I might have fled from this purgation. If I had been guilty, ſhould I not have embraced the opportunity? But, as it was, I could not. Reputation has been the idol, the jewel of my life. I could never have borne to think that a human creature in the remoteſt part of the globe ſhould believe that I was a criminal. Alas! what a deity it is that I have choſen for my worſhip! I have entailed upon myſelf everlaſting agony and deſpair!</p>
                     <p>"I have but one word to add. Gentlemen, I charge you to do me the imperfect juſtice that your office puts in your power! My life is a worthleſs thing. But my honour, the paltry remains of honour I have now to boaſt, is in your judgment. It is little that you can do for me; but it is not leſs your duty to do that little. May that God who is the fountain of honour and good, proſper and protect you! The man who now ſtands before you is devoted to perpetual barrenneſs and blaſt! He has nothing to hope for beyond the feeble con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation of this day!"</p>
                     <p>"You will eaſily imagine that Mr. Falkland was acquitted with every circumſtance of honour. Nothing is more to be deplored in human inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions than that the forms of juſtice ſhould thus ſubject a man, of whoſe innocence every one was convinced, to a ſpecies of purgation to which the ideas of mankind have annexed a ſentiment of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace. Nobody entertained the ſhadow of a doubt
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:028752_0144_0FDBF069DBBDAB58"/>
upon the ſubject, and yet a mere incidental con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of circumſtances made it neceſſary that the beſt of men ſhould be publicly arraigned as if really under ſuſpicion of an atrocious crime. It may be granted indeed that Mr. Falkland had his faults, but thoſe very faults placed him at a ſtill farther diſtance from the criminality in queſtion. He was the fool of honour and fame; a man whom in the purſuit of reputation nothing could divert; who would have purchaſed the character of a true, gallant and undaunted hero at the expence of worlds, and who thought every calamity nominal but a ſtain upon his honour. How atrociouſly abſurd to ſuppoſe any motive capable of inducing ſuch a man to play the part of a lurking aſſaſſin? How unfeeling to oblige him to defend himſelf from ſuch an imputation in a court of juſtice? Did any man, and leaſt of all a man of the pureſt honour, ever paſs in a moment from a life unſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a ſingle act of injury to the conſummation of human depravity?</p>
                     <p>"When the verdict of the jury was given, a general murmur of applauſe and involuntary tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port burſt forth in the court. It was at firſt low, and gradually became louder. As it was the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of rapturous delight and an emotion diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted and divine, ſo there was an indeſcribable ſomething in the very ſound that carried it home to the heart, and convinced every ſpectator that no perſonal pleaſure ever exiſted that was not fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh and feeble in the compariſon. Every one ſtrove who ſhould moſt expreſs his eſteem of the amiable accuſed. Mr. Falkland was no ſooner withdrawn, than the gentlemen in the court crowded together to conſult how they ſhould moſt effectually expreſs their congratulation. They immediately named a deputation to wait upon him for that purpoſe. The grand jury and the petty jury drew up an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:028752_0145_0FDBF0B163D22698"/>
of a ſimilar nature. The very judges and counſel, though leſs acquainted with his perſonal character, were ſtrongly impreſſed with the mute and univerſal teſtimony they witneſſed in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and zealouſly concurred to aſſiſt the general ſentiment. It was a ſort of ſympathetic feeling that took hold upon all ranks and degrees. The multitude received him with huzzas, they took his horſes from his carriage, dragged him in triumph, and attended him many miles in his return to his own habitation. It ſeemed as if a public trial be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a criminal judge, which had hitherto been conſidered in every event as a brand of diſgrace, was converted in the preſent inſtance into an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of enthuſiaſtic adoration and unexampled honour.</p>
                     <p>"But nothing could reach the heart of Mr. Falkland. He was not inſenſible to the general kindneſs and exertions; but it was too evident that the melancholy that had taken hold of his mind was invincible.</p>
                     <p>"It was only a few weeks after this memorable trial that the real murderer was diſcovered. Every part of this ſtory was extraordinary. The real murderer was Hawkins. He was found with his ſon under a feigned name at a village at about thirty miles diſtance, in want of all the neceſſaries of life. He had lived here from the period of his flight in ſo private a manner, that all the enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that had been ſet on foot by the benevolence of Mr. Falkland or the inſatiable malice of Mr. Tyrrel had been inſufficient to diſcover him. The firſt thing that had led to the detection was a parcel of clothes covered with blood that were found in a ditch, and which, when drawn out, were known by the people of the village to belong to this man. The murder of Mr. Tyrrel was not a circumſtance that could be unknown, and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:028752_0146_0FDBF06C128DEC78"/>
was immediately rouſed. A diligent ſearch being made, the ruſty handle with part of the blade of a knife was ſound thrown in a corner of his lodging, which being applied to a piece of the point of a knife that had been broken in the wound, appeared exactly to correſpond. Upon farther enquiry two ruſtics, who had been acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally on the ſpot, remembered to have ſeen Hawkins and his ſon in the town that very even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and to have called after them, and received no anſwer, though they were ſure of their perſons. Upon this accumulated evidence both Hawkins and his ſon were tried, condemned and afterwards executed. In the interval between the ſentence and execution Hawkins confeſſed his guilt with many marks of compunction; though there are perſons by whom this is denied; but I have taken ſome pains to enquire into the fact, and am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that their diſbelief is precipitate and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.</p>
                     <p>"The cruel injuſtice that this man had ſuffered from his village tyrant was not forgotten upon the preſent occaſion. It was by a ſtrange fatality that the barbarous proceedings of Mr. Tyrrel ſeemed never to fall ſhort of their completion; and even his death ſerved eventually to conſummate the ruin of a man he hated, a circumſtance, which, if it could have come to his knowledge, would perhaps have in ſome meaſure conſoled him for his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely end. This poor Hawkins was ſurely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to ſome pity, ſince his being finally urged to deſperation, and brought, together with his ſon, to an ignominious fate, was originally owing to the ſturdineſs of his virtue and independence. But the compaſſion of the public was in a great meaſure ſhut againſt him, as they thought it a piece of barbarous and unpardonable ſelfiſhneſs, that he had not rather come boldly forward to
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:028752_0147_0FDBF0B29851F3C0"/>
meet the conſequences of his own conduct, than ſuffer a man of ſo much public worth as Mr. Falk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and who had been ſo deſirous of doing him good, to be tried for a murder that he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
                     <p>"From this time to the preſent Mr. Falkland has been nearly ſuch as you at preſent ſee him. Though it be ſeveral years ſince theſe tranſactions, the impreſſion they made is for ever freſh in the mind of our unfortunate patron. From thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward his habits became totally different. He had before been fond of public ſcenes, and acting a part in the midſt of the people among whom he immediately reſided. He now made himſelf a rigid recluſe. He had no aſſociates, no friends. Inconſolable himſelf, he yet wiſhed to treat others with kindneſs. There was a ſolemn ſadneſs in his manner, attended with the moſt perfect gentleneſs and humanity. Every body reſpects him, for his benevolence is unalterable; but there is a ſtately coldneſs and reſerve in his behaviour, which makes it difficult for thoſe about him to regard him with the familiarity of affection. Theſe ſymptoms are uninterrupted, except at certain times when his ſufferings become intolerable, and he diſplays the marks of a furious inſanity. At thoſe times his language is fearful and myſterious, and he ſeems to figure to himſelf by turns every ſort of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution and alarm which may be ſuppoſed to attend upon an accuſation of murder. But, ſenſible of his own weakneſs, he is anxious at ſuch times to withdraw into ſolitude; and his domeſtics in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral know nothing of him but the uncommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and haughty, yet mild dejection that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies every thing he does."</p>

                     <p>I HAVE ſtated the narrative of Mr. Collins, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſperſed with ſuch other information as I was able to collect, with all the exactneſs that my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, aſſiſted by certain memorandums I made at the time, will afford. I do not pretend to warrant the authenticity of any part of theſe memoirs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſo much as fell under my own knowledge, and that part ſhall be ſtated with the ſame ſimplicity and accuracy that I would obſerve towards a court which was to decide in the laſt reſort upon every thing dear to me. The ſame ſcrupulous fidelity reſtrains me from altering the manner of Mr. Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins's narrative to adapt it to the precepts of my own taſte; and it will ſoon be perceived how eſſential that narrative is to the elucidation of my own hiſtory.</p>
                     <p>The intention of my friend in this communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was to give me eaſe; but he in reality added to my embarraſſment. Hitherto I had had no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe with the world and its paſſions; and, though I was not totally unacquainted with them as they appear in books, this proved to be of little ſervice to me when I came to witneſs them myſelf. The caſe ſeemed entirely altered, when the ſubject of thoſe paſſions was continually before my eyes, and the events had happened but the other day as it were, in the very neighbourhood where I lived. There was a connection and progreſs in this nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, which made it altogether unlike the little village incidents I had hitherto known. My feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:028752_0149_0FDBF0FA933BF340"/>
were ſucceſſively intereſted for the different perſons that were brought upon the ſcene. My veneration was excited for Mr. Clare, and my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe for the intrepidity of Mrs. Hammond. I was aſtoniſhed that any human creature ſhould be ſo ſhockingly perverted as Mr. Tyrrel. I paid the tribute of my tears to the memory of the artleſs Miſs Melvile. I found a thouſand freſh reaſons to admire and love my maſter.</p>
                     <p>At firſt I was ſatisfied with thus conſidering every incident in its obvious ſenſe. But the ſtory I had heard was for ever in my thoughts, and I was peculiarly intereſted to comprehend its full im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. I turned it a thouſand ways, and examined it in every point of view. In the original commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication it appeared ſufficiently diſtinct and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory; but, as I brooded over it, it gradually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came myſterious. There was ſomething ſtrange in the character of Hawkins. So firm, ſo ſturdily honeſt and juſt, as he appeared at firſt; all at once to become a murderer! His firſt behaviour under the proſecution, how accurately was it calculated to prepoſſeſs one in his favor! To be ſure, if he were guilty, it was very cruel of him to ſuffer a man of ſo much worth as Mr. Falkland to be tried for his crime! And yet I could not help bitterly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionating the honeſt fellow, brought to the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, as he was, ſtrictly ſpeaking, by the machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of that devil incarnate, Mr. Tyrrel. His ſon too, that ſon for whom he voluntarily ſacrificed his all, to die with him at the ſame tree; ſurely never was a ſtory more affecting!</p>
                     <p>Was it poſſible after all that Mr. Falkland ſhould be the murderer? The reader will ſcarcely believe that the idea ſuggeſted itſelf to my mind, that I would aſk him. It was but a paſſing thought; but it ſerves to mark the ſimplicity of my charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Then I recollected the virtues of my maſter,
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:028752_0150_0FDBF0BAFAAB8800"/>
almoſt too ſublime for human nature; I thought of his ſufferings ſo unexampled, ſo unmerited; and chid myſelf for the ſuſpicion. The dying confeſſion of Hawkins recurred to my mind; and I felt that there was no longer a poſſibility of doubting. And yet what was the meaning of all Mr. Falkland's agonies and terrors? In fine, the idea having once occurred to my mind, it was fixed there for ever. My thoughts fluctuated from conjecture to conjecture, but this was the centre about which they revolved. I determined to place myſelf as a watch upon my maſter.</p>
                     <p>The inſtant I had choſen this employment for myſelf, I found a ſtrange ſort of pleaſure in it. To do what is forbidden always has its charms, becauſe we have an indiſtinct apprehenſion of ſomething arbitrary and tyrannical in the prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. To be a ſpy upon Mr. Falkland! That there was danger in the employment ſerved to give an alluring pungency to the choice. I remembered the ſtern reprimand I had received, his terrible looks; and the recollection gave a kind of tingling ſenſation, not altogether unallied to enjoyment. The farther I advanced, the more the ſenſation was irreſiſtible. I ſeemed to myſelf perpetually upon the brink of being countermined, and perpetually rouſed to guard my deſigns. The more impene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable Mr. Falkland was determined to be, the more uncontroulable was my curioſity. Through the whole my alarm and apprehenſion of perſonal danger, had a large mixture of frankneſs and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, conſcious of meaning no ill, that made me continually ready to ſay every thing that was upon my mind, and would not ſuffer me to believe that, when things were brought to the teſt, any one could be ſeriouſly angry with me.</p>
                     <p>Theſe reflections led gradually to a new ſtate of my mind. When I had firſt removed into Mr.
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:028752_0151_0FDBF0FCE3DEC8F8"/>
Falkland's family, the novelty of the ſcene render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me cautious and reſerved. The diſtant and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn manners of my maſter ſeemed to have anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilated my conſtitutional gaiety. But the novelty by degrees wore off, and my conſtraint in the ſame degree diminiſhed. The ſtory I had now heard, and the curioſity it excited, reſtored to me acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, eagerneſs and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ourage. I had always had a propenſity to communicate my thoughts; my age was naturally inclined to talkativeneſs; and I ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured occaſionally in a ſort of heſitating way, as if queſtioning whether ſuch a conduct might be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to expreſs my ſentiments as they aroſe, in the preſence of Mr. Falkland.</p>
                     <p>The firſt time I did ſo, he looked at me with an air of ſurpriſe, made me no anſwer, and preſently took occaſion to leave me. The experiment was ſoon after repeated. My maſter ſeemed half in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to encourage me, and yet doubtful whether he might venture. He had been long a ſtranger to pleaſure of every ſort, and my artleſs and untaught remarks appeared to promiſe him ſome amuſement. In this uncertainty he could not probably find it in his heart to treat with ſeverity my innocent ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions. I needed but little encouragement: for the perturbation of my mind ſtood in want of this relief. My ſimplicity, ariſing from my being a total ſtranger to the intercourſe of the world, was accompanied with a mind in ſome degree cultivated with reading, and perhaps not altogether deſtitute of obſervation and talent. My remarks were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore perpetually unexpected, at one time implying extreme ignorance, and at another ſome portion of acuteneſs, but at all times having an air of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, frankneſs and courage. There was ſtill an apparent want of deſign in the manner, even after I was excited accurately to compare my obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations and ſtudy the inferences to which they led;
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:028752_0152_0FDBF0BC5BA550F8"/>
for the effect of old habit was more viſible, than that of a recently-conceived purpoſe which was hardly yet mature. Mr. Falkland's ſituation was like that of a fiſh that plays with the bait employed to entrap him. By my manner he was in a certain degree encouraged to lay aſide his uſual reſerve and relax his ſtatelineſs; till ſome abrupt obſervation or interrogatory ſtung him into recollection and brought back his alarm. Still it was evident that he bore about him a ſecret wound. Whenever the cauſe of his ſorrows was touched, though in a manner the moſt indirect and remote, his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance altered, his diſtemper returned, and it was with difficulty that he could ſuppreſs his emotions, ſometimes conquering himſelf with painful effort, and ſometimes burſting into a ſort of paroxiſm of inſanity, and haſtening to bury himſelf in ſolitude. Theſe appearances I too frequently interpreted into grounds of ſuſpicion, though I might with equal probability and more liberality have aſcribed them to the cruel mortifications he had encountered in the objects of his darling ambition. Mr. Collins had ſtrongly urged me to ſecrecy; and Mr. Falk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, whenever my geſture or his conſciouſneſs impreſſed him with the idea of my knowing more than I expreſſed, looked at me with wiſtful earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as queſtioning what was the degree of infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation I poſſeſſed, and how it was obtained. But again at our next interview the ſimple vivacity of my manner reſtored his tranquillity, obliterated the emotion of which I had been the cauſe, and placed things afreſh in their former ſituation. The longer this humble familiarity on my part had continued, the more effort it would require to ſuppreſs it; and Mr. Falkland was neither willing to mortify me by a ſevere prohibition of ſpeech, nor even perhaps to make me of ſo much conſequence as that prohibition might ſeem to imply. Though I
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:028752_0153_0FDBF1012B07EE20"/>
was curious, it muſt not be ſuppoſed that I had the object of my enquiry for ever in my mind, or that my queſtions and innuendos were perpetually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated with the cunning of a grey-headed inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitor. The ſecret wound of Mr. Falkland's mind was much more uniformly preſent to his recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection than to mine; and a thouſand times he applied the remarks that occurred in converſation, when I had not the remoteſt idea of ſuch an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication till ſome ſingularity in his manner brought it back to my thoughts. The conſciouſneſs of this morbid ſenſibility, and the imagination that its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence might perhaps conſtitute the whole of the caſe, ſerved probably to ſpur Mr. Falkland again to the charge, and connect a ſentiment of ſhame with every project that ſuggeſted itſelf for interrupting the freedom of our intercourſe.</p>
                     <p>I will give a ſpecimen of the converſations to which I allude, and as it ſhall be ſelected from thoſe which began upon topics the moſt general and remote, the reader will eaſily imagine the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbance that was almoſt daily endured by a mind ſo tremblingly alive as that of my maſter.</p>
                     <p>Pray, ſir, ſaid I, one day as I was aſſiſting Mr. Falkland in arranging ſome papers previouſly to their being tranſcribed into his collection, how came Alexander of Macedon to be ſurnamed the Great?</p>
                     <p>How came it? Did you never read his hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory?</p>
                     <p>Yes, ſir.</p>
                     <p>Well, Williams, and could you find no reaſons there?</p>
                     <p>Why, I do not know, ſir. I could find reaſons why he ſhould be famous; but every man that is talked of, is not admired. Judges differ about the merits of Alexander. Doctor Prideaux ſays in his Connections that he deſerves only to be called the
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:028752_0154_0FDBF0C2EB6FDB98"/>
Great Cut-throat, and the author of Tom Jones has written a volume to prove that he and all other conquerors ought to be claſſed with Jonathan Wild.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Falkland involuntarily reddened at theſe citations.</p>
                     <p>Accurſed blaſphemy! Did theſe authors think that by the coarſeneſs of their ribaldry they could deſtroy his well-earned fame? Are learning, ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and taſte no ſecurities to exempt their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor from this vulgar abuſe? Did you ever read, Williams, of a man more gallant, generous and free? Was ever mortal ſo completely the reverſe of every thing engroſſing and ſelfiſh? He formed to himſelf a ſublime image of excellence, and his only ambition was to realiſe it in his own ſtory. Remember his giving away every thing when he ſet out upon his grand expedition, profeſſedly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving for himſelf nothing but hope. Recollect his heroic confidence in Philip, the phyſician, and his entire and unalterable friendſhip for Epheſtion. He treated the captive family of Darius with the moſt cordial urbanity, and the venerable Syſigambis with all the tenderneſs and attention of a ſon to his mother. Never take the judgment, Williams, upon ſuch a ſubject of a clerical pedant or a Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter juſtice. Examine for yourſelf, and you will find in Alexander a model of honour, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity and diſintereſtedneſs, a man who for the cultivated liberality of his mind and the unparallel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed grandeur of his projects muſt ſtand alone the ſpectacle and admiration of all ages of the world.</p>
                     <p>Ah, ſir! it is a very fine thing for us to ſit here and compoſe his panegyric. But would you have me forget what a vaſt expence was beſtowed in erecting the monument of his fame? Was not he the common diſturber of mankind? Did nor he overrun nations that would never have heard of him, but for his devaſtations? How many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

                        </gap>acrifice in his ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer?

Man is ſurely a ſtrange ſort of creature, who never praiſes any one more heartily than him who has ſpread deſtruction and ruin over the face of nations!</p>
                     <p>The way of thinking you expreſs, Williams, is natural enough, and I cannot blame you for it. But let me hope that you will become more liberal. The death of a hundred thouſand men is at firſt fight very ſhocking; but what in reality are a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand ſuch men more than a hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſheep? It is mind, Williams, the generation of knowledge and virtue that we ought to love. This was the project of Alexander; he ſet out in a great undertaking to civiliſe mankind; he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered the vaſt continent of Aſia from the ſtupidity and degradation of the Perſian monarchy; and, though he was cut off in the midſt of his career, we may eaſily perceive the vaſt effects of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. Grecian literature and cultivation, the Seleucidae, the Antiochuſes and the Prolomies fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, in nations which before had been ſunk to the condition of brutes. Alexander was the builder as notoriouſly as the deſtroyer of cities.</p>
                     <p>And yet, ſir, I am afraid that the pike and the battle-axe are not the right inſtruments for making men wiſe. Suppoſe it were admitted that the lives of men were to be ſacrificed without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe if a paramount good were to reſult, it ſeems to me as if murder and maſſacre were but a very left-handed way of producing civiliſation and love. But pray, do not you think this great hero was a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

firing the palace of Perſepolis, his weeping for other worlds to conquer, and his marching his whole army over the burning ſands of Lybia, merely to viſit a temple, and perſuade mankind that he was the ſon of Jupiter Ammon?</p>
                     <p>Alexander, my boy, has been much miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. Mankind have revenged themſelves upon him by miſrepreſentation, for having ſo far eclipſed the reſt of his ſpecies. It was neceſſary to the realiſing his project that he ſhould paſs for a God. It was the only way by which he could get a firm hold upon the veneration of the ſtupid and bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goted Perſians. It was this, and not a mad va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, that was the ſource of his proceeding. And how much had he to ſtruggle with in this reſpect in the unapprehending obſtinacy of ſome of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonians?</p>
                     <p>Why then, ſir, at laſt Alexander did but employ means that all politicians profeſs to uſe, as well as he. He dragooned men into wiſdom, and cheated them into the purſuit of their own happineſs. But what is worſe, ſir, this Alexander in the paroxyſm of his headlong rage ſpared neither friend nor foe. You will not pretend to juſtify the exceſſes of his ungovernable paſſion. It is impoſſible ſure that a word can be ſaid for a man whom a momentary provocation can hurry into the commiſſion of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders—</p>
                     <p>The inſtant I had uttered theſe words, I felt what it was that I had done. There was a mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netical ſympathy between me and my maſter, ſo that their effect was not ſooner produced upon him, than my own mind reproached me with the inhumanity of the alluſion. Our confuſion was mutual. The blood forſook at once the tranſparent complexion of Mr. Falkland, and then ruſhed back again with rapidity and fierceneſs. I dared not
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:028752_0157_0FDBF1045A60EA18"/>
utter a word, leſt I ſhould commit a new error worſe than that into which I had juſt fallen. After a ſhort, but ſevere, ſtruggle to continue the converſation, Mr. Falkland began with trepidation, but afterwards became calmer:</p>
                     <p>You are not candid—Alexander—You muſt learn more clemency—Alexander, I ſay, does not deſerve this rigour. Do you remember his tears, his remorſe, his determined abſtinence from food, which he could ſcarcely be perſuaded to alter? Did not that prove acute feeling and a rooted principle of equity?—Well, well, Alexander was a true and judicious lover of mankind, and his real me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits have been little comprehended.</p>
                     <p>I know not how to make the ſtate of my mind at that moment accurately underſtood. When one idea has got poſſeſſion of the mind, it is ſcarcely poſſible to keep it from finding its way to the lips. Error, once committed, has a faſcinating power, like the eyes of the rattle-ſnake, to draw us into a ſecond error. It deprives us of that proud confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in our own ſtrength, to which we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted for ſo much of our virtue. Curioſity is a reſtleſs propenſity, and often does but hurry us forward the more irreſiſtibly, the greater is the danger that attends its indulgence.</p>
                     <p>Clitus, ſaid I, was a man of very coarſe and provoking manners, was he not?</p>
                     <p>Mr. Falkland felt the full force of this appeal. He gave me a penetrating look as if he would ſee my very ſoul. His eyes were then in an inſtant withdrawn. I could perceive him ſeized with a convulſive ſhuddering, which, though ſtrongly counteracted, and therefore ſcarcely viſible, had I know not what of terrible in it. He left his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, ſtrode about the room in anger, his viſage gradually aſſumed an expreſſion as of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:028752_0158_0FDBF0C857A84640"/>
barbarity, he quitted the apartment abrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and flung the door with a violence that ſeemed to ſhake the houſe.</p>
                     <p>Is this, ſaid I, the fruit of conſcious guilt, or of the diſguſt that a man of honour conceives at guilt undeſervedly imputed?</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XIV.</head>
                     <p>THE reader will feel how rapidly I was advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the brink of the precipice. I had a confuſed apprehenſion of what I was doing, but I could not ſtop myſelf. Is it poſſible, ſaid I, that Mr. Falkland, who is thus overwhelmed with a ſenſe of the unmerited diſhonour that has been faſtened upon him in the face of the word, will long endure the preſence of a raw and unfriended youth, who is perpetually bringing back that diſhonour to his recollection, and who ſeems himſelf the moſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to entertain the accuſation?</p>
                     <p>I felt indeed that Mr. Falkland would not haſtily incline to diſmiſs me, for the ſame reaſon that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained him from many other actions which might ſeem to ſavour of a too tender and ambiguous ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility. But this reflexion was little adapted to comfort me. That he ſhould cheriſh in his heart a growing hatred againſt me, and that he ſhould think himſelf obliged to retain me a continual thorn in his ſide, was an idea by no means of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable augury to my future peace.</p>
                     <p>It was ſome time after this that in clearing out a caſe of drawers I found a paper that by ſome acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent had ſlipped behind one of the drawers, and been overlooked. At another time perhaps my curioſity might have given way to the laws of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum, and I ſhould have reſtored it unopened to my maſter, its owner. But my eagerneſs for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation had been too much ſtimulated by the preceding incidents to allow me at preſent to neglect
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:028752_0160_0FDBF0C92C0AF6A0"/>
any occaſion of obtaining it. The paper proved to be a letter written by the elder Hawkins, and from its contents ſeemed to have been penned when he had firſt been upon the point of abſconding from the perſecutions of Mr. Tyrrel. It was as follows.</p>
                     <floatingText type="letter">

                           <opener>
                              <salute>Honourable Sir,</salute>
                           </opener>
                           <p>I have waited ſome time in daily hope of your honour's return into theſe parts. Old Gines and his dame, who are leſt to take care of your houſe, tell me, they cannot ſay when that will be, nor juſtly in what part of England you are at preſent. For my ſhare misfortune comes ſo thick upon me, that I muſt determine upon ſomething (that is for certain), and out of hand. Our ſquire, who I muſt own at firſt uſed me kindly enough, though I am afraid that was partly out of ſpite to ſquire Underwood, has ſince determined to be the ruin of me. Sir, I have been no craven; I fought it up ſtoutly; for after all, you know, God bleſs your honour! it is but a man to a man; but he has been too much for me.</p>
                           <p>Perhaps if I were to ride over to the market town and enquire of Munſle, your lawyer, he could tell me how to direct to you. But having hoped and waited o' this faſhion, and all in vain, has put me upon other thoughts. I was in no hurry, ſir, to apply to you; for I do not love to be a trouble to other people. I kept that for my laſt ſtake. Well, ſir, and now that has failed me like, I am aſhamed as it were to have thought of it. Have not I, thinks I, arms and legs as well as other people? I am driven out of houſe and home. Well, and what then? Sure I arn't a cabbage, that if you pull it out of the ground, it muſt die. I am pennyleſs. True; and how many hundreds are there that live from hand to mouth all the days

                           <p>But there is another thing that has ſwayed with me more than all the reſt. I do not know how to tell you, ſir—My poor boy, my Leonard, the pride of my life, has been three weeks in the county jail. It is true indeed, ſir. Squire Tyrrel put him there. Now, ſir, every time that I lay my head upon my pillow under my own little roof, my heart ſmites me with the ſituation of my Leonard. I do not mean ſo much for the hardſhip; I do not ſo much matter that. I do not expect him to go through the world upon velvet; I am not ſuch a fool. But who can tell what may hap in a jail? I have been three times to ſee him; and there is one man in the ſame quarter of the priſon that looks ſo wicked! I do not much fancy the looks of the reſt. To be ſure Leonard is as good a lad as ever lived. I think he will not give his mind to ſuch. But, come what will, I am determined he ſhall not ſtay among them twelve hours longer. I am an obſtinate old fool perhaps; but I have taken it into my head, and I will do it. Do not aſk me what. But, if I were to write to your honour, and wait for your anſwer, it might take a week or ten days more. I muſt not think of it!</p>
                           <p>Squire Tyrrel is very headſtrong, and you, your honour, might be a little hottiſh or ſo. No, I would not have any body quarrel for me. There has been miſchief enough done already; and I will get myſelf out of the way. So I write this, your honour, merely to unload my mind. I feel myſelf equally as much bound to reſpect and love you, as if you had done every thing for me that I believe you would have done if things had chanced dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently.
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:028752_0162_0FDBF0CA951CCCE8"/>
It is moſt likely you will never hear of me any more. If it ſhould be ſo, ſet your worthy heart at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

I have been uſed ill enough, God knows. But I bear no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice; my heart is at peace with all mankind; and I forgive every body. It is like enough that poor Leonard and I may have hardſhip enough to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo, among ſtrangers and being obliged to hide ourſelves like houſe-breakers or highwaymen.

                     <p>I read this letter with conſiderable attention, and it occaſioned me many reflections. To my way of thinking it contained a very intereſting picture of a blunt, downright, honeſt mind. It is a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy conſideration, ſaid I to myſelf; but ſuch is man! To have judged from appearances one would have ſaid, This is a fellow, to have taken fortune's buffets and rewards with an incorruptible mind. And yet ſee where it all ends! This man was capable of afterwards becoming a murderer, and finiſhing his life at the gallows. O poverty! thou art indeed omnipotent! Thou grindeſt us into deſperation; thou confoundeſt all our boaſted and moſt deep-rooted principles; thou filleſt us to the very brim with malice and revenge, and rendereſt us capable of acts of unknown horror! May I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be viſited by thee in the fulneſs of thy power!</p>

Having ſatisfied my curioſity with reſpect to this paper, I took care to diſpoſe of it in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as that it ſhould be found by Mr. Falkland; at the ſame time that, in obedience to the principle which at preſent governed me with abſolute domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, I was willing that the way in which it offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed itſelf to his attention, ſhould ſuggeſt to him the idea that it had poſſibly paſſed through my hands. The next morning I ſaw him, and I exerted myſelf to lead the converſation, which by this time I well knew how to introduce, by inſenſible degrees to the point I deſired. After ſeveral previous queſtions, remarks and rejoinders, I continued:</p>
                     <p>Well, ſir, after all, I cannot help feeling very uncomfortably as to my ideas of human nature, when I find that there is no dependence to be placed upon its perſeverance, and that, at leaſt among the illiterate, the moſt promiſing appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may end in the fouleſt diſgrace.</p>
                     <p>You think then that literature and a cultivated mind are the only aſſurance for the conſtancy of our principles?</p>
                     <p>Um!—why do you ſuppoſe, ſir, that learning and ingenuity do not often ſerve people rather to hide their crimes, than to reſtrain them from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting them? Hiſtory tells us ſtrange things in that reſpect.</p>
                     <p>Williams! ſaid Mr. Falkland, a little diſturbed, you are ſtrangely given to cenſure and ſeverity.</p>
                     <p>I hope not. I am ſure I am moſt fond of look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the other ſide of the picture, and conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how many men have been aſperſed, and even at ſome time or other almoſt torn to pieces by their fellow creatures, whom, when properly underſtood, we find worthy of our reverence and love.</p>
                     <p>Indeed, replied Mr. Falkland with a ſigh, when I conſider theſe things, I do not wonder at the dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exclamation of Brutus, O Virtue! I ſought
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:028752_0164_0FDBF0CF0760A430"/>
thee as a ſubſtance, but I find thee an empty name! I am too much inclined to be of his opinion.</p>
                     <p>Why to be ſure, ſir, innocence and guilt are too much confounded in human life. I remember a very affecting ſtory of a poor man in the reign of queen Elizabeth, who would have infallibly been hanged for murder upon the ſtrength of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial evidence, if the perſon really concerned had not been himſelf upon the jury, and prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it.</p>
                     <p>In ſaying this I touched the ſpring that waken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed madneſs in his mind. He came up to me with a ferocious countenance as if determined to force me into a confeſſion of my thoughts. A ſudden pang however ſeemed to change his deſign; he drew back with trepidation; and exclaimed, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted be the univerſe, and the laws that govern it! Honour, juſtice, virtue are all the juggle of knaves! If it were in my power, I would inſtantly cruſh the whole ſyſtem into nothing!</p>
                     <p>I replied; Oh, ſir! things are not ſo bad as you imagine. The world was made for men of ſenſe to do what they will with it. Its affairs cannot be better than in the direction of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine heroes; and, as in the end they will be found the trueſt friends of the whole, ſo the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude have nothing to do, but to look on, be faſhioned and admire.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Falkland made a powerful effort to recover his tranquillity. Williams! ſaid he, you inſtruct me well. You have a right notion of things, and I have great hopes of you. I will be more of a man. I will forget the paſt, and do better for the time to come. The future, the future is always our own.</p>
                     <p>I am ſorry, ſir, that I have given you pain. I am afraid to ſay all that I think. But it is my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that miſtakes will ultimately be cleared up,
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:028752_0165_0FDBF110537268A8"/>
juſtice be done, and the true ſtate of things come to light in ſpite of the falſe colours that may for a time obſcure it.</p>
                     <p>The idea I ſuggeſted did not give Mr. Falkland the proper degree of delight. He ſuffered a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary relapſe. Juſtice!—he muttered. I do not know what is juſtice. My caſe is not within the reach of common remedies; perhaps of none. I only know that I am miſerable. I began life with the beſt intentions and the moſt fervid philanthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py; and here I am—miſerable—miſerable beyond expreſſion or endurance.</p>
                     <p>Having ſaid this, he ſeemed ſuddenly to recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect himſelf, and re-aſſume his accuſtomed dignity and command. How came this converſation? cried he. Who gave you a right to be my confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent? Baſe, artful wretch that you are! learn to be more reſpectful! Are my paſſions to be wound and unwound by an inſolent domeſtic? Do you think I will be an inſtrument to be played on at your pleaſure, till you have extorted all the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of my ſoul? Begone, and fear le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t you be made to pay for the temerity you have already committed.</p>
                     <p>There was an energy and determination in the geſtures with which theſe words were accompanied that did not admit of their being diſputed. My mouth was cloſed; I felt as if deprived of all ſhare of activity, and was only able ſilently and paſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to quit the apartment.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XV.</head>
                     <p>TWO days ſubſequent to this converſation Mr. Falkland ordered me to be called to him. [I ſhall continue to ſpeak in my narrative of the ſilent, as well as the articulate part of the intercourſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us. His countenance was habitually ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated and expreſſive much beyond that of any other man I have ſeen. The curioſity, which, as I have ſaid, conſtituted at this time my ruling paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſtimulated me to make it my perpetual ſtudy. It will alſo moſt probably happen, while I am thus employed in collecting together the ſcattered inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of my hiſtory, that I ſhall upon ſome occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions annex to appearances an explanation, which I was far from poſſeſſing at the time, and was only ſuggeſted to me through the medium of ſubſequent events.]</p>
                     <p>Upon this occaſion Mr. Falkland's countenance exhibited an unwonted compoſure. This compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure however did not ſeem to reſult from internal eaſe, but from an effort which, while he prepared himſelf for an intereſting ſcene, was exerted to prevent his preſence of mind and power of volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary action from ſuffering any diminution.</p>
                     <p>Williams, ſaid he, I am determined, whatever it may coſt me, to have an explanation with you. You are a raſh and inconſiderate boy, and have given me a great deal of diſturbance. You ought to have known that, though I allow you to talk with me upon indifferent ſubjects, it is very impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in you to lead the converſation to any thing
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:028752_0167_0FDBF1159DD55FF8"/>
that relates to my perſonal concerns. You have ſaid many things lately in a very myſterious way, and appear to know ſomething more than I am aware of. I am equally at a loſs to gueſs how you came by your knowledge, as of what it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts. But I think I perceive too much inclination on your part to trifle with my peace of mind. That ought not to be, nor have I deſerved any ſuch treatment from you. But, be that as it will, the gueſſes in which you oblige me to employ myſelf are too painful. It is a ſort of ſporting with my feeling, which, as a man of reſolution, I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to bring to an end. I expect you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to lay aſide all myſtery and equivocation, and inform me explicitly what it is upon which your alluſions are built. What is it you know? What is it you want? I have been too much expoſed already to an unparalleled mortification and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and my wounds will not bear this perpetual handling.</p>
                     <p>I feel, ſir, anſwered I, how wrong I have been, and am aſhamed that ſuch a one as I ſhould have given you all this trouble and diſpleaſure. I felt it at the time; but I have been hurried along I do not know how. I have always tried to ſtop myſelf, but the devil that poſſeſſed me was too ſtrong for me. I know nothing, ſir, but what Mr. Collins told me. He told me the ſtory of Mr. Tyrrel and Miſs Melvile and Hawkins. I am ſure, ſir, he ſaid nothing but what was to your honour, and proved you to be more an angel than a man.</p>
                     <p>Well, ſir: I found a letter written by that Haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins the other day: did not that letter fall into your hands? Did not you read it?</p>
                     <p>For God's ſake, ſir, turn me out of your houſe. Puniſh me in ſome way or other, that I may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give myſelf. I am a fooliſh, wicked, deſpicable wretch. I confeſs, ſir, I did read the letter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="166" facs="unknown:028752_0168_0FDBF0D2123ACB38"/>
And how dared you read it? It was indeed very wrong of you. But we will talk of that by and by. Well, and what did you ſay to the letter? You know it ſeems that Hawkins was hanged.</p>
                     <p>I ſay, ſir? why it went to my heart to read it. I ſay, as I ſaid the day before yeſterday, that, when I ſee a man of ſo much principle, afterwards deliberately proceeding to the very worſt of crimes, I can ſcarcely bear to think of it.</p>
                     <p>That is what you ſay? It ſeems too you know, accurſed remembrance! that I was tried for this crime?</p>
                     <p>I was ſilent.</p>
                     <p>Well, ſir. You know too perhaps that, from the hour the crime was committed,—yes, ſir, that was the date [and, as he ſaid this, there was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what frightful, I had almoſt ſaid diabolical, in his countenance]—I have not had an hour's peace; I became changed from the happieſt into the moſt miſerable thing that lives; ſleep has fled from my eyes; joy has been a ſtranger to my thoughts; and annihilation I ſhould prefer a thouſand times to the being that I lead. As ſoon as I was capable of a choice, I choſe honour and the eſteem of mankind as a good I preferred to all others. You know, it ſeems, in how many ways my ambition has been diſappointed,—I do not thank Collins for having been the hiſtorian of my diſgrace,—Would to God that night could be blotted from the memory of man!—But the ſcene of that night, inſtead of periſhing, has been a ſource of ever new cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to me, which muſt flow for ever! Am I then, thus miſerable and ruined, a proper ſubject for you upon which to exerciſe your ingenuity, and improve your power of tormenting? Was it not enough that I was publicly diſhonoured? that I was deprived by the peſtilential influence of ſome demon of the opportunity of avenging my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour?
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:028752_0169_0FDBF11AAEBCA150"/>
No: in addition to this I have been tried upon the charge of having in this critical mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment intercepted my own vengeance by the fouleſt of crimes. That trial is paſt. Miſery itſelf has nothing worſe in ſtore for me except what you have inflicted: the ſeeming to doubt of my inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence which neither perſecutor, nor judge, nor jury ever ventured to do. You have forced me to this explanation. You have extorted from me a confidence which I had no inclination to confer. But it is a part of the miſery of my ſituation, that I am at the mercy of every creature, however little, who feels himſelf inclined to ſport with my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs. Be content. You have brought me low enough.</p>
                     <p>Oh, ſir! I am not content; I cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent! I cannot bear to think what I have done. I ſhall never again be able to look in the face the beſt of maſters and the beſt of men. I beg of you, ſir, to turn me out of your ſervice. Let me go and hide myſelf where I may never ſee you more.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Falkland's countenance had indicated great ſeverity through the whole of this converſation; but now it became more harſh and tempeſtuous than ever. How now, raſcal! cried he. You want to leave me, do you? Who told you that I wiſhed to part with you? But you cannot bear to live with ſuch a miſerable wretch as I am! You are not diſpoſed to put up with the caprices of a man ſo diſſatisfied and unjuſt!</p>
                     <p>Oh, ſir! do not talk to me thus! Do with me any thing you will. Kill me if you pleaſe.</p>
                     <p>Kill you! [Volumes could not deſcribe the emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with which this echo of my words was given and received.]</p>
                     <p>Sir, I could die to ſerve you! I love you more than I can expreſs. I worſhip you as a being of a ſuperior nature. I am fooliſh, raw, inexperienced,

                        </gap>ſe;—but never did a thought of diſloyalty to your ſervice enter into my heart.</p>
                     <p>Here our converſation ended; and the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion it made upon my youthful mind it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to deſcribe. I thought with aſtoniſhment, even with rapture, of the attention and kindneſs towards me I diſcovered in Mr. Falkland through all the roughneſs of his manner. I could never wonder enough at finding myſelf, humble as I was by my birth, obſcure as I had hitherto been, thus ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly become of ſo much importance to the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of one of the moſt enlightened and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed men in England. But this conſciouſneſs attached me to my maſter more eagerly than ever, and made me ſwear a thouſand times as I medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated upon my ſituation, that I would never prove unworthy of ſo generous a protector.</p>

                     <p>IS it not unaccountable that, in the midſt of all my increaſed veneration for my maſter, the firſt tumult of my emotion was ſcarcely ſubſided, before the old queſtion that had excited my conjectures recurred to my mind, Was he the murderer? It was a kind of fatal impulſe that ſeemed deſtined to hurry me to deſtruction. I did not wonder at the diſturbance that was given to Mr. Falkland by any alluſion however diſtant to this fatal affair. That was as completely accounted for from the conſideration of his exceſſive ſenſibility in matters of honour, as it would have been upon the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the moſt atrocious guilt. Knowing as he did, that ſuch a charge had once been connect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his name, he would of courſe be perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually uneaſy, and ſuſpect ſome latent inſinuation at every poſſible opportunity. He would doubt and fear, leſt every man with whom he converſed harboured the fouleſt ſuſpicions againſt him. In my caſe he found that I was in poſſeſſion of ſome information more than he was aware of, without its being poſſible for him to decide to what it amounted, whether I had heard a juſt or unjuſt, a candid or calumniatory tale. He had alſo reaſon to ſuppoſe that I gave entertainment to thoughts derogatory to his honour, and that I did not form that favourable judgment which the exquiſite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement of his ruling paſſion made indiſpenſable to his peace. All theſe conſiderations would of courſe maintain in him a ſtate of perpetual uneaſineſs.
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:028752_0172_0FDBF0D755D83190"/>
But, though I could find nothing that I could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider as juſtifying me in perſiſting in the ſhadow of a doubt, yet, as I have ſaid, the uncertainty and reſtleſſneſs of my contemplations would by no means depart from me.</p>
                     <p>The fluctuating ſtate of my mind produced a contention of oppoſite principles that by turns uſurped dominion over my conduct. Sometimes I was influenced by the moſt complete veneration for my maſter; I placed an unreſerved confidence in his integrity and his virtue, and implicitly ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered my underſtanding for him to ſet it to what point he pleaſed. At other times the confidence, which had before flowed with the moſt plenteous tide, began to ebb; I was, as I had already been, watchful, inquiſitive, ſuſpicious, full of a thouſand conjectures as to the meaning of the moſt indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent actions. Mr. Falkland, who was moſt pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully alive to every thing that related to his honour, ſaw theſe variations, and betrayed his conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of them now in one manner and now in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, frequently before I was myſelf aware, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times almoſt before they exiſted. The ſituation of both was diſtreſſing; we were each of us a plague to the other; and I often wondered that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance and benignity of my maſter was not at length exhauſted, and that he did not determine to thruſt from him for ever ſo inceſſant an obſerver. There was indeed one eminent difference between his ſhare in the tranſaction and mine. I had ſome conſolation in the midſt of my reſtleſſneſs. Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity is a principle that carries its pleaſures as well as its pains along with it. The mind is urged by a perpetual ſtimulus; it ſeems as if it were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually approaching to the end of its race; and, as the inſatiable deſire of ſatisfaction is its princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of conduct, ſo it promiſes itſelf in that ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction an unknown gratification, which ſeems as
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:028752_0173_0FDBF11F51F58CA8"/>
if it were capable of fully compenſating any inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that may be ſuffered in the career. But to Mr. Falkland there was no conſolation. What he endured in the intercourſe between us appeared to be all gratuitous evil. He had only to wiſh that there was no ſuch perſon as myſelf in the world, and to curſe the hour when his humanity led him to reſcue me from my obſcurity, and place me in his ſervice.</p>
                     <p>A conſequence produced upon me by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary nature of my ſituation it is neceſſary to mention. The conſtant ſtate of vigilance and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion in which my mind was retained worked a very rapid change in my character. It ſeemed to have all the effect that might have been expected from years of obſervation and experience. The ſtrictneſs with which I endeavoured to remark what paſſed in the mind of one man, and the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of conjectures into which I was led, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as it were to render me a competent adept in the different modes in which the human intellect diſplays its ſecret workings. I no longer ſaid to myſelf, as I had done in the beginning, "I will aſk Mr. Falkland whether he were the murderer." On the contrary, after having carefully examined the different kinds of evidence of which the ſubject was ſuſceptible, and recollecting all that had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready paſſed upon the ſubject, it was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſiderable pain that I felt myſelf unable to diſcover any way in which I could be perfectly and unalterably ſatisfied of my maſter's innocence. As to his guilt, I could ſcarcely bring myſelf to doubt that in ſome way or other, ſooner or later, I ſhould arrive at the knowledge of that, if it really exiſted. But I could not endure to think almoſt for a moment of that ſide of the alternative as true; and, with all my ungovernable ſuſpicion, ariſing from the myſteriouſneſs of the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:028752_0174_0FDBF0DCE8C08A78"/>
and the delight which a young and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fledged mind receives from ideas that give ſcope to all that imagination can picture of terrible or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime, I could not yet bring myſelf to conſider Mr. Falkland's guilt as a ſuppoſition attended with the remoteſt probability.</p>
                     <p>I hope the reader will forgive me for dwelling thus long on preliminary circumſtances. I ſhall come ſoon enough to the ſtory of my own miſery. I have already ſaid that one of the motives which induced me to the penning of this narrative was to conſole myſelf in my inſupportable diſtreſs. I derive a melancholy pleaſure from dwelling upon the circumſtances which imperceptibly paved the way to my ruin. While I recollect or deſcribe paſt ſcenes which occurred in a more favourable period of my life, my attention is called off for a ſhort interval from the hopeleſs misfortune in which I am at preſent involved. The man muſt indeed poſſeſs an uncommon portion of hardneſs of heart, who can envy me ſo ſlight a relief.—To proceed.</p>
                     <p>For ſome time after the explanation which had thus taken place between me and my maſter, his melancholy, inſtead of being in the ſlighteſt degree diminiſhed by the lenient hand of time, went on perpetually to increaſe. His fits of inſanity, for ſuch I muſt denominate them for want of a diſtinct appellation, though it is poſſible they might not fall under the definition that either the faculty or the court of chancery appropriate to that term, became ſtronger and more durable than ever. It was no longer practicable wholly to conceal them from the family and even from the neighbourhood. He would ſometimes without any previous notice abſent himſelf from his houſe for two or three days, unaccompanied by any ſervants or attendants. This was the more extraordinary, as it was well
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:028752_0175_0FDBF12492F3A388"/>
known that he paid no viſits, nor kept up any ſort of intercourſe with the gentlemen of the vicinity. But it was impoſſible that a man of Mr. Falkland's diſtinction and fortune ſhould long continue in ſuch a practice without its being diſcovered what was become of him, though a conſiderable part of our county was among the wildeſt and moſt deſolate diſtricts that are to be ſound in South Britain. Mr. Falkland was ſometimes ſeen climbing among the rocks, reclining motionleſs for hours together upon the edge of a precipice, or lulled into a kind of nameleſs lethargy of deſpair by the daſhing of the torrents. He would remain for whole nights together under the naked cope of heaven, inatten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the conſideration either of place or time, inſenſible to the variations of the weather, or rather ſeeming to be delighted with that uproar of the elements which partially called off his attention from the diſcord and dejection which occupied his own mind.</p>
                     <p>At firſt, when we received intelligence at any time of the place to which Mr. Falkland had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn himſelf, ſome perſon of his houſhold, Mr. Collins or myſelf, but moſt generally myſelf, as I was always at home, and always in the received ſenſe of that word at leiſure, went to him to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade him to return. But after a few experiments we thought it adviſeable to deſiſt, and to leave my maſter to prolong his abſence, or to terminate it, as might happen to ſuit his own inclination. Mr. Collins, whoſe grey hairs and long ſervices ſeemed to give him a ſort of right to be importunate, ſometimes ſucceeded; though even in that caſe there was nothing that could ſit more uneaſy upon Mr. Falkland than this inſinuation as if he wanted a guardian to take care of him, or as if he were, or were in danger of, falling into a ſtate in which he would be incapable of deliberately controuling
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:028752_0176_0FDBF0DE1201CD60"/>
his own words and actions. At one time he would ſullenly yield to his humble, venerable friend, murmuring grievouſly at the conſtraint that was put upon him, but without ſpirit enough even to complain of it with energy. At another time, even though complying, he would ſuddenly burſt out in a paroxyſm of reſentment. Upon theſe oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions there was ſomething inconceivably, ſavagely terrible in his anger, that gave to the perſon againſt whom it was directed the moſt humiliating and inſupportable ſenſations. Me he always treated at theſe times with fierceneſs, and drove me from him with a vehemence, lofty, emphatical and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained beyond any thing of which I ſhould have thought human nature to be capable. Theſe ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies ſeemed always to conſtitute a ſort of criſis in his indiſpoſition; and, whenever he was induced to ſuch a premature return, he would fall imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after into a ſtate of the moſt melancholy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>activity, in which he uſually continued for two or three days. It was by an obſtinate fatality that, whenever I ſaw Mr. Falkland in theſe deplorable ſituations, and particularly when I lighted upon him after having ſought him among the rocks and precipices, pale, emaciated, ſolitary and haggard, the ſuggeſtion would continually recur to me, in ſpite of inclination, in ſpite of perſuaſion, and in ſpite of evidence, Surely this man is a murderer!</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XVII.</head>
                     <p>IT was in one of the lucid intervals, as I may term them, that occurred during this period, that a peaſant was brought before him, in his character of a juſtice of peace, upon an accuſation of having murdered his fellow. As Mr. Falkland had by this time acquired the repute of a melancholy valetudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narian, it is probable he would not have been called upon to act in his official character upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent occaſion, had it not been that two or three of the neighbouring juſtices were all of them from home at once, ſo that he was the only one to be found in a circuit of many miles. The reader however muſt not imagine, though I have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed the word inſanity in deſcribing Mr. Falk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land's ſymptoms, that he was by any means reckoned for a madman by the generality of thoſe who had occaſion to obſerve him. It is true that his behaviour at certain times was ſingular and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable; but then at other times there was in it ſo much dignity, regularity and economy; he knew ſo well how to command and make himſelf reſpected; his actions and carriage were ſo conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending, conſiderate and benevolent; that, far from having forfeited the eſteem of the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate or the many, they were loud and earneſt in his praiſes.</p>
                     <p>I was preſent at the examination of this peaſant. The moment I heard of the errand which had brought this rabble of viſitors, a ſudden thought ſtruck me. I conceived the poſſibility of rendering
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:028752_0178_0FDBF0DF6E40C648"/>
the incident ſubordinate to the great enquiry which drank up all the currents of my ſoul. I ſaid, This man is arraigned of murder, and murder is the maſter-key that wakes diſtemper in the mind of Mr. Falkland. I will watch him without remiſſion. I will trace all the mazes of his thought. Surely at ſuch a time his ſecret anguiſh muſt betray itſelf. Surely, if it be not my own fault, I ſhall now be able to diſcover the true ſtate of his plea before the tribunal of unerring juſtice.</p>
                     <p>I took my ſtation in a manner moſt favourable to the object upon which my mind was intent. I could perceive in Mr. Falkland's features as he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered a ſtrong reluctance to the buſineſs in which he was engaged; but there was no poſſibility of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating. His countenance was embarraſſed and anxious; he ſcarcely ſaw any body. The exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation had not proceeded far before he chanced to turn his eye to the part of the room where I was. It happened in this, as in ſome preceding in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; we exchanged a ſilent look by which we told volumes to each other. Mr. Falkland's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion turned from red to pale, and from pale to red. I perfectly underſtood his feelings, and would willingly have withdrawn myſelf. But it was impoſſible; my paſſions were too deeply en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged; I was rooted to the ſpot: though my own life, that of my maſter, or almoſt of a whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had been at ſtake, I had no power to change my poſition.</p>
                     <p>The firſt ſurpriſe however having ſubſided, Mr. Falkland aſſumed a look of determined conſtancy, and even ſeemed to increaſe in ſelf-poſſeſſion much beyond what could have been expected from his firſt entrance. This he could probably have main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, had it not been that the ſcene, inſtead of being permanent, was in ſome ſort perpetually changing. The man who was brought before him
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:028752_0179_0FDBF12639A04608"/>
was vehemently accuſed by the brother of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed as having acted from the moſt rooted ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice. He ſwore that there had been an old grudge between the parties, and related ſeveral inſtances of it. He affirmed that the murderer had ſought the earlieſt opportunity of wreaking his revenge, had ſtruck the firſt blow, and, though the conteſt was in appearance only a common boxing match, had watched the occaſion of giving a fatal ſtroke which was followed by the inſtant death of his antagoniſt.</p>
                     <p>While the accuſer was giving in his evidence, the accuſed diſcovered every token of the moſt poignant ſenſibility. At one time his features were convulſed with anguiſh, tears unbidden rolled down his manly cheeks; and at another be ſtarted with aſtoniſhment at the unfavourable turn that was given to the narrative, though without betraying any impatience to interrupt. I never ſaw a man leſs ferocious in his appearance. He was tall, well made and comely. His countenance was ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and benevolent, without folly. By his ſide ſtood a young woman, his ſweetheart, extremely agreeable in her perſon, and her looks teſtifying how deeply ſhe intereſted herſelf in the fate of her lover. The accidental ſpectators were divided between indignation againſt the enormity of the ſuppoſed criminal, and compaſſion for the poor girl that accompanied him. They ſeemed to take little notice of the favourable appearances viſible in the perſon of the accuſed, till in the ſequel thoſe appearances were more forcibly ſuggeſted to their attention. For Mr. Falkland, he was at one moment engroſſed by curioſity and earneſtneſs to inveſtigate the tale, while at another be betrayed a ſort of revulſion of ſentiment which made the inveſtigation too painful for him to ſupport.</p>
                     <p>When the accuſed was called upon for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, he readily owned the miſunderſtanding that
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:028752_0180_0FDBF0E3183812C0"/>
had exiſted, and that the deceaſed was the worſt enemy he had in the world. Indeed he was his only enemy, and he could not tell the reaſon that had made him ſo. He had employed every poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble effort to overcome his animoſity, but in vain. The deceaſed had upon all occaſions ſought to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify him, and do him an ill turn; but he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved never to be engaged in a broil with him, and till this day he had ſucceeded. If he had met with a misfortune with any other man, people at leaſt might have thought it matter of accident; but now it would always be believed that he had acted from ſecret malice and a bad heart.</p>
                     <p>The fact was that he and his ſweetheart had gone to a neighbouring fair, where this man had met them. The man had often tried to affront him, and his paſſiveneſs, interpreted into cowardice, had perhaps encouraged the other to additional rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Finding that he had endured trivial inſults to himſelf with an even temper, the deceaſed now thought proper to turn his brutality upon the young woman that accompanied him. He purſued them; he endeavoured in various manners to harraſs and vex them; they had ſought in vain to ſhake him off. The young woman was conſiderably terrified. The accuſed expoſtulated with their perſecutor, and aſked him how he could be ſo barbarous as to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in frightening a woman? He replied with an inſulting tone, Then the woman ſhould find ſome one able to protect her; people that encouraged and truſted to ſuch a thief as that, deſerved no better! The accuſed tried every expedient he could invent; at length he could endure it no longer; he became exaſperated, and challenged the aſſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant. The challenge was accepted; a ring was formed; he confided the care of his ſweet-heart to a byſtander; and unfortunately the firſt blow he ſtruck proved fatal.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="179" facs="unknown:028752_0181_0FDBF12C6D0D18A8"/>
The accuſed added that he did not care what became of him. He had been anxious to go through the world in an inoffenſive manner, and now he had the guilt of blood upon him. He did not know but it would be a kindneſs in them to hang him out of the way; for his conſcience would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach him as long as he lived, and the figure of the deceaſed, as he had laid ſenſeleſs and without motion at his feet, would perpetually haunt him. The thought of this man, at one moment full of life and vigour, and the next lifted a helpleſs corpſe from the ground, and all owing to him, was a thought too dreadful to be endured. He had loved the poor maiden who had been the innocent occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this with all his heart, but from this time he ſhould never ſupport the ſight of her. The ſight would bring a tribe of fiends in its rear. One unlucky minute had poiſoned all his hopes, and made life a burden to him.—Saying this his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance fell, the muſcles of his face trembled with agony, and he looked the ſtatue of depair.</p>
                     <p>This was the ſtory of which Mr. Falkland was called upon to be the auditor. Though the incidents were for the moſt part wide of thoſe which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the adventures we have juſt related, and there had been much leſs policy and ſkill diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played on either part in this ruſtic encounter, yet there were many points which, to a man who bore the former ſtrongly in his recollection, ſuggeſted a ſufficient reſemblance. Theſe points perpetually ſmote upon the heart of Mr. Falkland. He at one time ſtarted with aſtoniſhment, and at another ſhift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his poſture like a man who is unable longer to endure the ſenſations that preſs upon him. Then he new-ſtrung his nerves to ſtubborn patience. I could ſee, while his muſcles preſerved an inflexible ſteadineſs, tears of unbidden anguiſh roll down his cheeks. He dared not truſt his eyes to glance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:028752_0182_0FDBF0E4134D3538"/>
the ſide of the room where I ſtood; and this gave an air of embarraſſment to his whole figure. But, when the accuſed came to ſpeak of his own feelings, to deſcribe the depth of his compunction for an involuntary fault, he could endure it no longer. He ſuddenly roſe, and with every mark of horror and deſpair ruſhed out of the room.</p>
                     <p>This circumſtance made no material difference in the affair of the accuſed. The parties were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained about half an hour. Mr. Falkland had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready heard the material parts of the evidence in perſon. At the expiration of that interval, he ſent for Mr. Collins out of the room. The ſtory of the culprit was confirmed by many witneſſes who had ſeen the tranſaction. Word was brought that my maſter was indiſpoſed, and at the ſame time the accuſed was ordered to be diſcharged. The ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of the brother however, as I afterwards un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, did not reſt here, and he ſound a magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate more ſcrupulous or more deſpotic, by whom the culprit was committed.</p>
                     <p>This affair was no ſooner concluded than I haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the garden, and plunged into the deepeſt of its thickets. My mind was full almoſt to burſting. I no ſooner conceived myſelf ſufficiently removed from all obſervation, than my thoughts forced their way ſpontaneouſly to my tongue, and I exclaimed in a ſit of uncontroulable enthuſiaſm: "This is the murderer! the Hawkinses were innocent! I am ſure of it! I will pledge my life of it! It is out! It is diſcovered! Guilty upon my ſoul!"</p>
                     <p>While I thus proceeded with haſty ſteps along the moſt ſecret paths of the garden, and from time to time gave vent to the tumult of my thoughts in involuntary exclamations, I felt as if my animal ſyſtem had undergone a total revolution. My blood boiled within me. I was conſcious to a kind of rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for which I could not account. I was ſolemn,
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:028752_0183_0FDBF12D92A141B0"/>
yet full of rapid emotion, burning with indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and energy. In the very tempeſt and hurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane of the paſſions, I ſeemed to enjoy the moſt ſoul-raviſhing calm. I cannot better expreſs the then ſtate of my mind, than by ſaying, I was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo perfectly alive as at that moment.</p>
                     <p>This ſtate of mental elevation continued for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral hours, but at length ſubſided and gave place to more deliberate reflection. One of the firſt queſtions that then occurred was, What ſhall I do with the knowlege I have been ſo eager to acquire? I had no inclination to turn informer. I felt, what I had had no previous conception of, that it was poſſible to love a murderer, and, as I then under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood it, the worſt of murderers. I conceived it to be in the higheſt degree abſurd and iniquitous to cut off a man qualified for the moſt eſſential and extenſive utility merely out of retroſpect to an act which, whatever were its merits, could not now be retrieved.</p>
                     <p>This thought led me to another which had at firſt paſſed unnoticed. If I had been diſpoſed to turn informer, what had occurred amounted to no evidence that was admiſſible in a court of juſtice. Well then, added I, if it be ſuch as would not be admitted at a criminal tribunal, am I ſure it is ſuch as I ought to admit? There were twenty perſons beſide myſelf preſent at the ſcene from which I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to derive ſuch entire conviction. Not one of them ſaw it in the light that I did. It either ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to them a caſual and unimportant circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, or they thought it ſufficiently accounted for by Mr. Falkland's infirmity and misfortunes. Did it really contain ſuch an extent of arguments and application, that nobody but I was diſcerning enough to ſee?</p>
                     <p>But all this reaſoning produced no alteration in my way of thinking. For this time I could not
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:028752_0184_0FDBF0E6544911C8"/>
get it out of my mind for a moment: "Mr. Falk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land is the murderer! He is guilty! I ſee it! I feel it! I am ſure of it!" Thus was I hurried along by an uncontroulable deſtiny. The ſtate of my paſſions in their progreſſive career, the inquiſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and impatience of my thoughts, appeared to make this determination unavoidable.</p>
                     <p>An incident occured while I was in the garden, that ſeemed to make no impreſſion upon me at the time, but which I recollected when my thoughts were got into ſomewhat of a ſlower motion. In the midſt of one of my paroxyſms of exclamation, and when I thought myſelf moſt alone, the ſhadow of a man as avoiding me paſſed tranſiently by me at a ſmall diſtance. Though I had ſcarcely caught a faint glimpſe of his perſon, there was ſomething in the occurrence that perſuaded me it was Mr. Falkland. I ſhuddered at the poſſibility of his having overheard the words of my ſoliloquy. But this idea, alarming as it was, had not power im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to ſuſpend the career of my reflections. Subſequent circumſtances however brought back the apprehenſion to my mind. I had ſcarcely a doubt of its reality, when dinner time came, and Mr. Falkland was not to be found. Supper and bed-time paſſed in the ſame manner. The only concluſion made by his ſervants upon this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance was, that he was gone upon one of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed melancholy rambles.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XVIII.</head>
                     <p>THE period at which my ſtory is now arrived ſeemed as if it were the very criſis of the fortune of Mr. Falkland. Incident followed upon incident in a kind of breathleſs ſucceſſion. About nine o'clock the next morning an alarm was given that one of the chimnies of the houſe was on fire. No accident could be apparently more trivial; but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently it blazed with ſuch fury, as to make it clear that ſome beam of the houſe, which in the firſt building had been improperly placed, had been reached by the flames. Some danger was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended for the whole edifice. The confuſion was the greater, in conſequence of the abſence of the maſter, as well as of Mr. Collins, the ſteward. While ſome of the domeſtics were employed in endeavouring to extinguiſh the flames, it was thought proper that others ſhould buſy themſelves in removing the moſt valuable moveables to a lawn in the garden. I took ſome command in the affair, to which indeed my ſtation in the family ſeemed to entitle me, and for which I was thought qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified by my underſtanding and mental reſources.</p>
                     <p>Having given ſome general directions, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that it was not enough to ſtand by and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintend, but that I ſhould contribute my perſonal labour in the public concern. I ſet out for that purpoſe; and my ſteps by ſome myſterious fatality were directed to the private apartment at the end of the library. Here, as I looked round, my eye
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:028752_0186_0FDBF0EA75F01718"/>
was ſuddenly caught by the cheſt mentioned in the firſt pages of my narrative.</p>
                     <p>My mind was already raiſed to its utmoſt pitch. In a window-ſeat of the room lay a parcel of chiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and other carpenter's tools. I know not what infatuation inſtantaneouſly ſeized me. The idea was too powerful to be reſiſted. I forgot the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon which I came, the employment of the ſervants and the urgency of general danger. I ſhould have done the ſame, if the apartment round me had been in flames. I ſnatched a tool ſuitable for the purpoſe, threw myſelf upon the ground, and applied with eagerneſs to a magazine which incloſed all for which my heart panted. After two or three efforts, in which the energy or uncontroul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able paſſion was added to my bodily ſtrength, the faſtenings gave way, the cheſt opened, and all that I ſought was at once within my reach.</p>
                     <p>I was in the act of lifting up the lid, when Mr. Falkland entered, wild, breathleſs, diſtraction in his looks! He had been brought home from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable diſtance by the ſight of the flames. At the moment of his appearance the lid dropt down from my hand. He no ſooner ſaw me, than his eyes emitted ſparks of rage. He ran with eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to a brace of loaded piſtols which hung up in the room, and, ſeizing one, preſented it to my head. I ſaw his deſign, and ſprang to avoid it; but with the ſame rapidity with which he had form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his reſolution, he changed it, and inſtantly went to the window and ſlung the piſtol into the court below. He bade me begone with his uſual irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble energy; and, overcome as I was already by the horror of the detection, I eagerly complied.</p>
                     <p>A moment after a conſiderable part of the chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney was tumbled with noiſe into the court below, and a voice exclaimed that the fire was more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent than ever. Theſe circumſtances ſeemed to
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:028752_0187_0FDBF13450D30D78"/>
produce a mechanical effect upon my maſter, who, having firſt locked the cloſet, appeared on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the houſe, aſcended the roof, and was in a moment in every place where his preſence was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. The flames were preſently extinguiſhed.</p>
                     <p>The reader can with difficulty form a concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſtate to which I was now reduced. My act was in ſome ſort an act of inſanity; but how undeſcribable are the feelings with which I looked back upon it! It was an inſtantaneous impulſe, a ſhort lived and paſſing alienation of mind; but what muſt Mr. Falkland think of that alienation? To any man a perſon, who had once ſhown him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf capable of ſo wild a flight of the mind, muſt appear dangerous; how muſt he appear to a man under Mr. Falkland's circumſtances? I had juſt had a piſtol held to my head by a man reſolved to put a period to my exiſtence. That indeed was paſt; but what was it that fate had yet in reſerve for me! The inſatiable vengeance of a Falkland, of a man whoſe hands were to my apprehenſion red with blood and his thoughts familiar with cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty and murder. How great were the reſources of his mind, reſources henceforth to be confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated for my deſtruction! This was the termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an ungoverned curioſity, an impulſe that I had repreſented to myſelf as ſo innocent and ſo venial.</p>
                     <p>In the high tide of boiling paſſion I had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked all conſequences. It now appeared to me like a dream. Is it in man to leap from the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raiſed precipice, or ruſh unconcerned into the midſt of flames? Was it poſſible I could have forgotten for a moment the awe-creating manners of Falk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and the inexorable fury I ſhould awake in his ſoul? No thought of future ſecurity had reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my mind. I had acted upon no plan. I had conceived no means of concealing my deed, after
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:028752_0188_0FDBF0EC567F9520"/>
it had once been effected. But it was over now. One ſhort minute had effected a reverſe in my ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, the ſuddenneſs of which the hiſtory of man perhaps is unable to ſurpaſs.</p>
                     <p>I have always been at a loſs to account for my having plunged thus headlong into an act ſo mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous. There is ſomething in it of unremarked and involuntary ſympathy. One ſentiment flows by neceſſity of nature into another ſentiment of the ſame general character. This was the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in which I had witneſſed a danger by fire. All was confuſion around me, and all changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hurricane within. The general ſituation to my unpractiſed apprehenſion partook of deſperate, and I by contagion became alike deſperate. At firſt I had been in ſome degree calm and collected, but that too was a deſperate effort, and when it gave way, a kind of inſtant inſanity became its ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor.</p>
                     <p>I had now every thing to fear. And yet what was my fault? It proceeded from none of thoſe errors which are juſtly held up to the averſion of mankind; my object had been neither wealth, nor the means of indulgence, nor the uſurpation of power. No ſpark of malignity had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>arboured in my ſoul. I had always reverenced the ſublime mind of Mr. Falkland; I reverenced it ſtill. My offence had merely been a miſtaken thirſt of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Such however it was as to admit neither of forgiveneſs nor remiſſion. This epoch was the criſis of my fate, dividing what may be called the offenſive part, from the defenſive which was the ſole buſineſs of my remaining years. Alas, my offence was ſhort, not aggravated by any ſiniſter intention: but the repriſals I was to ſuffer, are long, and can terminate only with my life!</p>
                     <p>In the ſtate in which I found myſelf, when the recollection of what I had done flowed back upon
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:028752_0189_0FDBF139AF19C128"/>
my mind, I was incapable of any reſolution. All was chaos and uncertainty within me. My thoughts were too full of horror to be ſuſceptible of activity. I felt deſerted of my intellectual powers, palſied in mind, and compelled to ſit in ſpeechleſs expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the miſery to which I was deſtined. To my own conception I was like a man, who, though blaſted with lightning and deprived for ever of the power of motion, ſhould yet retain the conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his ſituation. Death-dealing deſpair was the only idea of which I was ſenſible.</p>
                     <p>I was ſtill in this ſituation of mind when Mr. Falkland ſent for me. His meſſage roufed me from my trance. In recovering I felt thoſe ſickening and loathſome ſenſations, which a man may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed at firſt to endure who ſhould return from the ſleep of death. Gradually I recovered the power of arranging my ideas and directing my ſteps. I underſtood that the minute the affair of the chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney was over Mr. Falkland had retired to his own room. It was evening before he ordered me to be called.</p>
                     <p>I found in him every token of extreme diſtreſs, except that there was an air of ſolemn and ſad com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure that crowned the whole. For the preſent all appearance of gloom, ſtatelineſs and auſterity was gone. As I entered, he looked up, and, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing who it was, ordered me to bolt the door. I obeyed. He himſelf went round the room, and examined all its other avenue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. He then returned to where I was. I trembled in every joint of my frame. I exclaimed within myſelf, "What bloody <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> ſcene has Roſcius now to act?"</p>
                     <p>Williams, ſaid he, in a tone that had more in it of ſorrow than reſentment, I have attempted your life! I am a wretch devoted to the ſcorn and execration of mankind!—There he ſtopped.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="188" facs="unknown:028752_0190_0FDBF0F2277ACFC0"/>
If there be one being in the whole earth, that feels the ſcorn and execration due to ſuch a wretch more ſtrongly than another, it is myſelf. I have been kept in a ſtate of perpetual torture and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But I can put an end to it and its conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences; and, ſo far at leaſt as relates to you, I am determined to do it. I know the price, and—I will make the purchaſe.</p>
                     <p>You muſt ſwear, ſaid he. You muſt atteſt every ſacrament, divine and human, never to diſcloſe what I am now to tell you.—He dictated the oath, and I repeated it with an aching heart. I had no power to offer a word of remark.</p>
                     <p>This confidence, ſaid he, is of your ſeeking, not of mine. It is odious to me, as it is dangerous to you.</p>
                     <p>Having thus prefaced the diſcloſure he had to make, he pauſed. He ſeemed to collect himſelf as for an effort of magnitude. He wiped his face with his handkerchief. The moiſture that incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moded him appeared not to be tears, but ſweat.</p>
                     <p>Look at me. Obſerve me. Is it not ſtrange that ſuch a one as I ſhould retain lineaments of a human creature? I am the blackeſt of villains. I am the murderer of Tyrrel. I am the aſſaſſin of the Hawkinſes.</p>
                     <p>I ſtarted, as if I had trod upon a rattle-ſnake.</p>
                     <p>What a ſtory is mine! Inſulted, diſgraced, pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted in the face of hundreds, I was capable of any act of deſperation. I watched my opportunity, followed Mr. Tyrrel from the rooms, ſeized a ſharp-pointed knife that fell in my way, came behind him, and ſtabbed him to the heart. My gigantic oppreſſor rolled at my feet.</p>
                     <p>All are but links of one chain. A blow! A murder! My next buſineſs was to defend myſelf, to tell ſo well digeſted a lie, as that all mankind
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:028752_0191_0FDBF13ED34BB668"/>
ſhould believe it true. Never was a taſk ſo har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing and intolerable!</p>
                     <p>Well: thus far fortune favoured me. She fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured me beyond my deſire. The guilt was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from me, and caſt upon another; but this I was to endure. Whence came the circumſtantial evidence againſt him, the broken knife and the blood, I am unable to tell. I ſuppoſe by ſome mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous accident he was paſſing by, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to aſſiſt his oppreſſor in the agonies of death. You have heard Hawkins's ſtory; you have read one of his letters. But you do not know the thouſandth part of the proofs of his ſimple and unalterable rectitude that I have known. His ſon ſuffered with him, that ſon for the ſake of whoſe happineſs and virtue he ruined himſelf, and would have died a hundred times.—I have had feelings, but I cannot deſcribe them.</p>
                     <p>This it is to be a gentleman! a man of honour! I was the fool of fame. My virtue, my honeſty, my everlaſting peace of mind were cheap ſacrifices to be made at the ſhine of this divinity. But, what is worſe, there is nothing that has happened that has in any degree contributed to my cure. I am as much the fool of fame as ever, I cling to it to my laſt breath. Though I be the blackeſt of villains, I will leave behind me a ſpotleſs and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious name. There is no crime ſo malignant, no ſcene of blood ſo horrible, in which that object cannot engage me. It is no matter that I regard theſe things at a diſtance with averſion;—I am ſure of it; bring me to the teſt, and I ſhall yield. I deſpiſe myſelf; but thus I am; things are gone too far to be recalled.</p>
                     <p>Why is it that I am compelled to this confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence? From the love of fame. I ſhould tremble at the ſight of every piſtol, or inſtrument of death that offered itſelf to my hands; and perhaps my
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:028752_0192_0FDBF0F3135E86D0"/>
next murder may not be ſo fortunate as thoſe I have already committed. I had no alternative but to make you my confident or my victim. It was better to truſt you with the whole truth under every ſeal of ſecrecy, than to live in perpetual fear of your penetration or your raſhneſs.</p>
                     <p>Do you know what it is you have done? To gratify a fooliſhly inquiſitive humour you have ſold yourſelf. You ſhall continue in my ſervice, but can never ſhare in my affection. I will bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit you in reſpect of fortune, but I ſhall always hate you. If ever an unguarded word eſcape from your lips, if ever you excite my jealouſy or ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, expect to pay for it by your death or worſe. It is a dear bargain you have made. But it is too late to look back. I charge and adjure you by every thing that is ſacred and that is tremendous, preſerve your faith!</p>
                     <p>My tongue has now for the firſt time for ſeveral years ſpoken the language of my heart; and the intercourſe from this hour ſhall be ſhut for ever. I want no pity. I deſire no conſolation. Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded as I am with horrors, I will at leaſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve my fortitude to the laſt. If I had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to a different deſtiny, I have qualities in that reſpect worthy of a better cauſe. I can be mad, miſerable and frantic, but even in frenzy I can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve my preſence of mind and diſcretion.</p>
                     <p>Such was the ſtory I had been ſo earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to know. Though my mind had brooded upon the ſubject for months, there was not a ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable of it that did not come to my ear with the moſt perfect ſenſe of novelty. Mr. Falkland is a murderer! ſaid I, as I retired from the conference. This dreadful appellative "a murderer," made my very blood run cold within me. He killed Mr. Tyrrel, for he could not controul his reſentment and anger: he ſacrificed Hawkins the elder and
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:028752_0193_0FDBF140512A4598"/>
Hawkins the younger, becauſe he could upon no terms endure the public loſs of honour: how can I expect that a man thus paſſionate and unrelenting will not ſooner or later make me his victim?</p>
                     <p>But notwithſtanding this terrible application of the ſtory, an application to which perhaps in ſome form or other mankind are indebted for nine-tenths of their abhorrence againſt vice, I could not help occaſionally recurring to reflections of an oppoſite nature. Mr. Falkland is a murderer! reſumed I. He might yet be a moſt excellent man, if he did but think ſo. It is the thinking ourſelves vicious then, that principally contributes to make us vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious?</p>
                     <p>Amidſt the ſhock I received from finding, what I had never ſuffered myſelf conſtantly to believe, that my ſuſpicions were true; I ſtill diſcovered new cauſe of admiration for my maſter. His menaces indeed were terrible. But, when I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected the offence I had given, ſo contrary to every received principle of civilized ſociety, ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent and rude, ſo intolerable to a man of Mr. Falkland's elevation and in Mr. Falkland's pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity of circumſtances, I was aſtoniſhed at his forbearance. There were indeed ſufficiently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious reaſons why he might not chooſe to proceed to extremities with me. But how different from the fearful expectations I had conceived were the calmneſs of his behaviour and the regulated mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his language! In this reſpect I for a ſhort time imagined that I was emancipated from the miſchiefs which had appalled me, and that in hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to do with a man of Mr. Falkland's liberality I had nothing rigorous to apprehend.</p>
                     <p>It is a miſerable proſpect, ſaid I, that he holds up to me. He imagines that I am reſtrained by no principles, and deaf to the claims of perſonal excellence. But he ſhall find himſelf miſtaken. I
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:028752_0194_0FDBF0F493B66300"/>
will never become an informer. I will never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure my maſter; and therefore he will not be my enemy. With all his misfortunes and all his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, I feel that my ſoul yearns for his welfare. If he have been criminal, that is owing to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; the ſame qualities under other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances would have been, or rather were ſublimely beneficent.</p>
                     <p>My reaſonings were no doubt infinitely more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to my maſter than thoſe which human beings are accuſtomed to make in the caſe of ſuch as they ſtyle great criminals. This will not be wondered at, when it is conſidered that I had my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf juſt been trampling on the eſtabliſhed boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries of obligation, and therefore might well have a fellow-feeling for other offenders. Add to which, I had known Mr. Falkland from the firſt as a beneficent divinity. I had obſerved at leiſure and with a minuteneſs which could not deceive me the excellent qualities of his heart, and I found him poſſeſſed of a mind beyond compariſon the moſt fertile and accompliſhed I had ever known.</p>
                     <p>But, though the terrors which had impreſſed me were conſiderably alleviated, my ſituation was not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſufficiently miſerable. The eaſe and light-heartedneſs of my youth were for ever gone. The voice of an irreſiſtible neceſſity had command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to "ſleep no more." I was tormented with a conſcious ſecret of which I muſt never diſbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then myſelf; and this conſciouſneſs was at my age a ſource of perpetual melancholy. I had made myſelf a priſoner, in the moſt intolerable ſenſe of that term, for years, perhaps for the reſt of my life. Though my prudence and diſcretion ſhould be invariable, I muſt remember that I ſhould have an overſeer, vigilant from conſcious guilt, full of reſentment at the unjuſtifiable means by which I had extorted from him a confeſſion, and whoſe
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:028752_0195_0FDBF14474E08B78"/>
lighteſt caprice might at any time decide upon every thing that was dear to me. The vigilance even of a public and ſyſtematical deſpotiſm is poor, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with a vigilance which is thus goaded by the moſt anxious paſſions of the ſoul. Againſt this ſpecies of perſecution I knew not how to invent a refuge. I dared neither fly from the obſervation of Mr. Falkland, nor continue expoſed to its opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I was at firſt indeed lulled in a certain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to ſecurity upon the verge of the precipice. But it was not long before I found a thouſand cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances perpetually reminding me of my true ſituation. Thoſe I am now to relate are among the moſt memorable.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XIX.</head>
                     <p>IN no long time after the diſcloſure Mr. Falkland had made. Mr. Foreſter, his elder brother by the mother's ſide, came to reſide for a ſhort period in our family. This was a circumſtance peculiarly adverſe to my maſter's habits and inclinations. He had broken off, as I have already ſaid, all inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of viſiting his neighbours. He debarred himſelf every kind of amuſement and relaxation. He ſhrunk from the ſociety of his fellows, and thought he could never be ſufficiently buried in obſcurity and ſolitude. This principle was in moſt caſes of no difficult execution to a man of firmneſs. But Mr. Falkland knew not how to avoid the viſit of Mr. Foreſter. This gentleman was juſt return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from a reſidence of ſeveral years upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, and his demand of an apartment in the houſe of his half-brother till his own houſe at the diſtance of thirty miles ſhould be prepared for his reception, was made with an air of confidence that ſcarcely admitted of a refuſal. Mr. Falkland could only ſay that the ſtate of his health and ſpirits was ſuch, that he feared a reſidence at his houſe would be little agreeable to his kinſman; and Mr. Foreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conceived that this was a diſqualification which would always augment in proportion as it was tolerated, and hoped that his ſociety, by inducing Mr. Falkland to ſuſpend his habits of ſecluſion, would be the means of eſſential benefit. Mr. Falk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land oppoſed him no farther. He would have been ſorry to be thought unkind to a kinſman for
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:028752_0197_0FDBF145B6B5C878"/>
whom he had a particular eſteem; and the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of not daring to aſſign the true reaſon, made him cautious of adhering to his objection.</p>
                     <p>The character of Mr. Foreſter was in many reſpects the reverſe of that of my maſter. Like him he had ſeen much of the world; but to judge of him from the unfaſhioned bluntneſs of his manner, you would have thought he had never ſtirred from his fire-ſide. Yet under this rude ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior it was eaſy to diſtinguiſh various knowledge, nice diſcrimination, and a ſtrong and active mind. Nor was it ill-humour or miſanthropy that gave this turn to Mr. Foreſter's behaviour. He diſclaimed exaggeration of every kind, and was equally averſe to the cynic who paints every thing in the moſt ſplenetic colours, and the ſanguine enthuſiaſt to whom the whole appears to be exactly as it ought. In the mean time, while he hated exaggeration, he was himſelf one of its groſſeſt dupes. He was poſitive in all things, even where good ſenſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired him to be ſceptical; and he roughly imputed perverſeneſs, where true wiſdom would have taught him to correct miſtake. The ſame incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency followed him throughout. Full of origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality and genius, he pretended to deſpiſe them in others. His favourite principle was to care nothing for what the world ſhould ſay, and to aim only at doing right. So long as that debt was diſcharged, he would not ſtoop to purchaſe, at the expence of moving a finger, the applauſe of mankind in prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences to their hatred. He believed that the credit which is ſometimes given to men of ability, was the diſhoneſt gains of a combination, not the juſt reward of merit; and he took pleaſure in ſtating this opinion in its harſheſt form. He held that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> honeſt ploughman is a more uſeful member of ſociety, than all the poets and philoſophers that ever exiſted. In a word, Mr. Foreſter was one of
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:028752_0198_0FDBF17714C5AC38"/>
thoſe men who, with every ſeeming requiſite for the diſcovery of important truth, are all their lives in ſubjection to the moſt contemptible prejudices.</p>
                     <p>The peculiarities of this gentleman's character were not undiſplayed in the ſcene to which he was now introduced. Having much kindneſs in his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, he ſoon became deeply intereſted in the unhappineſs of his relation. He did every thing in his power to remove it; but his attempts were rude and unſkilful. He exhorted his hoſt to pluck up a ſpirit, and defy the foul fiend; but the tone of his exhortations found no ſympathetic chord in the mind of Mr. Falkland. The more he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained the articles of his creed, the more irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable did they appear with thoſe of my maſter. He had not the ſkill to carry conviction to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding ſo well fortified in error; and the leſs ſo as the effort of his reflections had long been turned to a bold and intelligible enunciation of principles, rather than to analyſing the rudiments out of which they were formed. In a word, after a thouſand efforts of kindneſs to his entertainer, he drew off his forces, growling and diſſatisfied with his own impotence, rather than angry at the obſtinacy of Mr. Falkland. He felt no diminution of his affection for him, and was ſincerely grieved to find that he did him ſo little good. Both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in this caſe did juſtice to the merits of the other; at the ſame time that the diſparity of their humours was ſuch as to prevent the ſtranger from being even a dangerous companion to the maſter of the houſe. They had ſcarcely any points of contact in their characters; Mr. Foreſter was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of giving Mr. Falkland that degree either of pain or pleaſure, which can raiſe the ſoul into a tumult and deprive it for a while of tranquillity and ſelf-command.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="197" facs="unknown:028752_0199_0FDBD6CA72C183D8"/>
Our viſitor was a man of an extremely commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicative diſpoſition, and he began to feel himſelf painfully out of his element upon the preſent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. Mr. Falkland was devoted to contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſolitude. He put upon himſelf ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of reſtraint upon the arrival of his kinſman, though even then his darling habits would break out. But when they had ſeen each other a certain number of times, and it was ſufficiently evident that the ſociety of either would be a burthen rather than a pleaſure to the other, they conſented by a ſort of ſilent compact that each ſhould be at liberty to follow his own inclination. Mr. Falkland was in a certain ſenſe the greateſt gainer by this. He returned to the habits of his choice, and acted as nearly as poſſible juſt as he would have done if Mr. Foreſter had not been in exiſtence. But the latter was wholly at a loſs. He had all the diſadvantages of retirement, without being able, as he might have done at his houſe, to bring his own aſſociates or his own amuſements about him.</p>
                     <p>In this ſituation he caſt his eyes upon me. It was his principle to do every thing that his thoughts ſuggeſted, without caring for the forms of the world. He ſaw no reaſon why a peaſant, with certain advantages of education and opportunity, might not be as eligible a companion as a lord: at the ſame time that he was deeply impreſſed with the venerableneſs of old inſtitutions. Reduced as he was to a kind of laſt reſort, he ſound me better qualified for his purpoſe than any other perſon of Mr. Falkland's houſhold. My habitual ſimplicity was extremely agreeable to him: and, be it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by the way, he loved to countenance the appearance of talents, while he profeſſed to be their enemy.</p>
                     <p>The manner in which he began this ſort of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence was ſufficiently characteriſtical. It
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:028752_0200_0FDBF149C04B12C0"/>
was abrupt; but it was ſtrongly ſtamped with eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial benevolence. It was blunt and humorous; but there was attractiveneſs, eſpecially in a caſe of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal intercourſe, in that very ruſticity by which he levelled himſelf with the great bulk of his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. He had to reconcile himſelf, as well as to invite me; not to reconcile himſelf to the poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poning an ariſtocratical vanity, for of that he had a very ſlender portion, but to the trouble of invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, for he loved his eaſe. All this produced ſome irregularity and indeciſion in his own mind, and gave a very whimſical impreſſion to his beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>
                     <p>On my part I was by no means ungrateful for the diſtinction that was paid me. My mind had been relaxed into temporary dejection, but my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve had no alloy of moroſeneſs or inſenſibility. It did not long hold out againſt the condeſcending attentions of Mr. Foreſter. I became gradually heedful, encouraged, confiding. I had a moſt eager thirſt for the knowledge of mankind; and, though no perſon perhaps ever purchaſed ſo dearly the inſtructions he received in that ſchool, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination was in no degree diminiſhed. Mr. Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſter was the ſecond man I had ſeen who ſeemed almoſt as much worth being ſtudied as Mr. Falk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land himſelf. I was glad to eſcape from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs of my thoughts; and, while engaged with this new friend, I forgot the criticalneſs of the evils with which I was hourly menaced.</p>
                     <p>Stimulated by theſe feelings on either part we were never at a loſs for ſubjects of converſation. The obſervations Mr. Foreſter had made in his travels, the ſet of opinions he had formed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, all amuſed and intereſted me. His manner of telling a ſtory or explaining his thoughts was forcible, perſpicuous and original: his ſtyle in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation had an uncommon zeſt, which while it
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:028752_0201_0FDBF17D4BB8B3B0"/>
ſeemed to diſdain ornament, was unconſciouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſperſed with the boldeſt figures; and often wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered into all the vehemence of oratory, while it affected to be blunt, ſimple, and abrupt. Nor was the part I ſuſtained upon theſe occaſions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out its recommendations. I received the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications of my friend with an ingenuous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced mind. If I objected to any of his views, my objections were not drawn from the ſtores of common place, and had therefore the grace of novelty. And I may venture to ſay that my objections depended more for effect upon their inherent value, than upon any poſitiveneſs and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade with which they were announced.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Falkland was deſtined to be for ever un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy; and it ſeemed as if no new incident could occur from which he was not able to extract food for this imperious propenſity. He was wearied with a perpetual repetition of ſimilar impreſſions, and entertained an invincible diſguſt againſt all that was new. The viſit of Mr. Foreſter he regarded with antipathy. He was ſcarcely able to look at him without ſhuddering; an emotion which his gueſt perceived, and pitied as the reſult of habit and diſeaſe rather than of judgment. None of his actions paſſed unremarked; the moſt indifferent excited uneaſineſs and apprehenſion. No ſooner had the firſt overtures of a ſort of intimacy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween me and Mr. Foreſter taken place, than they probably gave birth to ſentiments of jealouſy in the mind of my maſter. It was not long before he intimated to me that it would not be agreeable to him that there ſhould be too much intercourſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween me and his viſitor.</p>
                     <p>What could I do? Young as I was, could it be expected that I ſhould play the philoſopher, and put a perpetual curb upon my inclinations? Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent though I had been, could I voluntarily
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:028752_0202_0FDBF14CCA091398"/>
ſubject myſelf to an eternal penance, and eſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from human ſociety? Could I diſcourage a frankneſs ſo perfectly in conſonance with my wiſhes, and receive in an ungracious way a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that ſtole away my heart?</p>
                     <p>Beſide this, I was but ill prepared for the ſervile ſubmiſſion Mr. Falkland demanded. In early life I was accuſtomed to be much my own maſter. When I firſt entered into Mr. Falkland's ſervice, my perſonal habits were checked by the novelty of my ſituation, and my affections were gained by the high accompliſhments of my patron. To novelty and its influence, curioſity had immediately ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded. Curioſity, ſo long as it laſted, was a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple ſtronger in my boſom than even the love of independence. To that I would have ſacrificed my liberty or my life; I would have ſubmitted to the condition of a Weſt Indian Negro, or to the tortures inflicted by North American ſavages. But the turbulence of curioſity had now ſubſided.</p>
                     <p>As long as the threats of Mr. Falkland had been confined to generals, I endured it. I was conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of the unbecoming action I had committed, and this rendered me humble. But, when he went farther, and undertook to preſcribe to every article of my conduct, my patience was at an end. He ſtretched his power beyond the limits of policy and prudence, and thus brought its very exiſtence into queſtion. I believed that nothing which his rage irritated by the moſt open rebellion could inflict, would be worſe than the ſlavery he now pretended to impoſe. I had been adventurous in the gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of an infantine and unreaſonable curioſity, and I was reſolved not to be leſs adventurous, if need were, in the defence of every thing that can make life a bleſſing. I was prepared for an amica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble adjuſtment of intereſts; I would undertake that Mr. Falkland ſhould never ſuſtain injury through
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:028752_0203_0FDBF17E95821A80"/>
my means; but I expected in return that I ſhould ſuffer no incroachment, but be leſt to the direction of my own underſtanding.</p>
                     <p>I went on then to ſeek Mr. Foreſter's ſociety with eagerneſs; and it is the nature of an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe that does not decline, progreſſively to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe. Mr. Falkland obſerved theſe ſymptoms with viſible perturbation. Whenever I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of their being perceived by him, I betrayed tokens of confuſion; this did not tend to allay his uneaſineſs. One day he drew me aſide; and, with a look of myſterious, but terrible import, addreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me thus:</p>
                     <p>Young man, take warning! Perhaps this is the laſt time you ſhall have an opportunity to take it! I will not always be the butt of your ſimplicity and inexperience, nor ſuffer your weakneſs to triumph over my ſtrength! Why do you trifle with me? You little ſuſpect the extent of my power. At this moment you are ſurrounded with the engines of my vengeance, and before you are aware they will cloſe upon you. You might as well think of eſcaping from the reach of the omnipreſent God, as from mine! If you could touch ſo much as my finger, you ſhould expiate it in hours and months and years of a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of which as yet you have not the remoteſt idea! Remember! I am not talking at random! I do not utter a word, that, if you provoke me, ſhall not be executed to the ſevereſt letter!</p>
                     <p>It may be ſuppoſed that theſe menaces were not without their effect. I withdrew in ſilence. My whole ſoul revolted againſt the treatment I endur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and yet I could not utter a word. Why could not I ſpeak the expoſtulations of my heart, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the compromiſe I meditated? It was inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and not want of ſtrength, that awed me. Every act of Mr. Falkland contained ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of new, and I was unprepared to meet it.
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:028752_0204_0FDBF14DD1180D88"/>
Perhaps it will be found that the greateſt hero owes the propriety of his conduct to the habit of encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering difficulties and calling out with promptneſs the energies of his mind.</p>
                     <p>I contemplated <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>he proceedings of my maſter with the deepeſt aſtoniſhment. Humanity and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral kindneſs were fundamental parts of his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, but in relation to me they were ſterile and inactive. His own intereſt required that he ſhould purchaſe my kindneſs; but he preferred to govern me by terror, and watch me with unceaſing anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. I ruminated with the moſt mournful ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon the nature of my calamity. I believed that no human being was ever placed in a ſituation ſo pitiable as mine. Every atom of my frame ſeemed to have a ſeveral exiſtence, and to crawl within me. I had but too much reaſon indeed to believe that Mr. Falkland's were not empty words. I knew his ability; I felt his aſcendancy. If I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countered him, what chance had I of victory? If I were defeated, what was the penalty I had to ſuffer? Well then, the reſt of my life muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to ſlaviſh ſubjection? Miſerable ſentence! And, if it were, what ſecurity have I againſt the injuſtice of a man, vigilant, capricious and crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal? I envied the condemned wretch upon the ſcaffold. I envied the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> of the inquiſition in the midſt of his torture. They know what they have to ſuffer. I have only to imagine every thing terrible, and then ſay, The fate reſerved for me is worſe than this!</p>
                     <p>It was well for me that theſe ſenſations were but tranſient: human nature could not long ſupport it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf under what I then felt. By degrees my mind ſhook off its burthen. Indignation ſucceeded to emotions of terror. The hoſtility of Mr. Falkland excited hoſtility in me. I was determined I would never calumniate him in matters of the moſt trivial
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:028752_0205_0FDBF1839D9BC1F8"/>
import; much leſs betray the grand ſecret upon which every thing dear to him depended. But, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally abjuring the offenſive, I reſolved to ſtand firmly upon the defenſive. The liberty of acting as I pleaſed I would preſerve at whatever riſque. If I were worſted in the conteſt, I would at leaſt have the conſolation of reflecting that I had exerted myſelf with energy. In proportion as I thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, I drew off my forces from petty incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and felt the propriety of acting with preme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation and ſyſtem. I ruminated inceſſantly upon plans of deliverance, but I was anxious that my choice ſhould not be precipitately made.</p>
                     <p>It was during this period of my deliberation and uncertainty that Mr. Foreſter terminated his viſit. He obſerved a ſtrange diſtance in my behaviour, and in his good-natured, encouraging way chid me for it. I could only anſwer with a gloomy look of myſterious import, and a mournful and expreſſive ſilence. He ſought me for an explanation, but I was now as ingenious in avoiding, as I had before been ardent to ſeek him; and he quitted our houſe, as he afterwards told me, with an impreſſion, that there was ſome ill deſtiny that hung over it, that ſeemed fated to make all its inhabitants miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, without its being poſſible for a by-ſtander to penetrate the reaſon.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XX.</head>
                     <p>MR. Foreſter had left us about three weeks, when Mr. Falkland ſent me upon ſome buſineſs to an eſtate he poſſeſſed in a neighbouring county about fifty miles from his principal reſidence. The road led in a direction wholly wide of the habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our late viſitor. I was upon my return from the place to which I had been ſent, when I began in fancy to take a ſurvey of the various cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of my condition, and by degrees loſt in the profoundneſs of my contemplation all atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the ſurrounding objects. The firſt deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of my mind was to eſcape from the lynx-eyed jealouſy and deſpotiſm of Mr. Falkland; the ſecond to provide, by every effort of prudence and deliberation I could deviſe, againſt the danger with which I well knew my attempt muſt be accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied.</p>
                     <p>Occupied with theſe meditations, I rode many miles before I perceived that I had totally deviated from the right path. At length I rouſed myſelf, and ſurveyed the horizon round me; but I could obſerve nothing with which my organ was previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly acquainted. On three ſides the heath ſtretched as far as the eye could reach; on the fourth I diſcovered at ſome diſtance a wood of no ordinary dimenſions. Before me ſcarcely a ſingle track could be found to mark that any human being had ever viſited the ſpot. As the beſt expedient I could deviſe, I bent my courſe towards the wood I have mentioned, and then purſued as well as I
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:028752_0207_0FDBF184970858D8"/>
was able the windings of the incloſure. This led me after ſome time to the end of the heath, but I was ſtill as much at a loſs as ever reſpecting the road I ſhould purſue. The ſun was hid from me by a grey and cloudy atmoſphere; I was induced to continue along the ſkirts of the wood, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted with ſome difficulty the hedges and other obſtacles that from time to time preſented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. My thoughts were gloomy and diſconſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late; the drearineſs of the day and the ſolitude which ſurrounded me ſeemed to communicate a ſadneſs to my ſoul. I had proceeded a conſiderable way, and was quite overcome with hunger and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue, when I diſcovered a road and a little inn at no great diſtance. I made up to them, and upon enquiry found that, inſtead of purſuing the proper direction, I had taken one that led to Mr. Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſter's, rather than to my own habitation. I alighted, and was entering the houſe, when the appearance of that gentleman ſtruck my eyes.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Foreſter accoſted me with kindneſs, invited me into the room where he had been ſitting, and enquired what accident had brought me to that place. While he was ſpeaking, I could not help recollecting the extraordinary manner in which we were thus once more brought together, and a train of ideas was by this means ſuggeſted to my mind. Some refreſhment was by Mr. Foreſter's order pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for me; I ſat down and partook of it. Still this thought dwelt upon my recollection:—Mr. Falkland would never be made acquainted with our meeting; I had an opportunity thrown in my way, which if I did not improve, I ſhould deſerve all the conſequences that might reſult. I could now converſe with a friend, and a powerful friend, without fear of being watched and overlooked. What wonder that I was tempted to diſcloſe, not Mr. Falkland's ſecret, but my own ſituation, and
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:028752_0208_0FDBF150D13A3B88"/>
receive the advice of a man of worth and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which might perhaps be adequately done without entering into any detail injurious to my maſter?</p>
                     <p>Mr. Foreſter was forward on his part, to learn why it was that I thought myſelf unhappy, and why I had avoided him during the latter part of his reſidence under the ſame roof, as evidently as I had before taken pleaſure in his communications. I told him that I could give him but an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſatisfaction upon theſe points, but what I could I would willingly explain. The fact, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, was, that there were certain reaſons which rendered it impoſſible for me to have a tranquil moment under the roof of Mr. Falkland. I had revolved the matter again and again in my mind, and was finally convinced that I owed it to my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to withdraw from his ſervice. I added, that I was ſenſible by this half confidence I might ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeem to merit the diſapprobation of Mr. Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſter than his countenance; but I declared my perſuaſion that, if he could be acquainted with the whole affair, however ſtrange my behaviour might at preſent appear, he would applaud my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve.</p>
                     <p>He aſked what reaſon I had to complain of Mr. Falkland? I replied, that I entertained the deepeſt reverence for my maſter; I admired his abilities, and conſidered him as formed for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of his ſpecies. I ſhould in my own opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion be the vileſt of miſcreants, if I uttered a whiſper to his diſadvantage. But all this did not avail: I was not fit for him; perhaps I was not good enough for him; at all events I muſt be perpetually miſerable ſo long as I continued to live with him.</p>
                     <p>I obſerved Mr. Foreſter gaze upon me eagerly with curioſity and ſurpriſe, but this circumſtance I
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:028752_0209_0FDBF1861C33F0B0"/>
did not think proper to notice. Having recovered himſelf, he aſked, Why then, that being the caſe, I did not quit his ſervice? I anſwered, What he now touched upon was that which moſt of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to my misfortune. Mr. Falkland was not ignorant of my diſlike to my preſent ſituation; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he thought it unreaſonable, unjuſt; but I knew that he would never be brought to conſent to my giving way to it.</p>
                     <p>Here Mr. Foreſter interrupted me: and, ſmiling, ſaid, I magnified obſtacles, and overrated my own importance, adding that he would undertake to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move that difficulty, as well as to provide me with a more agreeable appointment. This ſuggeſtion produced in me a ſerious alarm. I replied, that I muſt intreat him upon no account to think of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying to Mr. Falkland upon the ſubject. I added, that perhaps I was only betraying my own imbeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; but in reality, unacquainted as I was with experience and the world, I was afraid, though diſguſted with my preſent reſidence, to expoſe my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon a mere project of my own, to the reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſo conſiderable a man as Mr. Falkland, If he would favour me with his advice upon the ſubject, or if he would only give me leave to hope for his protection in caſe of any unforeſeen ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, this was all I preſumed to requeſt; and, thus encouraged, I would venture to obey the dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of my inclination, and fly in purſuit of my loſt tranquillity.</p>
                     <p>Having thus opened myſelf to this generous friend as far as I could do it with propriety and ſafety, he ſat for ſome time ſilent with an air of deep reflection. At length with a countenance of unuſual ſeverity he thus addreſſed me: Young man, I am afraid you are ignorant of the nature of the tale you have been telling me. There is myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery in it; there is ſomething you cannot prevail
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:028752_0210_0FDBF154573DB8E8"/>
upon yourſelf to diſcloſe. Myſtery always implies ſomewhere or other an uncommon portion of wrong; what am I to think of you? Are you aware of the prejudice you are voluntarily creating againſt yourſelf thus upon the threſhold of life?</p>
                     <p>I anſwered that, whatever were the amount of that prejudice, I muſt ſubmit. I placed my hope of a candid conſtruction in the preſent inſtance, in the rectitude of his nature.</p>
                     <p>He went on: Well, be it as you pleaſe. It was abſolutely neceſſary I ſhould tell you what you were doing. I am in ſome reſpects the worſt perſon you could have applied to under theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. I am the idolator of frankneſs, and have an unconquerable abhorrence to every thing that is the reverſe of it. If any body had told me ſix months ago that I could have been brought to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance a perſon that practiſed that reverſe, I ſhould not have believed him. But I will tell you fairly the ſtate of my mind. Your conduct in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect has not, as yet at leaſt; deſtroyed the early predilection I conceived in your favour. The ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, ſo far as I am able at preſent to adjuſt it, is with you. I will therefore, though in total oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to my principles, yield to this inſtigation. I put myſelf into your hands; I will do exactly what you require. I will receive you either now or hereafter under my own roof, truſting that you will not deceive my confidence, and that I ſhall find unfavourable appearances ultimately terminat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the man moſt ſolicitous for your welfare would deſire.</p>
                     <p>We were engaged in the earneſt diſcuſſion of ſubjects thus intereſting to my peace, when we were interrupted by an event of all others the moſt ſeriouſly to be deprecated. Without the ſmalleſt notice, and as if he had dropped upon us from the clouds, Mr. Falkland burſt into the room. I found
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:028752_0211_0FDBF18AD7D950F0"/>
afterwards that Mr. Foreſter had come thus far upon an appointment to meet Mr. Falkland, and that the place of their intended rendezvous was the next ſtage. Mr. Foreſter was detained unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly at the inn where we now were, by our accidental rencounter, and in reality had for the moment forgotten his appointment; while Mr. Falkland, not finding him where he expected, had proceeded thus far towards the houſe of his kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. To me the meeting was the moſt unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable in the world.</p>
                     <p>I inſtantly foreſaw the dreadful complication of misfortune that was included in this event. To Mr. Falkland the meeting between me and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation muſt appear, not accidental, but concerted. I was totally out of the road I had been travelling by his direction; I was in a road that led directly to the houſe of Mr. Foreſter. What muſt he think of this? How muſt he ſuppoſe I came to that place? The truth, if told, that I came there with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deſign, and purely in conſequence of having loſt my way, muſt appear to be the moſt impudent lie that ever was deviſed.</p>
                     <p>Here then I ſtood detected in the fact of that intercourſe which had been ſo ſeverely forbidden. But in this inſtance it was infinitely worſe, than in thoſe which had already given ſo much diſturbance to Mr. Falkland. It was then open, frank and unconcealed; and therefore the preſumption was that it was for purpoſes that required no conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But the preſent interview, if concerted, was in the moſt emphatical degree clandeſtine. Nor was it leſs perilous than it was clandeſtine. It had been forbidden with the moſt dreadful menaces, and Mr. Falkland was not ignorant how deep an impreſſion thoſe menaces had made upon my ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination. Such a meeting therefore could not have been concerted under ſuch circumſtances for a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:028752_0212_0FDBF155546A3A10"/>
purpoſe, or for any purpoſe that his heart did not quake to think of. Such was the amount of my crime; ſuch was the agony my appearance was calculated to inſpire; and it was reaſonable to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that the penalty I had to expect would be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable. The threats of Mr. Falkland ſtill ſounded in my ears, and I was in a tranſport of terror.</p>
                     <p>The conduct of the ſame man in different cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances is often ſo various as to render it very difficult to be accounted for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mr. Falkland, in this to him terrible criſis, did not ſeem to be in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree hurried away by his paſſions. For a moment he was dumb, his eyes glared with aſtoniſhment; and the next moment as it were, he had the moſt perfect calmneſs and ſelf-command. Had it been otherwiſe I have no doubt that I ſhould inſtantly have entered into an explanation, the ingenuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and conſiſtency of which could not but have been in ſome degree attended with a favourable event. But as it was, I ſuffered myſelf to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come; I yielded as in a former inſtance to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfiting influence of ſurpriſe. I dared ſcarcely breathe; I obſerved the appearances with anxiety and wonder. Mr. Falkland quietly ordered me to return home, and take along with me the groom he had brought with him. I obeyed in ſilence.</p>
                     <p>I afterwards underſtood that he enquired mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutely of Mr. Foreſter the circumſtances of our meeting, and that that gentleman, perceiving that the meeting itſelf was diſcovered, and guided by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of frankneſs, which, when once rooted in a character, it is very difficult to counteract, told Mr. Falkland every thing that had paſſed, together with the remarks it had ſuggeſted to his own mind. Mr. Falkland received the communication with an ambiguous and ſtudied ſilence, which by no means operated to my advantage in the already-poiſoned
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:028752_0213_0FDBF18D93EAD4C8"/>
mind of Mr. Foreſter. His ſilence was partly the direct conſequence of a mind watchful, inquiſitive and doubting; and partly perhaps was adopted for the ſake of the effect it was qualified to produce, Mr. Falkland not being unwilling to encourage a prejudice againſt the character of a perſon who might one day become the adverſary of his own.</p>
                     <p>As to me, I went home indeed, for this was not a moment to reſiſt. Mr. Falkland, with a preme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation to which he had artfully given the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of accident, had taken care to ſend with me a guard to attend upon his priſoner. I ſeemed as if conducting to one of thoſe fortreſſes, famed in the hiſtory of deſpotiſm, from which the wretched victim is never known to eſcape; and, when I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered my chamber, I felt as if I were entering a dungeon. I reflected that I was at the mercy of a man, exaſperated at my diſobedience, and who was already formed to cruelty by ſucceſſive murders. I had occaſionally indulged in viſions of pleaſure, authority and honour as the attendants of my ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turer years: who has not? eſpecially who, with an imagination as buſy and a ſpirit as ardent as mine? All theſe proſpects were now cloſed; I was cut off for ever from purſuits that I had meditated with ineffable delight; my death might be the event of a few hours. I was a victim at the ſhrine of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious guilt that knew neither reſt nor ſatiety; I ſhould be blotted from the catalogue of the living, and my fate remain eternally a ſecret; the man who added my murder to his former crimes, would ſhow himſelf the next morning, and be hailed with the admiration and applauſe of his ſpecies.</p>
                     <p>In the midſt of theſe terrible imaginations one idea preſented itſelf that alleviated my feelings. This was the recollection of the ſtrange and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable tranquillity which Mr. Falkland had
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:028752_0214_0FDBF156DF313EA8"/>
manifeſted, when he diſcovered me in company with Mr. Foreſter. I was not deceived by this. I knew full well that this calm was temporary, and would be ſucceeded by a tumult and whirlwind of the paſſions of the moſt dreadful ſort. But a man under the power of ſuch terrors as now occupied me, catches at every reed. I ſaid to myſelf, that this tranquil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ity was a period it was incumbent upon me to improve; and the ſhorter its duration might be found, the more ſpeedy was I obliged to be in the uſe of it. I could not endure the thought that the apprehenſions I now entertained, ſhould be realiſed through the neglect of any exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or even daring on my part. In a word, I took the reſolution, becauſe I already ſtood in fear of the vengeance of Mr. Falkland, to riſque the poſſibility of provoking it in a degree ſtill more inexpiable, and terminate at once my preſent ſtate of uncertainty. Add to which, I had now opened my caſe to Mr. Foreſter, and he had given me poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive aſſurances of his protection. This in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent deſperation of my fortune was an idea to which my mind willingly had recourſe for ſupport and conſolation.—Inſtigated by theſe reflections, I ſat down to addreſs the following letter to Mr. Falkland.</p>

                     <p>Such was my employment of the evening of a day, which will be ever memorable in the hiſtory of my life. Mr. Falkland not being yet returned, though expected every hour, I was induced to make uſe of the pretext of fatigue to avoid an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview. I went to bed. The next morning I was informed, that he did not come home till late, that h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ad enquired for me, and being told that I was in bed, had ſaid nothing farther upon the ſubject. Satisfied in this reſpect, I went to the breakfaſting parlour, and buſied myſelf for ſome time in arrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a few books and ſome other little occupations, till Mr. Falkland ſhould appear. After a little time I heard his ſtep, which I perfectly knew how to diſtinguiſh, in the paſſage. Preſently, he ſtopped, and, ſpeaking to ſome one in a ſort of deliberate, but ſmothered voice, I overheard him repeat my
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:028752_0216_0FDBF15D9257FBE0"/>
name as enquiring for me. In conformity to the plan I had perſuaded myſelf to adopt, I now laid the letter I had written upon the table, near where he uſually ſat, and made my exit at one door as Mr. Falkland entered at the other. This done, I withdrew in expectation of the event to a private apartment, a ſort of light-cloſet at the end of the library, where I was accuſtomed not unfrequently to ſit.</p>
                     <p>I had not been here three minutes when I heard the voice of Mr. Falkland calling me. I went to him in the library. That is your letter, ſaid he, throwing it. His manner was that of a man la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring with ſome dreadful thought, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to give an air of careleſſneſs and inſenſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to his behaviour. I think no carriage of any other ſort could have produced a ſenſation of ſuch inexplicable horror, or have excited in the perſon who was moſt immediately its object, ſuch an alarm for the event.</p>
                     <p>My lad, continued he, I believe now you have played almoſt all your tricks, and, damn me, if the farce be not nearly at an end! With your apiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and abſurdity however you have taught me one thing, and, whereas before now I have winced at them with torture, I am now as tough as an elephant. I ſhall cruſh you in the end with the ſame indifference that I would any other little inſect that diſturbed my ſerenity.</p>
                     <p>I believe you have decided your fate. I think myſelf ſure that you will never have done till you have brought my whole weight upon you. You may try however. Your only chance is in paſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. I am now perfectly inſenſible to every thing you can ſuffer, but I have no pleaſure in it. I will let you alone, if I can.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="215" facs="unknown:028752_0217_0FDBF191975BD3F0"/>
I am unable to tell what brought about your meeting with Mr. Foreſter yeſterday. It might be deſign; it might be accident. But, be it which it will, I ſhall not forget it. You write me here, that you are deſirous to quit my ſervice. To that I have a ſhort anſwer, You ſhall never quit it with life. If you attempt it, you ſhall never ceaſe to rue your folly as long as you exiſt. That is my will; and I will not have it reſiſted. The very next time you diſobey me in that or any other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, there is an end of your vagaries for ever. Perhaps your ſituation may be a pitiable one; it is for you to look to that. I only know that it is in your power to prevent its growing worſe; no time nor chance ſhall ever make it better.</p>
                     <p>Do not imagine I am afraid of you! I wear an armour, againſt which all your weapons are impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. I have dug a pit for you; and, whichever way you move, backward or forward, to the right or to the left, it is ready to ſwallow you. Be ſtill! If once you fall, call as loud as you will, no man on earth ſhall hear your cries; prepare a tale ever ſo plauſible, or ever ſo true, the whole world ſhall execrate you as an impoſtor. Your innocence ſhall be of no ſervice to you; I laugh at ſo feeble a defence. It is I that ſay it; you may believe what I tell you. Do you not know, miſerable wretch! added he, ſuddenly altering his tone, and ſtamping upon the ground with fury, that I have ſworn to preſerve my reputation at whatever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, that I love it more than the whole world and its inhabitants taken together? And do you think that you ſhall wound it? Begone, miſcreant! reptile! and ceaſe to contend with unſurmountable power!</p>
                     <p>The part of my hiſtory which I am now relating is that which I reflect upon with the leaſt compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency.
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:028752_0218_0FDBF15D9445C608"/>
Why was it that I was once more totally overcome by the imperious carriage of Mr. Falk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and unable to utter a word? The reader will be preſented with many occaſions in the ſequel in which I wanted neither facility in the invention of expedients, nor fortitude in entering upon my juſtification. Perſecution at length gave firmneſs to my character, and taught me the better part of manhood. But in the preſent inſtance I was irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, overawed and abaſhed.</p>
                     <p>The ſpeech I had heard was the dictate of frenzy, and it created in me a ſimilar frenzy. It deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined me to do the very thing againſt which I was thus ſolemnly warned, and fly from my maſter's houſe. I could not enter into parley with him; I could no longer endure the vile ſubjugation he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on me. It was in vain that my reaſon came to my aid, and warned me of the raſhneſs of a meaſure to be taken without concert or preparation. I ſeemed to be in a ſtate in which reaſon had no power. I felt as if I could coolly ſurvey the ſeveral arguments of the caſe, perceive that they had pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, truth and common ſenſe on their ſide: and then anſwer, I am under the guidance of a direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor more energetic than you.</p>
                     <p>I was not long in executing what I had thus ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidly determined. I fixed on the evening of that very day as the period of my evaſion. Even in this ſhort interval I had perhaps ſufficient time for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation. But all opportunity was uſeleſs to me; my mind was fixed, and each ſucceeding moment only increaſed the unſpeakable eagerneſs with which I meditated my eſcape. The hours uſually obſerved by our family in this country reſidence were regular; and one in the morning was the time I ſelected for my undertaking. I ſtole down quietly from my chamber with a lamp in my hand;
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:028752_0219_0FDBF192D122FA68"/>
I went along a paſſage that led to a ſmall door opening into the garden, and then croſſed the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to a gate that interſected an elm walk and a private horſe-path on the outſide.</p>
                     <p>I could ſcarcely believe my good-fortune in hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus far executed my deſign without interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The terrible images Mr. Falkland's menaces had ſuggeſted to my mind, made me expect impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment and detection at every ſtep, though the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſioned ſtate of my mind impelled me to advance with deſperate reſolution. I drew a favourable omen as to the final reſult of my project, from the deſirable event which had attended me in the outſet.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XXI.</head>
                     <p>THE firſt plan that had ſuggeſted itſelf to me was, to go to the neareſt public road, and take the earlieſt ſtage for London. There I believed I ſhould be moſt ſafe from diſcovery, if the venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Mr. Falkland ſhould prompt him to purſue me; and I did not doubt, among the multiplied reſources of the metropolis, to find ſomething which ſhould ſuggeſt to me an eligible mode of diſpoſing of my perſon and induſtry. I reſerved Mr. Foreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in my arrangement as a laſt reſource, not to be called forth unleſs for immediate protection from the hand of perſecution and power.</p>
                     <p>The mode of my proceeding being thus far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, I traced with a chearful heart the unfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented path it was now neceſſary for me to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue. The night was gloomy, and it drizzled with rain. But theſe were circumſtances I had ſcarcely the power to perceive; all was ſunſhine and joy within me. I hardly felt the ground; I repeated to myſelf a thouſand times, I am free. What con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern have I with danger and alarm; I feel that I am free; I feel that I will continue ſo. What power is able to hold in chains a mind ardent and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined? What power can cauſe that man to die, whoſe whole ſoul commands him to continue to live? I looked back with abhorrence to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection in which I had been held. I did not hate the author of my misfortunes; truth and juſtice acquit me of that; I rather pitied the hard deſtiny
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:028752_0221_0FDBF199C83E65B8"/>
to which he ſeemed condemned. But I thought with unſpeakable loathing of thoſe errors, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of which every man is fated to be more or leſs the tyrant or the ſlave. I was aſtoniſhed at the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>olly of my ſpecies, that they did not riſe up as one man, and ſhake off chains ſo ignominious and miſery ſo inſupportable. So far as related to my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, I reſolved, and this reſolution has never been entirely forgotten by me, to hold myſelf diſengaged from the odious ſcene, and never fill the part either of the oppreſſor or the ſufferer.</p>
                     <p>My mind continued in this enthuſiaſtical ſtate, full of confidence, and acceſſible only to ſuch a portion of ſear as ſerved rather to keep up a ſtate of pleaſurable emotion, than to generate anguiſh and diſtreſs, during the whole of this nocturnal expedition. A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ter a walk of three hours I arrived without accident at the village from which I hoped to have taken my paſſage for the metropolis. At this early hour every thing was quiet; no found of any thing human ſaluted my ear. It was with difficulty that I gained admittance into the yard of the inn, where I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ound a ſingle oſtler taking care of ſome horſes. From him I received the unwelcome tidings that the coach was not expected till ſix o'clock in the morning of the following day, its route through that town recurring only three times a-week.</p>
                     <p>This intelligence gave the firſt check to the rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous inebriation by which my mind had been poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed from the moment I quitted the habitation of Mr. Falkland. The whole of my fortune in ready caſh conſiſted of about eleven guineas. I had about fifty more that had fallen to me from the diſpoſal of my property at the death of my father; but that was ſo veſted as to preclude it from immediate uſe, and I even doubted whether it would not be found
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:028752_0222_0FDBF16514421C88"/>
better ultimately to reſign it, than by claiming it to riſk the furniſhing a clue to what I moſt of all dreaded to incur, the perſecution of Mr. Falkland. There was nothing I ſo ardently deſired as the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation of all future intercourſe between us, that he ſhould not know there was ſuch a perſon on the earth as myſelf, and that I ſhould never more hear the name of my quondam maſter.</p>
                     <p>Thus circumſtanced, I conceived frugality to be an object by no means unworthy of my attention, unable as I was to prognoſticate what diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and delays might preſent themſelves to the accompliſhment of my wiſhes, after my arrival in London. For this and other reaſons I determined to adhere to my deſign of travelling by the ſtage; it only remaining for me to conſider in what manner I ſhould prevent the eventual delay of twenty-four hours from becoming by any untoward event a ſource of new calamity. It was by no means ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſable to remain at the village where I now was, during this interval; nor did I even think it proper to employ it in proceeding on foot along the great road. I therefore decided upon making a circuit, the direction of which ſhould ſeem at firſt extremely wide of my intended route, and then ſuddenly ſtriking into a different path ſhould enable me to arrive by the cloſe of day at a market-town twelve miles nearer to the metropolis.</p>
                     <p>Having fixed the economy of the day, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded myſelf that it was the beſt which under the circumſtances could be adopted, I diſmiſſed for the moſt part all farther anxieties from my mind, and eagerly yielded myſelf up to the different amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that aroſe. I reſted and went forward at the impulſe of the moment. At one time I reclined upon a bank immerſed in contemplation, and at another exerted myſelf to analyſe the proſpects
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:028752_0223_0FDBF19B109193C0"/>
which ſucceeded each other. The hazineſs of the morning was followed by a ſpirit-ſtirring and beautiful day. With the ductility ſo characteriſtic of a youthful mind, I forgot the anguiſh which had lately been my continual gueſt, and occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied myſelf entirely in dreams of future no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty and felicity. I ſcarcely ever in the whole courſe of my exiſtence ſpent a day of more various or exquiſite gratification. It furniſhed a ſtrong and perhaps not an unſalutary contraſt to the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors which had preceded, and the dreadful ſcenes that awaited me.</p>
                     <p>In the evening I arrived at the place of my deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tination, enquired for the inn at which the coach was accuſtomed to call, and ordered myſelf refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and a bed. I had not been long here, before, having occaſion to croſs the inn yard upon ſome oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, juſt as I was going again to enter the houſe I ſaw one of Mr. Falkland's footmen riding into the gate-way. I had no doubt that I was myſelf the object of his journey. But it was too late to think of avoiding his obſervation; he was almoſt upon me before I ſaw him. Every incident con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with my late abhorred ſituation was calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to impreſs me with the deepeſt alarm. My firſt thought was to betake myſelf to the fields, and truſt to the ſwiftneſs of my flight for ſafety. But I preſently remarked that he was alone; and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that it would be diſgraceful to fly, when, man to man, I might reaſonably hope I could at any time get the better, either by the firmneſs of my deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, or the ſubtlety of my invention.</p>
                     <p>Thus determined, I came up to him as he alight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from his horſe and bade him follow into the room where I had been ſitting. Well, Thomas, ſaid I, I gueſs your errand; but it is to no purpoſe. You come to conduct me back to Falkland Houſe; but no force ſhall ever drag me to that place alive. I
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:028752_0224_0FDBF16B9AFDCA40"/>
have not taken my reſolution without great conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and ſtrong reaſons; and, having taken it, all the world ſhall never perſuade me to alter. I am an Engliſhman; and it is the privilege of an Engliſhman to be ſole judge and maſter of his own actions.</p>
                     <p>Why, maſter Williams, replied Thomas, to be ſure you ſhould know beſt what you are about. We are all at a ſtound, as a man may ſay, to think what you have got in your head. But that is none of my buſineſs. Sure enough the ſquire expects you to go back with me; but I have a letter for you, and mayhap when you have read that, you may come off from a little of your ſtoutneſs. For my part I knew poor farmer Williams, your father, theſe many a day, and I ſhould be main <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>oth for his fake and your own too, that you ſhould come to any ſorrow.</p>
                     <p>Thus ſaying, he gave me his letter, which was from Mr. Foreſter, whom, as he told me, he had left at my maſter's houſe. It was as follows:</p>

                           <p>My brother Falkland has ſent his man Thomas in purſuit of you. He expects that, if found, you will return with him. I expect ſo too. It is of the utmoſt conſequence to your future honour and character. After reading theſe lines, if you are a villain and a raſcal, you will perhaps endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to fly. If your conſcience tells you, You are innocent, you will out of all doubt come back. Let me know whether I have been your dupe; and whether, while I was won over by your ſeeming ingenuity, I was the tool of a deſigning knave.

                     <p>What a letter was this? To a mind like mine glowing with the love of virtue, ſuch an addreſs was ſtrong enough to draw the perſon to whom it was addreſſed from one end of the earth to the other. Priſons, racks and gibbets would have ſhrunk into nothing in compariſon with it. The ideas it ſuggeſted had a tendency to fill the mind, and ſhut out the poſſibility of competition.</p>
                     <p>I repaſſed in my thoughts every memorable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident that had happened to me under the roof of Mr. Falkland. I could recollect nothing, except the affair of the myſterious cheſt, out of which the ſhadow of an accuſation of the nature alluded to in Mr. Foreſter's letter could be extorted. In that inſtance no doubt my conduct had been highly reprehenſible, and I had never looked back upon it without remorſe and ſelf-condemnation. But I did not believe that it was of the nature of thoſe actions which can be brought under legal cenſure. I ſtill leſs could perſuade myſelf to believe, that Mr. Falkland, who ſhuddered at the very poſſibility of his own detection, and who conſidered himſelf as completely in my power, would dare to bring forward a ſubject ſo cloſely connected with that topic, which wakened eternal agony in his ſoul. In a word, the more I reflected on the phraſes of Mr. Foreſter's billet, the leſs could I imagine the nature of thoſe ſcenes to which they were to ſerve as a prelude.</p>
                     <p>The inſcrutableneſs however of the myſtery they contained was by no means calculated to mitigate my apprehenſions. It ſerved on the contrary to give new pungency to my alarm. It overwhelmed

every quality of my mind; except my fortitude. What reſources had not my perſecutor at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand? It was now that I began to fear him. All the apprehenſions that had before haunted my mind ſeemed, in compariſon with what I now felt, like the gambols of children. But what could I do? This was an enemy to face and not to fly.

This is indeed a very extraordinary letter you have brought me; but it anſwers its purpoſe. I will certainly go with you now, whatever be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence.

                     <p>Bleſs us, cried Thomas, this is a ſurpriſing change indeed! But I ſhould think, ſir, if you pleaſe, that there is no need of being in ſuch a devil of a hurry. It is now dark night, and I am woundy tired. Whatever it is you may have got in your head, I dare to ſay neither you nor maſter will do any thing till to-morrow.</p>
                     <p>To this remonſtrance I replied, that I would willingly conſent to a reſpite of an hour or two hours, if he deſired it, but longer than that I was determined I would not wait, and, if he were not then ready, I would proceed without him. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that, in the circumſtances in which I was
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:028752_0227_0FDBF1A05077C260"/>
placed by Mr. Foreſter's letter, it became me to ſhow, not merely a willingneſs, but an alacrity and impatience to return. Thomas confeſſed that it was in his orders not to part from me when I was once found, and of conſequence he was obliged to agree to the compromiſe I propoſed. We pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured a ſecond horſe from the village. As we rode home, my mind was occupied again and again in endeavouring to account for Mr. Foreſter's letter; but none of my attempts were productive of ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. I knew the inflexibility and ſternneſs of Mr. Falkland's mind in accompliſhing the purpoſes he had moſt at heart; but I alſo knew that every virtuous and magnanimous principle was congenial to his character.</p>
                     <p>When we arrived it was ſtill dark, though the greater part of the night had already elapſed. We were obliged to waken one of the ſervants to give us admittance. I found that Mr. Foreſter had left a meſſage for me in conſideration of the poſſibility of my arrival during the night, directing me im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to go to bed, and to take care that I did not come weary and exhauſted to the buſineſs of the following day. I endeavoured to take his advice; but my ſlumbers were unrefreſhing and diſturbed. This did not diſcourage me; the ſingularity of my ſituation, my conjectures with reſpect to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, my apprehenſions for the future did not allow me to think it poſſible that I could ſink into a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guid and inactive ſtate.</p>
                     <p>Next morning the firſt perſon I ſaw was Mr. Foreſter. He told me that he did not yet know what Mr. Falkland had to allege againſt me, for that he had refuſed to know. He had arrived at the houſe of his brother by appointment on the preceding day to ſettle ſome indiſpenſable buſineſs, his intention having been to depart the moment the buſineſs was finiſhed, as he knew that conduct on
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:028752_0228_0FDBF17112932C38"/>
his part would be moſt agreeable to Mr. Falkland. But he was no ſooner come than he found the whole houſe in confuſion, the alarm of my elope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment having been given a little before. Mr. Falk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land had diſpatched ſervants in all directions in purſuit of me; and the ſervant from the market town arrived at the ſame moment with Mr. Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſter, with intelligence that a perſon anſwering to the deſcription h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> gave had been there very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the morning enquiring reſpecting the ſtage to London.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Falkland ſeemed extremely diſturbed at this information, and exclaimed upon me with great acrimony as an unthankful and unnatural villain.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Foreſter replied: Have more command of yourſelf, ſir! Villain is a very ſerious appellation, and ought not to be trifled with. Engliſhmen are free; and no man ought to be charged with villai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny becauſe he chooſes to change one ſource of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence for another.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Falkland ſhook his head, and with a ſmile expreſſive of acute ſenſibility ſaid, Brother, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, you are the dupe of his art. For my part I always conſidered him with an eye of ſuſpicion, and was aware of his depravity. But I have juſt diſcovered—</p>
                     <p>Stop, ſir! interrupted Mr. Foreſter. I own I thought you might be employing in a moment of acrimony harſh epithets without any accurate mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But, if you have any ſerious accuſation to make againſt Williams, let us not be told of that, till it be known whether the poor lad is within reach of a hearing. Though a juſt man will chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſuffer the ill opinion of others, he will not lightly entertain an ill opinion againſt them. For my part the ſlendereſt allowance I can make to ſuch as are unhappy enough to incur the deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their ſpecies, is that of being previouſly
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:028752_0229_0FDBF1A54B201948"/>
heard in their own defence. It is a wiſe principle in Engliſh law that requires the judge to come into court totally uninformed of the merits of the cauſe he is to try; and to that principle I am determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to conform as an individual. I think it right to be ſevere and inflexible in proceeding againſt offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, but the ſeverity I exerciſe in the ſequel ſhall always be accompanied with impartiality in the preliminary.</p>
                     <p>While Mr. Foreſter related to me th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, he obſerved me ready to break out into ſome of the expreſſions which the narrative ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, but he would not ſuffer me to ſpeak. No, Williams, ſaid he; I would not hear Mr. Falkland againſt you; neither will I hear you in your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. I am come to you at preſent to ſpeak, and not to hear. I thought it became me to warn you of your danger, but I have nothing more to do now. Reſerve what you have to ſay to the proper time. Make the beſt ſtory you can for yourſelf; true, if truth, as I hope, will ſerve your purpoſe; but, if not, the moſt plauſible and ingenious you can invent. That is an exertion which ſelf-defence requires from every man in caſes where, as it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways happens when a man is put upon his trial, he has the whole world againſt him, and has his own battle to fight againſt the world. Farewel, and God ſend you a good deliverance! If Mr. Falkland's accuſation, whatever it be, ſhall appear to be premature, depend upon having me more zealouſly your friend than ever. If not, this is the laſt act of friendſhip you will ever receive from me!</p>
                     <p>It may be believed that this addreſs, ſo ſingular, ſo ſolemn, ſo big with conditional menace, did not greatly tend to aſſuage my anxieties. I was totally ignorant of the charge to be advanced againſt me; and not a little aſtoniſhed, when it was in my
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:028752_0230_0FDBF175B7804080"/>
power to be in the moſt formidable degree the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer of Mr. Falkland, to find the principles of equity ſo completely reverſed, as for the innocent, but inſtructed individual, to be the party accuſed and ſuffering, inſtead of having, as was juſt, the real criminal at his mercy. I was ſtill more aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed at the ſupernatural power Mr. Falkland ſeemed to poſſeſs of bringing back by the moſt irreſiſtible means the object of his perſecution within the ſphere of his authority; a reflection attended with ſome diſcouragement to that thirſt of independence which now conſtituted the ruling paſſion of my mind.</p>
                     <p>But this was no time for meditation. To the ſufferer the courſe of events is taken out of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and he is hurried along with an irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble force, without finding it within the compaſs of his efforts to check their rapidity. I was allowed only a very ſhort time to recollect myſelf, when my trial commenced. I was conducted to the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary where I had paſſed ſo many happy and ſo many contemplative hours, and found there Mr. Foreſter and three of four of the ſervants already aſſembled in expectation of me and my accuſer. Every thing was calculated to ſuggeſt to me that I muſt truſt only in the juſtice of the parties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, and had nothing to hope from their mercy. Mr. Falkland entered at one door, almoſt as ſoon as I entered at the other.</p>

                     <p>HE began: It has been the principle of my life never to inflict a wilful injury upon any thing that lives; I need not expreſs my regret when I find myſelf obliged to be the promulgator of a criminal charge. How gladly would I paſs unnoticed the evil I have ſuſtained! but I owe it to ſociety to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect an offender, and prevent other men from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impoſed upon, as I have been, by an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of integrity.</p>
                     <p>It would be better, interrupted Mr. Foreſter, to ſpeak directly to the point. We ought not,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:028752_0234_0FDBF1A6544BC530"/>
though unwarily, by apologiſing for ourſelves, to create at ſuch a time a prejudice againſt an indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual, againſt whom a criminal accuſation will always be prejudice enough.</p>
                     <p>I ſtrongly ſuſpect, continued Mr. Falkland, this young man, who has been peculiarly the object of my kindneſs, of having robbed me to a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able amount.</p>
                     <p>What, replied Mr. Foreſter, are the grounds of your ſuſpicion?</p>
                     <p>The firſt of them is the actual loſs! have ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in notes, jewels and plate. I have miſſed bank notes to the amount of nine hundred pounds, three gold repeaters of extraordinary value, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete ſuit of diamonds the property of my late mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſeveral other articles.</p>
                     <p>And why, continued my arbitrator, aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, grief, and a deſire to retain his ſelf-poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion ſtrongly contending in his countenance and voice, do you fix on this young man as the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the depredation?</p>
                     <p>I found him, on my coming home upon the day when every thing was in diſorder from the alarm of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ire, in the very act of quitting the private apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment where theſe things were depoſited. He was confounded at ſeeing me, and haſtened to withdraw as ſoon as he poſſibly could.</p>
                     <p>Did you ſay nothing to him, take no notice of the confuſion your ſudden appearance produced?</p>
                     <p>I aſked what was his errand in that place. He was at firſt ſo terrified and overcome that he could not anſwer me. Afterwards with a good deal of faltering he ſaid that, when all the ſervants were engaged in endeavouring to ſave the moſt valuable part of my property, he had come hither with the ſame view; but that he had as yet removed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="7" facs="unknown:028752_0235_0FDBF1A7D1BF4DF0"/>
Did you immediately examine to ſee that every thing was ſafe?</p>
                     <p>No. I was accuſtomed to confide in his honeſty, and I was ſuddenly called away in the preſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to attend to the increaſing progreſs of the flames. I therefore only took out the key from the door of the apartment, having firſt locked it, and, putting it in my pocket, haſtened to go where my preſence ſeemed indiſpenſably neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>How long was it before you miſſed your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty?</p>
                     <p>The ſame evening. The hurry of the ſcene had driven the circumſtance entirely out of my mind, till, going by accident near the apartment, the whole affair, together with the ſingular and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal behaviour of Williams, ruſhed at once upon my recollection. I immediately entered, examined the cheſt in which theſe things were contained, and to my aſtoniſhment found the locks broken and the property gone.</p>
                     <p>What ſteps did you take upon this diſcovery?</p>
                     <p>I ſent for Williams, and talked to him very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly upon the ſubject. But he had now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly recovered his ſelf-command, and calmly and ſtoutly denied all knowledge of the matter. I urged him with the enormouſneſs of the offence, but it made no impreſſion. He did not diſcover either the ſurpriſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> indignation one would have expected from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">

                        </gap>y attends upon guilt. He was rather ſilent and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>. I then informed him, that I ſhould proce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> in a manner different from what he might perhaps expect. I would not, as is too frequent in ſuch caſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> make a general re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearch, for I had rather loſe my property for ever without redreſs, than expoſe a multitude of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent perſons to anxiety and injuſtice. My ſuſpicion
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:028752_0236_0FDBF1F396AF7308"/>
for the preſent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="6 letters">
                           <desc>••••••</desc>
                        </gap>dably fixed upon him. But in a matter of ſo great conſequence I was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined not to act upon ſuſpicion. I would neither incur the poſſibility of raining him being inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, nor be the inſtrument of expoſing others to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> depredations, if guilty. I ſhould therefore merely inſiſt upon his continuing in my ſervice. He might depend upon it he ſhould be well watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and I truſted the whole truth would eventually appear. Since he avoided confeſſion now, I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed him to con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ider how far it was likely he would come off with impunity at laſt. This I was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined on, that the moment he attempted an eſcape, I would confider that as an indication of guilt and proceed accordingly.</p>
                     <p>What circumſtances have occurred from that time to the preſent?</p>
                     <p>None upon which I can infer <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> certainty of guilt. Several that agree to favour a ſuſpicion. From that time Williams was perpetually uneaſy in his ſituation, always deſirous, as it now appears, to eſcape, but afraid to adopt ſuch a meaſure with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out certain precautions. It was not long after, that you, Mr. Foreſter, became my viſitor. I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved with diſſatisfaction the growing intercourſe between you, reflecting on the equivocalneſs of his character, and the attempt he would probably make to render you the dup<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> of his hypocriſy. I accordingly threatened him ſeverely, and I believe you obſerved the change that preſently after took place in his behaviour with relation to you.</p>
                     <p>I did, and it appeared at that time myſterious and extraordinary.</p>
                     <p>Some time after, as you well know, a rencounter took place between you, whether accidental or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentional on his part I am not able to ſay, when he confeſſed to you the uneaſineſs of his mind without
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:028752_0237_0FDBF1ACA41AF350"/>
diſcovering the cauſe, and openly propoſed to you to aſſiſt him in his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>light, and ſtand in caſe of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity between him and my reſentment. You offered, it ſeems, to take him into your ſervice, but nothing, as he acknowledged, would anſwer his purpoſe, that did not place his retreat wholly out of my power to diſcover.</p>
                     <p>Did it not appear extraordinary to you that he ſhould hope for any effectual protection from me, while it remained perpetually in your power to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy me of his unworthineſs?</p>
                     <p>Perhaps he had hopes that I ſhould not proceed to that ſtep, at leaſt ſo long as the place of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat ſhould be unknown to me, and of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence the event of my proceeding dubious. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he confided in his own powers, which are far from contemptible, to conſtruct a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> plauſible tale, eſpecially as he had taken care to have the firſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion in his favour. After all, this protection on your part was merely reſerved in caſe all other expedients failed. He does not appear to have had any other ſentiment upon the ſubject, than that, if he were defeated in his projects for placing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf beyond the reach of juſtice, it was better to have beſpoken himſelf a place in your patronage than to be deſtitute of every reſource.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Falkland having thus finiſhed his evidence, called upon Robert, the valet, to confirm that part of it which related to the day of the fire.</p>
                     <p>Robert ſtated, that he happened to be coming through the library that day, a few minutes after Mr. Falkland's being brought home by the ſight of the fire, that he had found me ſtanding there with every mark of perturbation and fright, that he was ſo ſtruck with my appearance that he could not help ſtopping to notice it, that he had ſpoken to me two or three times before he could obtain an anſwer,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:028752_0238_0FDBF1F90876A040"/>
and that all he could get from me at laſt, was that I was the moſt miſerable creature alive.</p>
                     <p>He farther ſaid, that in the evening of the ſame day Mr. Falkland called him into the private apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment adjoining to the library, and bid him bring him a hammer and ſome nails. He then ſhowed him a cheſt ſtanding in the apartment with its locks and faſtenings broken, and ordered him to obſerve and remember what he ſaw, but not to mention it to any one. Robert did not at that time know what Mr. Falkland intended by theſe directions; but he entertained no doubt that the faſtenings were broken and wrenched by the app<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ication of a chiſſel or ſuch like inſtrument with the intention of forcibly open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cheſt.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Foreſter obſerved upon this evidence, that as much of it as related to the day of the fire ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed indeed to afford powerful reaſons for ſuſpicion, and that the circumſtances that had occurred ſince ſtrang<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, that nothing proper to be done might be omitted, he propoſed ſearching my boxes to ſee whether by that means any trace could be diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to confirm the imputation. Mr. Falkland treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this ſuggeſtion ſlightly, ſaying that, if I were the thief, I had no doubt taken the precaution to obviate ſo palpable a means of detection. To this Mr. Foreſter only replied, that conjecture, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſkilfully formed, was not always realiſed in the actions and behaviour of mankind; and ordered that my boxes and trunks ſhould be brought into the library. The two that were firſt opened contained nothing to confirm the accuſation againſt me; in the third were found a watch and ſeveral jewels that were immediately known to be the property of Mr. Falkland. The production of this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>mingly deciſive evidence excited emotions of aſtoniſhment
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:028752_0239_0FDBF1AE0580CC58"/>
and concern: but no perſon's aſtoniſhment appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be greater than that of Mr. Falkland.</p>
                     <p>To the reſt of the perſons preſent I ſeemed to be merely the ſubject of detection; but in reality I was of all the ſpectators that individual who was moſt at a loſs to conceive through every ſtage of the ſcene what would come next, and who liſtened to every word that was uttered with the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controulable amazement. Amazement however al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternately yielded the aſcendancy to indignation and horror. At firſt I could not refrain from repeated<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attempting to interrupt; but I was checked in theſe attempts by Mr. Foreſter, and I preſently felt how neceſſary it was to my future peace that I ſhould collect the whole energy of my mind to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the charge, and aſſert my innocence.</p>
                     <p>Every thing being now produced that could be produced againſt me, Mr. Foreſter turned to me with a look of concern and pity, and told me that now was the time if I choſe to allege any thing in my defence. In reply to this invitation I ſpoke nearly as follows:</p>
                     <p>I am innocent. It is in vain that circumſtances are accumulated againſt me: there is not a perſon upon earth leſs capable than I of the things of which I am accuſed. I appeal to my heart; I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to my looks; I appeal to every ſentiment my tongue ever uttered.</p>
                     <p>I could perceive that the fervour with which I ſpoke made ſome impreſſion upon every one that heard me. But in a moment their eyes were turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the property that lay before them, and their countenances changed. I proceeded:</p>
                     <p>One thing more I muſt aver; Mr. Falkland is not deceived: he perfectly knows that I am inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="12" facs="unknown:028752_0240_0FDBF1B487D0D2F0"/>
I had no ſooner uttered theſe words than an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary cry of indignation burſt from every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the room. Mr. Foreſter turned to me with a look of extreme ſeverity, and ſaid:</p>
                     <p>Young man, conſider well what you are doing! It is the privilege of the party accuſed to ſay what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he thinks proper; and I will take care that you ſhall enjoy that privilege in its utmoſt extent. But do you think it will conduce in any reſpect to your benefit to throw out ſuch inſolent and intolerable inſinuations?</p>
                     <p>I thank you moſt ſincerely, replied I, for your caution; but I well know what it is that I am do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I make this averment nor merely becauſe it is ſolemnly true, but becauſe it is inſeparably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with my vindication. I am the party ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, and I ſhall be told that I am not to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in my own defence. I can produce no other witneſſes of my innocence; I therefore call upon Mr. Falkland to be my evidence. I aſk him,</p>
                     <p>Did you never boaſt to me in private of your power to ruin me? Did you never ſay that, if once I brought on myſelf the weight of your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, my fall ſhould be irreparable? Did you not tell me that, though I ſhould prepare in that caſe a tale ever ſo plauſible or ever ſo true, you would take care that the whole world ſhould exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate me as an impoſtor? Were not thoſe your very words? Did you not add that my innocence ſhould be of no ſervice to me, and that you laughed at ſo feeble a defence? I aſk you farther, Did you not receive a letter from me the morning of the day on which I departed, requeſting your conſent to my departure? Should I have done that, if my flight had been that of a thief? I challenge any man to reconcile the expreſſions of that letter with this accuſation. Should I have begun with ſtating that
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:028752_0241_0FDBF1B550E20580"/>
I had conceived a deſire to quit your ſervice, if my deſire and the reaſons for it had been of the nature that is now alledged? Should I have dared to aſk for what reaſon I was thus ſubjected to an eternal penance?</p>
                     <p>Saying this, I took out a copy of my letter and laid it open upon the table.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Falkland returned no immediate anſwer to my interrogations. Mr. Foreſter turned to him, and ſaid, Well, ſir, what is your reply to this chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge of your ſervant?</p>
                     <p>Mr. Falkland anſwered: Such a mode of defence hardly ſtands in need of a reply. But I anſwer, I held no ſuch converſation; I never uſed ſuch words; I received no ſuch letter. Surely it is no ſufficient rebutter of a criminal charge, that the criminal repels what is alledged againſt him with volubility of ſpeech and intrepidity of manner?</p>
                     <p>Mr. Foreſter then turned to me. If, ſaid he, you truſt your vindication to the plauſibility of your tale, you muſt take care to render it conſiſtent and complete. You have not told us what was the cauſe of the confuſion and anxiety in which Robert pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes to have found you, why you were ſo impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient to quit the ſervice of Mr. Falkland, or how you account for certain articles of his property being found in your poſſeſſion?</p>
                     <p>All that, ſir, anſwered I, is true. There are certain parts of my ſtory that I have not told. If they were told, they would not contribute to my diſadvantage, and they would make the preſent ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation appear ſtill more aſtoniſhing. But I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, as yet at leaſt, prevail upon myſelf to tell them. Is it neceſſary to give any particular and preciſe reaſons why I ſhould wiſh to change the place of my reſidence? You all of you know the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſtate of Mr. Falkland's mind. You know the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:028752_0242_0FDBF1FA55A8C4F0"/>
ſternneſs, reſervedneſs and diſtance of his manners. If I had no other reaſons, ſurely it would afford ſmall preſumption of criminality that I ſhould wiſh to change his ſervice for another.</p>
                     <p>The queſtion of how theſe articles of Mr. Falk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land's property came to be found in my poſſeſſion is more material. It is a queſtion I am wholly unable to anſwer. Their being found there was at leaſt as unexpected to me as to any one of the perſons now preſent. I only know that, as I have the moſt perfect aſſurance of Mr. Falkland's being conſcious of my innocence, for, obſerve! I do not ſhrink from that aſſertion, I reiterate it with new confidence; I therefore firmly and from my ſoul believe that their being there is of Mr. Falkland's contrivance.</p>
                     <p>I had no ſooner ſaid this, than I was again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted by an involuntary exclamation from every one preſent. They looked at me with furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous glances, as if they could have torn me to pieces, I proceeded:</p>
                     <p>I have now anſwered every thing that is alleged againſt me.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Foreſter, you are a lover of juſtice; I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure you not to violate it in my perſon. You are a man of penetration; look at me, do you ſee any of the marks of guilt? Recollect all that has ever paſſed under your obſervation; is it compatible with a mind capable of what is now alleged againſt me? Could a real criminal have ſhown himſelf ſo unabaſhed, compoſed and firm as I have now done?</p>
                     <p>Fellow ſervants! Mr. Falkland is a man of rank and fortune; he is your maſter. I am a poor country lad without a friend in the world. That is a ground of real difference to a certain extent; but it is not a ſufficient ground for the ſubverſion
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:028752_0243_0FDBF1BB496AC440"/>
of juſtice. Remember, that I am in a ſituation that is not to be trifled with, that a deciſion given againſt me now, in a caſe in which I ſolemnly aſſure you I am innocent, will for ever deprive me of reputation and peace of mind, combine the whole world in a league againſt me, and determine perhaps upon my liberty and my life. If you believe, if you ſee, if you know that I am inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, ſpeak for me. Do not ſuffer a puſillanimous timidity to prevent you from ſaving a fellow crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from deſtruction, who does not deſerve to have a human being for his enemy. Why have we the power of ſpeech, but to communicate our thoughts? I will never believe that a man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of innocence, cannot make other men per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that he has that thought. Do not you feel that my whole heart tells me, I am not guilty of what is imputed to me?</p>
                     <p>To you, Mr. Falkland, I have nothing to ſay. I know you, and know that you are impenetrable. At the very moment that you are urging ſuch odious charges againſt me, you admire my reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution and forbearance. But I have nothing to hope from you. You can look upon my ruin without pity or remorſe. I am moſt unfortunate indeed in having to do with ſuch an adverſary. You oblige me to ſay ill things of you; but I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to your own heart whether it is not in my power to ſay infinitely worſe.</p>
                     <p>Every thing that could be alleged on either ſide being now concluded, Mr. Foreſter undertook to make ſome remarks upon the whole. Williams, ſaid he, the charge againſt you is heavy; the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect evidence is ſtrong; the corroborating circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are numerous and ſtriking. I grant that you have ſhown conſiderable dexterity in your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers; but you will learn, young man, to your
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:028752_0244_0FDBF200DEFD5D68"/>
coſt, that dexterity, however powerful it may be in certain caſes, will avail little againſt the ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornneſs of truth. It is fortunate for mankind that the empire of talents has its limitations, and that it is not in the power of ingenuity to ſubvert the diſtinctions of right and wrong. Take my word for it, that the true merits of the caſe againſt you will be too ſtrong for ſophiſtry to overturn, that juſtice will prevail, and impotent malice be defeated.</p>
                     <p>To you, Mr. Falkland, ſociety is obliged for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing placed this black affair in its true light. Do not ſuffer the malignant aſperſions of the criminal to give you any uneaſineſs. Depend upon it that they will be found of no weight. I have no doubt that your character in the judgment of every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that has heard them ſtands higher than ever. We feel for your misfortune in being obliged to hear ſuch calumnies from a perſon who has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured you ſo groſsly. But you muſt be conſidered in that reſpect as a martyr in the public cauſe. The purity of your motives and diſpoſitions are beyond the reach of malice; and truth and equity will not fail to award to your calumniator in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy, and to you the love and approbation of mankind.</p>
                     <p>I have now told you, Williams, what I think of your caſe. But I have no right to aſſume to be your ultimate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> judge. Deſperate as it appears to me, I will give you one piece of advice as if I were retained as a counſel to aſſiſt you. Leave out of it whatever tells to the diſadvantage of Mr. Falkland. Defend yourſelf as well as you can, but do not attack your maſter. It is your buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to create in thoſe that hear you a prepoſſeſſion in your favour. But the recrimination you have been now practiſing will always create indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:028752_0245_0FDBF1BC111E0CB0"/>
Diſhoneſty will admit of ſome palliation. The deliberate malice you have now been ſhowing is a thouſand times more atrocious. It proves you to have the mind of a demon rather than a felon. Wherever you ſhall repeat it, thoſe who hear you will pronounce you guilty upon that, even if the proper evidence againſt you were glaringly defec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. If therefore you would conſult your intereſt, which ſeems to be your only conſideration, it is incumbent upon you by all means immediately to retract that. If you deſire to be believed honeſt, you muſt in the firſt place ſhow that you have a due ſenſe of merit in others. You cannot better ſerve your cauſe than by begging pardon of your maſter, and doing homage to rectitude and worth even when they are employed in vengeance againſt you.</p>
                     <p>It is eaſy to conceive that my mind ſuſtained an extreme ſhock from the deciſion of Mr. Foreſter; but his call upon me to retract and humble myſelf before my accuſer penetrated my whole ſoul with indignation. I anſwered:</p>
                     <p>I have already told you I am innocent. I believe that I could not endure the effort of inventing a plauſible defence, if it were otherwiſe. You have juſt affirmed that it is not in the power of inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity to ſubvert the diſtinctions of right and wrong, and in that very moment I find them ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted. This is indeed to me a very awful mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. New to the world, I know nothing of its affairs but what has reached me by rumour, or is recorded in books. I have come into it with all the ardour and confidence inſeparable from my years. In every fellow-being I expected to find a friend. I am unpractiſed in its wiles, and have even no acquaintance with its injuſtice. I have done nothing to deſerve the animoſity of mankind,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:028752_0246_0FDBF201DBF24C00"/>
but, if I may judge from the preſent ſcene, I am from henceforth to be deprived of the benefits of integrity and honour. I am to forfeit the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of every one I have hitherto known, and to be precluded from the power of acquiring that of others. I muſt therefore be reduced to derive my ſatisfaction from myſelf. Depend upon it I will not begin that career by diſhonourable conceſſions. If I am to deſpair of the good will of other men, I will at leaſt maintain the independence of my own mind. Mr. Falkland is my implacable ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. Whatever may be his merits in other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, he is acting towards me without huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, without remorſe and without principle. Do you think I will ever make any ſubmiſſions to a man by whom I am thus treated, that I will fall down at the feet of one who is to me a devil, or kiſs the hand that is red with my blood?</p>
                     <p>In that reſpect, anſwered Mr. Foreſter, do as you ſhall think proper. I muſt confeſs that your firmneſs and conſiſtency aſtoniſh me. They add ſomething to what I had conceived of human pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Perhaps you have choſen the part which all things conſidered may ſerve your purpoſe beſt, though I think more moderation would be more conciliating. The exterior of innocence will, I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ant, ſtagger the perſons who may have the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of your fate, but it will never be able to prevail againſt plain and incontrovertible facts. But I have done with you. I ſee in you a new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of that abuſe which is ſo generally made of talents the admiration of an undiſcerning public. I regard you with horror. And all that remains is that I ſhould diſcharge my duty in conſigning you as a monſter of depravity to the juſtice of your country.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="19" facs="unknown:028752_0247_0FDBF1C0DD4BD120"/>
No, rejoined Mr. Falkland, to that I can never conſent. I have put a reſtraint upon myſelf thus far, becauſe it was right that evidence and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry ſhould take their courſe. I have ſuppreſſed all my habits and ſentiments, becauſe it ſeemed due to the public that hypocriſy ſhould be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſked. But I can ſuffer this violence no longer. I have through my whole life interfered to protect, not overbear the ſufferer; and I muſt do ſo now. I feel not the ſmalleſt reſentment of his impotent attacks upon my character; I ſmile at their malice; and they make no diminution in my benevolence to their author. Let him ſay what he pleaſes; he cannot hurt me. It was proper that he ſhould be brought to public ſhame, that other people might not be deceived by him as we have been. But there is no neceſſity for proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any farther; and I muſt inſiſt upon it that he be permitted to depart wherever he pleaſes. I am ſorry that public intereſt affords ſo gloomy a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect for his future happineſs.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Falkland, anſwered Mr. Foreſter, theſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents do honour to your humanity; but I muſt not give way to them. They only ſerve to ſet in a ſtronger light the venom of this ſerpent, this monſter of ingratitude, who firſt robs his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, and then reviles him. Wretch that you are, will nothing move you? Are you inacceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to remorſe? Are you not ſtruck to the heart with the unmerited goodneſs of your maſter? Vile calumniator! you are the abhorrence of nature, the opprobrium of the human ſpecies, and the earth can only be freed from an inſupportable bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then by your being exterminated! Recollect, ſir, that this villain, at the very moment that you are exerciſing ſuch unexampled forbearance in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, has the preſumption to charge you with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:028752_0248_0FDBF203ACBE6050"/>
a crime of which you know him to be innocent, nay, with having conveyed the pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtolen goods among his property for the expreſs purpoſe of ruining him. By this unexampled vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainy he makes it your duty to free the world from ſuch a peſt, and your intereſt to admit no relaxing in your purſuit of him, leſt the world ſhould be perſuaded by your clemency to credit his vile in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuations.</p>
                     <p>I care no for conſequences, replied Mr. Falk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, I will obey the dictates of my own mind. I will never lend my perſonal aſſiſtance to the reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mankind by axes and gibbets; I am ſure things will never go well, till honour and not law be the dictator of mankind, till vice is taught to ſhrink before the reſiſtleſs might of inborn dignity, and not before the cold formality of ſtatutes. If my calumniator were worthy of my reſentment I would chaſtiſe him with my own ſword, and not that of the magiſtrate; but in the preſent caſe I ſmile at his malice, and reſolve to ſpare him, as the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous lord of the foreſt ſpares the inſect that would diſturb his repoſe.</p>
                     <p>The language you now hold, ſaid Mr. Foreſter, is that of romance, and not of reaſon. Yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be ſtruck with the contraſt exhibited be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me of the magnanimity of virtue and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate, impenetrable injuſtice of guilt. While your mind overflows with goodneſs, nothing can touch the heart of this thrice-bred villain. I ſhall never forgive myſelf for having once been entrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by his deteſtable arts. This is no time for us to ſettle the queſtion between chivalry and law. I ſhall therefore ſimply inſiſt as a magiſtrate, having taken the evidence in this felony, upon my right and duty of following the courſe of juſtice, and committing the accuſed to the county jail.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="21" facs="unknown:028752_0249_0FDBF1C2134453C8"/>
After ſome farther conteſt Mr. Falkland, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mr. Foreſter obſtinate and impracticable, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew his oppoſition. Accordingly a proper officer was ſummoned from the neighbouring village, a mittimus made out, and one of Mr. Falkland's carriages prepared to conduct me to the place of cuſtody. It will eaſily be imagined that this ſudden reverſe was very painfully felt by me. I looked round on the ſervants who had been the ſpectators of my examinations, but not one of them either by word or geſture expreſſed any compaſſion for my calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The robbery of which I was accuſed appeared to them atrocious from its magnitude, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſparks of compaſſion might otherwiſe have ſprung up in their ingenuous and undiſciplined minds, were totally obliterated by indignation at my ſuppoſed profligacy in recriminating upon their worthy and excellent maſter. My fate being already determined, and one of the ſervants diſpatched for the officer, Mr. Foreſter and Mr. Falkland with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew, and left me in the cuſtody of two others.</p>
                     <p>One of theſe was the ſervant who had gone in purſuit of me and found me at the market-town from whence I had intended to take coach for Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. I was willing accurately to diſcover the ſtate of mind of thoſe who had been witneſſes of this ſcene, and who had had ſome previous opportunity of obſerving my character and manners. I therefore endeavoured to open a converſation with him. Well, my good Thomas, ſaid I, in a querulous tone and with a heſitating manner, am I not a moſt miſerable creature?</p>
                     <p>Do n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> ſpeak to me, maſter Williams! You have given me a ſhock that I ſhall not get the better of for one while. You were hatched by a hen, as the ſaying is, but you came of the ſpawn of a cocka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice. I am glad to my heart, that honeſt farmer
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:028752_0250_0FDBF204195CD410"/>
Williams is dead, your villany would elſe have made him curſe the day that ever he was born.</p>
                     <p>Thomas, I am innocent! I ſwear by the great God that ſhall judge me another day, I am inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent!</p>
                     <p>Pray, do not ſwear! for goodneſs ſake, do not ſwear! Your poor ſoul is damned enough without that. For your ſake, lad, I will never take any body's word, nor truſt to appearances, thof it ſhould be an angel. Lord bleſs us! how ſmoothly you palavered it over, for all the world as if you had been as fair as a new-born babe! But it will not do; you will never be able to perſuade peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that black is white. For my own part I have done with you. I loved you yeſterday, all one as if you had been my own brother. To day I love you ſo well, that I would go ten miles with all the pleaſure in life to ſee you hanged.</p>
                     <p>Good God! Thomas, have you the heart? What a change! I call God to witneſs I have done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to deſerve it! What a world do we live in!</p>
                     <p>Hold your tongue, boy! It makes my very heart ſick to hear you! I would not lay a night under the ſame roof with you for all the world! I ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the houſe to fall and cruſh ſuch wickedneſs! I admire that the earth does not open and ſwallow you alive! It is poiſon ſo much as to look at you! If you go on at this hardened rate, I believed from my ſoul that the people you talk to will tear you to pieces, and you will never live to come to the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows. Oh, yes, you do well to pity yourſelf: poor, tender thing! that ſpit venom all round you like a toad, and leave the very ground upon which you crawl infected with your ſlime.</p>
                     <p>Finding the perſon with whom I talked thus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penetrable to all I could ſay, and conſidering that the advantage to be gained was but ſmall even if I

It was not much longer before every thing was prepared for my departure, and I was conducted to the ſame priſon which had ſo lately incloſed the wretched and innocent Haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinſes. They too had been the victims of Mr. Falkland. He exhibited, upon a very contracted ſcale indeed, but in which the truth of delineation was faithfully ſuſtained, a copy of what monarchs are, who reckon among the inſtruments of their power priſons of ſtate.</p>

                     <p>FOR my own part I had never ſeen a priſon, and like the majority of my brethren had given myſelf little concern to enquire what was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of thoſe who committed offence againſt, or became obnoxious to ſuſpicion from the community. Oh, how enviable is the moſt tottering ſhed under which the labourer retires to reſt, compared with the reſidence of theſe walls!</p>
                     <p>To me every thing was new, the maſſy doors, the reſounding locks, the gloomy paſſages, the grated windows, and the characteriſtic looks of the keepers, accuſtomed to reject every petition, and to ſteel their hearts againſt feeling and pity. Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity and a ſenſe of my ſituation induced me to fix my eyes on the faces of theſe men, but in a few minutes I drew them away with unconquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able loathing. It is impoſſible to deſcribe the ſort of ſqualidneſs and filth with which theſe manſions are diſtinguiſhed. I have ſeen dirty faces in dirty apartments, which have nevertheleſs borne the impreſſion of health, and ſpoke careleſſneſs and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity rather than diſtreſs. But the dirt of a priſon ſpeaks ſadneſs to the heart, and appears to be alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in a ſtate of putridity and infection.</p>
                     <p>I was detained for more than an hour in the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the keeper, one turnkey after another coming in, that they might make themſelves fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar with my perſon. As I was already conſidered
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:028752_0253_0FDBF1CA5C5C3D18"/>
as guilty of felony to a conſiderable amount, I underwent a rigorous ſearch, and they took from me a penknife, a pair of ſciſſars, and that part of my money which was in gold. It was debated whether or not theſe ſhould be ſealed up, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to me, as they ſaid, as ſoon as I ſhould be acquitted; and had I not diſplayed an unexpected firmneſs of manner and vigour of expoſtulation, ſuch was the conduct that would have been pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued. Having undergone theſe ceremonies, I was thruſt into a day-room in which all the perſons then under confinement for felony were aſſembled, to the number of eleven. Each of them was too much engaged in his own reflections to take notice of me. Of theſe two were impriſoned for horſe-ſtealing, and three for having ſtolen a ſheep, one for ſhop-lifting, one for coining, two for highway-robbery and two for burglary.</p>
                     <p>The horſe-ſtealers were engaged in a game at cards, which was preſently interrupted by a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of opinion, attended with great vocifera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they calling upon one and another to decide it to no purpoſe, one paying no attention to their ſummons, and another leaving them in the midſt of their ſtory, being no longer able to endure his own internal anguiſh in the midſt of their mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mery.</p>
                     <p>It is a cuſtom among thieves to conſtitute a ſort of mock tribunal of their own body, from whoſe deciſion every one is informed whether he ſhall be acquitted, reſpited or pardoned, as well as reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt ſkilful way of conducting his de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

One of the houſebreakers who had already paſſed this ordeal was ſtalking up and down the room with a forced bravery, exclaiming to his companion that he was as rich as the duke of Bedford himſelf. He had five gui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

as he could poſſibly ſpend in the courſe of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing month, and what happened after that it was Jack Ketch's buſineſs to ſee to, not his. As he uttered theſe words he threw himſelf abruptly upon a bench that was near him, and ſeemed to be aſleep in a moment. But his ſleep was uneaſy and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed, his breathing was hard, and at intervals had rather the nature of a groan. A young fellow from the other ſide of the room came ſoftly to the place where he lay with a large knife in his hand, and preſſed the back of it with ſuch violence upon his neck, the head hanging over the ſide of the bench, that it was not till after ſeveral efforts that he was able to riſe. Oh, Jack! cried this manual jeſter, I had almoſt done your buſineſs for you! The other expreſſed no marks of reſentment, but ſullenly anſwered, Damn you, why did not you take the edge? It would have been the beſt thing you have done this many a day<note n="*" place="bottom">This incident really occurred, and was witneſſed by a friend of the author a few years ſince in Newgate.</note>!</p>
                     <p>The caſe of one of the perſons committed for highway-robbery was not a little extraordinary. He was a common ſoldier, of a moſt engaging phyſiognomy, and two and twenty years of age. The proſecutor, who had been robbed one evening as he returned very late from the alehouſe, of the ſum of three ſhillings, ſwore poſitively to his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. The character of the priſoner was ſuch as has ſeldom been equalled. The meanneſs of his condition did not preclude him from the purſuit of intellectual cultivation; and he drew his favourite amuſement from the works of Virgil and Horace. His integrity had been proverbially great. In one inſtance he had been employed by a lady to convey a ſum of a thouſand pounds to a perſon at ſome

miles diſtance: in another he was intruſted by a gentleman during his abſence with the care of his houſe and furniture to the value of at leaſt five times that ſum. His habits of thinking were pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar, full of juſtice, ſimplicity and wiſdom. He from time to time earned money of his officers by his peculiar excellence in furbiſhing arms; but he declined offers that had been made him to become a ſerjeant or a corporal, ſaying, that he did not want money, and that in a new ſituation he ſhould have leſs leiſure for ſtudy. He was equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in refuſing preſents that were offered him by perſons that had been ſtruck with his merit: not that he was under the influence of falſe delicacy and pride, but that his conſcience would not allow him to accept that, the want of which he did not feel to be an evil.

                     <p>The whole day I was obliged to ſpend in the company of theſe men, ſome of them having really committed the actions laid to their charge, others whom their ill fortune had rendered the victims of ſuſpicion. The whole was a ſcene of miſery ſuch as nothing ſhort of actual obſervation can ſuggeſt to the mind. Some were noiſy and obſtreperous, endeavouring by a falſe bravery to keep at bay the remembrance of their condition; while others, incapable even of this effort, had the torment of their thoughts aggravated by the perpetual noiſe and confuſion that prevailed around them. In the faces of thoſe who aſſumed the moſt courage you might trace the furrows of anxious care, and in the midſt of their laboured hilarity dreadful ideas would ever and anon intrude, convulſing their features and

We talk of inſtruments of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; Engliſhmen take credit to themſelves for having baniſhed the uſe of them from their happy ſhore! Alas, he that has obſerved the ſecrets of a priſon, well knows that there is infinitely more tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the lingering exiſtence of a criminal, in the ſilent, intolerable minutes that he ſpends, than in the tangible miſery of whips and racks!</p>
                     <p>Such were our days. At ſun-ſet our jailors ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, and ordered each man to come away, and be locked into his dungeon. It was a bitter ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of our fate to be under the arbitrary controul of theſe fellows. They felt no man's ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; they were of all men leaſt capable of any ſort of feeling. They had a barbarous and ſullen pleaſure in iſſuing their deteſted mandates, and obſerving the mournful reluctance with which they were obeyed. Whatever they directed, it was in vain to expoſtulate; ſetters and bread and water were the ſure conſequences of reſiſtance. Their tyranny had no other limit than their own caprice; to whom ſhall the unfortunate felon appeal? To what purpoſe complain, when his complaints are ſure to be received with incredulity? A tale of mutiny and neceſſary precaution is the unfailing

In ſome of theſe miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble receptacles three perſons were put to ſleep to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether<note n="*" place="bottom">See Howard on Priſons.</note>. I was fortunate enough to have one to myſelf. It was now the approach of winter. We were not allowed to have candles; and, as I have already ſaid, were thruſt in here at ſun-ſet and not liberated till the returning day. This was our ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation for fourteen or fifteen hours out of the four and twenty I had never been accuſtomed to ſleep more than ſix or ſeven hours, and my inclination to ſleep was now leſs than ever. Thus was I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to ſpend half my day in this dreary abode and in compleat darkneſs. This was no trifling aggravation of my lot.</p>
                     <p>Among my melancholy reflections I taſked my memory, and counted over the doors, the lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Theſe, ſaid I, are the engines that tyranny ſits down in cold and ſerious meditation to invent. This is the empire that man exerciſes over man. Thus is a being, formed to expatiate, to act, to ſmile and enjoy, reſtricted and benumbed. How great muſt be his depravity or heedleſſneſs who vindicates this ſcheme for changing health and gaiety and ſerenity, into the wanneſs of a dungeon and the deep furrows of agony and deſpair!</p>

                     <p>For myſelf I looked round upon my walls, and forward upon the premature death I had too much reaſon to expect; I conſulted my own heart that whiſpered nothing but innocence; and I ſaid, This is ſociety.

                     <p>I believed that miſery, more pure than that which I now endured, had never fallen to the lot of a human being. I recollected with aſtoniſhment my puerile eagerneſs to be brought to the teſt and have my innocence examined. I execrated it as the vileſt and moſt inſufferable pedantry. I exclaimed in the bitterneſs of my heart, Of what value is a fair fame? It is the jewel of men formed to be amuſed with baubles. Without it I might have had ſere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of heart and chearfulneſs of occupation, peace and liberty; why ſhould I conſign my happineſs to other men's arbitration? But, if a fair fame were of the moſt inexpreſſible value, is this the method which common ſenſe would preſcribe to retrieve it? The language which theſe inſtitutions hold out to the unfortunate is, Come, and be ſhut out from the light of day, be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

This is the conſolation ſhe affords to thoſe whoſe malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity or folly, private pique or unfounded poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiveneſs have without the ſmalleſt foundation loaded with calumny. For myſelf I felt my own inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and I ſoon found upon enquiry that three-fourths of thoſe who are regularly ſubjected to a ſimilar treatment, are perſons, whom even with all the ſuperciliouſneſs and precipitation of our courts of juſtice no evidence can be found to convict. How ſlender then muſt be that man's portion of information and diſcernment, who is willing to commit his character and welfare to ſuch guardianſhip!</p>

But my caſe was even worſe than this. I inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately felt that a trial, ſuch as inſtitution is able to make it, is only the worthy ſequel of ſuch a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning. What chance had I, after the purgation I was now ſuffering, that I ſhould come out ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted at laſt? What probability was there that the trial I had juſt endured in the houſe of Mr. Falkland was not juſt as fair as any that might be expected to follow? No, I have already antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated my own condemnation.</p>
                     <p>Thus was I cut off for ever from all that exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence has to beſtow, from all the high hopes I had ſo often conceived, from all the future excellence my ſoul ſo much delighted to imagine, to ſpend a few weeks in a miſerable priſon, and then to periſh by the hands of the public executioner. No lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage can do juſtice to the indignant and ſoul-ſickening loathing that theſe ideas excited. My reſentment was not reſtricted to my proſecutor, but extended itſelf to take in the whole machine of human ſociety. I could never believe that all this was the fair reſult of inſtitutions inſeparable from the general good. I regarded the whole human ſpecies as ſo many hangmen and torturers. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered them as confederated to tear me to pieces; and this wide ſcene of inexorable perſecution in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon me inexpreſſible agony. I looked on this ſide and on that; I was innocent, I had a right to expect aſſiſtance; but every heart was ready to lend its force to make my ruin ſecure.

What relief had I from theſe ſenſations? Was it relief that I ſpent the day in the midſt of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligacy and execrations, that I ſaw reflected from every countenance agonies only inferior to my own? He that would form a lively idea of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of the damned, needed only to witneſs for ſix hours a ſcene to which I was confined for many months. Not for one hour could I withdraw my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from this complexity of horrors, or take re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge in the calmneſs of meditation. Air, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, ſeries, contraſt, thoſe grand enliveners of the human frame, I was for ever debarred, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exorable tyranny under which I was fallen. Nor did I find the ſolitude of my nightly dungeon leſs inſupportable. Its only furniture was the ſtraw that ſerved me for my repoſe. It was narrow, damp and unwholeſome. The ſlumbers of a mind, wearied like mine with the moſt deteſtable uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, to whom neither amuſement nor occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ever offered themſelves to beguile the painful hours, were ſhort, diſturbed and unrefreſhing. My ſleeping, ſtill more than my waking thoughts, were full of perplexity, deformity and diſorder. To theſe ſlumbers ſucceeded the hours which by the regulations of our priſon I was obliged though awake to ſpend in ſolitary and chearleſs darkneſs. Here I had neither books, nor pens, nor any thing upon which to engage my attention; all was a ſightleſs blank. How was a mind, active and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable like mine, to endure this miſery? I could not ſink it in lethargy; I could not forget my woes; they haunted me with unintermitted and demoniac malice.

                     <p>SUCH were the reflections that haunted the firſt days of my impriſonment, in conſequence of which they were ſpent in perpetual anguiſh. But after a time nature, wearied with diſtreſs, would no longer ſtoop to the burthen; thought, which is inceſſantly varying, introduced a ſeries of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections totally different.</p>
                     <p>My fortitude revived. I had always been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to chearfulneſs, good-humour and ſere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and this habit now returned to viſit me at the bottom of my dungeon. No ſooner did my contemplations take this turn, than I ſaw the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs and poſſibility of tranquillity and peace, and my mind whiſpered to me the propriety of ſhowing in this forlorn condition that I was ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to all my perſecutors. Bleſſed ſtate of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and ſelf-approbation! The ſunſhine of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious integrity pierced through all the harriers of my cell, and ſpoke ten thouſand times more joy to my heart than the accumulated ſplendours of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and art can communicate to the ſlaves of vice.</p>
                     <p>I found out the ſecret of employing my mind. I ſaid, I am ſhut up for half the day in total dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs without any external ſource of amuſement; the other half I ſpend in the midſt of noiſe, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulence and confuſion. What then? Can I not draw amuſement from the ſtores of my own mind? Is it not freighted with various knowledge? Have I not been employed from my infancy in gratifying an inſatiable curioſity? When ſhould I derive be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:028752_0264_0FDBF21C983985D8"/>
from theſe ſuperior advantages, if not at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent? Accordingly I taſked the ſtores of my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory and my powers of invention. I amuſed my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with recollecting the hiſtory of my life. By degrees I called to mind a number of minute cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances which but for this exerciſe would have been for ever forgotten. I repaſſed in my thoughts whole converſations, I recollected their ſubjects, their arrangement, their incidents and frequently their very words. I muſed upon theſe ideas till I was totally abſorbed in thought. I repeated them till my mind glowed with enthuſiaſm. I had my different employments fitted for the ſolitude of the night in which I could give full ſcope to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſes of my mind, and the uproar of the day in which my chief object was to be inſenſible to the diſorder with which I was ſurrounded.</p>
                     <p>By degrees I quitted my own ſtory, and amuſed myſelf with imaginary adventures. I figured to myſelf every ſituation in which I could be placed, and conceived the conduct to be obſerved in each. Thus ſcenes of inſult and danger, of tenderneſs and oppreſſion became familiar to me. In fancy I often paſſed the awful hour of diſſolving nature. In ſome of my reveries I boiled with impetuous indignation, and in others patiently collected the whole force of my mind for ſome fearful encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. I cultivated the powers of oratory ſuited to theſe different ſtates, and improved more in elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence in the ſolitude of my dungeon, than per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps I ſhould have done in the buſieſt and moſt crowded ſcenes At length I proceeded to as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular a diſpoſition of my time, as the man in his ſtudy who paſſes from mathematics to poetry, and from poetry to the law of nations in the different parts of each ſingle day; and I as ſeldom infringed upon my plan. Nor were my ſubjects of diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:028752_0265_0FDBF1DAD19DF6C8"/>
leſs numerous than his. I went over, by the aſſiſtance of memory only, a conſiderable part of Euclid during my confinement, and revived day after day the ſeries of facts and incidents in ſome of the moſt celebrated hiſtorians.</p>
                     <p>While I was thus employed I reflected with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ultation upon the degree in which man is inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of the ſmiles and frowns of fortune. I was beyond her reach, for I could fall no lower. To an ordinary eye I might ſeem deſtitute and miſerable, but in reality I wanted for nothing. My fare was coarſe; but I was in health. My dungeon was noiſome; but I felt no inconvenience. I was ſhut up from the uſual means of exerciſe and air; but I found the method of exerciſing my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf even to perſpiration in my dungeon. I had no means of withdrawing my perſon from a diſguſtful ſociety in the moſt chearful and valuable part of the day; but I ſoon brought to perfection the art of withdrawing my thoughts, and ſaw and heard the people about me for juſt as ſhort a time and as ſeldom as I pleaſed.</p>
                     <p>Such is man in himſelf conſidered; ſo ſimple his nature; ſo few his wants. How different from the man of artificial ſociety! Palaces are built for his reception, a thouſand vehicles provided for his exerciſe, provinces are ranſacked for the gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his appetite, and the whole world traverſed to ſupply him with apparel and furniture. Thus vaſt is his expenditure, and the purchaſe ſlavery. He is dependent on a thouſand accidents for tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity and health, and his body and ſoul are at the devotion of whoever will ſatisfy his imperious cravings.</p>
                     <p>In addition to the diſadvantages of my preſent ſituation, I was reſerved for an ignominious death. What then? Every man muſt die. No man
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:028752_0266_0FDBF21DD6E8FD80"/>
knows how ſoon. It ſurely is not worſe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter the king of terrors in health and with every advantage for the collection of fortitude, than to encounter him already half ſubdued by ſickneſs, and ſuffering. I was reſolved at leaſt fully to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs the days I had to live, and this is peculiarly in the power of the man who preſerves his health to the laſt moment of his exiſtence. Why ſhould I ſuffer my mind to be invaded by unavailing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grets? Every ſentiment of vanity, or rather of independence and juſtice within me, inſtigated me to ſay to my perſecutor, You may cut off my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence, but you cannot diſturb my ſerenity.</p>

                     <p>IN the midſt of theſe reflections another thought, which had not before ſtruck me, occurred to my mind. I exult, ſaid I, and reaſonably, over the impotence of my perſecutor. Is not that impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence greater than I have yet imagined? I ſay, he may cut off my exiſtence, but cannot diſturb my ſerenity. It is true: my mind, the clearneſs of my ſpirit, the firmneſs of my temper, are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his reach; is not my life equally ſo, if I pleaſe? What are the material obſtacles that man never ſubdued? What is the undertaking ſo ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous that by ſome has not been accompliſhed? And, if by others, why not by me? Had they ſtronger motives than I? Was exiſtence more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly endeared to them, or had they more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous methods by which to animate and adorn it? Many of thoſe who have exerted moſt perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance and intrepidity were obviouſly my inferiors in that reſpect. Why ſhould not I be as daring as they? Adamant and ſteel have a ductility like water to a mind ſufficiently bold and contemplative. The mind is its own place; and is endowed with pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that might enable it to laugh at the tyrant's vigilance. I paſſed and repaſſed theſe ideas in my mind; and, heated with the contemplation, I ſaid, No, I will not die!</p>
                     <p>My reading in early youth had been extremely miſcellaneous. I had read of houſebreakers to whom locks and bolts were a jeſt, and who, vain of their art, exhibited the experiment of entering
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:028752_0268_0FDBF2241BCE9F30"/>
a houſe the moſt ſtrongly barricaded, with as little noiſe and almoſt as little trouble as other men would lift up a latch. This circumſtance had caught my attention. There is nothing ſo intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the juvenile mind as the wonderful; there is no power that it ſo eagerly covets as that of aſtoniſhing ſpectators by its miraculous exertions. Mind appeared to my untutored reflections vague, airy and unfettered, the ſuſceptible perceiver of reaſons, but never intended by nature to be the ſlave of force. Why ſhould it be in the power of man to overtake and hold me by force? Why, when I chooſe to withdraw myſelf, ſhould I not be capable of eluding the moſt vigilant ſearch? Theſe limbs and this trunk are a cumbrous and unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate load for the power of thinking to drag along with it; but why ſhould not the power of thinking be able to lighten the load till it ſhall be no longer felt?—Theſe early modes of reflection were by no means indifferent to my preſent enquiries.</p>
                     <p>Our next-door neighbour at my father's houſe had been a carpenter. Freſh from the ſort of reading, I have mentioned, I was eager to examine his tools, their powers and their uſes. This car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter was a man of a ſtrong and vigorous mind; and, his faculties having been chiefly confined to the range of his profeſſion, he was fertile in expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments and ingenious in reaſoning upon theſe particular topics. I therefore obtained from him conſiderable ſatisfaction; and, my mind being ſet in action, I ſometimes even improved upon the hints he furniſhed. His converſation was particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly agreeable to me; I at firſt worked with him ſometimes for my amuſement, and afterwards occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally for a ſhort time as his journeyman. I was conſtitutionally vigorous, my bones well knit, and my limbs ſinewy and powerful; and by the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:028752_0269_0FDBF2251882BFF0"/>
thus attained I added to the abſtract poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of power the ſkill of applying it, when I pleaſed, in ſuch a manner as that no part ſhould be inefficient.</p>
                     <p>It is a ſtrange, but no uncommon feature in the human mind, that the very reſource of which we ſtand in greateſt need in a critical ſituation, though already accumulated it may be by preceding in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, fails to preſent itſelf at the time when it ſhould be called into action. Thus my mind had paſſed through two very different ſtages ſince my impriſonment, before this means of liberation ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted itſelf. My faculties were overwhelmed in the firſt inſtance, and raiſed to a pitch of enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm in the ſecond, while in both I took it for granted in a manner that I muſt paſſively ſubmit to the good pleaſure of my perſecutors.</p>
                     <p>During the period in which my mind had been thus undecided, the aſſizes, which were held twice a year in the town in which I was a priſoner, came on. Upon this occaſion my caſe was not brought forward, but was ſuffered to ſtand over ſix months longer. It would have been juſt the ſame, if I had had as ſtrong reaſon to expect acquittal, as I had conviction. If I had been apprehended upon the moſt frivolous reaſons upon which any juſtice of the peace ever thought proper to commit a naked beggar for trial, I muſt ſtill have waited about two hundred and ſeventeen days, before my innocence could be cleared. So imperfect are the effects of the boaſted laws of a country whoſe legiſlators hold their aſſembly from four to ſix months in every year! I never certainly diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whether this delay were owing to any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference on the part <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="42" facs="unknown:028752_0270_0FDBD6CF3805F310"/>
itſelf to the rights or benefit of an inſignificant individual.</p>
                     <p>The term of my impriſonment was thus unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countably prolonged. But this was not the only incident that occurred to me during my confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for which I could find no ſatisfactory ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It was nearly at the ſame time, that is, when I had been little more than a month in durance, that the keeper began to alter his behaviour to me. He ſent for me one morning into the part of the building which was appropriated for his own uſe, and after ſome heſitation told me he was ſorry my accommodations had been ſo indifferent, and aſked whether I ſhould like to have a chamber in his family? I was ſtruck with the unexpectedneſs of this queſtion, and deſired to know whether any body had employed him to aſk it. No, he replied; but, now the aſſizes were over, he had fewer felons on his hands, and more time to look about him: He believed I was a good kind of a young man; and he had taken a ſort of a liking to me. I fixed my eye upon his countenance as he ſaid this. I could diſcover none of the uſual ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of kindneſs; he appeared to me to be acting a part, unnatural and that ſat with aukwardneſs upon him. He went on however to offer me the liberty of eating at his table, which, if I choſe it, he ſaid would make no difference to him, and he ſhould not think of charging me any thing for it. He had always indeed as much upon his hands as one perſon could ſee to; but his wife and his daughter Peggy would be woundily pleaſed to hear a perſon of learning talk, as he underſtood I was; and perhaps I might not feel myſelf diſagreeable in their company.</p>
                     <p>I reflected on this propoſal, and had little doubt, notwithſtanding what the keeper had affirmed to
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:028752_0271_0FDBF1E90AE93680"/>
the contrary, that it did not proceed from any ſpontaneous humanity in him, but that he had, to ſpeak the language of perſons of his caſt, good reaſons for what he did. I buſied myſelf in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures as to who could be the author of this ſort of indulgence and attention. The two moſt likely perſons were Mr. Falkland and Mr. Foreſter. The latter I knew to be a man auſtere and inexorable towards thoſe whom he deemed vicious. He piqued himſelf upon being inſenſible to thoſe ſofter emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which he believed to anſwer no other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe than to ſeduce us from our duty. Mr. Falk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land on the contrary was a man of the acuteſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility; hence aroſe his pleaſures and his pains, his virtues and his vices. Though he were the bittereſt enemy to whom I could poſſibly be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and though no ſentiments of humanity could divert or controul the bent of his mind, I yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded myſelf that he was more likely than his kinſman to viſit in idea the ſcene of my dungeon, and to feel impelled to alleviate my ſufferings.</p>
                     <p>This conjecture was by no means calculated to ſerve as balm to my mind. My thoughts were unavoidably full of irritation againſt my perſecutor. How could I think kindly of a man, in compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition with the gratification of whoſe ruling paſſion my good name or my life was deemed as of no conſideration? I ſaw him cruſhing the one and bringing the other into jeopardy, with a quietneſs and compoſure on his part that I could not recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect without horror. I knew not what were his plans reſpecting me. I knew not whether he trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himſelf ſo much as to form a barren wiſh for the preſervation of one, whoſe future proſpects he had ſo iniquitouſly tarniſhed. I had hitherto been ſilent as to my principal topic of recrimination. But I was by no means certain that I ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:028752_0272_0FDBF239C95D8D70"/>
to go out of the world in ſilence, the victim of this man's obduracy and art. In every view I felt my heart ulcerated with a ſenſe of his injuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice; and my very ſoul ſpurned theſe pitiful indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, at a time that he was grinding me into duſt with the inexorableneſs of his vengeance.</p>
                     <p>I was influenced by theſe ſentiments in my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to the jailor; and I found a ſecret pleaſure in pronouncing them in all their bitterneſs. I viewed him with a ſarcaſtic ſmile, and ſaid, I was glad to find him of a ſudden become ſo humane: I was not however without ſome penetration as to the humanity of a jailor, and could gueſs at the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances by which it was produced. But he might tell his employer that his cares were fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; I would accept no favours from a man that held a halter about my neck, and had courage enough to endure the worſt both in time to come and now.—The jailor looked at me with aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and, turning upon his heel, exclaimed, Well done, my cock! You have not had your learning for nothing I ſee. You are ſet upon not dying dunghill. But that is to come, lad: you had better by half keep your courage till you ſhall find it wanted.</p>
                     <p>The aſſizes, which paſſed over without influence to me, produced a great revolution among my fellow priſoners. I lived long enough in the jail to witneſs a general mutation of its inhabitants. One of the houſebreakers and the coiner were hanged. Two more were caſt for tranſportation, and the reſt acquitted. The tranſports remained with us; and, though the priſon was thus lighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of nine of its inhabitants, I left within three as many perſons on the felons' ſide as I had found there on my firſt arrival.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="45" facs="unknown:028752_0273_0FDBF1EBF5310120"/>
The ſoldier, whoſe ſtory I have already record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, died, on the evening of the very day on which the judges arrived, of a diſeaſe the conſequence of his confinement. Such was the juſtice that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted from the laws of his country, to an indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual who would have been the ornament of any age, one who of all the men I ever knew was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſibly the kindeſt, of the moſt feeling heart, of the moſt engaging and unaffected manners, and the moſt unblemiſhed life. The name of this man was Brightwel. Were it poſſible for my pen to conſecrate him to never dying fame, I could un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake no taſk more grateful to my heart. His judgment was penetrating and manly, totally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed with imbecility and confuſion, while at the ſame time there was ſuch an uncontending frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in his countenance, that a ſuperficial obſerver would have ſuppoſed he muſt have been the prey of the firſt plauſible knavery that was practiſed againſt him. Great reaſon have I to remember him with affection! He was the moſt ardent, and I had almoſt ſaid the laſt of my friends. Nor did I remain in this reſpect in his debt. There was indeed a great congeniality, if I may preſume to ſay ſo, in our characters, except that I cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to rival the magnitude of his genius, or to compare with, what the world has ſcarcely ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed, the correctneſs and untainted purity of his conduct. He heard my ſtory, as far as I thought proper to diſcloſe it, with intereſt, he examined it with ſincere impartiality, and, if at firſt any doubt remained upon his mind, a frequent obſervation of me in my moſt unguarded moments taught him in no long time to place an unreſerved confidence in my innocence.</p>
                     <p>He talked of the injuſtice of which we were mutually victims without bitterneſs, and predicted
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:028752_0274_0FDBF22BD3D13630"/>
that the time would come when the poſſibility of ſuch intolerable oppreſſion would be extirpated. But this, he ſaid, was a happineſs reſerved for poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; it was too late for us to reap the benefit of it. It was ſome conſolation to him, that he could not tell the period in his paſt life, which the beſt judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of which he was capable would teach him to ſpend better. He could ſay, with as much reaſon as moſt men, he had diſcharged his duty. But he foreſaw that he ſhould not ſurvive his preſent cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. This was his prediction, while yet in his health. He might be ſaid in a certain ſenſe to have a broken heart. But, if that phraſe were in any way applicable to him, ſure never was deſpair more calm, more full of reſignation and ſerenity.</p>
                     <p>At no time in the whole courſe of my adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures was I expoſed to a ſhock more ſevere than I received from this man's death. The circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his fate preſented themſelves to my mind in their full complication of iniquity. From him and the execrations with which I loaded the government that could be the inſtrument of his tragedy, I turned to myſelf. I beheld the cataſtrophe of Brightwel with envy. A thouſand times I longed that my corſe had laid in death, inſtead of his. I was only reſerved, as I perſuaded myſelf, for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utterable woe. In a few days he would have been acquitted, his liberty, his reputation reſtored; man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind perhaps, ſtruck with the injuſtice he had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, would have ſhown themſelves eager to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance his misfortunes and obliterate his diſgrace. But this man died; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> remained alive! I, who, though not leſs wrongfully treated than he, had no hope of reparation, muſt be marked as long I lived for a villain, and in my death probably held up to the ſcorn and deteſtation of my ſpecies!</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="47" facs="unknown:028752_0275_0FDBF1ECD52EC678"/>
Such were ſome of the immediate reflections which the fate of this unfortunate martyr produced in my mind. Yet my intercourſe with Brightwel was not in the review without its portion of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. I ſaid, This man has ſeen through the veil of calumny that overſhades me; he has under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and has loved me. Why ſhould I deſpair? May I not meet hereafter with men ingenuous like him, who ſhall do me juſtice and ſympathiſe with my calamity? With that conſolation I will be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied. I will reſt in the arms of friendſhip, and forget the malignity of the world. Henceforth I will be contented with tranquil obſcurity, with the cultivation of ſentiment and wiſdom, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of benevolence within a narrow circle. It was thus that my mind became excited to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject I was about to undertake.</p>
                     <p>I had no ſooner meditated the idea of an eſcape, than I determined upon the following method of facilitating the preparations for it. I undertook to ingratiate myſelf with my keeper. In the world I have generally ſound ſuch perſons as had been acquainted with the outline of my ſtory, regarding me with a ſort of loathing and abhorrence, which made them avoid me with as much care as if I had been ſpotted with the plague. The idea of my having firſt robbed my maſter, and then endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to clear myſelf by charging him with ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ornation againſt me, placed me in a claſs diſtinct from and infinitely more guilty than that of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon felons. But this man was too good a maſter of his profeſſion to entertain averſion againſt a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low creature upon ſuch a ſcore. He conſidered the perſons committed to his cuſtody merely as ſo many human bodies for whom he was reſponſible that they ſhould be forthcoming in time and place; and the difference of innocence and guilt he looked
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:028752_0276_0FDBF22D52899EE8"/>
down upon as an affair beneath his attention. I had not therefore the prejudices to encounter in recommending myſelf to him, that I have found ſo peculiarly obſtinate in many other caſes. Add to which, the ſame motive, whatever it was, that had made him ſo profuſe in his offers a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, had probably its influence on the preſent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</p>
                     <p>I informed him of my ſkill in the profeſſion of a joiner, and offered to make him half a dozen hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome chairs, if he would facilitate my obtaining the tools neceſſary for carrying on my profeſſion in my preſent confinement; for, without his conſent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly obtained, it would have been in vain for me to expect that I could quietly exert an induſtry of this kind, even if my exiſtence had depended upon it. He looked at me firſt as aſking himſelf what he was to underſtand by this novel propoſal, and then, moſt graciouſly relaxing, ſaid, he was glad I was come off a little of my high notions and my buckram, and he would ſee what he could do. Two days after he ſignified his compliance. He ſaid that, as to the matter of the preſent I had offered him, he thought nothing of that, I might do as I pleaſed in it; but I might depend upon every civility from him that he could ſhow with ſafety to himſelf, if ſo be as, when he was civil, I did not offer a ſecond time to ſnap and take him up ſhort.</p>
                     <p>Having thus gained my preliminary, I gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally accumulated tools or various ſorts, gimlets, piercers, chiſſels, <hi>et cetera.</hi> I immediately ſet myſelf to work. The nights were long, and the ſordid eagerneſs of my keeper notwithſtanding his oſtentatious generoſity was great; I therefore petitioned and was indulged with a bit of, candle that I might amuſe myſelf for an hour or two with
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:028752_0277_0FDBF1F170D71510"/>
my work after I was locked up in my dungeon. I did not however by any means apply conſtantly to the work I had undertaken, and my jailor betrayed various tokens of impatience. Perhaps he was afraid I ſhould not have finiſhed it before I was hanged. I however inſiſted upon working at my leiſure as I pleaſed, and this he did not venture expreſsly to diſpute. In addition to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages thus obtained, I procured ſecretly from Miſs Peggy, who now and then came into the jail to make her obſervations of the priſoners, and who ſeemed to have conceived ſome partiality for my perſon, the implement of an iron crow.</p>
                     <p>In theſe proceedings it is eaſy to trace the vice and duplicity that muſt be expected to grow out of injuſtice. I know not whether my readers will pardon the ſiniſter advantage I extracted from the myſterious conceſſions of my keeper. But I muſt acknowledge my weakneſs in that reſpect; I am writing my adventures and not my apology: and I was not prepared to maintain the unvaried ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of my manners, at the expence of a ſpeedy cloſe to be put upon my exiſtence.</p>
                     <p>My plan was now digeſted. I believed that by means of the crow I could eaſily and without much noiſe force the door of my dungeon from its hinges, or, if not, that I could, in caſe of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, cut away the lock. This door led into a narrow paſſage, bounded on one ſide by the range of dungeons, and on the other by the jailor's and turnkey's apartments, through which was the uſual entrance from the ſtreet. This outlet I dared not attempt for fear of diſturbing the perſons cloſe to whoſe very door I ſhould in that caſe have found it neceſſary to paſs. I determined therefore upon another door at the farther end of the pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>ge, which was barricaded, and which led to a ſort of
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:028752_0278_0FDBF231D1498D68"/>
a garden in the occupation of the keeper. This gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den I had never entered, but I had had an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of obſerving it from the window of the felons' day room, which looked that way, the room itſelf being immediately over the range of dungeons. I perceived that it was bounded by a wall of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable height, which I was told by my fellow pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners was the extremity of the jail on that ſide, and beyond which was a back-lane of ſome length that terminated upon the ſkirts of the town. Upon an accurate obſervation and much reflection upon the ſubject I found that I ſhould be able, if once I got into the garden, with my gimblets and piercers inſerted at proper diſtances to make a ſort of lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, by means of which I could get clear over the wall, and once more take poſſeſſion of the ſweets of liberty. I preferred this wall to that which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſkirted my dungeon, on the other ſide of which was a populous ſtreet.</p>
                     <p>I ſuffered about two days to elapſe from the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod at which I had thoroughly digeſted my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and then in the very middle of the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſet about its execution. The firſt door was attended with conſiderable difficulty, but at length this obſtacle was happily removed. The ſecond door was faſtened on the inſide. I was therefore able with perfect eaſe to puſh back the bolts. But the lock, which of courſe was depended upon for the principal ſecurity, and was therefore ſtrong, was double-ſhot, and the key taken away. I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured with my chiſſel to force back the bolt of the lock, but to no purpoſe. I then unſcrewed the box of the lock; and, that being taken away, the door was no longer oppoſed to my wiſhes.</p>
                     <p>Thus far I had proceeded with the happieſt ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, but cloſe on the other ſide of the door there was a kennel with a large maſtiff dog, of which I
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:028752_0279_0FDBF2342F3CD988"/>
had not the ſmalleſt previous knowledge. Though I ſtepped along in the moſt careful manner, this animal was diſturbed and began to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ark. I was extremely diſconcerted, but immediately applied myſelf to ſoothe the animal, in which I preſently ſucceeded. I then returned along the paſſage to liſten whether any body had been diſturbed by the noiſe of the dog; reſolved, if that were the caſe, that I would return to my dungeon, and endeavour to replace every thing in its former ſtate. But the whole appeared perfectly quiet, and I was encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to proceed in my operation.</p>
                     <p>I now got to the wall, and had nearly gained half the aſcent, when I heard a voice at the garden door, crying, Holloa! who is there? who opened the door? The man received no anſwer, and the night was too dark for him to diſtinguiſh objects at any diſtance. He therefore returned, as I judged, into the houſe for a light. Meantime the dog, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the key in which theſe interrogations were uttered, began barking again more violently than ever. I had now no poſſibility of retreat, and I was not without hopes that I might yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh my object, and clear the wall. Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while a ſecond man came out, while the other was getting his lanthorn, and, by that time, I had got to the top of the wall, was able to perceive me. He immediately ſet up a ſhout, and threw a large ſtone which grazed me in its flight. Alarmed at my ſituation, I was obliged to deſcend on the other ſide without taking the neceſſary precautions, and in my fall nearly diſlocated my ancle.</p>
                     <p>There was a door in the wall, of which I was not previouſly appriſed; and, this being opened, the two men with the lanthorn were on the other ſide in an inſtant. They had then nothing to do but to run along the lane to the place from which I
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:028752_0280_0FDBF2CC5722DDE8"/>
had deſcended. I endeavoured to ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>I WAS conducted to the keeper's room for that night, and the two men ſat up with me. I was accoſted with many interrogatories, to which I gave little anſwer, but complained of the hurt in my leg. To this I could obtain no reply except, Curſe you, my lad! if that be all, we will give you ſome ointment for that; we will anoint it with a little cold iron. They were indeed exceſſively <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ulky with me, for having broken their night's reſt and given them all this trouble. In the morning they were as good as their word, fixing a pair of fetters upon both my legs, regardleſs of the ancle which was now ſwelled to a conſiderable ſize, and then faſtening me with a padlock to a ſtaple in the floor of my dungeon. I expoſtulated with warmth upon this treatment, told them that I was a man upon whom the law had as yet paſſed no cenſure, and who therefore in the eye of the law was inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. But they bid me keep ſuch fudge as that for people who knew no better; that they knew what they did, and would anſwer it to any court in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
                     <p>The pain of the fetter was intolerable. I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured in various ways to relieve it, and even privily to free my leg; but the more it was ſwelled, the more was this rendered impoſſible. I then reſolved to bear it with patience; ſtill the longer it continued, the worſe it grew. After two days and two nights I entreated the turnkey to go and aſk the ſurgeon who uſually attended the priſon
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:028752_0282_0FDBF23AD2190A98"/>
to look at it, for, if it continued longer as it was, I was convinced it would mortify. But he glared <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>lily at me, and ſaid, Damn my blood! I ſhould like to ſee that day. To die of a mortification is too good an end for ſuch a raſcal! At the time that he thus addreſſed me, the whole maſs of my blood was already fevered by the anguiſh I had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone, my patience was wholly exhauſted, and I was ſilly enough to be irritated beyond bearing by his impertinence and vulgarity. Look you, Mr. turnkey, ſaid I, there is one thing that ſuch fellows as you are ſet over us for, and another thing that you are not. You are to take care we do not eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, but it is no part of your office to call us names and abuſe us. If I were not chained down to my ſeat, you dare as well eat your fingers as uſe ſuch language; and, take my word for it, you ſhall yet live to repent of your inſolence.</p>
                     <p>While I thus ſpoke, the man ſtared at me with aſtoniſhment. He was ſo little accuſtomed to ſuch retorts that at firſt he could ſcarcely believe his ears; and ſuch was the firmneſs of my manner that he ſeemed to forget for a moment that I was not at large. But, as ſoon as he had time to recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect himſelf, he did not deign even to be angry. His face relaxed into a ſmile of contempt, he ſnap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped his fingers at me, and, turning upon his heel, exclaimed, Well ſaid, my cock, Crow away! Have a care you do not burſt! and, as he ſhut the door upon me, mimicked the voice of the animal he mentioned.</p>
                     <p>This rejoinder brought me to myſelf in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſhowed me the impotence of the reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I was expreſſing. But, though he thus put an end to the violence of my ſpeech, the torture of my body continued as great as ever. I was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to change my mode of attack. The ſame turnkey returned in a few minutes; and, as he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:028752_0283_0FDBF28365FE5D38"/>
me to put down ſome food he had brought I ſlipped a ſhilling into his hand, ſaying at the ſame time, My good fellow, for God's ſake, go to the ſurgeon: I am ſure you do not wiſh me to periſh for want of aſſiſtance. The fellow put the ſhilling in his pocket, looked hard at me, and then with one nod of his head, and without uttering a ſingle word, went away. The ſurgeon preſently after made his appearance; and, finding the part in a high ſtate of inflammation, ordered certain appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, and gave peremptory directions that the fetter ſhould not be replaced upon that leg, till a cure had been effected. It was a full month be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the leg was perfectly healed, and made equally ſtrong and flexible with the other.</p>
                     <p>The condition in which I was now placed was totally different from that which had preceded this attempt. I was chained all day in my dungeon, except that the door was regularly opened for a few hours, at which time ſome of the priſoners occaſionally came and ſpoke to me, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly one, who, though he could ill replace my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Brightwel, was innocent, guileleſs and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent. This was no other than the individual whom Mr. Falkland had ſome months before diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed upon an accuſation of murder. My manual labours were now at an end; my dungeon was ſearched every night, and every kind of tool care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully kept from me. The ſtraw which has been hitherto allowed me was removed, under pretence that it was adapted for concealment; and the only conveniences with which I was indulged were a chair and a blanket.</p>
                     <p>A proſpect of ſome alleviation in no long time opened upon me; but this my uſual ill fortune rendered abortive. The keeper once more made his appearance, and with his former unconſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal and ambiguous humanity. He pretended to
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:028752_0284_0FDBF23F82A99C30"/>
be ſurpriſed at my want of every accommodation. He reprehended in ſtrong terms my attempt to eſcape, and obſerved that there muſt be an end of civility from people in his ſituation, if gentlemen after all would not know when they were well. It was neceſſary in caſes the like of this to let the law take its courſe, and it would be ridiculous i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> me to complain, if after a regular trial things ſhould go hard with me. He was deſirous of being in every reſpect my friend, if I would let him—In the midſt of this circumlocution and preamble, he was called away from me for ſomething relating to the buſineſs of his office. In the mean time I ruminated upon his overtures; and, deteſting as I did the ſource from which I conceived them to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>low, I could not help reflecting how far it would be poſſible to extract from them the means of eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape. But my meditations in this caſe were vain. The keeper returned no more during the remainder of that day, and on the next an incident occurred which put an end to all expectations from his kindneſs.</p>
                     <p>An active mind, which has once been forced into any particular train, can ſcarcely be perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to deſert it as hopeleſs. I had ſtudied my chains during the extreme anguiſh that I endured from the preſſure of the fetter upon the ancle which had been ſprained; and, though from the ſwelling and acute ſenſibility of the part I had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ound all attempts at relief in that inſtance imprac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable, I obtained from the cloſeneſs of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigation another and apparently ſuperior advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. During the night my dungeon was in a ſtate of complete darkneſs; but, when the door was open, the caſe was ſomewhat different. The paſſage indeed into which it opened was ſo narrow, and the oppoſite dead wall ſo near, that it was but
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:028752_0285_0FDBF284524BFD90"/>
a glimmering and melancholy light that entered my apartment, even at full noon, and when the door was as its wideſt extent. But my eyes, after a practice of two or three weeks, accommodated themſelves to this circumſtance, and I learned to diſtinguiſh the minuteſt objects. One day, as I was alternately meditating and examining the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects around me, I chanced to obſerve a nail trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den into the mud floor at no great diſtance from me. I immediately conceived the deſire of poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing myſelf of this implement; but, for fear of ſurpriſe, people paſſing perpetually to and fro, I contented myſelf for the preſent with remarking its ſituation ſo accurately, that I might eaſily find it again in the dark. Accordingly, as ſoon as my door was ſhut, I ſeized upon this new treaſure, and, having contrived to faſhion it to my purpoſe, found that I could unlock with it the padlock that faſtened me to the ſtaple in the floor. This I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded as no inconſiderable advantage, ſeparately from the uſe I might derive from it in relation to my principal object. My chain permitted me to move only about eighteen inches to the right or left; and, having borne this confinement for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral weeks, my very heart leaped at the pitiful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation of being able to range without conſtraint, the miſerable coop in which I was immured. This incident had occurred ſeveral days previous to the laſt viſit of my keeper.</p>
                     <p>From this time it had been my conſtant practice to liberate myſelf every night, and not to replace things in their former ſituation, till I awoke in the morning, and expected ſhortly to perceive the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the turnkey. Security breeds negligence. It was on the morning ſucceeding my conference with the jailor that, whether I overſlept myſelf, or the turnkey went his round earlier than uſual, I
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:028752_0286_0FDBF2419196A3C8"/>
was rouſed from my ſleep by the noiſe he made in opening the cell next to my own; and, though I exerted the utmoſt diligence, yet having to grope for my materials in the dark, I was unable to faſten the chain to the ſtaple, before he entered as uſual with his lanthorn. He was extremely ſurpriſed to find me thus diſengaged, and immediately ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned the principal keeper. I was queſtioned re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting my method of proceeding; and, as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved concealment could lead to nothing but a ſeverer ſearch and a more accurate watch, I readily acquainted them with the exact truth. The illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious perſonage whoſe function it was to controul the inhabitants of theſe walls, was by this laſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance completely exaſperated againſt me. Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and fair ſpeaking were at an end. His eyes ſparkling with fury, he exclaimed, that he was now convinced of the folly of ſhowing kindneſs to raſcals, the ſcum of the earth, ſuch as I was; and, damn him, if any body ſhould catch him at that again towards any one. I had cured him effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually! He was aſtoniſhed that the laws had not provided ſome terrible retaliation for thieves that attempted to deceive their jailors. Hanging was a thouſand times too good for me!</p>
                     <p>Having vented his indignation, he proceeded to give ſuch orders as the united inſtigations of anger and alarm ſuggeſted to his mind. My apartment was changed. I was conducted to a room called the ſtrong room, the door of which opened into the middle cell of the range of dungeons. It was under-ground as they were, and had over it the day room for felons already deſcribed. It was ſpacious and dreary. The door had not been opened for years; the air was putrid; and the walls hung round with damps and mildew. The fetters, the padlock, and the ſtaple were employed
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:028752_0287_0FDBF28B442A9AC8"/>
as in the former caſe, in addition to which they put on me a pair of hand-cuffs. For my firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion the keeper ſent me nothing but a bit of bread, mouldy and black, and ſome dirty and ſtinking water. I know not indeed whether this is to be regarded as gratuitous tyranny on the part of the jailor; the law having providently directed in certain caſes, that the water to be adminiſtered to the priſoners, ſhall be taken from "the next ſink or puddle neareſt to the jail."<note n="*" place="bottom">State Trials, Vol. I. anno 1615.</note> It was far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ordered that one of the turnkeys ſhould ſleep in the cell that formed a ſort of antichamber to my apartment. Though every convenience was provided, to render this chamber fit for the recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a perſonage, of a dignity ſo ſuperior to the felon he was appointed to guard, he expreſſed much diſſatisfaction at the mandate: but there was no alternative.</p>
                     <p>The ſituation to which I was thus removed was apparently the moſt undeſirable that could be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined; but I was not diſcouraged. I had for ſome time learned not to judge by appearances. The apartment was dank and unwholeſome; but I had acquired the ſecret of counteracting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences. My door was kept continually ſhut, and the other priſoners were debarred acceſs to me. But, if the intercourſe of our fellow men has its pleaſures, ſolitude on the other hand is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out its advantages<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In ſolitude we can purſue our own thoughts undiſturbed; and I was able to call up at will the moſt pleaſing avocations. Beſide which, to one who meditated ſuch deſigns as now <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>illed my mind, ſolitude had peculiar recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations. I was ſcarcely left to myſelf before I tried an experiment the idea of which I conceived
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:028752_0288_0FDBF246D9625250"/>
while they were fixing my hand-cuffs; and, with my teeth only, diſengaged myſelf from this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint. The hours at which I was viſited by the keepers were regular, and I took care to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for them. Add to which, I had a narrow grated window near the cieling, about nine inches in perpendicular, and a foot and a half in width, which, though ſmall, admitted a much ſtronger light, than that to which I had been accuſtomed for ſeveral weeks. Thus circumſtanced, I ſcarcely ever found myſelf in total darkneſs, and was better provided againſt ſurpriſes, than I had been in my preceding ſituation. Such were the ſentiments which this change of abode immediately ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                     <p>I had been a very little time removed, when I received an unexpected viſit from Thomas, Mr. Falk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land's valet, whom I have already more than once mentioned in the courſe of my narrative. A ſervant of Mr. Foreſter happened to come to the town where I was impriſoned, a few weeks before, while I was confined with the hurt in my ancle, and had called in to ſee me. The account he gave of what he obſerved had been the ſource of many an uneaſy ſenſation to Thomas. The former viſit was a matter of mere curioſity, but Thomas was of the better order of ſervants. He was conſiderably ſtruck at the ſight of me. Though my mind was now ſerene, and my health ſufficiently good, yet the floridneſs of my complexion was gone, and there was a rudeneſs in my phyſiognomy, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of hardſhip and fortitude, extremely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the ſleekneſs of my better days. Thomas looked alternately in my face, at my hands and my feet; and then fetched a deep ſigh. After a pauſe:</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="61" facs="unknown:028752_0289_0FDBF28C99AECC70"/>
Lord bleſs us! ſaid he, in a voice in which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration was ſufficiently perceptible, is this you?</p>
                     <p>Why not, Thomas? You knew I was ſent to priſon, did not you?</p>
                     <p>Priſon! and muſt people in priſon be ſhackled and bound of that faſhion?—And where do you lay of nights?</p>
                     <p>Here.</p>
                     <p>Here! Why there is no bed!</p>
                     <p>No, Thomas, I am not allowed a bed. I had ſtraw formerly, but that is taken away.</p>
                     <p>And do they take off them there things of nights?</p>
                     <p>No; I am expected to ſleep juſt as you ſee.</p>
                     <p>Sleep! Why I thought this was a Chriſtian country; but this uſage is too bad for a dog.</p>
                     <p>You muſt not ſay ſo, Thomas. It is what the wiſdom of government has thought fit to provide.</p>
                     <p>Zounds, how I have been chouſed! They told me what a fine thing it was to be an Engliſhman, and about liberty and property, and all that there; and I find it is all a flam. Lord, what fools we be! Things are done under our very noſes, and we know nothing of the matter; and a parcel of fellows with grave faces ſwear to us that ſuch things never happen but in France, and other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries the like of that.

I did not think of your ſuffering all this into the bargain.</p>
                     <p>Soon after this converſation Thomas left me. The idea of the long connexion of our families ruſhed upon his memory, and he felt more for my ſufferings at the moment than I did for myſelf. In the afternoon I was ſurpriſed to ſee him again. He ſaid, that he could not get the thought of me out of his mind, and therefore he hoped I would not be diſpleaſed at his coming once more to take leave of me. I could perceive that he had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing upon his mind, which he did not know how to diſcharge. One of the turnkeys had each time come into the room with him, and continued as long as he ſtaid. Upon ſome avocation however, a noiſe I believe in the paſſage, the turnkey went as far as the door to ſatisfy his curioſity; and Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, watching the opportunity, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>aw, exclaiming at the ſame time with a ſorrowful tone. I know I am doing wrong; but, if they hang me too<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I cannot help it: I cannot do no other. For Chriſt's ſake, get out of this place; I cannot bear the thoughts of it!—I received the implements with great joy, and thruſt them into my boſom; and, as ſoon as he was gone, concealed them in the ruſhes of my chair. Meanwhile he had accompliſhed the object for which he came, and preſently after bade me farewel.</p>
                     <p>The next day the keepers, I know not for what reaſon, were more than uſually induſtrious in their ſearch, ſaying, though without aſſigning any ground for their ſuſpicion, that they were ſure I had ſome tool in my poſſeſſion that I ought not; but the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitory I had choſen eſcaped them.</p>
                     <p>I waited from this time the greater part of a week that I might have the benefit of a bright
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:028752_0291_0FDBF22A84B7E6A8"/>
moon light. It was neceſſary that I ſhould work in the night; it was neceſſary that my operations ſhould be performed between the laſt viſit of the keepers at night and their firſt in the morning, that is, between nine in the evening and ſeven. In my dungeon, as I have already ſaid, I paſſed fourteen or ſixteen hours of the four and twenty undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed; but, ſince I had acquired a character for mechanical ingenuity, a particular exception with reſpect to me was made from the general rules of the priſon.</p>
                     <p>It was ten o'clock when I entered on my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking. The room in which I was confined was ſecured with a double door. This was totally ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous for the purpoſe of my detention, ſince there was a centinel planted on the outſide. But it was very fortunate for my plan, becauſe theſe doors prevented the eaſy communication of ſound, and afforded me tolerable ſatisfaction that with a little care in my mode of proceeding I might be ſecure againſt the danger of being overheard. I firſt took off my hand-cuffs. I then filed through my fetters; and next performed the ſame ſervice to three of the iron bars that ſecured my window, to which I climbed partly by the aſſiſtance of my chair and partly by means of certain irregularities in the wall. All this was the work of more than two hours. When the bars were filed through, I eaſily forced them a little from the perpendicular, and then drew them one by one out of the wall, into which they were ſunk about three inches, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſtrait, and without any precaution to prevent their being removed. But the ſpace thus obtained was by no means wide enough to admit the paſſing of my body. I therefore applied myſelf partly with my chiſſel, and partly with one of the iron bars, to the looſening the brick work; and, when
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:028752_0292_0FDBF24C1328FFB0"/>
I had thus diſengaged four or five bricks, I got down and piled them upon the floor. This opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I repeated three or four times. The ſpace was now ſufficient for my purpoſe, and having crept through the opening, I ſtepped upon a ſort of ſhed on the outſide.</p>
                     <p>I was now in a kind of rude area between two dead walls, that ſouth of the felons day room the windows of which were at the eaſt end, and the wall of the priſon. But I had not, as formerly, any inſtruments to aſſiſt me in ſcaling the wall which was of a conſiderable height. There was of conſequence no reſource for me but that of ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting a practicable breach in the lower part of the wall, which was of no contemptible ſtrength, being of ſtone on the outſide, with a facing of brick within. The rooms for the debtors were at right angles with the building from which I had juſt eſcaped; and, as the night was extremely bright, I was in momentary danger, particularly in caſe of the leaſt noiſe, of being diſcovered by them, ſeveral of their windows commanding the area. Thus circumſtanced, I determined to make the ſhed anſwer the purpoſe of concealment. It was locked; but, with the broken link of my fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which I had had the precaution to bring with me, I found no great difficulty in opening the lock. I had now got a ſufficient means of hiding my perſon while I proceeded in my work, attended with no other diſadvantage, than that of being obliged to leave the door through which I had thus broken, a little open for the ſake of light. After ſome time I had removed a conſiderable part of the brick work of the outer wall; but, when I came to the ſtone, I found the undertaking infinitely more difficult. The mortar which bound together the building, was by length of time nearly petri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:028752_0293_0FDBF293516110F0"/>
and appeared to my firſt efforts one ſolid rock of the hardeſt adamant. I had now been ſix hours inceſſantly engaged in incredible labour; my chiſſel broke in the firſt attempt upon this new ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle, and between fatigue already endured, and the ſeemingly invincible difficulty before me, I concluded that I muſt remain where I was, and that all I had hitherto effected would prove uſeleſs. At the ſame time the moon, whoſe light had till now been of the greateſt uſe to me, ſet, and I was left in total darkneſs.</p>
                     <p>After a reſpite of ten minutes however, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the attack with new vigour. I could not be leſs than two hours before the firſt ſtone was looſened from the edifice. In one hour more the ſpace was ſufficient to admit of my eſcape. The pile of bricks I had left in the ſtrong room was conſiderable. But it was a mole hill compared with the ruins I had forced from the outer wall. I am fully aſſured that the work I had thus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed would have been to a common labourer with every advantage of tools the buſineſs of two or three days.</p>
                     <p>But my difficulties, inſtead of being ended, ſeemed to be only begun. The day broke before I had completed the opening, and in ten minutes more the keepers would probably enter my apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and perceive the devaſtation I had left. The lane, which connected the ſide of the priſon through which I had eſcaped with the adjacent country, was formed chiefly by two dead walls, with here and there a ſtable, a few warehouſes and ſome mean habitations tenanted by the lower order of people. My beſt ſecurity lay in clearing the town as ſoon as poſſible, and depending upon the open country for protection. My arms were intolerably ſwelled and bruiſed with my labour, and
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:028752_0294_0FDBF250F78F6B50"/>
my ſtrength ſeemed wholly exhauſted with fatigue. Speed I was nearly unable to exert for any conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance; and, if I could, with the enemy ſo cloſe at my heels, ſpeed would too probably have been uſeleſs It appeared as if I were now in almoſt the ſame ſituation, as that in which I had been placed five or ſix weeks before, in which after having completed my eſcape I was obliged to yield myſelf up without reſiſtance to my purſuers. I was not however diſabled as then; I was capable of exertion to what preciſe extent I could not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain; and I was well aware that every inſtance in which I ſhould fail of my purpoſe, would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to enhance the difficulty of any future at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. Such were the con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>iderations that preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves in relation to my eſcape; and, even if that were effected, I had to reckon among my difficulties that, at the time I quitted my priſon, I was deſtitute of every reſource, and had not a ſhilling remaining in the world.</p>

                     <p>I PASSED along the lane I had deſcribed without perceiving or being obſerved by a human being. The doors were ſhut, the window-ſhutters cloſed, and all was ſtill as night. I reached the extremity of the lane unmoleſted. My purſuers, if they immediately followed, would know that the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood was ſmall of my having in the interval found ſhelter in this place; and would proceed without heſitation, as I on my part was obliged to do, from the end neareſt to the priſon to its fartheſt termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>and; and the ſurface extremely irregular. I climbed a ſmall eminence, and could perceive not very remote in the diſtance a few cottages thinly ſcattered. This proſpect did not altogether pleaſe me; I conceived that my ſafety would for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent be extremely benefited by keeping myſelf from the view of any human being.</p>
                     <p>I therefore came down again into the valley, and upon a careful examination perceived that it was interſperſed with cavities, ſome deeper than others, but all of them ſo ſhallow as neither to be capable of hiding a man, nor of exciting ſuſpicion as places of poſſible concealment. Meanwhile the day had but juſt begun to dawn; the morning was lowering and drizzly; and, though the depth of
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:028752_0296_0FDBF252106FEE78"/>
theſe caverns was of courſe well known to the neighbouring inhabitants, the ſhadows they caſt were ſo black and impenetrable as might well have produced wider expectations in the mind of a ſtranger. Poor therefore as was the protection they were able to afford, I thought it right to have recourſe to it for the moment as the beſt the emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency would ſupply. It was for my life; and, the greater was the jeopardy to which it was expoſed, the more dear did that life ſeem to become to my affections. The receſs I choſe as moſt ſecure was within little more than a hundred yards of the end of the lane and the extreme buildings of the town.</p>
                     <p>I had not ſtood up in this manner two minutes, before I heard the ſound of feet, and preſently ſaw the ordinary turnkey and another paſs by the place of my retreat. They were ſo cloſe to me that, if I had ſtretched out my hand, I believe I could have caught hold of their clothes without ſo much as changing my poſture. As no part of the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanging earth intervened between me and them, I could ſee them entire, though the deepneſs of the ſhade rendered me almoſt completely inviſible. I heard them ſay to each other, in tones of vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment aſperity, Curſe the raſcal! which way can he be gone? Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Never fear! re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined the firſt, he cannot have above half a mile the ſtart of us They were preſently out of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for, as to ſight, I dared not advance my body ſo much as an inch to look after them, leſt I ſhould be diſcovered by my purſuers in ſome other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. From the very ſhort time that elapſed between my eſcape and the appearance of theſe men, I concluded that they had made their way through the ſame outlet as I had done, it being impoſſible that they could have had time to come
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:028752_0297_0FDBF29B90137A80"/>
from the gate of the priſon and ſo round a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable part of the town, as they muſt otherwiſe have done.</p>
                     <p>I was ſo alarmed at this inſtance of diligence on the part of the enemy, that for ſome time I ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ventured to proceed an inch from my place of concealment, or almoſt to change my poſture. The morning, which had been bleak and drizzly, was ſucceeded by a day of heavy and inceſſant rain: and the gloomy ſtate of the air and ſurrounding objects, together with the extreme nearneſs of my priſon, and a total want of food, cauſed me to paſs the hours in no very agreeable ſenſations. This inclemency of the weather however, which generated a feeling of ſtillneſs and ſolitude, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged me by degrees to change my retreat, for another of the ſame nature, but of ſomewhat greater ſecurity. I hovered with little variation about a ſingle ſpot as long as the ſun continued above the horizon.</p>
                     <p>Towards evening the clouds began to diſperſe, and the moon ſhone, as on the preceding night, in full brightneſs. I had perceived no human creature during the whole day, except in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance already mentioned. This had perhaps been owing to the nature of the day; at all events I conſidered it as too hazardous an experiment to venture from my hiding-place in ſo clear and fine a night. I was therefore obliged to wait for the ſetting of this luminary, which was not till near five o'clock in the morning. My only relief during this interval was to allow myſelf to ſink to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of my cavern, it being ſcarcely poſſible for me to continue any longer on my feet. Here I fell into an interrupted and unrefreſhing doze, the conſequence of a laborious night and a tedious, melancholy day; though I rather ſought to avoid
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:028752_0298_0FDBF25392D5A7C0"/>
ſleep, which, co-operating with the coldneſs of the ſeaſon, would tend more to injury than ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
                     <p>The period of darkneſs which I had determined to uſe for the purpoſe of removing to a greater diſtance from my priſon was in its whole duration ſomething leſs than three hours. When I roſe from my ſeat, I was weak with hunger and fatigue, and, which was worſe, I ſeemed between the dampneſs of the preceding day, and the ſharp, clear froſt of the night, to have loſt the command of my limbs. I ſtood up and ſhook myſelf; I leaned againſt the ſide of the hill, impelling in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent directions the muſcles of the extremities; and at length recovered in ſome degree the ſenſe of feeling. This operation was attended with an incredible aching pain, and required no common ſhare of reſolution to encounter and proſecute it. Having quitted my retreat, I at firſt advanced with weak and tottering ſteps; but, as I proceeded, increaſed my pace. The barren heath which reached to the edge of the town was at leaſt on this ſide without a path; but the ſtars ſhone, and guiding myſelf by them I determined to ſteer as far as poſſible from the hateful ſcene where I had been ſo long confined. The line I purſued was of irregular ſurface, ſometimes obliging me to climb a ſteep aſcent, and at others to go down into a dark and impenetrable dell. I was often compelled by the dangerouſneſs of the way to deviate conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably from the direction I wiſhed to purſue. In the mean time I advanced with as much rapidity, as theſe and ſimilar obſtacles would permit me to do. The ſwiftneſs of the motion and the thinneſs of the air reſtored to me my alacrity. I forgot the inconveniences under which I laboured, and my mind became lively, ſpirited and enthuſiaſtic.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="71" facs="unknown:028752_0299_0FDBF29D2ED58080"/>
I had now reached the border of the heath and entered upon what is uſually termed the foreſt. Strange as it may ſeem, it is nevertheleſs true, that, exhauſted as I was with hunger, deſtitute of all proviſion for the future, and ſurrounded with the moſt alarming dangers, my mind ſuddenly became glowing, animated and chearful. I thought that by this time the moſt formidable difficulties of my undertaking were ſurmounted; and I could not believe that, after having effected ſo much, I ſhould find any thing invincible in what remained to be done. I recollected the confinement I had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone and the fate that had impended over me with horror. Never did man feel more vividly than I felt at that moment the ſweets of liberty. Never did man more ſtrenuouſly prefer poverty with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence to the artificial allurements of a life of ſlavery. I ſtretched forth my arms with rapture, I clapped my hands one upon the other, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, Ah, this is indeed to be a man! Theſe wriſts were lately galled with fetters; all my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whether I roſe up or ſat down, were echoed to with the clanking of chains; I was tied down like a wild beaſt, and could not move but in a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of a few feet in circumference. Now I can run, fleet as a greyhound; and leap like a young roe upon the mountains. Oh, God! (if God there be, that condeſcends to record the lonely beatings of an anxious heart) thou only canſt tell with what delight a priſoner, juſt broke forth from his dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, hugs the bleſſings of new-found liberty! Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and indeſcribable moment, when man regains his rights! But lately I held my life in jeopardy, becauſe one man was unprincipled enough to aſſert what he knew to be falſe; I was deſtined to ſuffer an early and inexorable death from the hands of others, becauſe none of them had penetration
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:028752_0300_0FDBF25803473BC0"/>
enough to diſtinguiſh from falſhood what I uttered with the entire conviction of a full-fraught heart! Strange, that men from age of age ſhould conſent to hold their lives at the breath of another, merely that each in his turn may have a power of acting the tyrant according to law! Oh, God! give me poverty! ſhower upon me all the imaginary hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips of human life! I will receive them all with thankfulneſs. Turn me a prey to the wild beaſts of the deſert, ſo I be never again the victim of man dreſſed in the gore-dripping robes of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity! Suffer me at leaſt to call life and the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits of life my own! Let me hold it at the mercy of elements, of the hunger of beaſts or the revenge of barbarians, but not of the cold-blooded pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of monopoliſts and kings!—How enviable was the enthuſiaſm which could thus furniſh me with energy, in the midſt of hunger, poverty and univerſal deſertion!</p>
                     <p>I had now walked at leaſt ſix miles. At firſt I carefully avoided the habitations that lay in my way, and feared to be ſeen by any of the perſons to whom they belonged, leſt it ſhould in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree furniſh a clue to the reſearches of my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuers. As I went forward, I conceived it might be proper to relax a part of my precaution. At this time I perceived ſeveral perſons coming out of a thicket cloſe to me. I immediately conſidered this circumſtance as rather favourable than the contrary. It was neceſſary for me to avoid enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any of the towns and villages in the vicinity. At the ſame time it was full time that I ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure for myſelf ſome ſpecies of refreſhment; and it was by no means improbable that theſe men might be in ſome way aſſiſting to me in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. In my ſituation it appeared to me indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent what might be their employment or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:028752_0301_0FDBF2A21C8E7490"/>
I had little to apprehend from thieves, and I believed that they, as well as honeſt men, could not fail to have ſome compaſſion for a perſon under my circumſtances. I therefore rather threw myſelf in their way than avoided them.</p>
                     <p>They were thieves. One of the company cried out, Who goes there? ſtand! I accoſted them. Gentlemen, ſaid I, I am a poor traveller, almoſt—While I ſpoke, they came round me, and he that had firſt hailed me ſaid, Damn me, tip us none of your palaver; we have heard that ſtory of a poor traveller any time theſe five years. Come, down with your duſt! let us ſee what you have got! Sir, I replied, I have not a ſhilling in the world, and am more than half-ſtarved beſide. Not a ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling! anſwered my aſſailant, what, I ſuppoſe you are as poor as a thief? But, if you have not money, you have clothes, and thoſe you muſt reſign.</p>
                     <p>My clothes! rejoined I with indignation; you cannot deſire ſuch a thing. Is it not enough that I am pennyleſs? I have been all night upon the open heath. It is now the ſecond day that I have not eaten a morſel of bread. Would you ſtrip me naked to the weather in the midſt of this depopu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated foreſt? No, no, you are men! The ſame hatred of oppreſſion that arms you againſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence of wealth, will teach you to relieve thoſe who are periſhing like me. For God's ſake, give me food! do not ſtrip me of the benefits I ſtill poſſeſs!</p>
                     <p>While I uttered this apoſtrophe, the unpreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated eloquence of ſentiment, I could perceive by their geſtures, though the day had not yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to dawn, that the feelings of one or two of the company appeared to take my part. The man, who had already undertaken to be their ſpokeſman,
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:028752_0302_0FDBF258D099F060"/>
perceived the ſame thing; and, excited either by the brutality of his temper or the love of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, haſtened to anticipate the diſgrace of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat. He bruſhed ſuddenly up to me, and by main force puſhed me ſeveral feet from the place where I ſtood. The ſhock I received drove me upon a ſecond of the gang, not one of thoſe who had liſtened to my expoſtulation; and he repeated the ſame brutality. My indignation was ſtrongly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by this treatment; and, after being thruſt backward and forward two or three times in this manner, I broke through my aſſailants, and turned round to defend myſelf. The firſt that advanced within my reach was my original enemy. In the preſent moment I liſtened to nothing but the dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of paſſion, and I laid him at his length on the earth. I was immediately aſſailed with ſticks and bludgeons on all ſides, and preſently received a blow that almoſt deprived me of my ſenſes. The man I had knocked down was now upon his feet again, and aimed a ſtroke at me with a cutlaſs as I fell, which took place in a deep wound upon my neck and ſhoulder. He was going to repeat his blow. The two who had ſeemed to waver at firſt in their animoſity, afterwards appeared to me to join in the attack, urged either by animal ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy or the ſpirit of imitation.

You ſhall not ſtrike, by G—! ſaid one of the voices; why ſhould we be murderers?—The ſide of forbearance at length prevailed. They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore contented themſelves with ſtripping me of my coat and waiſtcoat, and rolling me into a dry ditch. They then left me, totally regardleſs of my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed condition, and the plentiful effuſion of blood which ſtreamed from my wound.</p>

                     <p>IN this woful ſituation, though extremely weak, I was not deprived of ſenſe. I tore my ſhirt from my naked body, and with it endeavoured with ſome ſucceſs to make a bandage to ſtanch the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the blood. I then exerted myſelf to crawl up the ſide of the ditch. I had ſcarcely effected the latter, when with equal ſurpriſe and joy I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a man advancing at no great diſtance. I called for help as well as I could. The man came towards me with evident ſigns of compaſſion, and the figure I exhibited was indeed ſufficiently calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to excite it. I had no hat. My hair was diſheveled, and the ends of the locks clotted with blood. My ſhirt was wrapped about my neck and ſhoulder, and was plentifully ſtained with red. My body which was naked to my middle was variegated with ſtreams of blood, nor had my breeches which were of leather by any means eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped.</p>
                     <p>For God's ſake, my poor fellow! ſaid he, with a tone of the greateſt imaginable kindneſs, how came you thus? And, ſaying this, he lifted me up, and ſet me on my feet. Can you ſtand? added he doubtfully. Oh, yes, very well, I replied. Having received this anſwer, he quitted me, and began to take off his own coat, that he might cover me from the cold. I had however overrated my ſtrength, and was no ſooner left to myſelf, than I reeled, and fell almoſt at my length upon the
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:028752_0305_0FDBF2A654BD5B50"/>
ground. But I broke my fall by ſtretching out my ſound arm, and again raiſed myſelf upon my knees. My benefactor now covered me, raiſed me, and bidding me lean upon him, told me he would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently conduct me to a place where I ſhould be taken care of. Courage is a capricious property; and, though while I had no one to depend upon but myſelf, I poſſeſſed a mine of ſeemingly inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſtible fortitude, yet no ſooner did I find this unexpected ſympathy on the part of another, than my reſolution appeared to give way, and I felt my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ready to ſaint. My charitable conductor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this, and he every now and then encouraged me in a manner ſo chearful, ſo good humoured and benevolent, equally free from the harſhneſs of rebuke and the weakneſs of indulgence, that I thought myſelf under the conduct of an angel ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than a man. I could perceive that his beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour had in it nothing of booriſh rudeneſs, and that he was thoroughly imbued with the principles of affectionate civility.</p>
                     <p>We walked about three quarters of a mile, and that not towards the open, but the moſt uncouth and unfrequented part of the foreſt. We croſſed a place which had once been a moat, but which was now in ſome parts dry and in others contained a little muddy and ſtagnated water. Within the incloſure of this moat, and among the ſtill viſible foundations of a larger, ancient building, was a cottage, or rather two or three cottages irregularly thrown together, not different from the habitations of the peaſantry in general, except that they were conſtructed for the moſt part of materials ſupplied from this ancient ruin.</p>
                     <p>My conductor knocked at the door, and was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by a voice from within, which for body and force might have been the voice of a man, but
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:028752_0306_0FDBF25F925E1660"/>
which had a ſort of female ſharpneſs and acidity, with the enquiry, Who is there? Satisfaction was no ſooner given in this point, than I heard two bolts puſhed back and the door unlocked. The apartment opened, and we entered. The interior of the building by no means correſponded with the appearance of my protector, but on the contrary wore a face of diſcomfort, careleſſneſs and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>. The only perſon I ſaw within was a woman, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther advanced in life, and whoſe appearance had I know not what of extraordinary and loathſome. Her eyes were red and blood-ſhot; her hair was pendent in matted and ſhaggy treſſes about her ſhoulders; her complexion ſwarthy, and of the conſiſtency of parchment; her form ſpare, and her whole body, her arms in particular, uncommonly vigorous and muſcular. Not the milk of human kindneſs, but the feverous blood of ſavage ferocity ſeemed to flow from her heart; and her whole figure ſuggeſted an idea of unmitigable energy and an appetite gorged in malevolence. This infernal Thaleſtris had no ſooner caſt her eyes upon us as we entered, than ſhe exclaimed in a diſcordant and diſcontented voice, What have we got here? this is not one of our people! My conductor, without anſwering this apoſtrophe, bid her puſh an eaſy chair which ſtood in one corner, and ſet it directly before the fire. This ſhe did with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent reluctance, muttering, Ah, you are at your old tricks; I wonder what ſuch folks as we have to do with charity! It will be the ruin of us at laſt, I can ſee that! Hold your tongue, beldam! ſaid he, with a ſtern ſignificance of manner, and fetch one of my beſt ſhirts, a waiſtcoat and ſome dreſſings. Saying this, he at the ſame time put into her hand a ſmall bunch of keys. In a word, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e treated me with as much kindneſs as if he had
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:028752_0307_0FDBF2AC2E6FD528"/>
been my father. He examined my wound, waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and dreſſed it; at the ſame time that the old woman by his expreſs order prepared for me ſuch nouriſhment as he thought moſt ſuitable to my weak and languid condition.</p>
                     <p>Theſe operations were no ſooner completed, than my benefactor recommended to me to retire to reſt, and preparations were making for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, when ſuddenly a trampling of feet was heard, ſucceeded by a knock at the door. The old woman opened the door with the ſame precautions as had been employed upon our arrival, and immediately ſix or ſeven perſons tumultuouſly entered the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Their appearance was different, ſome hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the air of mere ruſtics, and others that of a tarniſhed ſort of gentry. All had a feature of boldneſs, inquietude and diſorder, extremely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like any thing I had before obſerved in ſuch a groupe. But my aſtoniſhment was ſtill increaſed, when upon a ſecond glance I perceived ſomething in the general air of ſeveral of them, and of one in particular, that perſuaded me they were the gang from which I had juſt eſcaped, and this one the antagoniſt by whoſe animoſity I was ſo near to the having been finally deſtroyed. I inſtantly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined they had entered our hovel with a hoſtile intention, that my benefactor was upon the point of being robbed, and I probably murdered.</p>
                     <p>This ſuſpicion however was ſoon removed. They addreſſed my conductor with reſpect under the appellation of captain. They were boiſterous and noiſy in their remarks and exclamations, but their turbulence was tempered by a certain defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to his opinion and authority. I could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in the perſon who had been my active oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ſome aukwardneſs and irreſolution as he firſt perceived me, which he diſmiſſed with a ſort of
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:028752_0308_0FDBF2610F929E38"/>
effort, exclaiming, Who the devil is here? There was ſomething in the tone of this apoſtrophe that rouſed the attention of my protector. He looked at the ſpeaker with a fixed and penetrating glance, and then ſaid, Nay, Jones, do you know? Did you ever ſee the perſon before? Curſe it, Jones! interrupted a third, you are damnably out of luck. They ſay dead men walk, and you ſee there is ſome truth in it. Truce with your impertinence, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton! replied my protector, this is no proper occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for a joke. Anſwer me, Jones, were you the cauſe of this young man being left naked and wounded this bitter morning upon the foreſt?</p>
                     <p>Mayhap I was. What then?</p>
                     <p>What provocation could induce you to ſo cruel a treatment?</p>
                     <p>Provocation enough. He had no money.</p>
                     <p>What, did you uſe him thus without ſo much as being irritated by any reſiſtance on his part?</p>
                     <p>Yes, he did reſiſt. I only huſtled him, and he had the impudence to ſtrike me.</p>
                     <p>Jones! you are an incorrigible fellow.</p>
                     <p>Pooh, what ſignifies what I am? You with your compaſſion and your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ine feelings will bring us all to the gallows.</p>
                     <p>I have nothing to ſay to you; I have no hopes of you! Comrades, it is for you to decide upon the conduct of this man as you think proper. You know how repeated his offences have been; you know what pains I have taken to mend him. Our profeſſion is the profeſſion of juſtice. [It is thus that the prejudices of men univerſally teach them to colour the moſt deſperate cauſe, to which they have determined to adhere.] We undertake to counteract the partiality and iniquity of public in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions. We, who are thieves without a licence, are at open war with another ſet of men, who are
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:028752_0309_0FDBF2AD90927E20"/>
thieves according to law. If any one diſapprove our proceedings, at leaſt we have this to ſay for ourſelves, we act not by choice, but only as our wiſe governors force us to act. If any one diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove our proceedings, they have this apology in their favour, we riſk our lives when we adopt them, and ſtake our all upon their goodneſs and cogency. Time will one day decide whether we or our op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors be the genuine patriots: for the preſent we are cenſured, only becauſe they are the ſtronger party. With ſuch a cauſe then to bear us out, ſhall we ſtain it with cruelty, malice and revenge? For my own part I glory in the name of a thief; and am firmly perſuaded there is not a more gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant and honourable profeſſion upon the face of the earth, ſo long as it is exerciſed with a generous heart.—A thief is of courſe a man living among his equals; I do not pretend therefore to aſſume any authority among you; act as you think pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; but ſo far as relates to myſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I vote that Jones be expelled from among us as a diſgrace to our ſociety.</p>
                     <p>This propoſition ſeemed to meet the general ſenſe. It was eaſy to perceive that the opinion of the reſt coincided with that of their leader; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding which a few of them heſitated as to the conduct to be purſued. In the mean time Jones muttered ſomething in a ſurly and irreſolute way about taking care how they provoked him. This inſinuation inſtantly rouſed the courage of my protector, and his eyes flaſhed with contempt.</p>
                     <p>Raſcal! ſaid he, do you menace us? Do you think we will be your ſlaves? No, no, do your worſt! Go to the next juſtice of the peace and impeach us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I can eaſily believe you are capable of it. Sir, when we entered into this gang, we were not ſuch fools as not to know
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:028752_0310_0FDBF2660922A750"/>
that we entered upon a ſervice of danger. One of its dangers conſiſts in the treachery of fellows like you. But we did not enter at firſt, to flinch now. Did you believe that we would live in hourly fear of you, tremble at your threats, and compromiſe, whenever you ſhould ſo pleaſe, with your inſolence? That would be a bleſſed life in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed! I would rather ſee my fleſh torn piecemeal from my bones! Go, ſir! I defy you! You dare not do it! You dare not ſacrifice all theſe gallant fellows to your rage, and publiſh yourſelf to all the world a traitor and a ſcoundrel! If you do, you will puniſh yourſelf, not us! Begone!</p>
                     <p>The intrepidity of the leader communicated it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the reſt of the company. Jones eaſily ſaw that there was no hope of bringing them over to a contrary ſentiment. After a ſhort pauſe, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, I did not mean—No, damn it! I will not ſnivel neither. I was always true to my princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and a friend to you all. But, ſince you are reſolved to turn me out, why—good bye to you!</p>
                     <p>The expulſion of this man produced a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able improvement in the whole gang. Thoſe who were before inclined to humanity, aſſumed new energy in proportion as they ſaw ſuch ſentiments likely to prevail. They had before ſuffered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be overborne by the boiſterous inſolence of their antagoniſts; but now they adopted and with ſucceſs a different conduct. Thoſe who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied the aſcendancy of their comrade, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore imitated his conduct, began to heſitate in their career. Stories were brought forward of the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty and brutality of Jones, both to men and animals, which had never before reached the ear of the leader. Theſe ſtories I ſhall not repeat. They could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite only emotions of abhorrence and diſguſt, and
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:028752_0311_0FDBF2B355675EC0"/>
ſome of them argued a mind of ſuch a ſtretch of depravity as to many readers would appear utterly incredible. And yet this man had his virtues. He was enterpriſing, perſevering and faithful.</p>
                     <p>His removal was a conſiderable benefit to me. It would have been no ſmall hardſhip to have been turned adrift immediately under my unfavourable circumſtances, with the additional diſadvantage of the wound I had received; and yet I could ſcarcely have ventured to remain under the ſame roof with a man to whom my appearance was as a guilty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, perpetually reminding him of his own offence and the counteraction of his leader. His profeſſion accuſtomed him to a certain degree of indifference to conſequences, and indulgence to the ſallies of paſſion; and he might eaſily have found his opportunity to inſult or injure me, when I ſhould have had nothing but my own debilitated exertions to protect me.</p>
                     <p>Freed from this danger, I found my ſituation ſufficiently fortunate for a man under my circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. It was attended with all the advantages for concealment my fondeſt imagination could have hoped; and it was by no means deſtitute of the benefits which ariſe from kindneſs and humanity. Nothing could be more unlike than the thieves I had ſeen in—gaol, and the thieves of my new reſidence. The latter were generally full of chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and merriment. They could expatiate freely wherever they thought proper. They could form plans and execute them. They conſulted their own inclinations. They did not impoſe upon themſelves the taſk, as is too often the caſe in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſociety, of ſeeming tacitly to approve that from which they ſuffered moſt; or, which is worſe, of perſuading themſelves that all the wrongs they ſuffered were right; but were at open war
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:028752_0312_0FDBF267196BB0C0"/>
with their oppreſſors. On the contrary the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned felons I had lately ſeen were ſhut up like wild beaſts in a cage, deprived of activity, and palſied with indolence. The occaſional demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that ſtill remained of their former enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing life, were the ſtarts and convulſions of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, not the meditated and conſiſtent exertions of a mind in health. They had no more of hope, of project, of golden and animated dreams, but were reſerved to the moſt diſmal proſpects, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to think upon any other topic. It is true that theſe two ſcenes were parts of one whole, the one the conſummation, the hourly to be expected ſucceſſor of the other. But the men I now ſaw were wholly inattentive to this, and in that reſpect appeared to have no intercourſe with reflection or reaſon.</p>
                     <p>I might in one view, as I have ſaid, congratulate myſelf upon my preſent reſidence; it anſwered completely the purpoſes of concealment. It was the ſeat of merriment and hilarity; but the hila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity that characteriſed it, produced no correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent feelings in my boſom. The perſons who compoſed this ſociety, had each of them caſt off all controul from eſtabliſhed principle; their trade was terror, and their conſtant object to elude the vigilance of the community. The influence of theſe circumſtances was viſible in their character. I found among them benevolence and kindneſs; they were ſtrongly ſuſceptible of emotions of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity. But, as their ſituation was precarious, their diſpoſitions were proportionably fluctuating. Inured to the animoſity of their ſpecies, they were irritable and paſſionate. Accuſtomed to exerciſe harſhneſs towards the ſubject of their depredations, they did not always confine their brutality within that ſcope. They were habituated to conſider
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:028752_0313_0FDBF2B450BFD398"/>
wounds, and bludgeons and ſtabbing, as the obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mode of ſurmounting every difficulty. Unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in the debilitating routine of human affairs, they frequently diſplayed an energy, which from every impartial obſerver would have extorted vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Energy is perhaps of all qualities the moſt invaluable; and a juſt political ſyſtem would poſſeſs the means of extracting from it thus circumſtanced its beneficial qualities, inſtead of conſigning it as now to unlimited deſtruction. We act like the chymiſt who ſhould reject the fineſt ore, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy none but what was ſufficiently debaſed to fit it immediately for the vileſt uſes. But the energy of theſe men, ſuch as I beheld it, was in the higheſt degree miſapplied, unaſſiſted by any liberal and enlightened views, and directed only to the moſt narrow and contemptible purpoſes.</p>
                     <p>The reſidence I have been deſcribing might to many perſons have appeared attended with into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable inconveniences. But, excluſively of its advantages as a field for ſpeculation, it was Elyſium compared with that from which I had juſt eſcaped. Diſpleaſing company, incommodious apartments, filthineſs and riot, loſt the circumſtance by which they could moſt effectually diſguſt, when I was not compelled to remain with them. All hardſhips I could patiently endure, in compariſon with the menace of a violent and untimely death. There was no ſuffering that I could not perſuade myſelf to conſider as trivial, except that which flowed from the tyranny, the frigid precaution, or the inhuman revenge of my own ſpecies.</p>
                     <p>My recovery advanced in the moſt favourable manner. The attention and kindneſs of my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector were inceſſant, and the reſt caught the ſpirit from his example. The old woman who ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the houſhold, ſtill retained her animoſity.
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:028752_0314_0FDBF26D1673C998"/>
She conſidered me as the cauſe of the expulſion of Jones from the fraternity; Jones had been the object of her particular partiality; and, zealous as ſhe was for the public concern, ſhe thought an old and experienced ſinner for a raw probationer but an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ill exchange. Add to which, that her habits inclined her to moroſeneſs and diſcontent, and that perſons of her complexion ſeem unable to exiſt without ſome object upon which to employ the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity of their gall. She loſt no opportunity upon the moſt trifling occaſion of diſplaying her animoſity, and ever and anon eyed me with a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious glance of canine hunger for my deſtruction. Nothing was more evidently mortifying to her than the procraſtination of her malice; nor could ſhe bear to think that a fierceneſs ſo gigantic and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controulable ſhould ſhow itſelf in nothing more terrific than the pigmy ſpite of a chamber-maid. For myſelf, I had been accuſtomed to the warfare of formidable adverſaries and the encounter of alarming dangers; and what I ſaw of her ſpleen had not power ſufficient to diſturb my tranquillity.</p>
                     <p>As I recovered, I told my ſtory, except ſo far as related to the detection of Mr. Falkland's eventful ſecret, to my protector. That particular I could not as yet prevail upon myſelf to diſcloſe even in a ſituation like this, which ſeemed to preclude the poſſibility of its being made uſe of to the diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of my perſecutor. My preſent auditor however, whoſe habits of thinking were extremely oppoſite to thoſe of Mr. Foreſter, did not from the obſcurity which flowed from this reſerve, deduce any unfavourable concluſion. His penetration was ſuch as to afford little room for an impoſtor to hope to miſlead him by a fictitious ſtatement, and he confided in that penetration. So confiding, the ſimplicity and integrity of my manner carried con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:028752_0315_0FDBF2BA1150DC80"/>
to his mind, and inſured his good opinion and friendſhip.</p>
                     <p>He liſtened to my ſtory with eagerneſs, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented on the ſeveral parts as I related them. He ſaid that this was only one freſh inſtance of the tyranny and perfidiouſneſs exerciſed by the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful members of the community againſt thoſe who were leſs privileged than themſelves. Nothing could be more clear than their readineſs to ſacrifice the human ſpecies at large to their meaneſt intereſt or wildeſt caprice. Who that ſaw the ſituation in its true light would wait till their oppreſſors thought ſit to decree their deſtruction, and not take arms in their defence while it was yet in their power? Which was moſt meritorious, the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting and daſtardly ſubmiſſion of a ſlave, or the enterpriſe and gallantry of the man who dared to aſſert his claims? Since by the partial adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our laws innocence, when power was armed againſt it, had nothing better to hope for than guilt, what man of true courage would fail to ſet theſe laws at defiance, and, if he muſt ſuffer by their injuſtice, at leaſt take care that he had firſt ſhown his contempt of their yoke? For him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf he ſhould certainly never have embraced his preſent calling, had he not been ſtimulated to it by theſe cogent and irreſiſtible reaſons; and he hoped, as experience had ſo forcibly brought a conviction of this ſort to my mind, that he ſhould for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture have the happineſs to aſſociate me to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits.—It will preſently be ſeen how far theſe hopes were confirmed by the event.</p>
                     <p>Numerous were the precautions exerciſed by the gang of thieves with whom I now reſided to elude the vigilance of the ſatellites of juſtice. It was one of their rules to commit no depredations but at a conſiderable diſtance from the place of their
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:028752_0316_0FDBF26E8FBF6328"/>
reſidence, and Jones had tranſgreſſed this regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the attack to which I was indebted for my preſent aſylum. After having poſſeſſed themſelves of any booty, they took care in the ſight of the perſons whom they had robbed to purſue a route as nearly as poſſible oppoſite to that which led to their true haunts. The appearance of their place of reſidence, together with its environs was pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly deſolate and forlorn, and it had the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of being haunted. The old woman I have deſcribed had long been its inhabitant, and was commonly ſuppoſed to be its only inhabitant; and her perſon well accorded with the rural ideas of a witch. Her lodgers never went out or came in but with the utmoſt circumſpection, and generally by night. The lights which were occaſionally ſeen from various parts of her habitation were by the country people regarded with horror as ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural; and, if the noiſe of revelry at any time ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted their ears, it was imagined to proceed from a carnival of devils. With all theſe advantages the thieves did not venture to reſide here but by intervals: ſometimes they abſented themſelves for months, and reſided in a different part of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. The old woman ſometimes attended them in theſe tranſportations, and ſometimes remained; but in all caſes her removal took place either ſooner or later than theirs, ſo that the niceſt obſerver could ſcarcely have traced any connection between her re-appearances and the alarms of depredation that were frequently given; and the feſtival of demons ſeemed to the terrified ruſtics indifferently to take place whether ſhe were preſent or abſent.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. VIII.</head>
                     <p>ONE day, while I continued in this ſituation, a circumſtance occurred, which involuntarily at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted my attention. Two of our people had been ſent to a town at ſome diſtance for the purpoſe of procuring us ſome things of which we were in want. After having delivered theſe to our land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady, they retired to one corner of the room, and, one of them pulling a printed paper from his pocket, they mutually occupied themſelves in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining its contents. I was ſitting in an eaſy chair by the fire, being conſiderably better than I had been, though ſtill in a weak and languid ſtate. Having read for a conſiderable time, they looked at me, and then at the paper, and then at me again. They then went out of the room together, as if to conſult without interruption upon ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which that paper ſuggeſted to them. Some time after they returned, and my protector, who happened to be above ſtairs, entered the room at the ſame inſtant.</p>
                     <p>Captain! ſaid one of them with an air of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, look here! we have found a prize! I believe it is as good as a bank note of a hundred guineas.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Raymond (that was his name) took the paper and read. He pauſed for a moment. He then cruſhed the paper in his hand; and, turning to the perſon from whom he had received it, ſaid with the tone of a man confident in the ſucceſs of his reaſons,</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="90" facs="unknown:028752_0318_0FDBF273020A2FB0"/>
What uſe have you for theſe hundred guineas? Are you in want? Are you in diſtreſs? Can you be contented to purchaſe them at the price of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery? of violating the laws of hoſpitality?</p>
                     <p>Faith, captain, I do not very well know. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having violated other laws, I do not ſee why we ſhould be frightened at an old ſaw. We pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to judge for ourſelves, and ought to be above ſhrinking from a bugbear of a proverb. Beſide, this is a good deed, and I ſhould think no more harm of being the ruin of ſuch a thief, than of getting my dinner.</p>
                     <p>A thief! You talk of thieves!—</p>
                     <p>Not ſo faſt, if you pleaſe. God defend that I ſhould ſay a word againſt thieving as a general occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation! But one man ſteals in one way, and another in another. For my part, I go upon the highway, and take from any ſtranger I meet what it is a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to one he can very well ſpare. I ſee nothing to be found fault with in that. But I have as much conſcience as another man. Becauſe I laugh at aſſizes and great wigs and the gallows, and becauſe I will not be frightened from an innocent action when the lawyers ſay me nay, does it follow that I am to have a fellow-feeling for pilferers, and raſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally ſervants, and people that have neither juſtice nor principle? No: I have too much reſpect for the trade, not to be a foe to interlopers and people that ſo much the more deſerve my hatred becauſe the world calls them by my name.</p>
                     <p>You are wrong, Wilſon! You certainly ought not to employ againſt people that you hate, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing your hatred to be reaſonable, the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentality of that law which in your practice you defy. Be conſiſtent. Either be the friend of law, or its adverſary. Depend upon it that, wherever there are laws at all, there will be laws againſt
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:028752_0319_0FDBF2C0ABABC388"/>
ſuch people as you and I. Either therefore we all of us deſerve the vengeance of the law, or law is not the proper inſtrument of correcting the miſdeeds of mankind. I tell you this, becauſe I would fain have you aware that an informer or a king's evidence, a man who takes advantage of the confidence of another in order to betray him, who ſells the life of his neighbour for money, or coward like, upon any pretence calls in the law to do that for him which he cannot or dares not do for himſelf, is the vileſt of raſcals. But in the preſent caſe, if your reaſons were the beſt in the world, they do not apply.</p>
                     <p>While Mr. Raymond was ſpeaking, the reſt of the gang came into the room. He immediately turned to them and ſaid,</p>
                     <p>My friends, here is a piece of intelligence that Wilſon has juſt brought in, which with his leave I will lay before you.</p>
                     <p>Then, pulling the paper from his pocket, he continued: This is the deſcription of a felon with the offer of a hundred guineas for his apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Wilſon picked it up at—. By the time and other circumſtances, but particularly by the minute deſcription of his perſon, there can be no doubt out the object of it is our young friend, whoſe life <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

He is charged here with having taken advantage of the confidence of his patron and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor, to rob him of property to a large amount. Upon this charge he was committed to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> friends, I was acquainted with the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of this ſtory ſome time before. This lad let
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:028752_0320_0FDBF273D61A62E0"/>
me into his hiſtory at a time that he could not poſſibly have foreſeen that he ſhould ſtand in need of that precaution as an antidote againſt danger. He is not guilty of what is laid to his charge. Which of you is ſo ignorant as to ſuppoſe that his eſcape is any confirmation of his guilt? Who ever thinks, when he is apprehended for trial, of his innocence or guilt as being at all material to the iſſue? Who ever was fool enough to volunteer a trial, where thoſe who are to decide think more of the horror of the thing of which he is accuſed than whether he was the perſon that did it; and where the nature of our motives is to be collected from a ſet of ignorant witneſſes that no wiſe man would truſt for a fair repreſentation of the moſt indifferent action of his life?</p>
                     <p>The poor lad's ſtory is a long one, and I will not trouble you with it now. But from that ſtory it is as clear as the day, that, becauſe he wiſhed to leave the ſervice of his maſter, becauſe he had been perhaps a little too inquiſitive in his maſter's concerns, and becauſe, as I ſuſpect, he had been truſted with ſome important ſecrets, his maſter conceived an antipathy againſt him. This antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy gradually proceeded to ſuch a length, as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the maſter to forge this vile accuſation. He ſeems willing to hang the lad out of the way, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than ſuffer him to go where he pleaſes or get beyond the reach of his power. Williams has told me the ſtory with ſuch ingenuouſneſs that I am as ſure that he is guiltleſs of what they lay to his charge as that I am ſo myſelf. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the man's ſervants who were called in to hear the accuſation, and his relation, who as juſtice of the peace made out the mittimus, and who had the folly to think he could be impartial, gave it on his ſide with one voice, and thus afforded
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:028752_0321_0FDBF29205CA0288"/>
Williams a ſample of what he had to expect in the ſequel.</p>
                     <p>Wilſon, who when he received this paper had no previous knowledge of particulars, was for tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing advantage of it for the purpoſe of earning the hundred guineas. Are you of that mind, now you have heard them? Will you for ſo paltry a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration deliver up the lamb into the jaws of the wolf? Will you abet the purpoſes of this ſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary raſcal who, not contented with driving his late dependent from houſe and home, depriving him of character and all the ordinary means of ſubſiſtence, and leaving him almoſt without a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, ſtill thirſts for his blood? If no other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon have the courage to ſet limits to the tyranny of courts of juſtice, ſhall not we? Shall we, who earn our livelihood by generous daring, be indebted for a penny to the vile artifices of the informer? Shall we, againſt whom the whole ſpecies is in arms, refuſe our protection to an individual, more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to, but ſtill leſs deſerving of their perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than ourſelves?</p>
                     <p>The repreſentation of the captain produced an inſtant effect upon the whole company. They all exclaimed, Betray him! No, not for worlds! He is ſafe. We will protect him at the hazard of our lives. If fidelity and honour be baniſhed from thieves, where ſhall they find refuge upon the face of the earth? Wilſon in particular thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the captain for his interference, and ſwore that he would rather part with his right hand, than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure ſo worthy a lad, or aſſiſt ſuch an unheard of villainy. Saying this, he took me by the hand, and bade me fear nothing. Under their roof, no harm ſhould ever befal me; and, even if the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtrappers of the law ſhould diſcover my retreat, they would to a man die in my defence, ſooner
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:028752_0322_0FDBF275912C7430"/>
than a hair of my head ſhould be hurt. I thanked him moſt ſincerely for his good will; but I was principally ſtruck with the fervent benevolence of my benefactor. I told them, I found that my ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies were inexorable, and would never be appeaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but with my blood; and I aſſured them with the moſt ſolemn and earneſt veracity, that I had done nothing to deſerve the perſecution which was exerciſed againſt me.</p>
                     <p>The ſpirit and energy of Mr. Raymond had been ſuch, as to leave no part for me to perform in repelling this unlooked-for danger. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, it left a very ſerious impreſſion upon my mind. I had always placed ſome confidence in the returning equity of Mr. Falkland. Though he perſecuted me with bitterneſs, I could not help believing that he did it unwillingly, and I was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded it would not be for ever. A man, whoſe original principles had been ſo full of rectitude and honour, could not fail at ſome time or other to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect the injuſtice of his conduct, and to remit his aſperity. This idea had been always preſent to me, and had in no ſmall degree conſpired to inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate my exertions. I ſaid, I will convince my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor that I am of more value than that I ſhould be ſacrificed purely by way of precaution. Theſe expectations on my part had been encouraged by Mr. Falkland's behaviour upon the queſtion of my impriſonment and by various particulars which had occurred ſince.</p>
                     <p>But this new incident gave to the ſubject a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally different appearance. I ſaw him now, not contented with blaſting my reputation, confining me for a period in jail, and reducing me to the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation of a houſeleſs vagabond, but ſtill continuing his purſuit under theſe forlorn circumſtances with unmitigable cruelty. Indignation and reſentment
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:028752_0323_0FDBF2C7CFB42058"/>
ſeemed now for the firſt time to penetrate my mind. I knew his miſery ſo well, I was ſo fully acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with its cauſe, and ſo ſtrongly impreſſed with the idea of its being unmerited, that, while I ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſo deeply, I ſtill continued to pity, rather than hate my perſecutor. But this incident intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced ſome change into my feelings. I ſaid, Surely he might now believe that he had ſufficiently diſarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, and might at length ſuffer me to be at peace. At leaſt ought he not to be contented to leave me to my fate, the perilous and uncertain condition of an eſcaped felon, inſtead of thus whetting the animoſity and vigilance of my countrymen againſt me? Were his interference on my behalf in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the ſtern ſeverity of Mr. Foreſter, and his various acts of kindneſs ſince, a mere part that he played in order to lull me into patience? Was he perpetually haunted with the fear of an ample re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliation, and for that purpoſe did he perſonate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe at the very moment that he was ſecretly keeping every engine at play that could ſecure my deſtruction? The very ſuſpicion of ſuch a fact filled me with inexpreſſible horror, and ſtruck a ſudden chill through every fibre of my frame.</p>
                     <p>Meanwhile my wound was by this time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely healed, and it became abſolutely neceſſary that I ſhould form ſome determination reſpecting the future. My habits of thinking were ſuch as gave me an uncontroulable repugnance to the vocation of my hoſts. I did not indeed feel all that averſion and abhorrence to the men that is commonly entertained. I ſaw and reſpected their good qualities and their virtues. I was by no means inclined to believe them worſe men, or more inimical in their diſpoſitions to the welfare of their ſpecies, than the generality of thoſe that look down upon them with moſt cenſure. But, though I did
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:028752_0324_0FDBF279DC877398"/>
not ceaſe to love them as individuals, my eyes were perfectly opened to their miſtakes. If I ſhould otherwiſe have been in danger of being miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, it was my fortune to have ſtudied felons in a jail, before I ſtudied them in their ſtate of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative proſperity; and this was an infallible an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote to the poiſon. I ſaw that in this profeſſion were exerted uncommon energy, ingenuity and fortitude, and I could not help recollecting how admirably beneficial ſuch qualities might be made in the great theatre of human affairs; while in their preſent direction they were thrown away upon purpoſes that could ſcarcely in any ſenſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the appellation of uſeful. Thieves appeared to me to commit a miſtaken treaſon againſt the general welfare; at the ſame time that they were of all men the moſt fooliſh as to their own intereſts. The man who riſks or ſacrifices his life for the public welfare is rewarded with the teſtimony of an approving conſcience; but perſons who wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonly defy the inſtitutions of their country for no public good, and whoſe private intereſt the leaſt degree of ſound judgment might prove to be a thouſand times better promoted in every poſſible inſtance by a more legitimate proceeding, are in the ſame reſpect abſurd and ſelf-neglectful, as a man would be who ſhould ſet himſelf up as a mark for a file of muſqueteers to ſhoot at.</p>
                     <p>Viewing the ſubject in this light, I not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined that I would have no ſhare in their occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation myſelf, but thought I could not do leſs in return for the benefits I had received from them, than endeavour to diſſuade them from an employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in which they muſt themſelves be the greate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> ſufferers. My expoſtulation met with a various reception. All the perſons to whom it was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed had been tolerably ſucceſsful in perſuading
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:028752_0325_0FDBF2C9567D04E0"/>
themſelves of the innocence of their calling; and what remained of doubt in their mind was ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, and, ſo to ſpeak, laboriouſly forgotten. Some of them laughed at my arguments as a ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous piece of miſſionary quixotiſm. Others, and particularly our captain, repelled them with the boldneſs of a man that knows he has got the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſide. But this ſentiment of eaſe and ſelf ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction did not long remain. They had been uſed to arguments derived from religion and the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rableneſs of law. They had long ago ſhaken theſe from them as ſo many prejudices. But my view of the ſubject appealed to principles which they could not conteſt, and had by no means the air of that cuſtomary reproof which is for ever dinned in our ears, without finding one reſponſive chord in our hearts. Finding themſelves urged with objections unexpected and cogent, ſome of thoſe to whom I addreſſed them began to grow peeviſh and impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of the importunate remonſtrance. But this was by no means the caſe with Mr. Raymond. He was poſſeſſed of a candour that I have ſeldom ſeen equalled. He was ſurpriſed to hear objections ſo powerful to that which as a matter of ſpeculation he believed he had examined on all ſides. He revolved them with impartiality and care. He admitted them ſlowly, but he at length fully admitted them. He had now but one rejoinder in reſerve.</p>
                     <p>Alas, Williams, ſaid he, it would have been fortunate for me if theſe views had been preſented to me previouſly to my embracing my preſent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. It is now too late. Thoſe very laws, which by a perception of their iniquity drove me to what I am, now preclude my return. God, we are told, judges of men by what they are at the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of judgment, and, whatever be their crimes, if they have ſeen and abjured the folly of thoſe crimes, receives them to favour. But the inſtitutions of
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:028752_0326_0FDBF27CD4D023E8"/>
countries that profeſs to worſhip this God, admit no ſuch diſtinctions. They leave no room for amendment, and ſeem to have a brutal delight in confounding the demerits of offenders. It ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies not what is the character of the individual at the hour of trial. How changed, how ſpotleſs, and how uſeful avails him nothing. If they diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver at the diſtance of fourteen<note n="*" place="bottom">Eugene Aram.

                     <p>I WAS extremely affected by this plea. I could only anſwer that Mr. Raymond muſt himſelf be the beſt judge of the courſe it became him to hold; I truſted the caſe was not ſo deſperate as he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined. This ſubject was purſued no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

                        </gap>, and was in ſome degree driven from my thoughts by an incident of a very extraordinary nature. I have already mentioned the animoſity that was enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained againſt me by the infernal portreſs of this ſolitary manſion. Jones, the expelled member of the gang, had been her particular favourite. She ſubmitted to his exile indeed, becauſe her genius felt ſubdued by the energy and inherent greatneſs of Mr. Raymond; but ſhe ſubmitted with mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring and diſcontent. Not daring to reſent the conduct of the principal in this affair, ſhe collected all the bitterneſs of her ſpirit againſt me. To the unpardonable offence I had thus committed in the firſt inſtance, were added the reaſonings I had lately offered againſt the profeſſion of robbery. Robbery was a fundamental article in the creed of this hoary veteran, and ſhe liſtened to my objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with the ſame unaffected aſtoniſhment and horror, that an old woman of other habits would liſten to one who objected to the agonies and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the Creator of the world, or to the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of imputed righteouſneſs prepared to envelope the ſouls of the elect. Like the religious <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>, ſhe was ſufficiently diſpoſed to avenge a hoſtility againſt her opinions with the weapons of ſublunary
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:028752_0328_0FDBD8DBDD3BC7A8"/>
warfare. Meanwhile I had ſmiled at the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of her malice, as an object of contempt, rather than alarm. She perceived, as I imagine, the ſlight eſtimation in which I held her, and this did not a little increaſe the perturbation of her thoughts.</p>
                     <p>One day I was left alone with no other perſon in the houſe than this ſwarthy ſybil. The thieves had ſet out upon an expedition about two hours after ſunſet on the preceding evening, and had not returned, as they were accuſtomed to do, before day-break the next morning. This was a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that ſometimes occurred, and therefore did not produce any extraordinary alarm. At one time the ſcent of prey would lead them beyond the bounds they had preſcribed themſelves, and at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other the fear of purſuit; the life of a thief is always uncertain. The old woman had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring during the night for the meal to which they would expect to ſit down, as ſoon as might be after their return.</p>
                     <p>For myſelf I had learned from their habits to be indifferent to the regular return of the different parts of the day, and in ſome degree to turn day into night, and night into day. I had been now ſeveral weeks in this reſidence, and the ſeaſon was conſiderably advanced. I had paſſed ſome hours during the night in ruminating on my ſituation. The character and manners of the men among whom I lived were diſguſting to me. Their brutal ignorance, their ferocious habits, and their coarſe behaviour, inſtead of becoming more tolerable by cuſtom, hourly added force to my original aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The uncommon vigour of their minds and acuteneſs of their invention in the buſineſs they purſued, compared with the odiouſneſs of that buſineſs and their habitual depravity, awakened in me ſenſations too painful to be endured. Moral

diſapprobation, at leaſt in a mind unſubdued by philoſophy, I found to be one of the moſt fertile ſources of diſquiet and uneaſineſs. From this pain the ſociety of Mr. Raymond by no means relieved me. He was indeed eminently ſuperior to the vices of the reſt; but I did not leſs exquiſitely feel how much he was out of his place, how diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably aſſociated, or how contemptibly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed. I had attempted to counteract the errors under which he and his companions laboured; but I had found the obſtacles that preſented themſelves, much greater than I had imagined.</p>
                     <p>What was I to do? Was I to wait the iſſue of this my miſſionary undertaking, or was I to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw myſelf immediately? When I withdrew, ought that to be done privately, or with an open avowal of my deſign, and an endeavour to ſupply by the force of example what was deficient in my arguments? It was certainly improper, as I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined all participation in the purſuits of theſe men, did not contribute with my perſon to the riſk by which they ſubſiſted, and had no congeniality with their habits, that I ſhould continue to reſide with them any longer than was abſolutely neceſſary. There was one circumſtance that rendered this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation particularly preſſing. They intended in a few days removing from their preſent habitation, to a haunt to which they were accuſtomed in a diſtant county. If I did not propoſe to continue with them, it would perhaps be wrong to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany them in this removal. The ſtate of calamity to which my inexorable perſecutor had reduced me, had made the encounter even of a den of rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers a very fortunate adventure. But the time that had ſince elapſed, had probably been ſufficient to relax the keenneſs of the queſt that was made after me. I ſighed for that ſolitude and obſcurity, that
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:028752_0330_0FDBD8771E25E540"/>
retreat from the vexations of the world and the voice even of common fame, which I had propoſed to myſelf when I broke my priſon.</p>
                     <p>Such were the meditations which now occupied my mind. At length I grew fatigued with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued contemplation, and to relieve myſelf, I pulled out a pocket Horace, the legacy of my beloved Brightwel! I read with avidity the epiſtle in which he ſo beautifully deſcribes to Fuſcus the grammarian, the pleaſures of rural tranquillity and independence. By this time the ſun roſe from behind the eaſtern hills, and I open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my caſement to contemplate it. The day com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced with peculiar brilliancy, and was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with all thoſe charms, which the poets of nature, as they have been ſtyled, have ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted to deſcribe. There was ſomething in this ſcene, particularly as ſucceeding to the active ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions of intellect, that ſoothed the mind to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure. Inſenſibly a confuſed reverie invaded my faculties, I withdrew from the window, threw my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon the bed, and fell aſleep.</p>
                     <p>I do not recollect the preciſe images which in this ſituation paſſed through my thoughts, but I know that they concluded with the idea of ſome perſon, the agent of Mr. Falkland, approaching to aſſaſſinate me. This thought had probably been ſuggeſted, by the project I meditated of entering once again into the world, and throwing myſelf within the ſphere of his poſſible vengeance. I imagined that the deſign of the murderer was to come upon me by ſurpriſe, that I was aware of this deſign, and yet by ſome faſcination had no thought of evading it. I heard the ſteps of the murderer as he cautiouſly approached. I ſeemed to liſten to his conſtrained, yet audible breathings. He came up to the corner where I was placed, and
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:028752_0331_0FDBD94D6D93F800"/>
then ſtopped. The idea became too terrible, I ſtarted, opened my eyes, and beheld the execrable hag before mentioned ſtanding over me with a butcher's hatchet. I ſhifted my ſituation with a ſpeed that ſeemed too ſwift for volition, and the blow already aimed at my ſcull, ſunk impotent upon the bed. Before ſhe could wholly recover her poſture I ſprung upon her, ſeized hold of the weapon, and had nearly wreſted it from her. But in a moment ſhe reſumed her ſtrength and her deſperate pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and we had a furious ſtruggle, ſhe impelled by inveterate malice, and I reſiſting for my life. Her vigour was truly Amazonian, and at no time had I ever occaſion to contend with a more formid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able opponent. Her glance was ſudden and exact, and the ſhock with which from time to time ſhe impelled her whole frame, inconceivably vehement. At length I was victorious, took from her her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of death, and threw her upon the ground. Till now the ſobriety of her exertions had curbed her rage; but now ſhe gnaſhed with her teeth, her eyes ſeemed as if ſtarting from their ſockets, and her body heaved with uncontroulable inſanity.</p>
                     <p>Raſcal! devil! ſhe exclaimed, what do you mean to do to me?</p>
                     <p>Till now the ſcene had paſſed uninterrupted by a ſingle word.</p>
                     <p>Nothing, I replied: begone, infernal witch! and leave me to myſelf.</p>
                     <p>Leave you! No: I will thruſt my fingers through your ribs, and drink your blood!—You conquer me!—Ha, ha!—Yes, yes! you ſhall!—I will ſit upon you, and preſs you to hell! I will roaſt you with brimſtone, and daſh your entrails into your eyes!—Ha, ha!—ha!</p>
                     <p>Saying this, ſhe ſprung up, and prepared to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack me with redoubled fury. I ſeized her hands,
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:028752_0332_0FDBD87909D26398"/>
and compelled her to ſit upon the bed. Thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, ſhe continued to expreſs the tumult of her thoughts by grinning, by certain furious motions of her head, and by occaſional vehement efforts to diſengage herſelf from my graſp. Theſe contor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ſtarts were of the nature of thoſe fits, in which the patients are commonly ſuppoſed to need three or four perſons to hold them. But I found by experience that, under the circumſtances in which I was placed, my ſingle ſtrength was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient. The ſpectacle of her emotions was incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivably frightful. Her violence at length however began to abate, and ſhe became perſuaded of the hopeleſſneſs of the conteſt.</p>
                     <p>Let me go! ſaid ſhe. Why do you hold me? I will not be held!</p>
                     <p>I wanted you gone from the firſt, replied I. Are you contented to go now?</p>
                     <p>Yes, I tell you, miſbegotten villain! Yes, raſcal!</p>
                     <p>I immediately looſed my hold. She flew to the door, and, holding it in her hand, ſaid, I will be the death of you yet: you ſhall not be your own man twenty-four hours longer! With theſe words ſhe ſhut the door, and locked it upon me. An action ſo totally unexpected ſtartled me. Whither was ſhe gone? What was it ſhe intended? To periſh by the machinations of ſuch a hag as this, was a thought not to be endured. Death in any form, brought upon us by ſurpriſe, and for which the mind has had no time to prepare, is inexpreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly terrible. My thoughts wandered in breathleſs horror and confuſion, and all within was uproar. I endeavoured to break the door, but in vain. I went round the room in ſearch of ſome tool to aſſiſt me. At length I ruſhed againſt it with a deſperate effort, to which it yielded, and had nearly thrown me from the top of the ſtairs to the bottom.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="105" facs="unknown:028752_0333_0FDBD94F6E556788"/>
I deſcended with all poſſible caution and vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance. I entered the kitchen, but it was deſerted. I ſearched every other apartment in vain. I went out of the houſe; ſtill I diſcovered nothing of my late aſſailant. It was extraordinary: what could be become of her? what was I to conclude from her diſappearance? I reflected on her parting me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace. "I ſhould not be my own man twenty-four hours longer." It was myſterious; it did not ſeem to be the menace of aſſaſſination.</p>
                     <p>Suddenly the recollection of the hand bill brought to us by Wilſon ruſhed upon my memory. Was it poſſible that ſhe alluded to that in her parting words? Would ſhe ſet out upon ſuch an expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by herſelf? Was it not dangerous to the whole fraternity, if without the ſmalleſt precaution ſhe ſhould bring the officers of juſtice into the midſt of them? It was perhaps improbable ſhe would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in an undertaking thus deſperate. It was not however eaſy to anſwer for the conduct of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in her ſtate of mind. Should I wait, and riſk the preſervation of my liberty upon the iſſue?</p>
                     <p>To this queſtion I returned an immediate nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. I had reſolved in a very ſhort time to quit my preſent ſituation, and the difference of a little ſooner or a little later could not be very material. It promiſed to be neither agreeable nor prudent, for me to remain under the roof with a perſon who had manifeſted ſuch a fierce and inexpiable hoſtility. But the conſideration which had inexpreſſibly the moſt weight with me, belonged to the ideas of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, trial and death. The longer they had formed the ſubject of my contemplation, the more forcibly was I impelled to avoid them. I had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered upon a ſyſtem of action for that purpoſe; I had already made many ſacrifices; and I believed that I ſhould never miſcarry in this project through
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:028752_0334_0FDBD87F75BBAD20"/>
any neglect of mine. The thought of what was reſerved for me by my proſecutors ſickened my very ſoul; and the more intimately I was acquainted with oppreſſion and injuſtice, the more deeply was I penetrated with the abhorrence to which they are entitled.</p>
                     <p>Such were the reaſons that determined me, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, abruptly, without leave-taking or acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment for the peculiar and repeated favours I had received, to quit a habitation to which for ſix weeks I had apparently been indebted for protection, from trial, conviction and an ignominious death. I had come hither pennyleſs; I quitted my abode with the ſum of a few guineas in my poſſeſſion, Mr. Raymond having inſiſted upon my taking a ſhare, at the time that each man received his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidend from the common ſtock. Though I had reaſon to ſuppoſe that the heat of the purſuit againſt me would be ſomewhat remitted by the time that had elapſed, the magnitude of the miſchief that in an unſavourable event might fall on me, determined me to neglect no imaginable precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I recollected the hand bill which was the ſource of my preſent alarm, and conceived that one of the principal dangers that threatened me was the recognition of my perſon, either by ſuch as had previouſly known me, or even by ſtrangers. It ſeemed prudent therefore to diſguiſe it as effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally as I could. For this purpoſe I had recourſe to a parcel of tattered garments that lay in one corner of our habitation. The diſguiſe I choſe was that of a beggar. Upon this plan I threw off my ſhirt. I tied a handkerchief about my head, with which I took care to cover one of my eyes. Over this I drew a piece of an old woollen night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cap. I ſelected the worſt apparel I could find, and this I reduced to a ſtill more deplorable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:028752_0335_0FDBD950EAE06120"/>
by rents that I purpoſely made in various places. Thus equipped, I ſurveyed myſelf in a looking-glaſs. I had rendered my appearance com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete, nor would any one have ſuſpected that I was not one of the fraternity to which I aſſumed to belong. I ſaid, This is the form in which tyranny and injuſtice oblige me to ſeek for refuge; but bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, a thouſand times better is it, thus to incur contempt with the dregs of mankind, than to truſt to the tender mercies of our ſuperiors!</p>

                     <p>THE only rule that I laid down to myſelf in traverſing the foreſt was to take a direction as oppoſite as poſſible to that which led to the ſcene of my late impriſonment. After about two hours walking I arrived at the termination of this ruder ſcene, and reached that part of the county which is incloſed and cultivated. Here I ſat down by the ſide of a brook, and, pulling out a cruſt of bread which I had brought away with me, reſted and refreſhed myſelf. While I continued in this place, I began to ruminate upon the plan I ſhould lay down for my future proceedings; and my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity now led me, as it had done in a former in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, to fix upon the capital which I believed, beſide its other recommendations, would prove the ſafeſt place for concealment. During theſe thoughts I ſaw a couple of peaſants paſſing at a ſmall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and enquired of them reſpecting the Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don road. By their deſcription I underſtood that the moſt immediate way would be to repaſs a part of the foreſt, and that it would be neceſſary to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach conſiderably nearer to the county town than I was at the ſpot which I had at preſent reached. I did not imagine that this could be a circumſtance of conſiderable importance. My diſguiſe appeared to be a ſufficient ſecurity againſt momentary dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; and I therefore took a path, though not the moſt direct one, which led towards the point they ſuggeſted.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="109" facs="unknown:028752_0337_0FDBD95B411EE938"/>
The occurrences of the day were not very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable. As I paſſed along a road which lay in my way for a few miles, I ſaw a carriage advancing in the oppoſite direction. I debated with myſelf for a moment, whether I ſhould paſs it without notice, or ſhould take this occaſion by voice or geſture of making an eſſay of my trade. This idle diſquiſition was however ſpeedily driven from my mind when I perceived that the carriage was Mr. Falkland's. The ſuddenneſs of the encounter ſtruck me with terror, though perhaps it would have been difficult for calm reflection to have diſcovered any conſiderable danger. I withdrew from the road, and ſkulked behind a hedge till it ſhould have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely gone by. I was too much occupied with my own feelings to venture to examine whether or no the terrible adverſary of my peace were in the carriage. I perſuaded myſelf that he was. I look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after the equipage, and exclaimed, There you may ſee the luxurious accommodations and appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dages of guilt, and here the forlornneſs that waits upon innocence!—I was to blame to imagine that my caſe was ſingular in that reſpect. I only men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it to ſhow how the moſt trivial circumſtance contributes to embitter the cup to the man of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity. The thought however was a tranſient one. I had learned this leſſon from my ſufferings, not to indulge in the luxury of diſcontent. As my mind recovered its tranquillity, I began to enquire whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the phenomenon I had juſt ſeen could have any relation to myſelf. But though my mind was extremely inquiſitive and verſatile in this reſpect, I could diſcover no ſufficient ground upon which to build any judgment in the caſe.</p>
                     <p>At night I entered a little public houſe at the extremity of a village, and, ſeating myſelf in a corner of the kitchen, aſked for ſome bread and
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:028752_0338_0FDBD89662FB42E0"/>
cheeſe. While I was ſitting at my repaſt, three or four labourers came in for a little refreſhment after their work. Ideas reſpecting the inequality of rank pervade every order in ſociety; and, as my appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance was meaner and more contemptible than theirs, I found it expedient to give way to theſe gentry of a village alehouſe, and remove to an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurer ſtation. I was ſurpriſed and not a little ſtartled to find them fall almoſt immediately into converſation about my hiſtory, whom with a ſlight variation of circumſtances they ſtyled the notorious houſebreaker, Kit Williams.</p>
                     <p>Damn the fellow, ſaid one of them, one never hears of any thing elſe. O' my life, I think he makes talk for the whole county.</p>
                     <p>That is very true, replied another. I was at the market town to-day to ſell ſome oats for my maſter, and there was a hue and cry, ſome of them thought they had got him, but it was a falſe alarm.</p>
                     <p>That hundred guineas is a fine thing, rejoined the firſt. I ſhould be glad if ſo be as how it fell in my way.</p>
                     <p>For the matter of that, ſaid the traveller, I ſhould like a hundred guineas as well as another. But I cannot be of your mind for all that. I ſhould never think money would do me any good, that had been the means of bringing a Chriſtian creature to the gallows.</p>
                     <p>Poh, that is all my granny! Some folks muſt be hanged to keep the wheels of our ſtate folks a-going. Beſide, I could forgive the fellow all his other robberies, but that he ſhould have been ſo hardened as to break the houſe of his own maſter at laſt, that is too bad.</p>
                     <p>Lord, lord, replied the other, I ſee you know nothing of the matter! I will tell you how it was, as I learned it at the town. I queſtion whether he
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:028752_0339_0FDBD95DAB89FF00"/>
ever robbed his maſter at all. But hark you! you muſt know as how that ſquire Falkland was once tried for murder—</p>
                     <p>Yes, yes, we know that.</p>
                     <p>Well, he was as innocent as the child unborn. But I ſuppoſes as how he is a little ſoft or ſo. And ſo Kit Williams—Kit is a deviliſh cunning fellow, you may judge that from his breaking priſon no leſs than five times,—ſo, I ſay, he threatened to bring his maſter to trial at the 'ſizes all over again, and ſo frightened him, and got money from him at divers times. Till at laſt one ſquire Foreſter, a relation of t'other, found it all out. And he made the hell of a rumpus, and ſent away Kit to priſon in a twinky, and I believe he would have been hanged; for when two ſquires lay their heads to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, they do not much matter law, you know; or elſe they twiſt the law to their own ends, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not exactly ſay which; but it is much at one, when the poor fellow's breath is out of his body.</p>
                     <p>Though this ſtory was very circumſtantially told and with a ſufficient detail of particulars, it did not paſs unqueſtioned. Each man maintained the juſtneſs of his own ſtatement, and the diſpute was long and obſtinately purſued. Hiſtorians and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators at length withdrew together. The terrors with which I was ſeized when this converſation began, were extreme. I ſtole a ſide-long glance to one quarter and another, to obſerve if any man's attention were turned upon me. I trembled as if in an ague fit; and at firſt felt continual impulſes to quit the houſe and take to my heels. I drew cloſer in my corner, held aſide my head, and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from time to time to undergo a total revolution of the animal economy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="112" facs="unknown:028752_0340_0FDBD898A4159C20"/>
At length the tide of ideas turned. Perceiving they paid no attention to me, the recollection of the full ſecurity my diſguiſe afforded recurred ſtrongly to my thoughts, and I began inwardly to exult, though I did not venture to obtrude myſelf to examination. By degrees I began to be amuſed at the abſurdity of their tales, and the variety of the falſehoods I heard aſſerted around me. My ſoul ſeemed to expand; I felt a pride in the ſelf-poſſeſſion and lightneſs of heart with which I could liſten to the ſcene; and I determined to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long and heighten the enjoyment. Accordingly, when they were withdrawn, I addreſſed myſelf to our hoſteſs, a buxom, bluff, good humoured widow, and aſked what ſort of a man this Kit Williams might be? She replied that, as ſhe was informed, he was as handſome, likely a lad, as any in four counties round; and that ſhe loved him for his cleverneſs, by which be outwitted all the keepers they could ſet over him, and made his way through ſtone walls, as if they were ſo many cobwebs. I obſerved that the country was ſo thoroughly alarmed, that I did not think it poſſible he ſhould eſcape the purſuit that was ſet up after him. This idea excited her immediate indignation; ſhe ſaid ſhe hoped he was far enough away by this time, but, if not, ſhe wiſhed the curſe of God might light on them that betrayed ſo noble a fellow to a fatal end!—Though ſhe little thought that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of whom ſhe ſpoke was ſo near her, yet the ſincere and generous warmth with which ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted herſelf in my behalf, gave me conſiderable pleaſure. With this ſenſation to ſweeten the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues of the day and the calamities of my ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I retired from the kitchen to a neighbouring barn, laid myſelf down upon ſome ſtraw, and fell into a profound ſleep.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="113" facs="unknown:028752_0341_0FDBD95F2B437850"/>
The next day about noon as I was purſuing my journey, I was overtaken by two men on horſeback, who ſtopped me to enquire reſpecting a perſon that they ſuppoſed might have paſſed along that road. As they proceeded in their deſcription I perceived with aſtoniſhment and terror that I was myſelf the perſon to whom their queſtions related. They en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into a tolerably accurate detail of the various characteriſtics by which my perſon might beſt be diſtinguiſhed. They ſaid, they had good reaſon to believe that I had been ſeen at a place in that county the very day before. While they were ſpeaking, a third perſon who had fallen behind came up, and my alarm was greatly increaſed upon ſeeing that this perſon was the ſervant of Mr. Foreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who had viſited me in priſon about a fortnight before my eſcape. My beſt reſource in this criſis was compoſure and apparent indifference. It was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate for me that my diſguiſe was ſo complete, that the eye of Mr. Falkland itſelf could ſcarcely have penetrated it. I had been aware for ſome time before that this was a refuge which events might make neceſſary, and had endeavoured to arrange and methodiſe my ideas upon the ſubject. From my youth I had poſſeſſed a conſiderable faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in the art of imitation; and, when I quitted my retreat under the roof of Mr. Raymond, I adopted along with my beggar's attire a peculiar ſlouching and clowniſh gait to be uſed whenever there ſhould appear the leaſt chance of my being obſerved, together with an Iriſh brogue which I had had an opportunity of ſtudying in my priſon. Such are the miſerable expedients and ſo great the ſtudied artifice, which man, who never deſerves the name of manhood but in proportion as he is erect and independent, may find it neceſſary to employ, for the purpoſe of eluding the inexorable
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:028752_0342_0FDBD8B20D32E418"/>
animoſity and unfeeling tyranny of his fellow man! I had made uſe of this brogue, though I have not thought it neceſſary to write it down in my narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, in the converſation of the village alehouſe. Mr. Foreſter's ſervant as he came up obſerved that his companions were engaged in converſation with me; and, gueſſing at the ſubject, aſked whether they had gained any intelligence. He added to the information at which they had already hinted, that a reſolution was taken to ſpare neither diligence nor expence for my diſcovery and apprehenſion, and that they were ſatisfied that, if I were above ground and in the kingdom, it would be impoſſible for me to eſcape them.</p>
                     <p>Every new incident that had occurred to me, thus tended to impreſs upon my mind the extreme danger to which I was expoſed. I could almoſt have imagined that I was the ſole ſubject of general attention, and that the whole world was in arms to exterminate me. The very idea tingled through every fibre of my frame. But, terrible as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to my imagination, it did but give new energy to my purpoſe; and I determined that I would not voluntarily reſign the field, that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſpeaking my neck to the cord of the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner, notwithſtanding the greateſt ſuperiority in my aſſailants. But the incidents which had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen me, though they did not change my purpoſe, induced me to examine over again the means by which that purpoſe might be effected. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of this reviſal was to determine me to bend my courſe to the neareſt ſea-port on the weſt ſide of the iſland, and tranſport myſelf to Ireland. I cannot now tell what it was that inclined me to prefer this ſcheme to that which I had originally formed. Perhaps the latter, which had been for ſome time preſent to my imagination, for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

appeared the more obvious of the two; and I found an appearance of complexity, which the mind did not ſtay to explain to itſelf, in ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting the other in its ſtead.</p>
                     <p>I arrived without farther impediment at the place from which I intended to ſail, enquired for a veſſel which I found ready to put to ſea in a few hours, and agreed with the captain for my paſſage. Ireland had to me the diſadvantage of being a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency of the Britiſh government, and therefore a place of leſs ſecurity than moſt other countries which are divided from it by the ocean. To judge from the diligence with which I ſeemed to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued in England, it was not improbable that the zeal of my perſecutors might follow me to the other ſide of the channel. It was however ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently agreeable to my mind that I was upon the point of being removed one ſtep farther from the danger which was ſo grievous to my imagination.</p>
                     <p>Could there be any peril in the ſhort interval that was to elapſe before the veſſel was to weigh anchor, and quit the Engliſh ſhore? Probably not. A very ſhort time had intervened between my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination for the ſea and my arrival at this place; and, if any new alarm had been given to my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors, it proceeded from the old woman a very few days before. I hoped I had anticipated their diligence. Meanwhile that I might neglect no reaſonable precaution, I went inſtantly on board, reſolved that I would not unneceſſarily, by walking in the ſtreets of the town, expoſe myſelf to any untoward accident.</p>

                     <p>THE time was now nearly elapſed that was preſcribed for our ſtay, and orders for weighing anchor were every moment expected, when we were hailed by a boat from the ſhore with two other men in it beſide thoſe that rowed. They entered our veſſel in an inſtant. They were officers of juſtice. The paſſengers, five perſons beſide myſelf, were ordered upon deck for exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. I was inexpreſſibly diſturbed at the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of ſuch a circumſtance in ſo unſeaſonable a moment. I took it for granted that it was of me that they were in ſearch. Was it poſſible that by any unaccountable accident they ſhould have got an intimation of my diſguiſe? It was infinitely more diſtreſſing to encounter them upon this nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſtage and under theſe pointed circumſtances, than, as I had before encountered my purſuers, under the appearance of an indifferent perſon. My recollection however did not forſake me. I confided in my conſcious diſguiſe and my Iriſh brogue, as a rock of dependence againſt all acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents.</p>
                     <p>No ſooner did we appear upon deck than to my great conſternation I could obſerve the attention of our gueſts principally turned upon me. They aſked a few frivolous queſtions of ſuch of my fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low paſſengers as happened to be neareſt to them; and then turning to me enquired my name, who I was, whence I came, and what had brought me there? I had ſcarcely opened my mouth to reply,
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:028752_0345_0FDBD967688609E8"/>
when with one conſent they laid hold of me, ſaid I was their priſoner, and declared that my accent, together with the correſpondence of my perſon, would be ſufficient to convict me before any court in England. I was hurried out of the veſſel into the boat in which they came, and ſeated between them, as if by way of precaution leſt I ſhould ſpring overboard and by any means eſcape them.</p>
                     <p>I now took it for granted that I was once more in the power of Mr. Falkland, and the idea was inexpreſſibly mortifying and afflictive to my ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination. Eſcape from his purſuit, freedom from his tyranny, were objects upon which my whole ſoul was bent; could no human ingenuity and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion effect them? Did his power reach through all ſpace, and his eye penetrate every concealment? Was he like that myſterious being, to protect us from whoſe fierce revenge mountains and hills we are told might fall on us in vain! No idea is more heart-ſickening and tremendous than this. But in my caſe it was not a ſubject of reaſoning or of faith; I could derive no comfort either openly from unbelief, or ſecretly from the remoteneſs and incomprehenſibility of the conception; it was an affair of ſenſe; I felt the fangs of the tyger ſtriking deep into my heart.</p>
                     <p>But, though this impreſſion were at firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly ſtrong, and accompanied with its uſual attendants in dejection and puſillanimity of ſpirit, yet my mind ſoon began as it were mechanically, to turn upon the conſideration of the diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this ſea-port and my county priſon, and the various opportunities of eſcape that might offer themſelves in the interval. My firſt duty was to avoid betraying myſelf more than it might after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards appear I was betrayed already. It was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that, though apprehended, my apprehenſion
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:028752_0346_0FDBD8B8B2F97428"/>
might have been determined on upon ſome ſlight ſcore, and that by my dexterity I might render my diſmiſſion as ſudden as my arreſt had been. It was even poſſible that I had been ſeized through a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, and that the preſent meaſure might have no connection with Mr. Falkland's affair. Upon every ſuppoſition it was my buſineſs to gain information, and not to communicate it.</p>
                     <p>I ſoon found the benefits of this reſolution. In my paſſage from the ſhip to the town I did not utter a word. My conductors commented on my ſulkineſs, but remarked that it would avail me nothing, I ſhould infallibly ſwing, as it was never known that any body got off; who was tried for robbing his majeſty's mail. It is eaſy to conceive the lightneſs of heart which was communicated to me by theſe words: I perſiſted however in the ſilence I had meditated. From the reſt of their converſation, which was ſufficiently voluble, I learned that the mail from Edinburgh to London had been robbed about ten days before by two Iriſhmen, that one of them was already ſecured, and that I was taken up upon ſuſpicion of being the other. They had a deſcription of his perſon which, though, as I afterwards found, it diſagreed from mine in ſeveral material articles, appeared to them to tally to the minuteſt tittle. The intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence that the whole proceeding againſt me was founded in a miſtake, took an oppreſſive load from my mind. I believed that I ſhould immediately be able to eſtabliſh my innocence to the ſatisfaction of any magiſtrate in the kingdom; and, though croſſed in my plans, and thwarted in my deſign of quitting the iſland even after I was already at ſea, this was but a trifling inconvenience compared with what I had had but too much reaſon to fear.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="119" facs="unknown:028752_0347_0FDBD96DA3BB3398"/>
As ſoon as we came aſhore I was conducted to the houſe of a juſtice of peace, a man who had formerly been the captain of a collier, but who, having been ſucceſsful in the world, had quitted this wandering life, and for ſome years had had the honour to repreſent his majeſty's perſon. We were detained for ſome time in a ſort of anti-room, waiting his reverence's leiſure. The perſons by whom I had been taken up were experienced in their trade, and inſiſted upon employing this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval in ſearching me, in preſence of two of his worſhip's ſervants. They found upon me fifteen guineas and ſome ſilver. They required me to ſtrip myſelf perfectly naked, that they might examine whether I had bank notes concealed any where about my perſon. They took up the detached par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels of my miſerable attire as I threw it from me, and felt them one by one to diſcover whether the articles of which they were in ſearch might by any device be ſown up in them. To all this I ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without murmuring. It might probably come to the ſame thing at laſt, and ſummary juſtice was ſufficiently coincident with my views, my principal object being to get as ſoon as poſſible out of the clutches of the reſpectable perſons who now had me in cuſtody.</p>
                     <p>This operation was ſcarcely completed, before we were directed to be uſhered into his worſhip's apartment. My accuſers opened the charge, and told him that they had been ordered to this town upon an intimation that one of the perſons who robbed the Edinburgh mail was to be ſound here; and that they had taken me on board a veſſel which was by this time under ſail for Ireland. Well, ſays his worſhip, that is your ſtory; now let us hear what account the gentleman gives of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. What is your name, ha, ſirrah? and from
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:028752_0348_0FDBD8BAA42A7FC8"/>
what part of Tipperary are you pleaſed to come? I had already taken my determination upon this article; and, the moment I learned the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of the charge againſt me, reſolved, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at leaſt, to lay aſide my Iriſh accent, and ſpeak my native tongue. This I had done in the very few words I had ſpoken to my conductors in the anti-room: they ſtared at the metamorphoſis, but they had gone too far for it to be poſſible they ſhould retract in conſiſtence with their honour. I now told the juſtice that I was no Iriſhman, nor had ever been in that country: I was a native of England. This occaſioned a conſulting of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in which my perſon was ſuppoſed to be deſcribed, and which my conductors had brought along with them for their direction. To be ſure that required that the offender ſhould be an Iriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
                     <p>Obſerving his worſhip heſitate, I thought this was the time to puſh the matter a little farther. I referred to the paper, and ſhewed him that the deſcription neither tallied as to height nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion. But then it did as to years and the colour of the hair; and it was not this gentleman's habit, as he informed me, to ſquabble about trifles, or to let a man's neck out of the halter for a pretended flaw of a few inches in his ſtature. If a man were too ſhort, he ſaid, there was no remedy like a little ſtretching. The miſcalculation in my caſe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to be the oppoſite way, but his reverence did not think proper to loſe his jeſt. Upon the whole he was ſomewhat at a loſs how to proceed.</p>
                     <p>My conductors obſerved this, and began to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the reward, which two hours ago they thought as good as in their own pocket. To retain me in cuſtody they judged to be a ſafe ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; if it turned out a miſtake at laſt, they felt
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:028752_0349_0FDBD96EE789B828"/>
little apprehenſion of a ſuit for falſe impriſonment from a poor man accoutred as I was in rags. They therefore urged his worſhip to comply with their views. They told him that to be ſure the evidence againſt me did not prove ſo ſtrong, as for their part they heartily wiſhed it had, but that there were a number of ſuſpicious circumſtances reſpecting me. When I was brought up to them upon the deck of the veſſel, I ſpoke as fine an Iriſh brogue as one ſhall hear in a ſummer's day; and now all at once there was not the leaſt particle of it left. In ſearching me they had ſound upon me fifteen guineas; how ſhould a poor beggar lad, ſuch as I appeared, come honeſtly by fifteen guineas? Beſide, when they had ſtripped me naked, though my dreſs was ſo ſhabby, my ſkin had all the ſleekneſs of a gentleman. In fine, for what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe could a poor beggar, who had never been in Ireland in his life, want to tranſport himſelf to that country? It was as clear as the ſun that I was no better than I ſhould be. This reaſoning, together with ſome ſignificant winks and geſtures between the juſtice and the plaintiffs, brought him over to their way of thinking. He ſaid, I muſt go to War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick, where it ſeems the other robber was at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in cuſtody, and be confronted with him; and if then every thing appeared fair and ſatisfactory, I ſhould be diſcharged.</p>
                     <p>No intelligence could be more terrible than that which was contained in theſe words. That I, who had found the whole country in arms againſt me, who was expoſed to a purſuit ſo peculiarly vigilant and penetrating, ſhould now be dragged to the very centre of the kingdom, without power of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modating myſelf to circumſtances, and under the immediate cuſtody of the officers of juſtice, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to my ears almoſt the ſame thing as if they had pronounced upon me a ſentence of death! I
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:028752_0350_0FDBD8BBC4B3CBE0"/>
ſtrenuouſly urged the injuſtice of this proceeding. I obſerved to the magiſtrate that it was impoſſible I ſhould be the perſon at whom the deſcription pointed. It required an Iriſhman; I was no Iriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. It deſcribed a perſon ſhorter than I; a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of all others the leaſt capable of being counterfeited. There was not the ſlighteſt reaſon for detaining me in cuſtody. I had been already diſappointed of my voyage and loſt the money I had paid down through the officiouſneſs of theſe gentlemen in apprehending me. I aſſured his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip that every delay under my circumſtances was of the utmoſt importance to me. It was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to deviſe a greater injury to be inflicted on me, than the propoſal that, inſtead of being permitted to proceed upon my voyage, I ſhould be ſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der arreſt into the heart of the kingdom.</p>
                     <p>My remonſtrances were in vain. The juſtice was by no means inclined to digeſt the being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulated with in this manner by a perſon in the habiliments of a beggar. In the midſt of my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs he would have ſilenced me for my imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, but that I ſpoke with an earneſtneſs with which he was wholly unable to contend. When I had finiſhed, he told me that it was all to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and that it might have been better for me if I had ſhown myſelf leſs inſolent. It was clear that I was a vagabond and a ſuſpicious perſon. The more earneſt I ſhowed myſelf to get off, the more reaſon there was he ſhould keep me faſt. Perhaps after all I ſhould turn out to be the felon in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But, if I was not that, he had no doubt I was worſe; a poacher, or for what he knew a murderer. He had a kind of a notion that he had ſeen my face before about ſome ſuch affair; out of all doubt I was an old offender. He had it in his choice to ſend me to hard labour as a vagrant upon the ſtrength of my appearance and the contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:028752_0351_0FDBD9732AB87A48"/>
in my ſtory, or to order me to Warwick; and out of the ſpontaneous goodneſs of his diſpoſition he choſe the milder alternative. He could aſſure me I ſhould not ſlip through his fingers. It was of more benefit to his majeſty's government to hang one ſuch fellow as he ſuſpected me to be, than out of miſguided tenderneſs to concern one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for the good of all the beggars in the nation.</p>
                     <p>Finding that it was impoſſible to work on a man, ſo fully impreſſed with his own dignity and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance and my utter inſignificance, in the way I deſired, I claimed that at leaſt the money taken from my perſon ſhould be reſtored to me. This was granted. His worſhip perhaps ſuſpected that he had ſtretched a point in what he had already done, and was therefore the leſs unwilling to relax in this incidental circumſtance. My conductors did not oppoſe themſelves to this indulgence, for a reaſon that will appear in the ſequel. The juſtice however enlarged upon his clemency in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding. He did not know whether he was not exceeding the ſpirit of his commiſſion in complying with my demand. So much money in my poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion could not be honeſtly come by. But it was his temper to ſoften, as far as could be done with propriety, the ſtrict letter of the law.</p>
                     <p>There were cogent reaſons why the gentlemen who had originally taken me into cuſtody, choſe that I ſhould continue in their cuſtody, when my examination was over. Every man is in his dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent mode ſuſceptible to a ſenſe of honour; and they did not chooſe to encounter the diſgrace that would accrue to them if juſtice had been done. Every man is in ſome degree influenced by the love of power; and they were willing I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> owe any benefit I received, to their ſovereign grace and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity, and not to the mere reaſon of the caſe. It was not however an unſubſtantial honour and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:028752_0352_0FDBD8BDA1F56BA0"/>
power that formed the object of their purſuit: no, their views were deeper than that. In a word, though they choſe that I ſhould retire from the ſeat of juſtice as I had come before it, a priſoner, yet the tenour of my examination had obliged them in ſpite of themſelves to ſuſpect, that I was innocent of the charge they alleged againſt me. Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive therefore that the hundred guineas that had been offered as a reward for taking the robber, was completely out of the queſtion in the preſent buſineſs, they were contented to ſtrike at ſmaller game. Having conducted me to an inn, and given directions reſpecting a vehicle for the journey, they took me aſide, while one of them addreſſed me in the following manner:</p>
                     <p>You ſee, my lad, how the caſe ſtands; heigh for Warwick is the word! and, when we are got there, what may happen then I will not pretend for to ſay. Whether you are innocent or no is no buſineſs of mine; but you are not ſuch a chicken as to ſuppoſe, if ſo be as you are innocent, that that will make your game altogether ſure. You ſay, your buſineſs calls you another way, and as how you are in haſte: I have not the heart to croſs any man in his concerns, if I can help it. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you will give us them there fifteen ſhiners, why ſnug is the word. They are of no uſe to you; a beggar, you know, is always at home. For the matter of that we could have had them in the way of buſineſs as you ſaw at the juſtice's. But I am a man of principle; I loves to do things above board, and ſcorns to extort a ſhilling from any man.</p>
                     <p>He who is tinctured with principles of moral diſcrimination, is apt upon occaſion to be run away with by his feelings in that reſpect, and to forget the immediate intereſt of the moment. I confeſs that the firſt ſentiment excited in my mind by this
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:028752_0353_0FDBD9742C355A30"/>
overture was that of indignation. I was irreſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably impelled to give utterance to this feeling, and poſtpone for a moment the conſideration of the future. I replied with the ſeverity which ſo baſe a proceeding appeared to deſerve. My bear-leaders were conſiderably ſurpriſed with my firmneſs, but ſeemed to think it beneath them to conteſt with me the principles I delivered. He who had made the overture contented himſelf with replying, Well, well, my lad, do as you will; you are not the firſt man that has been hanged rather than part with a few guineas. His words did not paſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heeded by me. They were ſtrikingly applicable to my ſituation, and I was determined not to ſuffer the occaſion to eſcape me unimproved.</p>
                     <p>The pride of theſe gentlemen however was too great to admit of farther parley for the preſent. They left me abruptly; having firſt ordered an old man, the father of the landlady, to ſtay in the room with me while they were abſent. The old man they ordered for ſecurity to lock the door and put the key in his pocket, at the ſame time mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing below ſtairs the ſtation in which they had left me, that the people of the houſe might have an eye upon what went forward, and not ſuffer me to eſcape. What was the intention of this manoeuvre I am unable certainly to pronounce. Probably it was a ſort of compromiſe between their pride and their avarice, being deſirous for ſome reaſon or other to drop me as ſoon as convenient, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore determining to wait the reſult of my private meditations on the propoſal they had made.</p>

                     <p>THEY were no ſooner withdrawn than I caſt my eye upon the old man, and found ſomething extremely venerable and intereſting in his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. His form was above the middle ſize. It indicated that his ſtrength had once been conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; nor was it at this time by any means anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilated. His hair was in conſiderable quantity, and was as white as the driven ſnow. His com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion was healthful and ruddy, at the ſame time that his face was furrowed with wrinkles. In his eye there was remarkable vivacity, and his whole countenance was ſtrongly expreſſive of good nature. The booriſhneſs of his rank in ſociety was loſt, in the cultivation his mind had derived from habits of ſenſibility and benevolence.</p>
                     <p>The view of his figure immediately introduced a train of ideas into my mind reſpecting the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to be drawn from the preſence of ſuch a perſon. The attempt to take any ſtep without his conſent was hopeleſs, for, though I ſhould ſucceed with regard to him, he could eaſily give the alarm to other perſons who would no doubt be within call. Add to which, I could ſcarcely have prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on myſelf to offer any offence to a perſon whoſe firſt appearance ſo ſtrongly engaged my affection and eſteem. In reality my thoughts were turned into a different channel. I was impreſſed with an ardent wiſh, to be able to call this man my bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor. Purſued by a train of ill-fortune, I could
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:028752_0355_0FDBD97AFA024010"/>
no longer conſider myſelf as a member of ſociety. I was a ſolitary being, cut off from the expectation of ſympathy, kindneſs and the good-will of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. I was ſtrongly impelled by the ſituation in which the preſent moment placed me, to indulge in a luxury which my deſtiny ſeemed to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied. I could not conceive of the ſmalleſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon between the idea of deriving my liberty from the ſpontaneous kindneſs of a worthy and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent mind, and that of being indebted for it to the ſelfiſhneſs and baſeneſs of the worſt members of ſociety. It was thus that I allowed myſelf in the wantonneſs of refinement even in the midſt of deſtruction.</p>
                     <p>Guided by theſe ſentiments, I requeſted his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to the circumſtances by which I had been brought into my preſent ſituation. He immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſignified his aſſent, and ſaid he would chearfully liſten to any thing I thought proper to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate. I told him the perſons who had juſt left me in charge with him, had come to this town for the purpoſe of apprehending ſome perſon who had been guilty of robbing the mail; that they had choſen to take me up under this warrant, and had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted me before a juſtice of the peace; that they had ſoon detected their miſtake, the perſon in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being an Iriſhman, and differing from me both in country and ſtature; but that by colluſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and the juſtice they were permitted to retain me in cuſtody, and pretended to undertake to conduct me to Warwick to confront me with my accomplice; that in ſearching me at the juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice's they had found a ſum of money in my poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion which excited their cupidity, and that they had juſt been propoſing to me to give me my li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty upon condition of my ſurrendering this ſum into their hands. Under theſe circumſtances I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:028752_0356_0FDBD8C7A82D37A0"/>
him to conſider whether he would wiſh to render himſelf the inſtrument of their extortion. I put myſelf into his hands, and ſolemnly averred the truth of the facts I had juſt ſtated. If he would aſſiſt me in my eſcape, it could have no other effect than to diſappoint the baſe paſſions of my conductors. I would upon no account expoſe him to any real inconvenience; but I was well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that the ſame generoſity that prompted him to a good deed, would enable him effectually to vindicate it when done; and that thoſe who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained me, when they had loſt ſight of their prey, would feel covered with confuſion, and not dare to take another ſtep in the affair.</p>
                     <p>The old man liſtened to what I related with cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity and intereſt. He ſaid that he had always felt an abhorrence to the ſort of people who had me in their hands, that he had an averſion to the taſk they had juſt impoſed upon him, but that he could not refuſe ſome little diſagreeable offices to oblige his daughter and ſon-in-law. He had no doubt, from my countenance and manner, of the truth of what I had aſſerted to him. It was an extraordinary requeſt I had made, and he did not know what had induced me to think him the ſort of perſon to whom it might properly be made. In reality however his habits of thinking were uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and he felt more than half inclined to act as I deſired. One thing at leaſt he would deſire of me in return, which was to be faithfully informed in ſome degree reſpecting the perſon he was aſked to oblige. What was my name?</p>
                     <p>The queſtion came upon me unprepared. But, whatever might be the conſequences, I could not bear to deceive the perſon by whom it was put, and in the circumſtances under which it was put.
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:028752_0357_0FDBD97C6A880FC0"/>
The practice of perpetual falſhood is too painful a taſk. I replied that my name was Williams.</p>
                     <p>He pauſed His eye was fixed upon me. I ſaw his complexion alter at the repetition of that word. He proceeded with viſible anxiety.</p>
                     <p>My chriſtian name?</p>
                     <p>Caleb.</p>
                     <p>Good God! it could not be—? He conjured me by every thing that was ſacred to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer him faithfully to one queſtion more. I was not?—no, it was impoſſible—the perſon who had formerly lived ſervant with Mr. Falkland of—?</p>
                     <p>I told him that, whatever might be the meaning of his queſtion, I would anſwer him truly. I was the individual he mentioned.</p>
                     <p>As I uttered theſe words, the old man roſe from his ſeat. He was ſorry that fortune had been ſo unpropitious to him, as for him ever to have ſet eyes upon me! I was a monſter with whom the very earth groaned!</p>
                     <p>I intreated that he would ſuffer me to explain this new miſapprehenſion, as he had done in the former inſtance. I had no doubt that I ſhould do it equally to his ſatisfaction:</p>
                     <p>No! no! no! he would upon no conſideration admit that his ears ſhould ſuffer ſuch contamina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This caſe and the other were very different. There was no criminal upon the face of the earth, no murderer, half ſo deteſtable, as the perſon who could prevail upon himſelf to utter the charges I had done by way of recrimination againſt ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a maſter.—The old man was in a perfect ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with the recollection.</p>
                     <p>At length he calmed himſelf enough to ſay he ſhould never ceaſe to grieve that he had held a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's parley with me. He did not know what was the conduct that ſevere juſtice required of
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:028752_0358_0FDBD8CD2F8B1CB0"/>
him; but, ſince he had come into the knowledge of who I was only by my own confeſſion, it was irreconcilably repugnant to his feelings to make uſe of that knowledge to my injury. Here there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all relation between us ceaſed; and indeed it would be an abuſe of words to conſider me in the light of a human creature. He would do me no miſchief; but then on the other hand he would not for the world be any way aſſiſting and abetting me.</p>
                     <p>I was inexpreſſibly affected at the abhorrence this good and benevolent creature expreſſed againſt me. I could not be ſilent; I endeavoured once and again to prevail upon him to hear me. But his determination was unalterable. Our conteſt laſted for ſome time, and he at length terminated it by ringing the bell, and calling up the waiter. A very little while after this my conductors enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and theſe two other perſons withdrew.</p>
                     <p>It was a part of the ſingularity of my fate that it hurried me from one ſpecies of anxiety and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs to another, too rapidly to ſuffer any one of them to ſink deeply into my mind. I am apt to believe in the retroſpect that half the calamities I was deſtined to endure would infalliby have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed and deſtroyed me. But, as it was, I had no leiſure to chew the cud upon croſs accidents as they befel me, but was under the neceſſity of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting them to guard againſt peril that the next moment ſeemed ready to cruſh me. The behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of this incomparable and amiable old man cut me to the heart. It was a dreadful prognoſtic for all my future life. But, as I have juſt obſerved, my conductors entered, and another ſubject called imperiouſly upon my attention. I could have been content, mortified as I was at this inſtant, to have been ſhut up in ſome impenetrable ſolitude, and to
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:028752_0359_0FDBD9835A468448"/>
have wrapped myſelf up in inconſolable miſery. But the grief I endured had not ſuch power over me, as that I could be content to riſk the being led to the gallows. The love of life, and ſtill more a hatred againſt oppreſſion, ſteeled my heart againſt that ſpecies of inertion. In the ſcene that had juſt paſſed I had indulged, as I have ſaid, in a wantonneſs and luxury of refinement. It was time that that indulgence ſhould be brought to a period. It was dangerous to trifle any more upon the brink of fate; and, penetrated as I was with ſadneſs by the reſult of my laſt attempt, I was little diſpoſed to any unneceſſary circumambulation. I was exactly in the temper in which the gentlemen who had me in their power, would have deſired to find me. Accordingly we entered upon immediate buſineſs; and, after ſome chaffering, they agreed to accept eleven guineas as the price of my freedom. To preſerve however the charineſs of their reputation, they inſiſted upon conducting me with them for a few miles on the outſide of a ſtage coach. They then pretended that the road they had to travel lay in a croſs-country direction; and, having quitted the vehicle, they ſuffered me, almoſt as ſoon as it was out of ſight, to ſhake off this troubleſome aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation, and follow my own inclinations. It may be worth remarking by the way, that theſe fellows outwitted themſelves at their own trade. They had laid hold of me at firſt under the idea of a prize of a hundred guineas: they had ſince been glad to accept a compoſition of eleven; but, if they had retained me a little longer in their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, they would have found the poſſibility of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring the ſum that had originally excited their purſuit, upon a different ſcore.</p>
                     <p>The miſchances that had befallen me in my late attempt to eſcape from my purſuers by having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the ſea, deterred me from the thought
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:028752_0360_0FDBD8CE6AD01D10"/>
of repeating the ſame experiment. I therefore once more returned to the ſuggeſtion of hiding myſelf, at leaſt for the preſent, amidſt the crowds of the metropolis. Meanwhile I by no means thought proper to venture by the direct route, and the leſs ſo as that was the courſe which would be ſteered by my late conductors; but took my road along the borders of Wales. The only incident worth relating in this place, occurred in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject I thought proper to adopt for croſſing the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern in a particular point. The mode of croſſing was by a ferry; and by ſome ſtrange inadvertence I loſt my way ſo completely that I was wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that night to reach the ferry, and arrive at the town which I had deſtined for my repoſe.</p>
                     <p>It was by a ſingular fatality that this petty diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment, in the midſt of the overwhelming conſiderations that might have been expected to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſs every thought of my mind, was borne by me with particular impatience. I was that day un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commonly fatigued. Previouſly to the time when I miſtook, or at leaſt was aware of the miſtake of the road, the ſky had become exceedingly black and lowering, and ſoon after the clouds burſt down in ſheets of rain. I was then in the midſt of a heath, without tree or covering of any ſort to ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter me. I was thoroughly drenched in a moment. In this uncomfortable ſtate I proceeded with a ſort of ſullen determination. By and by the rain gave place to a ſtorm of hail. The hail-ſtones were large and frequent. I was ill defended from them by the miſerable covering I wore, and they ſeemed to cut me in a thouſand directions. The hail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorm ſubſided, and was again ſucceeded by a heavy rain. It was at this time I perceived that I had totally deviated from my way. I could diſcover neither man, nor beaſt, nor habitation of any
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:028752_0361_0FDBD98568126088"/>
kind. I walked on, conſulting at every turn the path it would be proper for me to purſue, and in no inſtance able to diſcern a ſufficient reaſon for rejecting the one and preferring the other. My mind was in a moſt diſconſolate and repin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtate. I muttered imprecations and murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as I paſſed along. I was full of loathing and abhorrence againſt life, and every thing that life carries in its train. After wandering without any certain direction for two hours, I was overtaken by the night, and obliged to take up my reſt for the preſent in a ſolitary ſhed.</p>
                     <p>In a corner of the ſhed which I had choſen for my retreat I found ſome clean ſtraw. I threw off my rags, placing them in a ſituation where they would beſt be dried, and buried myſelf amidſt this friendly warmth. Through fatigue of mind and body it happened in this inſtance, though in general my repoſe was remarkably ſhort, that I ſlept till almoſt noon of the next day. When I roſe, I found that I was at no great diſtance from the ferry, which I croſſed, and entered the town where I intended to have reſted the preceding night.</p>
                     <p>It was market day. As I paſſed near the croſs, I obſerved two people look at me with great ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs, after which one of them exclaimed, I will be damned, if I do not think that is the very fellow thoſe men were enquiring for, who ſet off an hour ago by the coach for—. I was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely alarmed at this information; and, quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my pace, turned ſharp down a narrow lane. The moment I was out of ſight I ran with all the ſpeed I could exert, and did not think myſelf ſafe till I was ſeveral miles diſtant from the place where this information had reached my ears. I have always
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:028752_0362_0FDBD8D0293D0D78"/>
believed that the men to whom it related were the very perſons who had apprehended me on board the ſhip in which I had embarked for Ireland, that by ſome accident they had met with the deſcription of my perſon as publiſhed on the part of Mr. Falk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and that from putting together the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances they had been led to believe that this was the very individual who had lately been in their cuſtody. Indeed it was a piece of infatuation in me for which I am now unable to account, that, after the various indications which had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred in that affair proving to them that I was a man in very critical and peculiar circumſtances, I ſhould have perſiſted in wearing the ſame diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe without the ſmalleſt alteration. My eſcape in the preſent caſe was eminently fortunate. If I had not loſt my way in conſequence of the hail-ſtorm of the preceding night, or if I had not ſo greatly overſlept myſelf this very morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I muſt almoſt infallibly have fallen into the hands of theſe infernal blood-hunters.</p>
                     <p>The town they had choſen for their next ſtage, the name of which I had thus caught in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-place, was the very town to which, but for this intimation, I ſhould have immediately proceeded. As it was, I determined to take a road as wide of it as poſſible. In the firſt place to which I came, in which it was practicable to do ſo, I bought a great coat which I drew over my beggar's weeds, and a better hat. The hat I ſlouched over my face, and covered one of my eyes with a green ſilk ſhade. The handkerchief, which I had hitherto worn about my head, I now tied about the lower part of my viſage, ſo as to cover my mouth. By degrees I diſcarded every part of my former dreſs, and wore for my upper garment a kind of carman's frock,
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:028752_0363_0FDBD9871BEAAEC8"/>
which, being of the better ſort, made me look like the ſon of a reputable farmer of the lower claſs. Thus equipped, I proceeded on my journey, and, after a thouſand alarms, precautions, and circui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous deviations from the direct path, arrived ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in London.</p>

                     <p>HERE then was the termination of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe ſeries of labours, upon which no man could have looked back without aſtoniſhment, or forward without a ſentiment bordering on deſpair. It was at a price which defies eſtimation that I had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed this reſting-place; whether we conſider the efforts it had coſt me to eſcape from the walls of my priſon, or the dangers and anxieties to which I had been a prey from that hour to the preſent.</p>
                     <p>But why do I call the point at which I was now arrived a reſting place? Alas, it was diametrically the reverſe! It was my firſt and immediate buſineſs to review all the projects of diſguiſe I had hitherto conceived, to derive every improvement I could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent from the practice to which I had been ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, and to manufacture a veil of concealment more impenetrable than ever. This was an effort to which I could ſee no end. In ordinary caſes the hue and cry after a ſuppoſed offender is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of temporary operation; but ordinary caſes formed no ſtandard for the coloſſal intelligence of Mr. Falkland. For the ſame reaſon, London, which appears an inexhauſtible reſervoir of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment to the majority of mankind, brought no ſuch conſolatory ſentiment to my mind. Whether life were worth my accepting on ſuch terms I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pronounce. I only know that I perſiſted in this exertion of my faculties, through a ſort of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rental love that men are accuſtomed to entertain
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:028752_0365_0FDBD98D48D300B0"/>
for their intellectual offspring; the more thought I had expended in rearing it to its preſent perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the leſs did I find myſelf diſpoſed to abandon it. Another motive not leſs ſtrenuouſly exciting me to perſeverance, was the ever-growing repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance I felt to injuſtice and arbitrary power.</p>
                     <p>The firſt evening of my arrival in town I ſlept at an obſcure inn at the borough of Southwark, chooſing that ſide of the metropolis on account of its lying entirely wide of the part of England from which I came. I entered the inn in the evening in my countryman's frock; and, having paid for my lodging before I went to bed, equipped myſelf next morning as differently as my wardrobe would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and left the houſe before day. The frock I made up into a ſmall packet; and, having carried it to a diſtance as great as I thought neceſſary, I dropped it in the corner of an alley through which I paſſed. My next care was to furniſh myſelf with another ſuit of apparel totally different from any to which I had hitherto had recourſe. The exterior which I was now induced to aſſume was that of a Jew. One of the gang of thieves upon—fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt had been of that race; and, by the talent of mimicry, which I have already ſtated myſelf to poſſeſs, I could copy their pronunciation of the Engliſh language, ſufficiently to anſwer ſuch occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions as were likely to preſent themſelves. One of the preliminaries I adopted was to repair to a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the town in which great numbers of this people reſide, and ſtudy their complexion and countenance. Having made ſuch proviſion as my prudence ſuggeſted to me, I retired for that night to an inn on the ſide of Mile End and Wapping. Here I accoutred myſelf in my new habiliments; and, having employed the ſame precautions as before, retired from my lodging at a time leaſt expoſed to
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:028752_0366_0FDBD8D52EB805A0"/>
obſervation. It is unneceſſary to deſcribe all the particulars of my new equipage. Suffice it to ſay, that one of my cares was to diſcolour my complexion, and give it the dun and sallow hue which is in moſt inſtances characteriſtic of the tribe to which I aſſumed to belong; and that, when my metamorphoſis was finiſhed, I could not upon the ſtricteſt examination conceive, that any one could have traced out the perſon of Caleb Williams in this new diſguiſe.</p>
                     <p>Thus far advanced in the execution of my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, I deemed it adviſable to procure a lodging, and change my late wandering life for a ſtationary one. In this lodging I conſtantly ſecluded myſelf from the riſing to the ſetting of the ſun; the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods I allowed for exerciſe and air were few, and thoſe few by night. I was even careful of ſo much as approaching the window of my apartment, though upon the attic ſtory; a principle I laid down to myſelf was, not wantonly and unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily to expoſe myſelf to riſk, however ſlight that riſk might appear. Thus I had ſeemingly attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſituation of obſcurity, ſecluded from the haunts and intercourſe of men. It had however little reſemblance to that obſcurity to which my imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation had looked forward with delight, while I was yet in—jail. There is an immeaſurable dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between that rural ſolitude, where a man reſts his head in the lap of verdure and tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; and that retirement in the very ſeat of action, whoſe conſtant attendant is diſquietude, and in which a man ſhrinks with alarm from the eye of his fellow.</p>
                     <p>I might have thought myſelf ſtill more ſecure, if I had been in poſſeſſion of money upon which to ſubſiſt. The neceſſity of a man's earning for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the means of exiſtence is in moſt inſtances a
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:028752_0367_0FDBD98EE5B6B578"/>
merely imaginary evil; but in mine certainly tended to thwart the plan of ſecrecy to which I was condemned. Whatever labour I adopted, or deemed myſelf qualified to diſcharge, it was firſt to be conſidered how I was to be provided with employment, and where I was to find an employer or purchaſer for my commodities. In the mean time I had no alternative. The little money with which I had eſcaped from the blood-hunters was almoſt wholly expended.</p>
                     <p>After the minuteſt conſideration I was able to beſtow upon this queſtion, I determined that lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature ſhould be the field of my firſt experiment. I had read much of money being acquired in this way, and of prices given by the ſpeculators in this ſort of ware to its proper manufacturers. My qualifications I eſtimated at a ſlender valuation. I was not without a conviction that experience and practice muſt pave the way to excellent production. But, though of theſe I was utterly deſtitute, my propenſities had always led me in this direction; and my early thirſt of knowledge had conducted me to a more intimate acquaintance with books, than could perhaps have been expected under my circumſtances. If my literary pretenſions were ſlight, the demand I intended to make upon them was not great. I only deſired a ſubſiſtence, and I was perſuaded few perſons could ſubſiſt upon ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer means than myſelf. I alſo conſidered that this was a temporary expedient, neceſſary only till by accident or time I could place myſelf in a more eligible ſituation. The reaſons that principally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined me in my choice, were that this employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment called upon me for the leaſt preparation, and could, as I thought, be exerciſed with leaſt obſervation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="140" facs="unknown:028752_0368_0FDBD8D749326E60"/>
There was a ſolitary woman of middle age, who tenanted a chamber in this houſe upon the ſame floor with my own. I had no ſooner determined upon the deſtination of my induſtry, than I caſt my eye upon her as the poſſible inſtrument for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of my productions. Excluded as I was from all intercourſe with my ſpecies in general, I found pleaſure in the occaſional exchange of a few words with this inoffenſive and good-humoured creature, who was already of an age to preclude ſcandal. She lived upon a very ſmall annuity al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed her by a diſtant relation, a woman of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, who, poſſeſſed of thouſands herſelf, had no other anxiety with reſpect to this perſon, than that ſhe ſhould not contaminate her alliance by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion of honeſt induſtry. This humble creature was of a uniformly chearful and active diſpoſition, unacquainted alike with the cares of wealth, and the preſſure of misfortune. Though her preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions were ſmall, and her information ſlender, ſhe was by no means deficient in penetration. She ſaw the faults and follies of mankind with a judging eye; but her temper was of ſo mild and forgiving a caſt, as would have induced moſt perſons to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that ſhe perceived nothing of the matter. Her heart overflowed with the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>k of kindneſs. She was ſincere and ardent in her attachments, and never did ſhe omit a ſervice which ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived herſelf able to render to a human being. I found her willing and alert to enter into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">

                        </gap> I propoſed to her. That I might anticipate occaſions of ſuſpicion, I frankly told her that, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> reaſons which I wiſhed to be excuſed from relating, but which, if related, I was ſure would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive me of her good opinion, I found it neceſſary for the preſent to keep myſelf private. With this ſtatement ſhe readily acquieſced, and told me that
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:028752_0369_0FDBD98FFAEBA228"/>
ſhe had no deſire for any farther information than I found it expedient to give.</p>
                     <p>My firſt productions were of the poetical kind. After having finiſhed two or three, I directed this generous friend to take them to the office of a newſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paper; but they were rejected with contempt by the Ariſtarchus of that place, who, having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on them a ſuperficial glance, told her that ſuch matters were not at all in his way. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help mentioning in this place that the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Mrs. Marney (that was the name of my am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadreſs) was in all caſes a perfect indication of her ſucceſs, and rendered explanation by words wholly unneceſſary. She intereſted herſelf ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſervedly in what ſhe undertook, that ſhe felt either miſcarriage or good fortune much more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitely than I did. I had an unheſitating confidence in my own reſources, and, occupied as I was in the meditation of more intereſting concerns, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded theſe matters as altogether trivial.</p>
                     <p>I quietly took the pieces back, and laid them upon my table. Upon reviſal I altered and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed one of them, and, joining it with two others, diſpatched them together to the editor of a magazine. He deſired they might be left with him till the day after to-morrow. When that day <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>me, he told my friend they ſhould be inſerted; but, Mrs Marney aſking reſpecting the price, he replied, it was their conſtant rule to give nothing for poetical compoſitions, the letter-box being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways full of writings of that ſort; but, if the gentleman would try his hand in proſe, a ſhort eſſay or a tale, he would ſee what he could do for him.</p>
                     <p>With the requiſition of my literary dictated I immediately complied. I attempted a paper in the ſtyle of Addiſon's Spectators, which was accepted.

In a ſhort time I was upon an eſtabliſhed footing in this quarter. I however diſtruſted my reſources in the way of moral diſquiſition, and ſoon turned my thoughts to his other ſuggeſtion, a tale. His demands upon me were now frequent, and to faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate my labour I bethought myſelf of the reſource of tranſlation. I had ſcarcely any convenience with reſpect to the procuring of books; but, as my memory was very retentive, I frequently tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated or modelled my narratives upon a reading of ſome years before. By a fatality for which I do not well know how to account, my thoughts fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently led me to the hiſtories of celebrated rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; and I retailed from time to time incidents and anecdotes of Cartouche, Guſman d'Alfarache, and other memorable worthies, whoſe career was terminated upon the gallows or the ſcaffold.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XIII.</head>
                     <p>WHILE I was thus endeavouring to occupy and provide for the intermediate period till the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the purſuit after me might be a little abated, a new ſource of danger opened upon me of which I had no previous ſuſpicion. Jones, the thief who had been expelled from captain Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond's gang, had fluctuated during the laſt years of his life, between the two profeſſions of a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator and a miniſter of executive juſtice. I believe he had originally devoted himſelf to the firſt, and probably his initiation in the myſteries of thieving qualified him to be peculiarly expert in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of a thief-taker, a profeſſion he had adopted not from choice, but neceſſity. In this employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment his reputation was great, though perhaps not equal to his merits; for it happens here, as in all other departments of human ſociety, that, however the ſubalterns may furniſh wiſdom and ſkill, the principals run away with the eclat. He was exerciſing this art in a very proſperous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, when it happened by ſome accident, that one or two of his atchievements, previous to his hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhaken off the dregs of unlicenſed depreda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, were in danger of becoming ſubjects of public attention. Having had repeated intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this, he thought it prudent to decamp, and it was during this period of his retreat that he entered into the—gang.</p>
                     <p>Such was the hiſtory of this man antecedently to his being placed in the ſituation in which I had firſt encountered him. At the time of that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:028752_0372_0FDBD8DE64A3DA30"/>
he was a veteran of Captain Raymond's gang; for, thieves being a ſhort-lived race, the character of veteran coſts the leſs time in acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Upon his expulſion from this community he returned once more to his lawful profeſſion, and by his old comrades was received with congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation as a loſt ſheep. In the vulgar claſſes of ſociety no length of time is ſufficient to expiate a crime; but among the fraternity of thief-takers it is a rule never to bring one of their own brethren to a reckoning, when it can with any propriety be avoided. Another rule obſerved by thoſe who have paſſed through the ſame gradations as Jones had done, and which was adopted by Jones him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, was always to reſerve ſuch as had been the accomplices of their depredations to the laſt, and on no account to aſſail them without great neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity or powerful temptation. For this reaſon Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Raymond and his confederates were, according to Jones's ſyſtem of tactics, ſafe, as he would have termed it, from his retaliation.</p>
                     <p>But, though Jones was in this ſenſe of the term a man of ſtrict honour, my caſe unfortunately did not fall within the laws of honour he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged. Misfortune had overtaken me, and I was on all ſides without protection or ſhelter. The perſecution to which I was expoſed was founded upon the ſuppoſition of my having committed felony to an immenſe amount. But in this Jones had had no participation; he was careleſs whether the ſuppoſition were true or falſe, and hated me as much as if my innocence had been eſtabliſhed beyond the reach of ſo much as a whiſper of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion. The blood-hunters who had taken me into cuſtody at—, related, as uſual, among their fraternity a part of their adventure, and told of the reaſon which inclined them to ſuppoſe, that
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:028752_0373_0FDBD996A9E061F8"/>
the individual who had paſſed through their cuſtody, was the very Caleb Williams for whoſe apprehenſion a reward had been offered of a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred guineas. Jones, whoſe acuteneſs was emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in the way of his profeſſion, by comparing facts and dates was induced to ſuſpect in his own mind that Caleb Williams was the perſon he had huſtled and wounded upon—foreſt. Againſt that perſon he entertained the bittereſt averſion. I had been the innocent occaſion of his being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled with diſgrace from Captain Raymond's gang; and Jones, as I afterwards underſtood, was inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately perſuaded that there was no compariſon between the liberal and manly profeſſion of a rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, from which I had driven him, and the ſordid and mechanical occupation of a blood-hunter, to which he was obliged to return. He no ſooner received the information I have mentioned, than he vowed revenge. He determined to leave all other objects, and conſecrate every faculty of his mind to the unkenneling me from my hiding place. The offered reward, which his vanity made him conſider as aſſuredly his own, appeared as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete indemnification of his labour and expence. Thus I had to encounter the ſagacity he poſſeſſed in the way of his profeſſion, whetted and ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by a ſentiment of vengeance in a mind that knew no reſtraint from conſcience or humanity.</p>
                     <p>The firſt ſtep he purſued in execution of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, was to ſet out for the ſea-port town where I had formerly been apprehended. From thence he traced me to the banks of the Severn, and from the banks of the Severn to London. It is ſcarcely neceſſary to obſerve that this is always practicable, unleſs the precautions of the fugitive be in the higheſt degree both judicious in the conception and fortunate in the execution,—provided the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuer
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:028752_0374_0FDBD8E0F01A8788"/>
have motives ſtrong enough to excite him to perſeverance. Jones indeed in the courſe of his purſuit was often obliged to double his ſteps; and, like the harrier, an apt emblem of a man engaged in this ſanguinary occupation, whenever he was at a fault, returned to the place where he had laſt perceived the ſcent of the animal whoſe death he had decreed. He ſpared neither pains nor time in the gratification of the paſſion which choice had made his ruling one.</p>
                     <p>Upon my arrival in town he for a moment loſt all trace of me, London being a place in which, on account of the magnitude of its dimenſions, it might well be ſuppoſed that an individual could remain hidden and unknown. But no difficulty could diſcourage this new adverſary. He went from inn to inn, reaſonably ſuppoſing that there was no private houſe to which I could immediately repair, till he found, by the deſcription he gave, and the ſentiments he excited, that I had ſlept for one night in the borough of Southwark. But he could get no farther information. The people of the inn had no knowledge what had become of me the next morning. This however did but render him more eager in his purſuit. The deſcribing me was now more difficult, on account of the partial change of my dreſs I had made the ſecond day of my being in town. But Jones at length overcame the obſtacle from that quarter. Having traced me to my ſecond inn, he was here furniſhed with a more copious information. I had been a ſubject of ſpeculation for the leiſure hours of ſome of the perſons belonging to this inn. An old woman of a moſt curious and loquacious diſpoſition who lived oppoſite to it, and who that morning roſe early to her waſhing, had eſpied me from her window by the light of a large lamp which hung over the
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:028752_0375_0FDBD99D3A29B5A0"/>
inn, as I iſſued from the gate. She had but a very imperfect view of me, but ſhe thought there was ſomething Jewiſh in my appearance. She was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to hold a conference every morning with the landlady of the inn, ſome of the waiters and chambermaids occaſionally aſſiſting at it. In the courſe of the dialogue of this morning ſhe aſked ſome queſtions about the Jew who had ſlept there the night before. No Jew had ſlept there. The curioſity of the landlady was excited in her turn. By the time of the morning it could be no one but me. It was very ſtrange! They compared notes reſpecting my appearance and dreſs. No two things could be more diſſimilar. The Jew-Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, upon any dearth of ſubjects of intelligence, repeatedly furniſhed matter for their diſcourſe.</p>
                     <p>The information thus afforded to Jones, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed exceedingly material. But the performance did not for ſome time keep pace with the promiſe. He could not enter every private houſe into which lodgers were ever admitted, in the ſame manner that he had treated the inns. He walked the ſtreets, and examined with a curious and inquiſitive eye the countenance of every Jew about my ſtature; but in vain. He repaired to Duke's Place and the ſynagogues. It was not here that in reality he could calculate upon finding me; but he reſorted to theſe means in deſpair and as a laſt hope. He was more than once upon the point of giving up the purſuit; but he was recalled to it by an inſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable and reſtleſs appetite for revenge.</p>
                     <p>It was during this perturbed and fluctuating ſtate of his mind that he chanced to pay a viſit to a brother of his who was the head-workman of a printing-office. There was little intercourſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two perſons, their diſpoſitions and habits of life being extremely diſſimilar. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:028752_0376_0FDBD945A85DFFE8"/>
was induſtrious, ſober, and of a propenſity to accumulation. He was extremely diſſatisfied with the character and purſuits of his brother, and had made ſome ineffectual attempts to reclaim him. But, though they by no means agreed in their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of thinking, they ſometimes ſaw each other. Jones loved to boaſt of as many of his atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as he dared venture to mention; and his brother was one more hearer, in addition to the ſet of his uſual aſſociates. The printer was amuſed, with the blunt ſagacity of remark and novelty of incident that characteriſed Jones's converſation. He was ſecretly pleaſed, in ſpite of all his ſober and church-going prejudices, that he was brother to a man of ſo much ingenuity and fortitude.</p>
                     <p>After having liſtened for ſome time upon this occaſion to the wonderful ſtories which Jones in his rugged way condeſcended to tell, the printer felt an ambition to entertain his brother in his turn. He began to retail ſome of my ſtories of Cartouche and Guſman d'Alfarache. The attention of Jones was excited. His firſt emotion was wonder; his ſecond was envy and averſion. Where did the printer get theſe ſtories? This queſtion was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. I will tell you what, ſaid the printer, we none of us know what to make of the writer of theſe articles. He writes poetry and morality and hiſtory: I am a printer and corrector of the preſs, and may pretend without vanity to be a tolerably good judge of theſe matters: he writes them all to my mind extremely fine, and yet he is no more than a Jew. [To my honeſt printer this ſeemed as ſtrange as if they had been written by a Cherokee chieftain at the falls of the Miſſiſſippi.]</p>
                     <p>A Jew! How do you know? Did you ever ſee him?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="149" facs="unknown:028752_0377_0FDBD99E661BFB40"/>
No; the matter is always brought to us by a woman. But my maſter hates all myſteries; he likes to ſee his auth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rs themſelves. So he plagues and plagues the old woman; but he can never get any thing out of her, except that one day ſhe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to drop that the young gentleman was a Jew.</p>
                     <p>A Jew! a young gentleman! a perſon who did every thing by proxy, and made a ſecret of all his motions! Here was abundant matter for the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations and ſuſpicions of Jones. He was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in them, without adverting to the proceſs of his own mind, by the ſubject of my lucubra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, men who died by the hands of the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner. He ſaid little more to his brother, except aſking, as if caſually, what ſort of an old woman this was? of what age ſhe might be? and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe often brought him materials of this kind? and ſoon after took occaſion to leave him.</p>
                     <p>It was with vaſt pleaſure that Jones had liſtened to this unhoped for information. Having col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from his brother ſufficient hints relative to the perſon and appearance of Mrs. Marney, and underſtanding that he expected to receive ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from me the next day, Jones took his ſtand in the ſtreet early that he might not riſk miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age by negligence. He waited ſeveral hours, but not without ſucceſs. Mrs. Marney came; he watched her into the houſe; and after about twenty minutes delay ſaw her return. He dogged her from ſtreet to ſtreet; obſerved her finally enter the door of a private houſe; and congratulated himſelf upon having at length arrived at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation of his labours.</p>
                     <p>The houſe ſhe entered was not her own habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. By a ſort of miraculous accident ſhe had
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:028752_0378_0FDBD9A3AE24B2C8"/>
obſerved Jones following her in the ſtreet. As ſhe went home, ſhe ſaw a woman who had fallen down in a fainting fit. Moved by the compaſſion that was ever alive in her, ſhe approached her in order to render her aſſiſtance. Preſently a crowd collected round them. Mrs. Marney having done what ſhe was able, once more proceeded home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Obſerving the crowd round her, the idea of pickpockets occurred to her mind; ſhe put her hands to her ſides, and at the ſame time looked round upon the populace. She had left the circle ſomewhat abruptly; and Jones, who had been obliged to come nearer leſt he ſhould loſe her in the confuſion, was at that moment ſtanding exactly oppoſite to her. His viſage was of the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary kind; habit had written the characters of malignant cunning and dauntleſs effrontery in every line of his face; and Mrs. Marney, who was neither philoſopher nor phyſiognomiſt, was never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs ſtruck. This good woman, like moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of her notable character, had a peculiar way of going home, not through the open ſtreets, but by narrow lanes and alleys, with intricate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions and ſudden turnings. In one of theſe by ſome accident ſhe once again caught a glance of her purſuer. This circumſtance, together with the ſingularity of his appearance, awakened her conjectures. Could he be following her? It was the middle of the day, and ſhe could have no fears for herſelf. But could this circumſtance have any reference to me? She recollected the precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ſecrecy I practiſed, and had no doubt that I had reaſons for what I did. She recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected that ſhe had always been upon her guard reſpecting me; but had ſhe been ſufficiently ſo? She thought that, if ſhe ſhould be the means of
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:028752_0379_0FDBDB154B1EF838"/>
any miſchief to me, ſhe ſhould be miſerable for ever. She determined therefore by way of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution in caſe of the worſt, to call at a friend's houſe, and ſend me word of what had occurred. Having inſtructed her friend, ſhe went out imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon a viſit to a perſon in the exactly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite direction, and deſired her friend to proceed upon the errand to me, five minutes after ſhe left the houſe. By this prude<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> ſhe completely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricated me from the preſent danger.</p>
                     <p>Meantime the intelligence that was brought me by no means aſcertained the greatneſs of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. For any thing I could diſcover in it, the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance might be perfectly innocent, and the fear ſolely proceed from the over caution and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this benevolent and excellent woman. Yet ſuch was the miſery of my ſituation, that I had no choice. For this menace or no menace, I was obliged to deſert my habitation at a minute's warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, taking with me nothing but what I could carry in my hand; to ſee my generous benefactreſs no more; to quit my little arrangements and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and to ſeek once again in ſome forlorn re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat new projects and, if of that I could have any rational hope, a new friend: I deſcended into the ſtreet with a heavy, not an irreſolute heart. It was broad day. I ſaid, Perſons are at this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſuppoſed to be roaming the ſtreet in ſearch of me: I muſt not truſt to the chance of their purſuing one direction, and I another. I tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed half a dozen ſtreets, and then dropped into an obſcure houſe of entertainment for perſons of ſmall expence. In this houſe I took ſome refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, paſſed ſeveral hours of active, but melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly thinking, and at laſt procured a bed. As ſoon however as it was dark, I went out (for this
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:028752_0380_0FDBD9A4ED5C51E8"/>
was indiſpenſable) to purchaſe the materials of a new diſguiſe. Having adjuſted it as well as I could during the night, I left this aſylum with the ſame precautions that I had employed in former inſtances.</p>

                     <p>I PROCURED a new lodging. I became more cautious, and went out ſeldomer than ever. By ſome bias of the mind it may be, gratifying itſelf with images of peril, I inclined upon the whole to believe that Mrs. Marney's alarm had not been without foundation. I was however unable to conjecture through what means danger had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached me; and had therefore only the unſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory remedy of redoubling my watch upon all my actions. Still I had the joint conſiderations preſſing upon me of ſecurity and ſubſiſtence. I had ſome ſmall remains of the produce of my former induſtry; but this was but ſmall, for my employer was in arrear with me, and I did not chooſe in any method to apply to him for payment. The anxieties of my mind in ſpite of all my ſtruggles preyed upon my heath. I did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider myſelf as in ſafety for an inſtant. My ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance was waſted to a ſhadow; and I ſtarted at every ſound that was unexpected. Sometimes I was half tempted to reſign myſelf into the hands of the law, and brave its worſt; but reſentment and indignation at thoſe times ſpeedily flowed back upon my mind, and re-animated my perſeverance.</p>
                     <p>I knew no better reſource with reſpect to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence, than that I had employed in the former inſtance, of ſeeking ſome third perſon to ſtand between me and the diſpoſal of my induſtry. I might find an individual ready to undertake this office in my behalf, but where ſhould I find the
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:028752_0382_0FDBD9ABCF4FA5B0"/>
benevolent ſoul of Mrs. Marney? The perſon I fixed upon was a Mr. Spurrel, a man who took in work from the watch-makers, and had an apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon our ſecond floor. I examined him two or three times with irreſolute glances, as we paſſed upon the ſtairs, before I would venture to accoſt him. He obſerved this, and at length kindly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited me into his apartment.</p>
                     <p>Being ſeated, he condoled with me upon my ſeeming bad health, and the ſolitary mode of my living, and wiſhed to know whether he could be of any ſervice to me. From the firſt moment he ſaw me, he had conceived an affection for me. In my preſent diſguiſe I appeared twiſted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and in other reſpects by no means an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of attraction. But it ſeemed, Mr. Spurrel had loſt an only ſon about ſix months before, and I was the very picture of him. If I had put off my counterfeited uglineſs, I ſhould probably have l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſt all hold upon his affections. He was now an old man, as he obſerved, juſt dropping into the grave, and this ſon had been his only conſolation. The poor lad was always ailing, but he had been a nurſe to him; and the more care he required while he was alive, the more he miſſed him now he was dead. Now he had not a friend, nor any body that cared for him in the whole world. If I pleaſed, I ſhould be inſtead of that ſon to him, and he would treat me in all reſpects with the ſame at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and care.</p>
                     <p>I expreſſed my ſenſe of theſe benevolent offers; but told him that I ſhould be ſorry to be in any way burthenſome to him. My ideas at preſent led me to a private and ſolitary life, and my chief dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty was to reconcile this with ſome mode of earning neceſſary ſubſiſtence. If he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to lend me his aſſiſtance in ſmoothing this
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:028752_0383_0FDBDB1B6690E8D8"/>
difficulty, it would be the greateſt benefit he could confer on me. I told him that my mind had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways had a mechanical and induſtrious turn, and that I did not doubt of ſoon maſtering any craft to which I ſeriouſly applied myſelf. I had not been brought up to any trade; but, if he would favour me with his inſtructions, I would work with him as long as he pleaſed for a bare ſubſiſtence. I knew that I was aſking of him an extraordinary kindneſs, but I was urged on the one hand by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme and unmitigable neceſſity, and encouraged on the other by the perſuaſiveneſs of his friendly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions.</p>
                     <p>The old man dropped ſome tears over my appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent diſtreſs, and readily conſented to every thing I propoſed. Our agreement was ſoon made, and I entered upon my functions accordingly. My new friend was a man of a ſingular turn of mind. Love of money and a charitable officiouſneſs of demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour were his leading characteriſtics. He lived in the moſt penurious manner, and denied himſelf almoſt every indulgence. I entitled myſelf almoſt immediately, as he frankly acknowledged, to ſome remuneration for my labours, and accordingly he inſiſted upon my being paid. He did not however, as ſome perſons would have done under the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances I have deſcribed, pay me the whole amount of my earnings, but profeſſed to ſubtract from them twenty per cent. as an equitable conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration for inſtruction and commiſſion-money in procuring me a channel for my induſtry. Yet he frequently ſhed tears over me, was uneaſy in every moment of our indiſpenſable ſeparation, and exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited perpetual tokens of attachment and fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                     <p>I had not been long in this new ſituation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an incident occurred which filled me with
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:028752_0384_0FDBD9AD2DA21D18"/>
greater alarm and apprehenſion than ever. I was walking out one evening for an hour's exerciſe and air, an indulgence in which I now ſcarcely ever allowed myſelf, when my ear was ſtruck with two or three caſual ſounds from the mouth of a hawker who was bawling his wares. I ſtood ſtill to inform myſelf more exactly, when to my utter aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and confuſion I heard him deliver himſelf nearly in theſe words. "Here you have the Moſt Wonderful and Surpriſing Hiſtory, and Miraculous Adventures of Caleb Williams! you are informed how he firſt robbed, and then brought falſe accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations againſt his maſter; as alſo of his attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divers times to break out of priſon, till at laſt he effected his eſcape in the moſt wonderful and uncredible manner; as alſo of his travelling the kingdom in various diſguiſes, and the robberies he committed with a moſt deſperate and daring gang of thieves; and of his coming up to London, where it is ſuppoſed he now lies concealed; with a true and faithful copy of the hue and cry printed and publiſhed by one of his majeſty's moſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal ſecretaries of ſtate, offering a reward of one hundred guineas for apprehending him. All for the price of one halfpenny."</p>
                     <p>Petrified as I was at theſe amazing and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſounds, I had the temerity to go up to the man and purchaſe one of his papers, deſperately reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to know the exact ſtate of the fact, and what I had to depend upon. I carried it with me a little way, till, no longer able to endure my impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, I contrived to make out the chief part of its contents by the help of a lamp, at the upper end of a narrow paſſage. I found it contain a greater number of circumſtances than could have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected in this ſpecies of publication. I was equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the moſt notorious houſe-breaker in the art
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:028752_0385_0FDBDB1CA85C5620"/>
of penetrating through walls and doors, and to the moſt accompliſhed ſwindler in plauſibleneſs, dupli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and diſguiſe. The hand-bill which Wilſon had firſt brought to us upon the foreſt, was printed at length. All my diſguiſes, previouſly to the laſt alarm that had been given me by the providence of Mrs. Marney, were faithfully enumerated; and the public was warned to be upon their watch againſt a perſon of an uncouth and extraordinary appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and who lived in a recluſe and ſolitary manner. I alſo learned from this paper that my former lodgings had been ſearched on the very even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of my eſcape, and that Mrs. Marney had been ſent to Newgate upon a charge of miſpriſion of felony.—This laſt circumſtance affected me deeply. It was a moſt cruel and intolerable idea, if I were not only myſelf to be an object of unrelenting perſecution, but my very touch were to be infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and every one that ſuccoured me to be involv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the common ruin. I could almoſt have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to undergo the utmoſt malice of my ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, could I by that means have ſaved this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent woman from an hour's diſtreſs.—I afterwards learned that Mrs. Marney was delivered from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement by the interpoſition of her noble rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>This paper was the conſummation of my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. Nothing could happen beyond it but the actual apprehenſion with which I was menaced. Diſguiſe was no longer of uſe to me. A nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous claſs of individuals, through every depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, almoſt every houſe of the metropolis, would be induced to look with a ſuſpicious eye upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtranger, eſpecially every ſolitary ſtranger, that fell under their obſervation. The prize of one hundred guineas was held out to excite their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity, and ſharpen their penetration. It was no longer Bow-Street, it was a million of men, in
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:028752_0386_0FDBD9B32BE3CB48"/>
arms againſt me. Neither had I the refuge, which few men have been ſo miſerable as to want, of one ſingle individual with whom to repoſe my alarms, and who might ſhelter me from the gaze of indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminate curioſity. I inſtantly ſaw that London was no place for my abode, at the ſame time that I apprehended increaſe of peril in any attempt to withdraw from it. I reſolved however that I would no longer ſubmit to this ſtate of terrific alarm. I reſolved that I would not remain quieſcent, till miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief ſhould overtake and devour me. I could ſcarcely reduce things to a more miſerable paſs. "To be worſe than this, were not to be at all."</p>
                     <p>Filled with reflections of this nature, I careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and deliberately deſtroyed the paper I had been reading, by tearing it in a thouſand pieces. I did not return home, but went inſtantly to the water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide. I found that the cheapeſt paſſage I could procure was in a veſſel, moored near the Tower, and which was to ſail in a few days for Middleburg in Holland. I would have gone inſtantly on board and endeavoured to prevail with the captain to let me remain there till he ſailed; but that unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately I had not money enough in my pocket to defray my paſſage. It was worſe than this. I had not money enough in the world. I however paid the captain half his demand, and promiſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn with the reſt. I knew not in what manner it was to be procured, but I believed that I would not fail to procure it. I had ſome idea of borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it of Mr. Spurrel. Surely he would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe me? He appeared to love me with parental affection, and I thought I might truſt myſelf for a moment in his hands.</p>
                     <p>I approached my own home with a heavy and foreboding heart. Mr. Spurrel was not at home; and I was obliged to wait for his return. I had
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:028752_0387_0FDBDB1E28D9FA30"/>
work of his in my trunk, which had been deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out to me that very morning, to five times the amount I wanted. I even canvaſſed for a moment whether I ſhould make uſe of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty as if it were my own; but I rejected the idea with diſdain. I had never in the ſmalleſt degree merited the reproaches that were caſt upon me; and I was determined I never would merit them. It was extraordinary that Mr. Spurrel ſhould be abroad at this hour; I had never known it happen before. His bed-time was between nine and ten. Ten o'clock came, eleven o'clock, but not Mr. Spurrel. At midnight I heard his knock at the door. Every ſoul in the houſe was in bed. Mr. Spurrel, on account of his regular hours, was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided with a key to open for himſelf. A gleam of gaiety and the ſocial ſpirit came over my heart. I flew nimbly down the ſtairs, and opened the door to him myſelf.</p>
                     <p>I could perceive by the little taper in my hand ſomething extraordinary written in his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. I had not time to ſpeak, before I ſaw two other men follow him. At the firſt glance I was ſufficiently aſſured what ſort of perſons they were. At the ſecond I perceived that one of them was no other than Jones himſelf. I had underſtood formerly that he had been of this profeſſion, and I was not much ſurpriſed to find him in it again. Though I had for ſome hours made up my mind as it were, to the unavoidable neceſſity of my once more falling into the hands of the officers of law, yet I could not ſee them enter without feeling my very heart ache in my boſom. I was beſide not a little ſurpriſed at the time and manner of their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, and deſirous to learn whether Mr. Spurrel could be baſe enough to have been their intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducer.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="160" facs="unknown:028752_0388_0FDBD9B32E51A2B0"/>
I was not long held in perplexity. He no ſooner ſaw his two followers properly within the door, than he exclaimed with convulſive eagerneſs, There, there, that is your man! thank God! thank God! Jones looked eagerly in my face, with a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance expreſſive alternately of hope and doubt, and anſwered, By G—, and I do not know whether it be or no! I am afraid we are in the wrong box! then recollecting himſelf, We will go into the houſe, and examine farther however. We all went up ſtairs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Mr. Spurrel's room; I ſet down the candle upon the table. I had hitherto been ſilent; but now, with a calm and deliberate manner, in my feigned voice, one of the characteriſtics of which was liſping, I aſked, And pray, gentlemen, what may be your pleaſure with me? Why, ſaid Jones, our errand is with one Caleb Williams, and a precious raſcal he is! I ought to know the chap well enough; but they ſay he has as many faces as there are days in the year. So you pleaſe to pull off your face; or if you cannot do that, at leaſt you can put off your clothes, and let us ſee what your hump is made of.</p>
                     <p>I remonſtrated, but in vain. I ſtood detected in part of my artifice; and Jones, though ſtill un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, was every moment more and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in his ſuſpicions. Mr. Spurrel perfectly gloted, with eyes that ſeemed ready to devour eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that paſſed. As my impoſture gradually appeared more palpable, he repeated his exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Thank God! thank God! At laſt, tired with this ſcene of mummery, and diſguſted beyond meaſure with the baſe and hypocritical figure I ſeemed to exhibit, I exclaimed, Well, I am Caleb Williams; conduct me wherever you pleaſe! And now, Mr. Spurrel—! He gave a violent ſtart. The inſtant I declared myſelf his tranſport had
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:028752_0389_0FDBDB23D4846930"/>
been at the higheſt, and was, to any power he was able to exert, abſolutely uncontroulable. But the unexpectedneſs of my addreſs, and the tone in which I ſpoke, electrified him.—Is it poſſible, continued I, that you ſhould have been the wretch to betray me? What had I done to deſerve this treatment? Is this the kindneſs you profeſſed? the affection that was perpetually in your mouth? to be the death of me!</p>
                     <p>My poor boy! my dear creature! cried Spurrel, whimpering, and in a tone of the humbleſt expoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation, indeed I could not help it! I would have helped it, if I could! I hope they will not hurt my darling! I am ſure, I ſhall die if they do!</p>
                     <p>Miſerable driveller! interrupted I, with a ſtern voice, do you betray me into the gore-dripping fangs of the law, and then talk of my not being hurt? I know my ſentence, and am prepared to meet it! You have fixed the halter upon my neck, and at the ſame price would have done ſo to your only ſon! Go, count your accurſed guineas! My life would have been ſafer in the hands of one I had never ſeen, than in yours, whoſe mouth and whoſe eyes for ever ran over with crocodile affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion!</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XV.</head>
                     <p>SAYING this, I left him with ineffable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, unable to utter a word. Jones and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion attended me. It is unneceſſary to repeat all the inſolence of this man. He alternately tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed in the completion of his revenge, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gretted the loſs of the reward to the ſhrivelled old curmudgeon we had juſt quitted, whom however he ſwore he would cheat of it, if he could. He equally regretted the imperfect way in which his ſkill had been cut off; boaſtfully recounting how he had ferreted me thus far, and bitterly lamenting that the whole had not been left to him, which in a day or two he would infallibly have accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed.</p>
                     <p>I paid but little attention to his ſtory. It ſtruck upon my ſenſe, and I was able to recollect it at my neareſt leiſure, though I thought not of it at the time. For the preſent I was buſily employed reflecting on my new ſituation, and the conduct to be obſerved in it. My proſpects were particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly gloomy and diſcouraging. How much labour had I exerted, firſt to extricate myſelf from priſon, and next to evade the diligence of my purſuers; and the reſult of all, after months of anxiety and diligence, was, to be brought back to the point from which I began! I had gained fame indeed, the miſerable fame to have my ſtory bawled forth by hawkers and ballad-mongers, to have my praiſes as an active and ſurpriſing villain celebrated among
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:028752_0391_0FDBDB266DBAF860"/>
footmen and chambermaids; but I was neither an Eroſtratus nor an Alexander, to die contented with that ſpecies of eulogium. With reſpect to all that was ſolid and deſirable, what chance could I aſcribe to new exertions of a ſimilar nature; which, if undertaken at all, muſt be undertaken with infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more unfavourable auſpices?</p>
                     <p>They were conſiderations like theſe that dictated my reſolution. My mind had been gradually weaning from Mr. Falkland, till its feelings roſe to ſomething like abhorrence. I had long cheriſhed a reverence for him, which not even animoſity and perſecution on his part could readily deſtroy. But I now aſcribed a character ſo inhumanly ſanguinary to his mind; I ſaw ſomething ſo fiend-like in the thus hunting me round the world, and determining to be ſatisfied with nothing leſs than my blood, while at the ſame time he knew my innocence, my innoxiouſneſs, nay I might add my virtues; that henceforth I trampled reverence and the recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of former eſteem under my feet. I loſt all regard to his intellectual greatneſs, and all pity for the torture and agonies of his ſoul. I alſo would abjure forbearance. I would ſhow myſelf bitter and inflexible as he had done. Was it wiſe in him to compel me into extremity and madneſs? Had he no fears for his own ſecret and atrocious of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences?</p>
                     <p>I went before the magiſtrates to whoſe office Jones and his comrade conducted me, fully deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to publiſh thoſe aſtoniſhing ſecrets, of which I had hitherto been the faithful depoſitory; and once for all to turn the tables upon my accuſer. It was time that the real criminal ſhould be the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer, and not that innocence ſhould for ever labour under the oppreſſion of guilt. I had been obliged to ſpend the remainder of the night upon which I
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:028752_0392_0FDBDAD760F52628"/>
had been apprehended in priſon. During the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval I had thrown off every veſtige of diſguiſe, and appeared the next morning in my own perſon. I was of courſe eaſily identified; and, this being the whole with which the magiſtrates before whom I now ſtood thought themſelves concerned, they were proceeding to make out an order for my being conducted back to my own county. I ſuſpended the diſpatch of this meaſure by obſerving that I had ſomething to diſcloſe. This is an overture to which men appointed for the adminiſtration of cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal juſtice never fail to attend.</p>
                     <p>I ſaid that I had always proteſted my innocence, and muſt now repeat the proteſt.</p>
                     <p>In that caſe, retorted the ſenior magiſtrate ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly, what can you have to diſcloſe? If you are innocent, that is no buſineſs of ours! We act officially.</p>
                     <p>I always declared, continued I, that I was the perpetrator of no guilt, but that the guilt wholly belonged to my accuſer. He privately conveyed theſe effects among my property, and then charged me with the robbery. I now declare more than that, that this man is a MURDERER, that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected his criminality, and that for that reaſon he is determined to deprive me of life. I preſume, gentlemen, that you do conſider it as your buſineſs to take this declaration. I am perſuaded you will be by no means diſpoſed actively or paſſively to contribute to the atrocious injuſtice under which I ſuffer, to the impriſonment and condemnation of an innocent man in order that a murderer may go free. I ſuppreſſed this ſtory as long as I could. I was extremely averſe to be the author of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs or the death of a human being. But all patience and ſubmiſſion have their limits.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="165" facs="unknown:028752_0393_0FDBDB27EF0E6EB8"/>
Give me leave, ſir, rejoined the magiſtrate with an air of affected moderation, to aſk you two queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Were you any way aiding, abetting, or contributing to this murder?</p>
                     <p>No.</p>
                     <p>And pray, ſir, who is this Mr. Falkland, and what may have been the nature of your connection with him?</p>
                     <p>Mr. Falkland is a gentleman of ſix thouſand per annum. I lived with him as his ſecretary.</p>
                     <p>In other words you were his ſervant?</p>
                     <p>As you pleaſe.</p>
                     <p>Very well, ſir, that is quite enough for me. Firſt I have to tell you as a magiſtrate, that I can have nothing to do with your declaration. If you had been concerned in the murder you talk of, that would alter the caſe. But it is out of all reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble rule for a magtſtrate to take an information from a felon, except againſt his accomplices. Next I think it right to obſerve to you in my own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per perſon, that you appear to me to be the moſt impudent raſcal I ever ſaw. Why, are you ſuch an aſs as to ſuppoſe, that the ſort of ſtory you have been telling, can be of any ſervice to you, either here, or at the aſſizes, or any where elſe? A fine time of it indeed it would be, if, when gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of ſix thouſand a year take up their ſervants for robbing them, thoſe ſervants could trump up ſuch accuſations as theſe, and could get any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate or court of juſtice to liſten to them! Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no the felony with which you ſtand charged would have brought you to the gallows, I will not pretend to ſay. But I am ſure this ſtory will. There would be a ſpeedy end to all order and good government, if fellows that trample upon ranks and diſtinctions in this atrocious ſort, were upon any conſideration ſuffered to get off.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="166" facs="unknown:028752_0394_0FDBDAD9F0943BC8"/>
And do you refuſe, ſir, to attend to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of the charge I alledge?</p>
                     <p>Yes, ſir, I do.—But, if I did not, pray what witneſſes have you of the murder?</p>
                     <p>This queſtion ſtaggered me.</p>
                     <p>None.—But I believe I can make out a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial proof of a nature to force attention from the moſt indifferent hearer.</p>
                     <p>I thought ſo.—Officers, take him from the bar.</p>
                     <p>Such was the ſucceſs of this ultimate reſort on my part, upon which I had built with ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubting confidence. Till now I had conceived that the unfavourable ſituation in which I was placed was prolonged by my own forbearance; and I was determined to endure all that human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture could ſupport, rather than have recourſe to this extreme recrimination. That idea ſecretly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoled me under all my calamities: a voluntary ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice is chearfully made. I regarded myſelf as allied to the army of martyrs and confeſſors; I applauded my own fortitude and ſelf-denial; and I pleaſed myſelf with the idea, that I had the power, though I hoped never to employ it, by an unrelenting diſplay of all my reſources to put an end at once to my ſufferings and perſecutions.</p>
                     <p>And this at laſt was the juſtice of mankind. A man under certain circumſtances ſhall not be heard in the detection of a crime, becauſe he has not been a participator of it! The ſtory of a flagitious mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſhall be liſtened to with indifference, while an innocent man is hunted like a wild beaſt to the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt corners of the earth! Six thouſand a year ſhall protect a man from accuſation; and the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity of an impeachment ſhall be ſuperſeded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the author of it is a ſervant!</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="167" facs="unknown:028752_0395_0FDBDB2E0C754CF0"/>
I was conducted back to the very priſon from which a few months before I had made my eſcape. My proſpects were more gloomy, and my ſituation apparently more irremediable than ever. I was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed again, if that were of any account, to the inſolence and tyranny that are uniformly exerciſed within thoſe walls. Why ſhould I repeat the loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome tale of all that was endured by me, and is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured by every man who is unhappy enough to fall under the government of theſe conſecrated miniſters of national juriſprudence? The ſufferings I had already experienced, my anxieties, my flight, the perpetual expectation of being diſcovered, worſe than the diſcovery itſelf, would perhaps have been enough to ſatisfy the moſt inſenſible individual in the court of his own conſcience, if I had even been the felon I was pretended to be. But the law has neither eyes, nor ears, nor bowels of humanity; and it turns into marble the hearts of all thoſe that are nurſed in its principles.</p>
                     <p>Yet I was not caſt down. I reſolved that, while I had life, I would never deſpair. Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, annihilated I might be; but if I died, I would die reſiſting. What uſe, what advantage, what pleaſurable ſentiment could ariſe from a tame ſurrender? There is no man that is ignorant, that to humble yourſelf at the feet of the law is a bootleſs taſk; in her courts there is no room for amendment and reformation.</p>
                     <p>My fortitude may to ſome perſons appear above the ſtandard of human nature. But, if I draw back the veil from my heart, they will readily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs their miſtake. My heart bled at every pore. My reſolution was not the calm ſentiment of phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy and reaſon. It was a gloomy and deſperate purpoſe; the creature, not of hope, but of a mind auſterely held to its deſign, that thought itſelf ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:028752_0396_0FDBDADBD7961600"/>
with the naked effort, and prepared to give ſucceſs or miſcarriage to the winds. It was to this miſerable condition, which might awaken ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy in the moſt hardened boſom, that Mr. Falk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land had reduced me.</p>
                     <p>I anticipated the event of my trial. I was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined once more to eſcape from my priſon, nor did I doubt of my ability to effect at leaſt this firſt ſtep towards my future preſervation. The aſſizes, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, were near, and there were certain conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, unneceſſary to be detailed, that perſuaded me there might be benefit in waiting till my trial ſhould actually be terminated, before I made my attempt. It ſtood upon the liſt as one of the lateſt to be brought forward. I was therefore extremely ſurpriſed to find it called out of its order early on the morning of the ſecond day. But, if this were unexpected, how much greater was my aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when my proſecutor was called, to find nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mr. Falkland nor Mr. Foreſter, nor a ſingle individual of any deſcription appear againſt me! The recognizances into which my proſecutors had entered were ordered to be forfeited, and I was diſmiſſed without further impediment from the bar.</p>
                     <p>The effect which this incredible reverſe produced upon my mind was as if I had fallen from the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the moſt diſtant planet in the ſyſtem upon our earth in a moment. I, who had come to that bar with the ſentence of death already in idea ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in my ears, to be told that I was free to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſport myſelf whitherſoever I pleaſed! Was it for this that I had broken through ſo many locks, and bolts, and the adamantine walls of my priſon; that I had paſſed ſo many anxious days, and ſleepleſs, ſpectre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haunted nights; that I had racked my invention for expedients of evaſion and concealment; that
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:028752_0397_0FDBDB32979E14E0"/>
my mind had been rouſed to an energy of which I could ſcarcely have believed it capable; that my exiſtence had been enthralled to an ever-living tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſuch as I could hardly have ſuppoſed it in man to endure? Great God! what is man? Is he thus blind to the future, thus totally unſuſpecting of what is to occur in the next moment of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence? I have ſomewhere read that heaven in mercy hides from us the future incidents of our life. My own experience does not well accord with this aſſertion. In this inſtance at leaſt I ſhould have been ſaved from inſupportable labour and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribable anguiſh, could I have foreſeen the cataſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trophe of this moſt intereſting tranſaction.</p>

                     <p>IT was not long before I took my everlaſting leave of this deteſted and miſerable ſcene. My heart was for the preſent too full of aſtoniſhment and exulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this unexpected deliverance, to admit of anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety about the future. I withdrew from the town. I rambled with a ſlow and thoughtful pace, now burſting with exclamation, and now buried in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found and undefinable reverie. Accident led me towards the very heath which had firſt ſheltered me, when upon a former occaſion I broke out of my priſon. I wandered among its cavities and its vallies. It was a forlorn and deſolate ſolitude. I continued here I know not how long. Night at length overtook me unperceived, and I prepared to return for the preſent to the town I had quitted.</p>
                     <p>It was now perfectly dark, when two men whom I had not previouſly obſerved ſprung upon me from behind. They ſeized me by the arms, and threw me upon the ground. I had no time for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance or recollection. I could however perceive that one of them was the diabolical Jones. They blindfolded, gagged me, and hurried me I knew not whither. As we paſſed along in ſilence, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to conjecture what could be the meaning of this extraordinary violence. I was ſtrongly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with the idea that, after the event of this morning, the moſt ſevere and painful part of my hiſtory was paſt; nor could I perſuade myſelf to ſhrink with alarm at this unexpected attack. It
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:028752_0399_0FDBDB341A6942D0"/>
might however be ſome new project ſuggeſted by the brutal unrelenting temper and animoſity of Jones.</p>
                     <p>I preſently found that we were returned into the town I had juſt quitted. They led me into a houſe, and, as ſoon as they had taken poſſeſſion of a room, freed me from the reſtraints they had before im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. Here Jones informed me with a malicious grin, that no harm was intended me, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhould ſhow moſt ſenſe in keeping myſelf quiet. I perceived that we were in an inn; I over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard company in a room at no great diſtance from us, and therefore was myſelf as thoroughly aware as he could be, that there was at preſent little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſtand in fear of any ſpecies of violence, and that it would be time enough to reſiſt, when they attempted to conduct me from the inn in the ſame manner that they had brought me into it. I was not without ſome curioſity to ſee the concluſion that was to follow upon ſo extraordinary a commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>The preliminaries I have deſcribed were ſcarcely completed, before Mr. Falkland entered the room. I remember Collins, when he firſt communicated to me the particulars of our patron's hiſtory, obſerved that he was totally unlike the man he had once been. I had no means of aſcertaining the truth of that obſervation. But it was ſtrikingly applicable to the ſpectacle which now preſented itſelf to my eyes, though, when I laſt beheld this unhappy man, he had been a victim to the ſame paſſions, a prey to the ſame undying remorſe as now. Miſery was at that time inſcribed in legible characters upon his countenance. But now he appeared like nothing that had ever been viſible in human ſhape. His viſage was haggard, emaciated, and fleſhleſs. His complexion was a dun and tarniſhed red, the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour uniform through every region of the face, and
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:028752_0400_0FDBDAE2782C7A58"/>
ſuggeſted the idea of its being burnt and parched by the eternal fire that burned within him. His eyes were red, quick, wandering, full of ſuſpicion and rage. His hair was neglected, ragged, and float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. His whole figure was thin to a degree that ſuggeſted the idea rather of a ſkeleton than a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon actually alive. Life ſeemed hardly to be the capable inhabitant of ſo woe-begone and ghoſt-like a figure. The taper of wholeſome life was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired; but paſſion and fierceneſs and frenzy were able for the preſent to ſupply its place.</p>
                     <p>I was to the utmoſt degree aſtoniſhed and ſhocked at the ſight of him.—He ſternly commanded my conductors to leave the room</p>
                     <p>Well, ſir, I have this day ſucceſsfully exerted myſelf to ſave your life from the gallows. A fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night ago you did what you were able to bring my life to that ignominious cloſe.</p>
                     <p>Were you ſo ſtupid and undiſtinguiſhing as not to know that the preſervation of your life was the uniform object of my exertions? Did not I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain you in priſon? Did not I endeavour to prevent your being ſent thither? Could you miſtake the bigoted and obſtinate conduct of Foreſter in offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a hundred guineas for your apprehenſion for mine?</p>
                     <p>I had my eye-upon you in all your wanderings. You have taken no material ſtep through their whole courſe with which I have not been acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I meditated to do you good. I have ſpilled no blood but that of Tyrrell: that was in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of paſſion, and it has been the ſubject of my uninterrupted and hourly remorſe. I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nived at no man's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ate but that of the Hawkinses: they could no otherwiſe have been ſaved than by acknowledging myſelf a murderer. The reſt of my life has all been ſpent in acts of benevolence. I
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:028752_0401_0FDBDB38EF7E7E38"/>
meditated to do you good. For that reaſon I was willing to prove you. You pretended to act towards me with conſideration and forbearance. If you had perſiſted in that to the end, I would yet have found a way to reward you I left you to your own diſcretion. You might ſhow the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent malignity of your own heart, but in the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances in which you were then placed I knew you could not hurt me. Your forbearance has proved, as I all along ſuſpected, empty and treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous. You have attempted to blaſt my reputation. You have ſought to diſcloſe the ſelect and eternal ſecret of my ſoul. Becauſe you have done that, I will never forgive you. I will remember it to my lateſt breath. The memory ſhall ſurvive me, when my exiſtence is no more. Do you think you are out of the reach of my power, becauſe a court of juſtice has acquitted you?</p>
                     <p>While Mr. Falkland was ſpeaking, a ſudden diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper came over his countenance, his whole frame was ſhaken by an inſtantaneous convulſion, and he ſtaggered to a chair. In about three minutes he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</p>
                     <p>Yes, ſaid he, I am ſtill alive. I ſhall live for days and months and years; the power that made me, of whatever kind it be, can only determine how long. I live the guardian of my reputation. That, and to endure a miſery ſuch as man never endured, are the only ends to which I live. But, when I am no more, my fame ſhall ſtill ſurvive. My character ſhall be revered, as ſpotleſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>impeachable by all poſterity, as long as the name of Falkland ſhall be repeated in the moſt diſtant region of the many-peopled globe.</p>
                     <p>Having ſaid this, he retu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ned to the diſcourſe which more immediately related to my future con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and happineſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="174" facs="unknown:028752_0402_0FDBDAE5EB6490F8"/>
There is one condition, ſaid he, upon which you may obtain ſome mitigation of your future ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity. It is for that purpoſe that I have ſent for you. Liſten to my propoſals with deliberation and ſobriety! Remember, that the inſanity is not leſs to trifle with the reſolved determination of my ſoul, than it would be to pull a mountain upon your head that hung trembling upon the edge of the mighty Appenine!</p>
                     <p>I inſiſt then upon your ſigning a paper declaring in the moſt ſolemn manner that I am innocent of murder, and that the charge you alleged at the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in Bow-ſtreet is falſe, malicious and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. Perhaps you may ſcruple out of a regard to truth. Is truth then entitled to adoration for its own ſake, and not for the ſake of the happineſs it is calculated to produce? Will a reaſonable man ſacrifice to barren truth, when benevolence, huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and every conſideration that is dear to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man heart require that it ſhould be ſuperſeded! It is probable that I may never make uſe of this pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but I require it as the only practicable repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the honour you have aſſailed. This is what I had to propoſe. I expect your anſwer.</p>
                     <p>Sir, anſwered I, I have heard you to an end, and I ſtand in need of no deliberation to enable me to anſwer you in the negative. You took me up a raw and inexperienced boy, capable of being moulded to any form you pleaſed. But you have communicated to me volumes of experience in a very ſhort period. I am no longer irreſolute and pliable. What is the power you retain over my fate I am unable to diſcover. You may deſtroy me; but you cannot make me tremble. I am not concerned to enquire whether what I have ſuffered flowed from you by deſign or otherwiſe, whether you were the author of my miſeries or only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nived
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:028752_0403_0FDBDB3CE7FD4630"/>
at them. This I know, that I have ſuffered too exquiſitely on your account, for me to feel the leaſt remaining claim on your part to my making any voluntary ſacrifice.</p>
                     <p>You ſay that benevolence and humanity require this ſacrifice of me. No. It would only be a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to your mad and miſguided love of fame, to that paſſion which has been the ſource of all your miſeries, of the moſt tragical calamities to others, and of every misfortune that has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to me. I have no forbearance to exerciſe towards that paſſion. If you be not yet cured of this tremendous and ſanguinary folly, at leaſt I will do nothing to cheriſh it. I know not whether from my youth I was deſtined for a hero; but I may thank you for having taught me a leſſon of inſurmountable fortitude.</p>
                     <p>What is it that you require of me? That I ſhould ſign away my own reputation for the better maintaining of yours. Where is the equality of that? What is it that caſts me at ſuch an immenſe diſtance below you, as to make every thing that relates to me wholly unworthy of conſideration? You have been educated in the prejudice of birth. I abhor that prejudice. You have made me deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, and I utter what that deſperation ſuggeſts.</p>
                     <p>You will tell me perhaps that I have no repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to loſe, that, while you are eſteemed fault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and unblemiſhed, I am univerſally reputed a thief, a ſuborner and a calumniator. Be it ſo. I will never do any thing to countenance thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations. The more I am deſtitute of the eſteem of mankind, the more careful I will be to preſerve my own. I will never from fear or any other miſtaken motive do any thing of which I ought to be aſhamed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="176" facs="unknown:028752_0404_0FDBDAEEEB8B3398"/>
You are determined to be for ever my enemy. I have in no degree deſerved this eternal abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. I have always eſteemed and pitied you. For a conſiderable time I rather choſe to expoſe myſelf to every kind of misfortune, than diſcloſe the ſecret that was ſo dear to you. I was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred by your menaces, (What could you make me ſuffer more than I actually ſuffered?) but by the humanity of my own heart; in which, and not in means of violence, you ought to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed your confidence. What is the myſterious vengeance that you can yet execute againſt me? You menaced me before; you can menace no worſe now. You are wearing out the ſprings of terror. Do with me as you pleaſe! You teach me to hear you with an unſhrinking and deſperate firmneſs. Recollect yourſelf! I did not proceed to the act with which you reproach me till I was apparently urged to the very laſt extremity. I am now ſorry that that ſtep was ever adopted. But it ſeemed that I was treated with unrelenting rigour; and, urged to exaſperation by unintermitted ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, I had no time to cool or to deliberate. Even at preſent I cheriſh no vengeance againſt you. All that is reaſonable, all that can really contribute to your ſecurity, I will readily concede; but I will not be driven to an act repugnant to all reaſon, integrity, and juſtice.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Falkland liſtened to me with aſtoniſhment and impatience. He had entertained no previous conception of the firmneſs I diſplayed. Several times he was convulſed with the fury that laboured in his breaſt. Once and again he betrayed an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to interrupt; but he was reſtrained by the collectedneſs of my manner, and perhaps by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be acquainted with the entire ſtate of my mind. Finding that I had concluded, he pauſed
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:028752_0405_0FDBDB3E719D08D8"/>
for a moment; his paſſion ſeemed gradually to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large, till it was no longer capable of controul.</p>
                     <p>It is well! ſaid he, gnaſhing his teeth, and ſtamping upon the ground. You refuſe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition I offer! I have no power to perſuade you to compliance! You defy me! At leaſt I have a power reſpecting you, and that power I will exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe; a power that ſhall grind you into atoms. I condeſcend to no more expoſtulation. I know what I am, and what I can be. I know what you are, and what fate is reſerved for you!</p>
                     <p>Saying this he quitted the room.</p>
                     <p>Such were the particulars of this memorable ſcene. The impreſſion it has left upon my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is indelible. The figure and appearance of Mr. Falkland, his death-like weakneſs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, his more than mortal energy and rage, the words that he ſpoke, the motives that animated him, produced one compounded effect upon my mind that nothing of the ſame nature could ever parallel. The idea of his miſery thrilled through my frame. How weak in compariſon of it is the imaginary hell, which the great enemy of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind is repreſented as carrying every where about with him!</p>
                     <p>From this conſideration my mind preſently turned to the menaces he had vented againſt my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. They were all myſterious and undefined. He had talked of power, but had given no hint from which I could collect in what he imagined it to conſiſt. He had talked of miſery, but had not dropped a ſyllable reſpecting the nature of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery to be inflicted.</p>
                     <p>I ſat ſtill for ſome time ruminating on theſe thoughts. Neither Mr. Falkland, nor any other perſon appeared, to diſturb my meditations. I roſe, went out of the room, and from the inn
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:028752_0406_0FDBDAF1197113A8"/>
into the ſtreet. No one offered to moleſt me. It was ſtrange! What was the nature of this power from which I was to apprehend ſo much, yet which ſeemed to leave me at perfect liberty? I began to imagine that all I had heard from this dreadful adverſary was mere madneſs and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance, that he was at length deprived of the uſe of reaſon, which had long ſerved him only as a medium of torment. Yet was it likely in that caſe that he ſhould be able to employ Jones and his aſſociate, who had juſt been his inſtruments of violence upon my perſon?</p>
                     <p>I proceeded along the ſtreets with conſiderable caution. I looked before me and behind me, as well as the darkneſs would allow me to do, that I might not again be hunted in ſight by ſome man of ſtratagem and violence without my perceiving it. I was not as before beyond the limits of the town, but conſidered the ſtreets, the houſes and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants as affording ſome degree of ſecurity. I was ſtill walking with my mind thus full of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion and forecaſt, when I diſcovered Thomas, that ſervant of Mr. Falkland whom I have already more than once had occaſion to mention. He advanced towards me with an air ſo blunt and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, as inſtantly to remove from me the idea of any thing inſidious in his purpoſe; beſide that I had always felt the character of Thomas, ruſtic and uncultivated as it was, to be entitled to a more than common proportion of eſteem.</p>
                     <p>Thomas, ſaid I, as he advanced, I hope you are willing to give me joy that I am at length delivered from the dreadful danger which for many months haunted me ſo unmercifully.</p>
                     <p>No, rejoined Thomas roughly, I be not at all willing. I do not know what to make of my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:028752_0407_0FDBDB40212ED7B0"/>
in this affair. While you were in priſon in that miſerable faſhion, I felt all at one almoſt as if I loved you: and, now that that is over, and you are turned out looſe in the world to do your worſt, my blood riſes at the very ſight of you. To look at you, you are almoſt that very lad Williams for whom I could with pleaſure as it were have laid down my life; and yet behind that ſmiling face there lie robbery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and lying, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that is ungrateful and murderous Your laſt action was worſe than all the reſt How could you find in your heart to revive that cruel ſtory about Mr. Tyrrel, which every body had agreed out of regard to the ſquire never to mention again, and of which I know and you know he is as innocent as the child unborn? There are cauſes and reaſons, or elſe I could have wiſhed from the bottom of my ſoul never to have ſet eyes on you again!</p>
                     <p>And you ſtill perſiſt in your hard thoughts of me!</p>
                     <p>Worſe! I think worſe of you than ever! Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I thought you as bad as man could be. I wonder from my ſoul what you are to do next. But you make good the old ſaying, When a man is once in—.</p>
                     <p>And ſo there is never to be an end of my mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes. What can Mr. Falkland contrive for me worſe than the ill opinion and enmity of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind?</p>
                     <p>Mr. Falkland contrive! He is the beſt friend you have in the world, though you are the baſeſt trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to him. Poor man! it makes one's heart ache to look at him; he is the very image of grief. And it is not clear to me that it is not all owing to you. At leaſt you have given the finiſhing blow in behalf of the diſeaſethat already had him in its clutches. There have been the devil and all to pay
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:028752_0408_0FDBDAF65373CC20"/>
between him and ſquire Foreſter. The ſquire is right raving mad with my maſter, for having out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witted him in the matter of the trial, and ſaved your life. He ſwears that you ſhall be taken up and tried all over again at the next aſſizes; but my maſter is ſo reſolute, that I believe he will carry it his own way. To ſee him ordering every thing for your benefit, and taking all your maliciouſneſs as mild and innocent as a lamb, and then to think of your vile proceedings againſt him, is a ſight one ſhall not ſee again, if one was to go all the world over. For God's ſake, repent of your reprobate doings, and make what little reparation is in your power! Think of your poor ſoul, before you awake, as to be ſure one of theſe days you will, in fire and brimſtone everlaſting!</p>
                     <p>Saying this, he held out his hand, and took hold of mine. The action ſeemed ſtrange, but I at firſt thought of it as the unpremeditated reſult of his ſolemn and well-intended adjuration. I felt however that he put ſomething into my hand. The next moment he quitted his hold, and haſtened from me with the ſwiftneſs of an arrow. What he had thus given me was a bank-note of twenty pounds. I had no doubt that he had been charged to deliver it to me from Mr. Falkland.</p>
                     <p>What was I to infer? What light did it throw upon the intentions of my inexorable perſecutor? His animoſity againſt me was as great as ever; that I had juſt had confirmed to me from his own mouth. Yet his animoſity appeared to be ſtill tempered with the remains of humanity. He preſcribed to it a line wide enough to embrace the gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his views, and within the boundaries of that line it ſtopped. But this diſcovery carried no conſolation to my mind. I knew not what portion of calamity I was fated to endure, before his jealouſy
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:028752_0409_0FDBDB46AFA4A3D8"/>
of diſhonour and inordinate thirſt of fame would deem themſelves ſatisfied.</p>
                     <p>Another queſtion offered itſelf. Was I to receive the money which had juſt been put into my hands? the money of a man, who had inflicted upon me injuries, leſs than thoſe which he had entailed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf, but the greateſt that one man can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict upon another? who had blaſted my youth, who had deſtroyed my peace, who had held me up to the abhorrence of mankind, and rendered me an outcaſt upon the face of the earth? who had forged of me the baſeſt and moſt atrocious falſeſhoods, and urged them with a ſeriouſneſs and perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance which produced univerſal belief? who an hour before had vowed againſt me inexorable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and ſworn to entail upon me miſery without end? Would not this conduct on my part betray a baſe and abject ſpirit, that crouched under tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and kiſſed the hands that were embrued in my blood?</p>
                     <p>If theſe reaſons appeared ſtrong, neither was the other ſide without reaſons in reply. I wanted the money: not for any purpoſe of vice or ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity, but for thoſe purpoſes without which life cannot ſubſiſt. Man ought to be able, wherever placed, to find for himſelf the means of exiſtence: but I was to open a new ſcene of life, to remove to ſome diſtant ſpot, to be prepared againſt the ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will of mankind, and the unexplored projects of hoſtility of a moſt accompliſhed foe. The actual means of exiſtence are the property of all. What ſhould hinder me from taking that of which I was really in want, when in taking it I riſked no ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance and perpetrated no violence? The property in queſtion will be beneficial to me, and the volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary ſurrender of it is accompanied with no injury to its late proprietor; what other condition can be
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:028752_0410_0FDBDAFA2D223EB8"/>
neceſſary to render the uſe of it on my part a duty? He that lately poſſeſſed it has injured me; does that alter its value as a medium of exchange? He will boaſt perhaps of the imaginary obligation he has conferred on me: Surely to ſhrink from a thing in itſelf right, from any ſuch apprehenſion, can be the reſult only of puſillanimity and cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice.</p>

                     <p>INFLUENCED by theſe reaſonings, I determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to retain what had thus been put into my hands. My next care was in regard to the ſcene I ſhould chooſe as the retreat of that life which I had juſt ſaved from the graſp of the executioner. The danger to which I was expoſed of forcible interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in my purſuits was probably in ſome reſpects leſs now, than it had been previouſly to this criſis. Beſide, that I was conſiderably influenced in this deliberation by the ſtrong loathing I conceived for the ſituations in which I had lately been engaged. I knew not in what mode Mr. Falkland intended to exerciſe his vengeance againſt me; but I was ſeized with ſo unconquerable an averſion to diſguiſe and the idea of ſpending my life in the perſonating a fictitious character, that I could not for the preſent at leaſt reconcile my mind to any thing of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The ſame kind of diſguſt I had conceived for the metropolis, where I had ſpent ſo many hours of artifice and terror. I therefore decided in favour of the project which had formerly prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amuſing to my imagination, of withdrawing to ſome diſtant, rural ſcene, a ſcene of calmneſs and obſcurity, where for a few years at leaſt, perhaps during the life of Mr. Falkland, I might be hidden from the world, recover the wounds my mind had received in this fatal connexion, metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe and improve the experience which had been accumulated, cultivate the faculties I in any degree poſſeſſed, and employ the intervals of theſe occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:028752_0412_0FDBDAFF422D28D0"/>
in ſimple induſtry and the intercourſe of guileleſs, uneducated, kind-intentioned minds. The menaces of my perſecutor ſeemed to forebode the inevitable interruption of this ſyſtem. But I deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it wiſe to put theſe menaces out of my conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. I compared them to death, which muſt infallibly overtake us, we know not when; but the poſſibility of whoſe arrival next year, next week, to-morrow, muſt be left out of the calculation of him who would enter upon any important or well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerted undertaking.</p>
                     <p>Such were the ideas that determined my choice. Thus did my youthful mind delineate the ſyſtem of diſtant years, even when the threats of inſtant calamity ſtill ſounded in my ears. I was inured to the apprehenſion of miſchief, till at laſt the hoarſe roarings of the beginning tempeſt had no power to diſturb my tranquillity. I however thought it neceſſary, while I was apparently with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſphere of the enemy, to exert every practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable degree of vigilance. I was careful not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur the hazards of darkneſs and ſolitude. When I left the town, it was with the ſtage-coach, an obvious ſource of protection againſt glaring and enormous violence. Meanwhile I found myſelf no more expoſed to moleſtation in my progreſs, than the man in the world who ſhould have had the leaſt reaſon for apprehenſions of this nature. As the diſtance increaſed, I relaxed ſomething in my precaution, though ſtill awake to a ſenſe of danger, and conſtantly purſued with the image of my foe. I fixed upon an obſcure market-town in Wales as the choſen ſeat of my operations. This place re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended itſelf to my obſervation, as I was wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering in queſt of an abode. It was clean, chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and of great ſimplicity of appearance. It was at a diſtance from any public and frequented road,
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:028752_0413_0FDBDB4830C81538"/>
and had nothing which could deſerve the name of trade. The face of nature around it was agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably diverſified, being partly wild and romantic, and partly rich and abundant in production.</p>
                     <p>Here I ſolicited employment in two profeſſions; the firſt that of a watch-maker, in which though the inſtructions I had received were but few, they were eked out and aſſiſted by a mind fruitful in mechanical invention; the other that of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructor in mathematics and its practical applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, geography, aſtronomy, land-ſurveying and navigation. Neither of theſe was a very copious ſource of emolument in the obſcure retreat I had choſen for myſelf: but, if my receipts were ſlender, my diſburſements were ſtill fewer. In this little town I became acquainted with the vicar, the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary, the lawyer, and the reſt of the perſons who time out of mind had been regarded as the top gentry of the place. Each of theſe centred in himſelf a variety of occupations. There was little in the appearance of the vicar that reminded you of his profeſſion except on the recurring Sunday. At other times he condeſcended with his evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical hand to guide the plough, or to drive the cows from the field to the farm-yard for the milk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The apothecary occaſionally officiated as a barber, and the lawyer was the village ſchool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter.</p>
                     <p>By all theſe perſons I was received with kindneſs and hoſpitality. Among people thus remote from the buſtle of human life there is an open ſpirit of confidence, by means of which, a ſtranger eaſily finds acceſs to their benevolence and good-will. My manners had never been greatly debauched, by the ſcenes through which I had paſſed, from the ſimplicity of rural life; and the hardſhips I had endured gave additional mildneſs to my character.
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:028752_0414_0FDBDB0268CAC790"/>
In the theatre upon which I was now placed I had no rival. My mechanical occupation had hitherto been a non-reſident; and the ſchoolmaſter, who did not aſpire to the ſublime heights of ſcience I profeſſed to diſcover, was very willing to admit me as a partner in the taſk of civilizing the unpoliſhed manners of the inhabitants. For the parſon, civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſation was no part of his trade; his buſineſs was with the things of a better life, not with the carnal concerns of this material ſcene; in truth, his thoughts were principally occupied with his oat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meal and his cows.</p>
                     <p>This ſcene had perhaps a more powerful handle upon my affections, than it would have had upon thoſe of almoſt any other perſon with my degree of intellectual cultivation. I had had a profound experience, though a ſhort one, of ſociety ſuch as ranks and regulations have conſtituted it. The ſimple ſcene of which I was now an inmate, the abode of groſs and unſuſpecting ignorance, bore a kind of rude reſemblance to that ſimplicity which ſeems to be the goal of elevated and comprehenſive reaſon. I bore with its groſſneſs, the narrowneſs of its proſpects and the uniformity of its impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, in behalf of its freedom from malignity and deceit. How long I ſhould have ſat down contented with theſe defects in conſideration of theſe advantages I am unable to pronounce. For the preſent, ſore with perſecution and diſtreſs, and bleeding at almoſt every vein, there was nothing I ſo much coveted as reſt and tranquillity. It ſeemed as if my faculties were, at leaſt for the time, exhauſted by the late preternatural and vice-derived intenſity of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions, and that they ſtood indiſpenſably in need of a period of comparative ſuſpenſion.</p>
                     <p>In this ſtate, ſo grateful to my feelings, week after week glided away without interruption and alarm. Every day contributed to my progreſs in
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:028752_0415_0FDBDB4D86A61E30"/>
the eſteem of my guileleſs neighbours. At firſt they looked upon me with wonder as a ſort of non deſcript; but they were pleaſed to find upon farther acquaintance that I fell in for the moſt part with their habits and manners; and that, though I was able, if ſolicited, to inform them upon ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects extremely remote from their uſual occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, yet my ſuperior knowledge gave me no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to dictate or domineer. The peculiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in which I differed from them generated no averſion. My habits were more ſolitary and ſeden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary than thoſe of any of my neighbours: but I ſtate the ſimple and unornamented fact when I affirm, that my univerſal character among them was that of a perſon of great learning and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, mild, even-tempered, and that would not hurt ſo much as a worm.</p>
                     <p>Thus tranquil, there were moments in which I even forgot there was ſuch a perſon as Mr. Falk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land in the world. The ſituation in which I was now placed was not very different from that in which I had ſpent my earlier years; and I began to look back upon the intervening period as upon a diſtempered and tormenting dream; or rather per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps my feelings were like thoſe of a man reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from ſix months raging delirium, from ideas of horror, confuſion, ſlight, perſecution, agony and deſpair! When I recollected what I had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone, it was not without ſome ſatisfaction as the recollection of a thing that was paſt; every day augmented my hope that it was never to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. Surely the dark and terrific menaces of Mr. Falkland were rather the perturbed ſuggeſtions of his angry mind, than the final reſult of a delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and digeſted ſyſtem! How happy ſhould I feel beyond what ordinarily falls to the lot of man, if, after the terrors and alarms I had undergone, I
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:028752_0416_0FDBDB074CFBFD68"/>
found myſelf thus unexpectedly reſtored to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities of a human being!</p>
                     <p>While I was thus ſoothing my mind with fond imaginations, it happened that a few bricklayers and their labourers came over from a diſtance of five or ſix miles, to work upon ſome additions to one of the better ſort of houſes in the town which had changed its tenant. No incident could be more trivial than this, had it not been for a ſtrange coincidence of time between this circumſtance and a change which introduced itſelf into my ſituation. This firſt manifeſted itſelf in a ſort of ſhyneſs with which I was treated firſt by one perſon and then another of my new-formed acquaintance. They were backward to enter into converſation with me, and anſwered my enquiries with an aukward and embarraſſed air. When they met me in the ſtreet or the field, their countenance contracted a cloud, and they endeavoured to ſhun me. My ſcholars quitted me one after another, and I had no longer any employment in my mechanical profeſſion. It is impoſſible to deſcribe the ſenſations which the gradual, but uninterrupted progreſs of this revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion produced in my mind. It ſeemed as if I had ſome contagious diſeaſe, from which every man ſhrunk with alarm, and left me to periſh unaſſiſted and alone. I aſked one man and another to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain to me the meaning of theſe appearances; but every one avoided the taſk, and anſwered in an evaſive and ambiguous manner. I ſometimes ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that it was all a deluſion of the imagination; till the repetition of the ſenſation, and ſtill more the decay of my projected modes of ſubſiſtence, brought the reality too painfully home to my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion. There are few things that give a greater ſhock to the mind than a phenomenon in the conduct of our fellow men, of great import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:028752_0417_0FDBDB4FAB836B68"/>
to our concerns, and for which we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to aſſign any plauſible reaſon. I was like a tree ſtruck with ſome fatal blight, from which one branch falls off after another, and leaves the naked trunk a monument of calamity and ſcorn. Inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of aſſigning the cauſe of my diſgrace, I was at times half inclined to believe that the change was not in other men, but that ſome alienation of my own underſtanding generated the horrid viſion. I endeavoured to awake from my dream, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to my former ſtate of enjoyment and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but in vain. To the ſame conſideration it may be aſcribed, that unacquainted with the ſource of the evil, obſerving its perpetual increaſe, and finding it ſo far as I could perceive entirely arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary in its nature, I was unable to aſcertain its limits, or the degree in which it would finally overwhelm me.</p>
                     <p>In the midſt however of the wonderful and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly inexplicable nature of this ſcene, there was one idea that inſtantly intruded itſelf, and that I could never after baniſh from my mind. It is Falkland! In vain I ſtruggled againſt the ſeeming improbability of the ſuppoſition. In vain I ſaid, Mr. Falkland, wiſe as he is and pregnant in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources, acts by human and not by ſupernatural means. He may overtake me by ſurpriſe and in a manner of which I have no previous expectation; but he cannot produce a great and notorious effect without ſome viſible agency, however difficult it may be to trace that agency, to its abſolute author. He cannot, like thoſe inviſible perſonages who are ſuppoſed from time to time to interfere in human affairs, ride in the whirlwind, ſhroud himſelf in clouds and impenetrable darkneſs, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction upon the earth from his ſecret habitation. Thus it was that I bribed my imagination, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to perſuade myſelf that my preſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:028752_0418_0FDBDB092CB54060"/>
originated in a different ſource from my former. All evils appeared trivial to me, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of the recollection and perpetuation of my parent misfortune. I was little better than diſtracted between the incoherence of my ideas as to my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſituation excluding from it the machinations of Mr. Falkland, and the horror I conceived at the bare poſſibility of again encountering his animoſity, after a ſuſpenſion of many weeks, a ſuſpenſion as I had hoped for ever. An interval of weeks was an age to a perſon in the calamitous ſituation I had ſo long experienced. But, in ſpite of all my efforts, I could not baniſh from my mind the dreadful idea. My original conceptions of the genius and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance of Mr. Falkland had been ſuch, that I could with difficulty think that any thing was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to him. I knew not how to ſet up my own opinions of material cauſes and the powers of the human mind as the limits of exiſtence. Mr. Falk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land had always been to my imagination an object of wonder, and that which excites our wonder we ſcarcely ever ſuppoſe ourſelves competent to ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyſe.</p>
                     <p>I was in this ſtate of mind, and had already been compelled by the ſituation of my affairs to meditate the removing myſelf to a different reſidence, when a new circumſtance occurred, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> tended in part to diſſipate the miſt which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> over my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. In reality, nothing at this time appeared more neceſſary to me than information. Without ſome conception of the cauſe of my preſent mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune I could not tell whither to remove, nor what precautions my intereſt obliged me to adopt. I was ſaved by the incident to which I allude <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>I returned one evening from a pedeſtrian <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>. It is probable that my return was ſomewhat ſooner than was uſual with
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:028752_0419_0FDBDB535C6B7B70"/>
me upon ſimilar occaſions. Be that as it will, I found upon entering the houſe an apartment of which I occupied, that it was totally deſerted of its uſual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants. The woman and her children were gone out to enjoy the freſhneſs of the breeze. The huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band was engaged in his uſual without-door occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations. I opened for myſelf, and went into the kitchen of the family. Here, as I looked round, my eyes accidentally glanced upon a paper lying in one corner, which by ſome aſſociation I was unable to explain, rouſed in me a ſtrong ſenſation of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion and curioſity. I eagerly went towards it, caught it up, and found it to be the very paper of the Wonderful and Surpriſing Hiſtory of Caleb Williams, the diſcovery of which towards the cloſe of my reſidence in London had produced in me ſuch exquiſite pain.</p>
                     <p>This diſcovery at once cleared up all the myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery that had hung upon my late tranſactions. Abhorred and intolerable certainty ſucceeded to the doubts which had haunted my mind. It ſtruck me with the rapidity and irreſiſtible effect of lightning. I was like a man blaſted, his head bare and expoſed to the fury of the elements.</p>
                     <p>Was there no hope that remained to me? Was acquittal uſeleſs? Was there no period, paſt or in proſpect, that could give relief to my ſufferings? Was the odious and atrocious falſhood that had been invented againſt me deſtined to follow me wherever I went, to ſtrip me of character, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive me of the ſympathy and good will of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, to wreſt from me the very bread by which life muſt be ſuſtained?</p>
                     <p>For the ſpace perhaps of half an hour the agony I felt, from this termination to my late tranquillity, and the expectation it excited of that enmity which would follow me through every retreat, was
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:028752_0420_0FDBDB0C1B4FCA70"/>
ſo great as to bereave me of all conſiſtent thinking and of the power of coming to any reſolution. As ſoon as this hurricane of the mind ſubſided, and the winds that impelled me this way and that were ſtill, one ſtiff and maſter gale took its turn of aſcendancy, and drove me to an inſtant deſertion of this once-cheriſhed retreat. I had no patience to enter into remonſtrance and explanation with the uninſtructed inhabitants of my preſent reſidence. I had ſeen too much of the reign of triumphant falſhood to have that ſanguine confidence in the effects of my innocence, which would have ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted itſelf to the mind of any other perſon of my propenſities and my age. I could not endure the thought of oppoſing the venom that was thus ſcattered againſt me, in detail and through its mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuter particles. If ever it ſhould be neceſſary for me to encounter it, if I were purſued like a wild beaſt till I could no longer avoid turning upon my hunters, I would then turn upon the true author of this unprincipled attack. I would encounter the calumny in its ſtrong hold, I would rouſe myſelf to an exertion hitherto uneſſayed, and, by the firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, intrepidity and unalterable conſtancy I ſhould diſplay, would yet compel mankind to believe that Mr. Falkland was a ſuborner and a murderer.</p>

                     <p>I HASTEN to the concluſion of my melancholy ſtory. I began to write ſoon after the period to which I have now conducted it. It has ſerved me as a ſource of avocation for ſeveral years. For ſome time I had a melancholy conſolation in writing. I was better pleaſed to repaſs in my mind the particulars of calamities that had formerly afflicted me, than to look forward, as at other times I was too apt to do, to thoſe by which I might hereafter be overtaken. I conceived that my ſtory faithfully digeſted would carry in it an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of truth that ſew men would be able to reſiſt; or at worſt that, by leaving it behind me when! ſhould no longer continue to exiſt, poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity might be induced to do me juſtice, and, ſeeing in my example what ſort of evils are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> upon mankind by ſociety as it is at preſent conſtituted, might be inclined to turn their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the fountain from which ſuch bitter waters have been accuſtomed to flow. But theſe motives have diminiſhed in their influence. I have contracted ſomething too like a loathing for life and all its appendages. Writing, which was at firſt a pleaſure, is changed into a burthen. I ſhall compreſs into a ſmall compaſs what yet remains to be told.</p>
                     <p>I found out not long after the period of which I am ſpeaking the preciſe cauſe of the myſterious reverſe I had experienced in my reſidence in Wales, and included in that cauſe what it was I
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:028752_0422_0FDBDB0CE7E55930"/>
had to look for in my future adventures. Mr. Falkland had taken the infernal Jones into his pay, a man in three reſpects moſt critically qualified for the ſervice in which he was now engaged; by the unfeeling brutality of his temper, by the habits of his mind at once audacious and artful, and by the peculiar animoſity and vengeance he had conceived againſt me. The employment to which this man was hired was that of following me from place to place for the purpoſe of blaſting my reputation, and preventing me from the chance, by continuing long in one reſidence, of acquiring a character of integrity that might give new weight to any accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation I might at a future time be induced to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer. He had come to the ſeat of my reſidence with the bricklayers and labourers I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; and, while he took care to keep out of ſight ſo far as related to me, was induſtrious in diſſeminating that which in the eye of the world ſeemed to amount to a demonſtration of the profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy and deteſtableneſs of my character. It was, no doubt, from him that the deteſted ſcroll had been procured, which I had found in my habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion immediately prior to my quitting it. In all this Mr. Falkland, reaſoning upon his principles, was only employing a neceſſary precaution. There was ſomething in the temper of his mind that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed him with averſion to the idea of violently putting an end to my exiſtence; at the ſame time that unfortunately he could never deem himſelf ſufficiently ſecured againſt my recrimination, ſo long as I remained alive. As to the fact of Jones being retained by him for this tremendous purpoſe, he by no means deſired that it ſhould become gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally known; but then neither did he look upon the poſſibility of its being known with terror. It was already too notorious for his wiſhes, that I had
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:028752_0423_0FDBDB58E73EAD38"/>
advanced the moſt odious charges againſt him. If he regarded me with abhorrence as the great adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary of his fame, thoſe perſons who had had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to be at all acquainted with our hiſtory, did not entertain leſs abhorrence againſt me for my own ſake. If they knew all the pains he exerted in cauſing my evil reputation to follow me, they would conſider it as an act of impartial juſtice, perhaps as a generous anxiety to prevent other men from being impoſed upon and injured, as he had been.</p>
                     <p>What expedient was I to employ for the purpoſe of counteracting the meditated and barbarous pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which was thus deſtined in all changes of ſcene to deprive me of the benefits and conſolations of human ſociety? There was one expedient againſt which I was abſolutely determined, diſguiſe. I had experienced ſo many mortifications and ſuch intolerable reſtraint when I had formerly had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to it, it was aſſociated in my underſtanding with ſenſations of ſuch acute anguiſh, that my mind was thus far entirely convinced: Life was not worth purchaſing at ſo high a price! But, though in this reſpect I was wholly reſolved, there was another point that did not appear to me ſo material, and in which therefore I was willing to accommodate my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to circumſtances. I was contented, if that would inſure my peace, to ſubmit to the otherwiſe unmanly expedient of paſſing by a different name.</p>
                     <p>But the change of my name, the abruptneſs with which I removed from place to place, the remote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and the obſcurity which I propoſed to myſelf in the choice of my abode, were all inſufficient to elude the ſagacity of Jones, or the unrelenting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy with which Mr. Falkland incited my tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentor to purſue me. Whitherſoever I removed myſelf, it was not long before I had occaſion to
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:028752_0424_0FDBDB0D8F251EF8"/>
perceive this deteſted adverſary in my rear. No words can enable me to d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> juſtice to the ſenſations which this circumſtance produced in me. It was like what has been deſcribed of the eye of Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience purſuing the guilty ſinner, and darting a ray that awakens him to new ſenſibility, at every moment when otherwiſe exhauſted nature would lull him into a temporary oblivio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> of the reproaches of his conſcience. Sleep fled from my eyes. No walls could hide me from the diſcernment of this hated foe. Every where his induſtry was unwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to create for me new diſtreſs. Reſt I had none: relief I had none: never could I count upon an inſtant's ſecurity: never could I wrap myſelf for a moment in the ſhroud of oblivion. The mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes in which I did not actually perceive him, were contaminated and blaſted with the certain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of his ſpeedy interference. In my firſt retreat I had paſſed ſome weeks of deluſive tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity, but never after was I happy enough to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſo much as that ſhadowy gratification. I ſpent ſome years in this dreadful viciſſitude of pain. My ſenſations at certain periods partook of inſanity.</p>
                     <p>It has already appeared that I was not of a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to endure calamity without endeavouring by every means I could deviſe to delude and diſarm it. Recollecting, as I was habituated to do, the various projects by which my ſituation could be meliorated, the queſtion in one inſtance occurred to me: Why ſhould I be haraſſed by the purſuit of this Jones; why, man to man, may I not by the powers of my mind attain the aſcendancy over him? at preſent he appears to be the perſecutor and I the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: is not this difference the mere creature of the imagination? May I not employ my ingenuity to vex him with difficulties and laugh at the endleſs labour to which he will be condemned?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="197" facs="unknown:028752_0425_0FDBDB5AE962C5B8"/>
Alas, this is a ſpeculation for a mind at eaſe! It is not the perſecution; but the cataſtrophe which is annexed to it, that makes the difference between the tyrant and the ſufferer! In mere corporal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion the hunter perhaps is upon a level with the miſerable animal he purſues! But could it be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by either of us, that at every ſtage Jones was to gratify his malignant paſſions by diſſeminating charges of the moſt infamous nature and exciting againſt me the abhorrence of every honeſt boſom, while I was to ſuſtain the ſtill repeated annihilation of my peace, my character and my bread? Could I by any refinement of my reaſon convert this dreadful ſeries into ſport? I had no philoſophy that qualified me for ſo extraordinary an effort. If under other circumſtances I could even have entertained ſo ſtrange an imagination, I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained in the preſent inſtance by the neceſſity of providing for myſelf the means of ſubſiſtence, and the fetters which through that neceſſity the forms of human ſociety impoſed upon my exertions.</p>
                     <p>In one of thoſe changes of reſidence to which my miſerable fate repeatedly compelled me, I met, upon a road which I was obliged to traverſe, the friend of my youth, my earlieſt and beſt beloved friend, the venerable Collins. It was one of thoſe misfortunes which ſerved to accumulate my diſtreſs, that this man had quitted the iſland of Great Britain only a very few weeks before that fatal reverſe of fortune which had ever ſince pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued me with unrelenting eagerneſs. Mr. Falk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, in addition to the large eſtate he poſſeſſed in England, had a very valuable plantation in the Weſt Indies. This property had been greatly miſmanaged by the perſon who had the direction of it on the ſpot; and, after various promiſes and evaſions on his part, which, however they might

ſerve to beguile the patience of Mr. Falkland, had been attended with no ſalutary fruits, it was reſolved that Mr. Collins ſhould go over in perſon to rectify the abuſes which had ſo long prevailed. There had even been ſome idea of his reſiding ſeveral years, if not ſettling finally, upon the plantation. From that hour to the preſent I had never received the ſmalleſt intelligence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting him.</p>
                     <p>I had always conſidered the circumſtance of his critical abſence as one of my ſevereſt mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes. Mr. Collins had been one of the firſt perſons even in the period of my infancy to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive hopes of me as of ſomething above the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſtandard, and had contributed more than any other to encourage and aſſiſt my juvenile ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. He had been the executor of the little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of my father, who had fixed upon him for that purpoſe in conſideration of the mutual affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that exiſted between us; and I ſeemed on every account to have more claim upon his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection than upon that of any other human being. I had always believed that, had he been preſent in the criſis of my fortune, he would have felt conviction of my innocence; and, convinced him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, would by means of the venerableneſs and energy of his character have interpoſed ſo effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, as to have ſaved me the greater part of my ſubſequent misfortunes.</p>
                     <p>No ſight therefore could give me a purer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light than that which now preſented itſelf to my eyes. It was ſome time however before either of us recogniſed the perſon of the other. Mr. Collins looked at leaſt ten years older than he had none when I laſt ſaw him, in addition to which he was in his preſent appearance pale, ſickly and thin. Theſe unfavourable effects had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:028752_0427_0FDBDB5FCFC4B670"/>
by the change of climate, particularly try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to perſons in an advanced period of life. Add to which, I ſuppoſed him to be at that moment in the Weſt Indies. I was probably as much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in the period that had elapſed as he had been. I was the firſt to recollect him. He was on horſeback; I on foot. I had ſuffered him to paſs me. In a moment the full idea of who he was ruſhed upon my mind: I ran; I called with an impetuous voice; I was unable to reſtrain the vehemence of my emotions.</p>
                     <p>The ardour of my feelings diſguiſed my uſual tone of ſpeaking, which otherwiſe Mr. Collins would infallibly have recogniſed. His ſight was already dim; he pulled up his horſe till I ſhould overtake him; and then ſaid, Who are you? I do not know you.</p>
                     <p>My father! exclaimed I, embracing one of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nees with fervour and delight, I am your ſon! once your little Caleb, whom you a thouſand times loaded with your kindneſs!</p>
                     <p>The unexpected repetition of my name gave a kind of ſhuddering emotion to my friend, which was however checked by his age, and the calm and benevolent philoſophy that formed one of the moſt conſpicuous of his habits.</p>
                     <p>I did not expect to ſee you! replied he.—I did not wiſh it!</p>
                     <p>My beſt, my oldeſt friend! anſwered I, reſpect blending itſelf with my impatience, Do not ſay ſo! I have not a friend any where in the whole world, but you! In you at leaſt let me find ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy and reciprocal affection! If you knew how anxiouſly I have thought of you during the whole period of your abſence, you would not thus griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly diſappoint me in your return.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="200" facs="unknown:028752_0428_0FDBDB8A2AD3B6F0"/>
How is it, ſaid Mr. Collins gravely, that you have been reduced to this forlorn condition? Was it not the inevitable conſequence of your own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?</p>
                     <p>The actions of others, not mine! Does not your heart tell you that I am innocent?</p>
                     <p>No. My obſervation of your early character taught me that you would be extraordinary. But unhappily all extraordinary men are not good men; that ſeems to be a lottery, dependent on circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances apparently the moſt trivial.</p>
                     <p>Will you hear my juſtification? I am as ſure as I am of my exiſtence that I can convince you of my purity.</p>
                     <p>Certainly, if you wiſh it, I will hear you. But that muſt not be juſt now. I could have been glad to decline it wholly. At my age I am not fit for the ſtorm, and I am not ſo ſanguine as you in my expectation of the reſult. Of what would you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince me? That Mr. Falkland is a ſuborner and a murderer?</p>
                     <p>I made no anſwer. My ſilence was an affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to this queſtion.</p>
                     <p>And what benefit will reſult from this convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? I have known you a promiſing boy, whoſe character might turn to one ſide or the other as events ſhould decide. I have known Mr. Falkland in his maturer years, and have always admired him as the living model of liberality and goodneſs. If you could change all my ideas, and ſhow me that there was no criterion by which vice might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented from being miſtaken for virtue, what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit would ariſe from that? I muſt part with all my interior conſolation, and all my external con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections. And for what? What is it you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe? The death of Mr. Falkland by the hands of the hangman?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="201" facs="unknown:028752_0429_0FDBD88669F30B50"/>
No. I will not hurt a hair of his head, unleſs compelled to it by a principle of defence. But ſurely you owe me juſtice?</p>
                     <p>What juſtice? The juſtice of proclaiming your innocence? You know what conſequences are annexed to that. But I do not believe I ſhall find you innocent. If you even ſucceed in perplexing my underſtanding, you will not ſucceed in enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening it. Such is the ſtate of mankind, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence when involved in circumſtances of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion can ſcarcely ever make out a demonſtration of its purity, and guilt can often make us feel an inſurmountable reluctance to the pronouncing it guilt. Meanwhile for the purchaſe of this uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty I muſt ſacrifice all the remaining comforts of my life. I believe Mr. Falkland to be virtuous, but I know him to be prejudiced. He would never forgive me even this accidental parley, if by any means he ſhould come to be acquainted with it.</p>
                     <p>Oh, argue not the conſequences that are poſſible to reſult! anſwered I impatiently. I have a right to your kindneſs; I have a right to your aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance!</p>
                     <p>You have them. You have them to a certain degree; and it is not likely by any proceſs of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination you can have them entire. You know my habits of thinking. I regard you as vicious; but I do not conſider the vicious as proper objects of indignation and ſcorn. I conſider you as a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine: you are not conſtituted, I am afraid, to be greatly uſeful to your fellow men; but you did not make yourſelf; you are juſt what circumſtances irreſiſtibly compelled you to be. I am ſorry for your ill properties; but I entertain no enmity againſt you, nothing but benevolence. Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you in the light in which I at preſent conſider you, I am ready to contribute every thing in my
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:028752_0430_0FDBD887EDDADC70"/>
power to your real advantage, and would gladly aſſiſt you, if I knew how, in detecting and extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating the errors that have miſled you. You have diſappointed me, but I have no reproaches to utter: it is more neceſſary for me to feel compaſſion for you, than that I ſhould accumulate your misfortune by my cenſures.</p>
                     <p>What could I ſay to ſuch a man as this? Amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, incomparable man! Never was my mind more painfully divided than at that moment. The more he excited my admiration, the more imperiouſly did my heart command me, whatever were the price it ſhould coſt, to extort his friendſhip. I was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that ſevere duty required of him, that he ſhould reject all perſonal conſiderations, that he ſhould proceed reſolutely to the inveſtigation of the truth, and that, if he found the reſult terminating in my favour, he ſhould reſign all his advantages, and, deſerted as I was by the world, make a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cauſe, and endeavour to compenſate the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral injuſtice. But was it for me to force this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct upon him, if, now in his declining years, his own fortitude ſhrunk from it? Alas, neither he nor I foreſaw the dreadful cataſtrophe that was ſo cloſely impending! Otherwiſe I am well aſſured, that no tenderneſs for his remaining tranquillity would have withheld him from a compliance with my wiſhes! On the other hand, could I pretend to know what evils might reſult to him from his declaring himſelf my advocate? Might not his integrity be brow-beaten and defeated as mine had been? Did the imbecility of his grey hairs afford no advantage to my terrible adverſary in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt? Might not Mr. Falkland reduce him to a condition as wretched and low as mine? After all, was it not vice in me to deſire to involve an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other man as my champion? If he could protect
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:028752_0431_0FDBD88FF8D90638"/>
me, had I not yet energy and wiſdom and conſcious purity enough to protect myſelf?</p>
                     <p>Influenced by theſe conſiderations, I aſſented to his views. I aſſented to be thought hardly of by the man in the world whoſe eſteem I moſt ardently deſired, rather than involve him in poſſible cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. I aſſented to the reſigning what appeared to me at that moment as the laſt practicable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of my life, a comfort upon the thought of which, while I ſurrendered it, my mind dwelt with undeſcribable longings. Mr. Collins was deeply affected with the apparent ingenuouſneſs with which I expreſſed my feelings. The ſecret ſtruggle of his mind was, Can this be hypocriſy? The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual with whom I am conferring, if virtuous, is one of the moſt diſintereſtedly virtuous perſons in the world. We tore ourſelves from each other. Mr. Collins promiſed, as far as he was able, to have an eye upon my viciſſitudes, and to aſſiſt me in every reſpect that was at all conſiſtent with a juſt recollection of conſequences. Thus I parted as it were with my right arm; and voluntarily conſented, thus maimed and forlorn, to encounter all the evils that were yet in ſtore for me.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XIX.</head>
                     <p>HAVING made an experiment of various ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, all of them with one uniform reſult, I at length determined to remove myſelf, if poſſible, from the reach of my perſecutor, by going into voluntary baniſhment from my native ſoil. But it ſeemed this ſlender conſolation was to be denied to me by the inexorable Falkland. At the time that the project was formed by me I was at no great diſtance from the eaſt coaſt of the iſland, and I determined to take ſhip at Harwich, and paſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately into Holland. I accordingly repaired to that place, and went almoſt as ſoon as I arrived to the port. But there was no veſſel juſt at that time ready to ſail. I left the port, and withdrew to an inn, where after ſome time I retired to a chamber. I was ſcarcely there, before the door of the room was opened, and the man, whoſe countenance was of all others moſt hateful to my eyes, Jones, entered the apartment. He ſhut the door again as ſoon as he entered.</p>
                     <p>Youngſter, ſaid he, I have a little private intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to communicate to you. I come as a friend, and that I may ſave you a labour-in-vain trouble. If you conſider what I have to ſay in that light, it will be the better for you. It is my buſineſs now, do you ſee, for want of a better, to ſee that you do not break out of bounds. Not that I much matter having one man for my employer, or dancing attendance after another's heels; but I have a
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:028752_0433_0FDBDB60E872F330"/>
ſpecial kindneſs for you, for ſome good turns that you wot of, and therefore I do not ſtand upon cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies! You have led me a very pretty round already; and, out of the love I bear you, you ſhall lead me as much farther, if you will. But beware the ſalt ſeas! They are out of my orders. You are a priſoner at preſent, and I believe all your life will remain ſo. Thanks to the milk-and-water ſoftneſs of your former maſter! if I had the order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe things, it ſhould go with you in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other faſhion. As long as you think proper, you are a priſoner within the rules; and the rules with which the ſoft-hearted ſquire indulges you are all England, Scotland and Wales. But you are not to go out of theſe climates. The ſquire is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined you ſhall never paſs the reach of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal. He has therefore given orders that, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you attempt ſo to do, you ſhall be converted from a priſoner at large to a priſoner in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perer meaning of the word. A friend of mine fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed you juſt now to the harbour; I was within call; and, if there had been any appearance of your ſetting your foot from land, we ſhould have been with you in a trice, and laid you faſt by the heels. I would adviſe you for the future to keep at a proper diſtance from the ſea, for fear of the worſt. You ſee I tell you all this for your good. For my part I ſhould be better ſatisfied, if you were in limbo, with a rope about your neck, and a comfortable bird's eye proſpect to the gallows: but I do as I am directed; and ſo, good night to you!</p>
                     <p>The intelligence thus conveyed to me occaſioned an inſtantaneous revolution in both my intellectual and animal ſyſtem. I diſdained to anſwer or take the ſmalleſt notice of the fiend by whom it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered. It is now three days ſince I received it,
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:028752_0434_0FDBDB62A5F66240"/>
and from that moment to the preſent my blood has been in a perpetual ferment. My thoughts wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from one idea of horror to another with incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible rapidity. I have had no ſleep. I have ſcarcely remained in one poſture for a minute to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. It has been with the utmoſt difficulty that I have been able to command myſelf far enough to add a few pages to my ſtory. But, uncertain as I am of the events of each ſucceeding hour, I thought it right to force myſelf to the performance of this taſk. All is not right within me. How it will terminate God knows. I ſometimes fear that I ſhall be wholly deſerted of my reaſon.</p>
                     <p>What—dark, myſterious, unfeeling, unrelent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tyrant!—is it come to this?—When Nero and Caligula ſwayed the Roman ſceptre, it was a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing to offend theſe bloody rulers. The em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire had already ſpread itſelf from climate to cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, and from ſea to ſea. If their unhappy vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim fled to the riſing of the ſun, where the lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary of day ſeems to us firſt to aſcend from the waves of the ocean, the power of the tyrant was ſtill behind him. If he withdrew to the weſt, to Heſperian darkneſs, and the ſhores of barbarian Thule, ſtill he was not ſafe from his gore-drenched foe.—Falkland! art thou the offspring in whom the lineaments of theſe tyrants are faithfully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved? Was the world with all its climates made in vain for thy helpleſs, unoffending victim?</p>
                     <p>Tremble!</p>
                     <p>Tyrants have trembled ſurrounded with whole armies of their Janiſſaries! What ſhould make thee inacceſſible to my fury?—No, I will uſe no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers! I will unfold a tale—! I will ſhow thee for what thou art to the world, and all the men that live ſhall confeſs my truth!—Didſt thou imagine that I was altogether paſſive, a mere worm, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganized to feel ſenſations of pain, but no emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of reſentment? Didſt thou imagine that
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:028752_0435_0FDBDB6420FAC3A8"/>
there was no danger in inflicting on me pains how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever great, miſeries however dreadful? Didſt thou believe me impotent, imbecil and idiot-like, with no underſtanding to contrive thy ruin, and no energy to perpetrate it?</p>
                     <p>I will tell a tale—! The juſtice of the country ſhall hear me! The elements of nature in univerſal uproar ſhall not interrupt me! I will ſpeak with a voice more fearful than thunder!—Why ſhould I be ſuppoſed to ſpeak from any diſhonourable motive? I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no proſecution now! I ſhall not now appear to be endeavouring to remove a criminal indictment from myſelf, by throwing it back on its author!—Shall I regret the ruin that will overwhelm thee! Too long have I been tender-hearted and forbearing! What benefit has ever reſulted from my miſtaken clemency? There is no evil thou haſt ſcrupled to accumulate upon me! Neither will I be more ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous! Thou haſt ſhown no mercy; and thou ſhalt receive none!—I muſt be calm! Bold as a lion, yet collected!</p>
                     <p>This is a moment pregnant with fate. I know—I think I know—that I will be triumphant, and cruſh my ſeemingly omnipotent foe. But ſhould it be otherwiſe, at leaſt he ſhall not be every way ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful. His fame ſhall not be immortal as he thinks. Theſe papers ſhall preſerve the truth: they ſhall one day be publiſhed, and then the world ſhall do juſtice on us both. Recollecting that, I ſhall not die wholly without conſolation. It is not to be endured that falſhood and tyranny ſhould reign for ever.</p>
                     <p>How impotent are the precautions of man againſt the eternally-exiſting laws of the intellectual world? This Falkland has invented againſt me every ſpecies of foul accuſation? He has hunted me from city to city. He has drawn his lines of circumvallation round me that I may not eſcape. He has kept his

                        </gap>enters of human prey for ever at my heels. He may hunt me out of the world.—In vain! With this engine, this little pen I defeat all his machina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; I ſtab him in the very point he was moſt ſolicitous to defend!</p>
                     <p>Collins! I now addreſs myſelf to you. I have conſented that you ſhould yield me no aſſiſtance in my preſent terrible ſituation. I am content to die rather than do any thing injurious to your felicity.—But, remember,—you are my father ſtill!—I conjure you, by all the love you ever bore me, by the benefits you have conferred on me, by the forbearance and kindneſs towards you that now penetrates my ſoul, by my innocence—for, if theſe be the laſt words I ſhall ever write, I die proteſting my innocence!—by all theſe or whatever tie more ſacred has influence on your ſoul, I conjure you, liſten to my laſt requeſt! Preſerve theſe papers from deſtruction, and preſerve them from Falkland? It is all I aſk! I have taken care to provide a ſafe mode of conveying them into your poſſeſſion; and I have a firm confidence which I will not ſuffer to depart from me, that by ſome means or other they will one day find their way to the public!</p>
                     <p>The pen lingers in my trembling fingers!—Is there any thing I have left unſaid?—The contents of the fatal cheſt from which originated all my misfortunes I have never been able to aſcertain. I once thought it contained ſome murderous inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or relique connected with the fate of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Tyrrel. I am now perſuaded that the ſecret it incloſed was a faithful narrative of that and its concomitant tranſactions to be reſerved in caſe of the worſt, that, if by any unforeſeen event the guilt of Falkland ſhould ever come to be fully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed, it might contribute to redeem the wreck of his reputation. But it is no matter. If Falkland ſhall never be detected to the ſatisfaction of the
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:028752_0437_0FDBDB693044EF00"/>
world, ſuch a narrative will probably never ſee the light. In that caſe this ſtory of mine may amply, ſeverely perhaps ſupply its place.</p>
                     <p>I know not what it is that renders me thus ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn. I have a ſecret foreboding as if I ſhould never again be maſter of myſelf. If I ſucceed in what I now meditate reſpecting Falkland, my precaution in removing theſe papers will have been unneceſſary; I ſhall no longer be reduced to arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and evaſion. If I fail, the precaution will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be wiſely choſen.</p>

                     <p>ALL is over. I have carried into execution my meditated attempt. My ſituation is totally chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; I now ſit down to give an account of it. For ſeveral weeks after the completion of this dreadful buſineſs, my mind was in too tumultuous a ſtate to permit me to write. I think I ſhall now be able to arrange my thoughts ſufficiently for that purpoſe. Great God! how wondrous, how terrible are the events that have intervened ſince I was laſt employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a ſimilar manner! It is no wonder that my thoughts were ſolemn, and my mind filled with horrible forebodings!</p>
                     <p>Having formed my reſolution, I ſet out from Harwich for the metropolitan town of the county in which Mr. Falkland reſided. Jones I well knew was in my rear. That was of no conſequence to me. He might wonder at the direction I purſued, but he could not tell with what purpoſe I purſued it. My deſign was a ſecret carefully locked up in my own breaſt. It was not without a ſentiment of terror that I entered a town which had been the ſcene of my long impriſonment. I proceeded to the houſe of the chief magiſtrate the inſtant I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, that I might give no time to my adverſary to counterwork my proceeding.</p>
                     <p>I told him who I was, and that I was come from a diſtant part of the kingdom for the purpoſe of rendering him the medium of a charge of murder
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:028752_0439_0FDBDB70A8EDFF30"/>
againſt my former maſter. My name was already familiar to him. He anſwered that he could not take cognizance of my depoſition, that I was an object of univerſal execration in that part of the world, and he was determined upon no account to be the vehicle of my depravity.</p>
                     <p>I warned him to conſider well what he was about. I called upon him for no favour; I only applied to him in the regular exerciſe of his func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Would he take upon him to ſay that he had a right at his pleaſure to ſuppreſs a charge of this complicated nature? I had to accuſe Mr. Falkland of repeated murders. The perpetrator knew that I was in poſſeſſion of the truth upon the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; and, knowing that, I went perpetually in danger of my life from his malice and revenge. I was determined to go through with the buſineſs, if juſtice were to be obtained from any court in England. Upon what pretence did he refuſe my depoſition? I was in every reſpect a competent witneſs. I was of age to underſtand the nature of an oath; I was in my perfect ſenſes; I was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarniſhed by the verdict of any jury, or the ſentence of any judge. His private opinion of my charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter could not alter the law of the land. I demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be confronted with Mr. Falkland, and I was well aſſured I ſhould ſubſtantiate the charge to the ſatisfaction of the whole world. If he did not think proper to apprehend him upon my ſingle teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony, I ſhould be ſatisfied if he only ſent him notice of the charge and ſummoned him to appear.</p>
                     <p>The magiſtrate finding me thus reſolute, thought proper a little to lower his tone. He no longer abſolutely refuſed to comply with my requiſition, but condeſcended to expoſtulate with me. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to me Mr. Falkland's health which had for ſome years been exceedingly indifferent, his
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:028752_0440_0FDBDB746760F690"/>
having been already once brought to trial, upon the ſame accuſation, the diabolical malice in which alone my proceeding muſt have originated, and the tenfold ruin it would bring down upon my own head. I ſhould be pilloried for perjury, if not hanged for the robbery, in relation to which Mr. Falkland had ſo generouſly ſpared me upon a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer occaſion. To all theſe repreſentations my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was ſhort. I was determined to go on, and would abide the conſequences. A ſummons was at length granted, and notice ſent to Mr. Falkland of the charge preferred againſt him.</p>
                     <p>Three days elapſed before any farther ſtep could be taken in this buſineſs. This interval in no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree contributed to tranquilliſe my mind. The thought of preferring a capital accuſation againſt, and haſtening the death of ſuch a man as Mr. Falkland, was by no means an opiate to reflexion. At one time I commended the action, either as juſt revenge (for the benevolence of my nature was in a great degree turned to ſour), or as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary ſelf-defence, or as that which in an impartial and philanthropical eſtimate included the ſmalleſt evil. At another time I was haunted with doubts. But, ſpite of theſe variations of ſentiment, I uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly determined to perſiſt; I felt as if impelled by an unconquerable neceſſity. The conſequences were ſuch as might well appal the ſtouteſt heart. Either the ignominious execution of a man whom I had once ſo deeply venerated, and whom now I ſometimes ſuſpected not to be without his claims to veneration; or a confirmation, perhaps an increaſe, of the calamities I had ſo endured. Yet theſe I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to a ſtate of uncertainty. I deſired to know the worſt; to put an end to the hope, however faint, which had been ſo long my torment; and above all to exhauſt and finiſh the catalogue of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedients
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:028752_0441_0FDBDB75EB15A9C0"/>
that were within my diſpoſition. My mind was worked up to a ſtate little ſhort of frenzy. My body was in a burning fever with the agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my thoughts. When I laid my hand upon my boſom or my head, it ſeemed to ſcorch them with the fervency of its heat. I could not ſit ſtill for a moment. I panted with inceſſant deſire that the dreadful criſis I had ſo eagerly invoked were come, and were over.</p>
                     <p>After an interval of three days I met Mr. Falk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land in the preſence of the magiſtrate to whom I had applied upon the ſubject. I had only two hours notice to prepare myſelf, Mr. Falkland ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as eager as I to have the queſtion brought to a criſis, and laid at reſt for ever. I had an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity before the examination to learn that Mr. Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſter was gone upon ſome buſineſs on an excurſion to the continent, and that Collins, whoſe health when I ſaw him was in a very precarious ſtate, was at this time confined with alarming illneſs. His conſtitution had been wholly broken with his Weſt Indian voyage. The audience I met at the houſe of the magiſtrate conſiſted of ſeveral gentlemen and others ſelected for the purpoſe, the plan being to find a medium between the ſuſpicious air of a private examination, and the indelicacy as it was ſtyled of an examination expoſed to the remark of every accidental ſpectator.</p>
                     <p>I can conceive of no ſhock greater than that I received from the ſight of Mr. Falkland. His ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance on the laſt occaſion on which we met had been haggard, ghoſt-like and wild, energy in his geſtures and frenzy in his aſpect. It was now the appearance of a corpſe. He was brought in in a chair unable to ſtand, fatigued and almoſt deſtroyed by the journey he had juſt taken. His viſage was colourleſs; his limbs deſtitute of motion, almoſt
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:028752_0442_0FDBDB7AA8029590"/>
of life. His head reclined upon his boſom, except that now and then he liſted it up and opened his eyes with a languid glance, immediately after which he ſunk back into his former apparent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibility. He ſeemed not to have three hours to live. He had kept his chamber for ſeveral weeks; but the ſummons of the magiſtrate had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to him at his bed-ſide; his orders reſpecting letters and written papers being ſo peremptory that no one dared to diſobey them. Upon reading the paper he was ſeized with a very dangerous fit; but, as ſoon as he recovered, he inſiſted upon being conveyed with all practicable expedition to the place of appointment. Falkland in the moſt helpleſs ſtate was ſtill Falkland, firm in command, and capable to extort obedience from every one that approached him.</p>
                     <p>What a ſight was this to me! Till the moment that Falkland was preſented to my view, my breaſt was ſteeled to pity. I thought that I had coolly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into the reaſon of the caſe (paſſion in a ſtate of ſolemn and omnipotent vehemence always ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be coolneſs to him in whom it domineers); and that I had determined impartially and juſtly. I believed that, if Mr. Falkland were permitted to perſiſt in his ſchemes, we muſt both of us be completely wretched. I believed that it was in my power by the reſolution I had formed to throw my ſhare of this wretchedneſs from me and that his could ſcarcely be increaſed. It appeared therefore to my mind to be a mere piece of equity and juſtice, ſuch as an impartial ſpectator would deſire, that one perſon ſhould be miſerable in preference to two, that one perſon rather than two ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacitated from acting his part, and contributing his ſhare to the general good. I thought that in this buſineſs I had riſen ſuperior to perſonal conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations,
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:028752_0443_0FDBDB7BE8F5E6A0"/>
and judged with a total neglect of the miſerable ſuggeſtions of ſelf-regard. It is true Mr. Falkland was mortal: but, notwithſtanding his apparent decay, he might live long. Ought I to ſubmit to waſte the beſt years of my life in my preſent wretched ſituation? He had declared that his reputation ſhould be for ever inviolate; this was his ruling paſſion, the thought that worked his ſoul to madneſs. He would probably therefore leave a legacy of perſecution to be received by me from the hands of Jones or ſome other villain equally atrocious, when he ſhould himſelf be no more. Now or never was the time for me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem my future life from endleſs woe.</p>
                     <p>But all theſe fine-ſpun reaſonings vaniſhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the object that was now exhibited to me. Shall I trample upon a man thus dreadfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced? Shall I point my animoſity againſt one whom the ſyſtem of nature has brought down to the grave? Shall I poiſon with ſounds the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable to his ears the laſt moments of a man like Falkland? It is impoſſible. There muſt have been ſome dreadful miſtake in the train of argument that perſuaded me to be the author of this hateful ſcene. There muſt have been a better and more magnanimous remedy to the evils under which I groaned.</p>
                     <p>It was too late. The miſtake I had committed was now gone paſt all power of recal. Here was Falkland ſolemnly brought before a magiſtrate to anſwer a charge of murder. Here I ſtood, having already declared myſelf the author of the charge, gravely and ſacredly pledged to ſupport it. This was my ſituation; and, thus ſituated, I was called upon immediately to act. My whole frame ſhook. I would eagerly have conſented that that moment ſhould have been the laſt of my exiſtence. I how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:028752_0444_0FDBDB80C4C396D8"/>
believed that the conduct now moſt indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſably incumbent on me, was to lay the emotions of my ſoul naked before my hearers. I looked firſt at Mr. Falkland, and then at the magiſtrate and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants, and then at Mr. Falkland again. My voice was ſuffocated with agony. I began:</p>
                     <p>Why cannot I recal the four laſt days of my life? How was it poſſible for me to be ſo eager, ſo obſtinate in a purpoſe ſo diabolical? Oh, that I had liſtened to the expoſtulations of the magiſtrate that hears me, or ſubmitted to the well-meant deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potiſm of his authority! Hitherto I have only been miſerable; henceforth I ſhall account myſelf baſe! Hitherto, though hardly treated by mankind, I ſtood acquitted at the bar of my own conſcience. I had not filled up the meaſure of my wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs!</p>
                     <p>Would to God it were poſſible for me to retire from this ſcene without uttering another word! I would brave the conſequences—I would ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to any imputation of cowardice, falſhood and profligacy, rather than add to the weight of misfortune with which Mr. Falkland is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed. But the ſituation and the demands of Mr. Falkland himſelf forbid me. He, in compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for whoſe fallen ſtate I would willingly forget every intereſt of my own, would compel me to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, that he might enter upon his juſtification.—I will confeſs every ſentiment of my heart.</p>
                     <p>No penitence, no anguiſh can expiate the folly and the cruelty of this laſt act I have perpetrated. But Mr. Falkland well knows—I affirm it in his preſence—how unwillingly I have proceeded to this extremity. I have reverenced him; he was wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of reverence: I have loved him; he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with qualities that partook of divine.</p>
                     <p>From the firſt moment I ſaw him, I conceived for him the moſt ardent admiration. He conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:028752_0445_0FDBDB81EB6E7C08"/>
to encourage me; I attached myſelf to him with all the fulneſs of affection. He was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy; I exerted myſelf with youthful curioſity to diſcover the ſecret of his woe. This was the beginning of misfortune.</p>
                     <p>What ſhall I ſay?—He was indeed the murderer of Tyrrel; he ſuffered the Hawkinses to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted, knowing that they were innocent, and that he alone was guilty. After ſucceſſive ſurmiſes, after various indiſcretions on my part and indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on his, he at length confided to me at full the fatal tale!</p>
                     <p>Mr. Falkland! I moſt ſolemnly conjure you to recollect yourſelf! Did I ever prove myſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of your confidence? The ſecret was a moſt painful burthen to me; it was the extremeſt folly that led me unthinkingly to gain poſſeſſion of it; but I would have died a thouſand deaths rather than betray it. It was the jealouſy of your own thoughts, and the weight that hung upon your mind, that led you to watch my motions, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive alarm from every particle of my conduct.</p>
                     <p>You began in confidence; why did you not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in confidence? The evil that reſulted from my original imprudence, would then have been comparatively little. You threatened me: did I then betray you? A word from my lips at that time would have freed me from your threats for ever. I bore them for a conſiderable period, and at laſt quitted your ſervice, and threw myſelf a fugitive upon the world in ſilence. Why did you not ſuffer me to depart? You brought me back by ſtratagem and violence, and wantonly accuſed me of an enormous felony; did I then mention a ſyllable of the murder, the ſecret of which was in my poſſeſſion?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="218" facs="unknown:028752_0446_0FDBDB836A6CCF30"/>
Where is the man that has ſuffered more from the injuſtice of ſociety than I have done? I was accuſed of a villainy that my heart abhorred. I was ſent to jail. I will not enumerate the horrors of my priſon, the lighteſt of which would make the heart of humanity ſhudder. I looked forward to the gallows! Young, ambitious, fond of life, innocent as the child unborn, I looked forward to the gallows! I believed that one word of reſolute accuſation againſt my maſter would deliver me, yet I was ſilent, I armed myſelf with patience, uncertain whether it were better to accuſe or to die. Did this ſhew me a man unworthy to be truſted?</p>
                     <p>I determined to break out of priſon. With in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite difficulty and repeated miſcarriages I at length effected my purpoſe. Inſtantly a proclamation with a hundred guineas reward was iſſued for ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending me. I was obliged to take refuge among the ſcum of mankind, in the midſt of a gang of thieves. I encountered the moſt imminent peril of my life when I entered into this retreat, and when I quitted it. Immediately after I tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled almoſt the whole length of the kingdom in poverty and diſtreſs, in hourly danger of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken and manacled like a felon. I would have fled my country; I was prevented. I had recourſe to various diſguiſes; I was innocent, and yet was compelled to as many arts and ſubterfuges as could have been entailed on the worſt of villains. In London I was as much haraſſed and as repeatedly alarmed, as I had been in my flight through the country. Did all theſe perſecutions perſuade me to put an end to my ſilence? No: I ſuffered them with patience and ſubmiſſion; I did not make one attempt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort them upon their author.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="219" facs="unknown:028752_0447_0FDBDB892E76E5C0"/>
I fell at laſt into the hands of the miſcreants that are nouriſhed with human blood. In this terrible ſituation I for the firſt time attempted by turning informer to throw the weight from myſelf. Happily for me the London magiſtrate liſtened to my tale with inſolent contempt.</p>
                     <p>I ſoon and long repented of my raſhneſs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced in my miſcarriage. I acknowledge that in various ways Mr. Falkland ſhewed humanity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me during this period. He would have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented my going to priſon at firſt; he contributed to my ſubſiſtence during my detention; he had no ſhare in the purſuit that had been ſet on foot againſt me; he at length procured my diſcharge when brought forward for trial. But a great part of his forbearance was unknown to me; I ſuppoſed him to be my unrelenting purſuer. I could not forget that, whoever heaped calamities on me in the ſequel, they all originated in his forged accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</p>
                     <p>The proſecution againſt me for felony was now at an end. Why were not my ſufferings permitted to terminate then, and I allowed to hide my weary head in ſome obſcure yet tranquil retreat? Had I not ſufficiently proved my conſtancy and fidelity? Would not a compromiſe in this ſituation have been moſt wife and moſt ſecure? But the reſtleſs and jealous anxiety of Mr. Falkland would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him to repoſe the leaſt atom of confidence. The only compromiſe that he propoſed was, that with my own hand I ſhould ſign myſelf a villain. I refuſed this propoſal, and have ever ſince been driven from place to place, deprived of peace, of honeſt ſame, even of bread. For a long time I perſiſted in the reſolution that no emergency ſhould convert me into the aſſailant. In evil hour I at laſt liſtened to my reſentment and impatience, and
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:028752_0448_0FDBD884A8DF39F0"/>
the hateful miſtake into which I fell has produced the preſent ſcene.</p>
                     <p>I now ſee that miſtake in all its enormity. I am ſure that, if I had opened my heart to Mr. Falkland, if I had told to him privately the tale that I have now been telling, he could not have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted my reaſonable demand. After all his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions, he muſt ultimately have depended upon my forbearance. Could he be ſure that, if I were at laſt worked up to diſcloſe every thing I knew, and to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> it with all the energy I could exert, I ſhould obtain no credit? If he muſt in every caſe be at my mercy, in which mode ought he to have ſought his ſafety, in conciliation or in inexorable cruelty?</p>
                     <p>Mr. Falkland is of a noble nature. Yes; in ſpite of the cataſtrophe of Tyrrel, of the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble end of the Hawkinses, and of all that I have myſelf ſuffered, I affirm that he has qualities of the moſt admirable kind. It is therefore impoſſible that he could have reſiſted a frank and fervent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulation, the frankneſs and the fervour in which the whole ſoul was poured out. I deſpaired, while it was yet time to have made the juſt experiment; but my deſpair was criminal, was treaſon againſt the ſovereignty of truth.</p>
                     <p>I have told a plain and unadulterated tale. I came hither to curſe, but I remain to bleſs. I came to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, but am compelled to applaud. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim to all the world that Mr. Falkland is a man worthy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> affection and kindneſs, and that I am myſelf the worſt of villains! Never will I forgive myſelf the iniquity of this day. The memory will always haunt me, and embitter every hour of my exiſtence. In thus acting I have been a murderer, a cool, deliberate, unfeeling murderer.—I have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> what my accurſed precipitation has obliged me
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:028752_0449_0FDBDB8F024183C0"/>
to ſay. Do with me as you pleaſe! I aſk no favour. Death would be a kindneſs, compared to what I feel!</p>
                     <p>Such were the accents dictated by my remorſe. I poured them out with uncontroulable impetuoſity, for my heart was pierced, and I was compelled to give vent to its anguiſh. Every one that heard me was petrified with aſtoniſhment. Every one that heard me was melted into tears. They could not reſiſt the ardour with which I praiſed the great qualities of Falkland; they manifeſted their ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy in the tokens of my penitence.</p>
                     <p>How ſhall I deſcribe the feelings of this unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate man? Before I began, he ſeemed ſunk and debilitated, incapable of any ſtrenuous impreſſion. When I mentioned the murder, I could perceive in him an involuntary ſhuddering, though it was counteracted partly by the feebleneſs of his frame, and partly by the energy of his mind. This was an allegation he expected, and he had endeavoured to prepare himſelf for it. But there was much of what I ſaid, of which he had had no previous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. When I expreſſed the anguiſh of my mind, he ſeemed at firſt ſtartled and alarmed leſt this ſhould be a new expedient to gain credit to my tale. His indignation againſt me was great for having retained all my reſentment towards him thus, as it might be, in the laſt hour of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence. It was increaſed, when he diſcovered me, as he ſuppoſed, uſing a pretence of liberality and ſentiment, to give new edge to my hoſtility. But, as I went on, he could no longer reſiſt. He ſaw my ſincerity; he was penetrated with my grief and compunction. He roſe from his ſeat ſupported by the attendants, and—to my infinite aſtoniſhment—threw himſelf into my arms!</p>
                     <p>

Williams, ſaid he, you have conquered! I ſee too late the greatneſs and elevation of your mind. I adore the qualities that you now diſplay, though to thoſe qualities I owe my ruin. I could have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted any plan of malicious accuſation you might have brought againſt me. But I ſee that the artleſs and manly ſtory you have told, has carried con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction to every hearer. All my proſpects are concluded. All that I moſt ardently deſired is for ever fruſtrated. I have ſpent a life of the baſeſt cruelty to cover one act of momentary vice and to protect myſelf againſt the prejudices of my ſpecies. I ſtand now completely detected. My name will be conſecrated to infamy, while your heroiſm, your patience and your virtues will be for ever ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired. You have inflicted on me the moſt fatal of all miſchiefs, but I bleſs the hand that wounds me. And now,—turning to the magiſtrate—and now, do with me as you pleaſe. I am prepared to ſuffer all the vengeance of the law. You cannot inflict on me more than I deſerve. You cannot hate me more than I hate myſelf. I am the moſt execrable of all villains. I have for years (I know not how long) dragged on a miſerable exiſtence in inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable pain. I am at laſt, in recompenſe for all my labours and my crimes, diſmiſſed from it, with the diſappointment of my only remaining hope, the deſtruction of that for the ſake of which alone I conſented to exiſt. It was worthy of ſuch a life, that it ſhould continue juſt long enough to witneſs this final overthrow. If however you wiſh to puniſh me, you muſt be ſpeedy in your juſtice; for, as reputation was the blood that warmed my heart, ſo I feel that death and infamy muſt ſeize me together.</p>
                     <p>I record the praiſes beſtowed on me by Falk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, not becauſe I deſerve them, but becauſe they
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:028752_0451_0FDBDB926869A848"/>
ſerve to aggravate the baſeneſs of my cruelty. He ſurvived but three days this dreadful ſcene. I have been his murderer. It was fit that he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

But, atrocious, execrable wretch that I have been! I wantonly inflicted on him an anguiſh a thouſand times worſe than death. Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while I endure the penalty of my crime. His figure is ever in imagination before me. Waking or ſleeping I ſtill behold him. He ſeems mildly to expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late with me for my unfeeling behaviour. I live the devoted victim of conſcious reproach. Alas! I am the ſame Caleb Williams that but ten days before boaſted, that, however great were the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities I endured, I was ſtill innocent.</p>
                     <p>Such has been the reſult of a project I formed for delivering myſelf from the evils that had ſo long attended me. I thought that, if Falkland were dead, I ſhould return once again to all that makes life worth poſſeſſing. I thought that, if the guilt of Falkland were eſtabliſhed, fortune and the world would ſmile upon my efforts. Both theſe events are accompliſhed; and it is only now that I am truly miſerable.</p>
                     <p>Why ſhould my reflections perpetually centre upon myſelf? ſelf, an overweening regard to which has been the ſource of my errors! Falkland, I will think only of thee, and from that thought will draw ever-freſh nouriſhment for my ſorrows! One generous, one diſintereſted tear I will conſecrate to thy aſhes! A nobler ſpirit lived not among the ſons of men. Thy intellectual powers were truly ſublime, and thy boſom burned with a godlike am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition. But of what uſe are talents and ſentiments

in the corrupt wilderneſs of human ſociety? It is a rank and rotten ſoil from which every finer ſhrub draws poiſon as it grows. All that in a happier field and a purer air would expand into virtue and germinate into general uſefulneſs, is thus converted into henbane and deadly nightſhade.</p>
                     <p>Falkland! thou ſettedſt out in thy career with the pureſt and moſt laudable intentions. But thou imbibedſt the poiſon of chivalry with thy earlieſt youth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the baſe and low-minded envy that met thee on thy return to thy native ſeats, operated with this poiſon to hurry thee into madneſs. Soon, too ſoon, by this fatal coincidence were the bloom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hopes of thy youth blaſted for ever! From that moment thou only continuedſt to live to the phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of departed honour. From that moment thy benevolence was in a great part turned into rank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling jealouſy and inexorable precaution. Year after year didſt thou ſpend in this miſerable project of impoſture; and only at laſt continuedſt to live long enough to ſee, by my misjudging and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red intervention, thy cloſing hope diſappointed, and thy death accompanied with the fouleſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace!</p>
                     <p>I began theſe memoirs with the idea of vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating my own character. I have now no charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that I wiſh to vindicate: but I will finiſh them that thy ſtory may be fully underſtood; and that, if thoſe errors of thy life be known which thou ſo ardently deſiredſt to conceal, the world may at leaſt not hear and repeat a half-told and mangled tale.</p>
