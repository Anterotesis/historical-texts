            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

So that if a Brother ſhould be a Rebel againſt the State, he is not to be countenanc'd in his Rebellion, however he may be pitied as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Man; and if convicted of no other Crime, though the loyal Brotherhood muſt and ought to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own his Rebellion, and give no Umbrage or Ground of political Jealouſy to the Government for the time being; they cannot expel him from the <hi>Lodge,</hi> and his Relation to it remains indeſeaſible.</p>

            <p n="3">III. The <hi>Maſter</hi> of each particular <hi>Lodge,</hi> or one of the <hi>Wardens,</hi> or ſome other Brother by his Order, ſhall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p n="7">VII. Every <hi>new Brother</hi> at his making is decently to cloath the <hi>Lodge,</hi> that is, all the Brethren preſent, and to depoſite ſomething for the Relief of indigent and decay'd Brethren, as the <hi>Candidate</hi> ſhall think fit to beſtow, over and above the ſmall Allowance ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the <hi>By-Laws</hi> of that particular <hi>Lodge;</hi> which <hi>Charity</hi> ſhall be lodg'd with the <hi>Maſter</hi> or <hi>Wardens,</hi> or the <hi>Caſhier,</hi> if the Members think fit to chuſe one.</p>

            <p>If any Set or Number of Maſons ſhall take upon themſelves to form a Lodge without the <hi>Grand-Maſter's</hi> Warrant, the <hi>regular Lodges</hi> are not to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance them, nor own them as <hi>fair Brethren</hi> and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly form'd, nor approve of their Acts and Deeds; but muſt treat them as <hi>Rebels,</hi> until they humble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as the <hi>Grand-Maſter</hi> ſhall in his Prudence di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, and until he approve of them by his <hi>Warrant,</hi> which muſt be ſignify'd to the <hi>other Lodges,</hi> as the Cuſtom is when a <hi>new Lodge</hi> is to be regiſter'd in the <hi>Liſt</hi> of <hi>Lodges.</hi>

            <p n="11">XI.

Here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo all Differences, that cannot be made up and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated privately, nor by a particular <hi>Lodge,</hi> are to be ſeriouſly conſidered and decided: And if any <hi>Brother</hi> thinks himſelf aggrieved by the Deciſion of this Board, he may appeal to the <hi>annual Grand-Lodge</hi> next enſuing, and leave his Appeal in Writing, with the <hi>Grand-Maſter,</hi> or his <hi>Deputy,</hi> or the <hi>Grand-War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens.</hi>

            <p>They ſhall alſo appoint a <hi>Treaſurer,</hi> a Brother of good worldly Subſtance, who ſhall be a Member of the <hi>Grand-Lodge</hi> by virtue of his Office, and ſhall be always preſent, and have Power to move to the <hi>Grand-Lodge</hi> any thing, eſpecially what concerns his Office.

The <hi>Grand-Maſter,</hi> or his <hi>Deputy,</hi> ſhall always com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the <hi>Treaſurer</hi> and <hi>Secretary,</hi> with their <hi>Clerks</hi> and <hi>Books,</hi> in order to ſee how Matters go on, and to know what is expedient to be done upon any emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Occaſion.</p>
            <p>Another Brother (who muſt be a <hi>Fellow-Craft</hi>) ſhould be appointed to look after the Door of the <hi>Grand-Lodge;</hi> but ſhall be no Member of it.</p>

            <p>The <hi>Grand-Maſter</hi> ſhould receive no Intimation of Buſineſs concerning <hi>Maſonry,</hi> but from his <hi>Deputy</hi> firſt, except in ſuch certain Caſes as his Worſhip can well judge of; for if the Application to the <hi>Grand-Maſter</hi> be irregular, he can eaſily order the <hi>Grand-Wardens,</hi> or any other Brethren thus applying, to wait upon his <hi>Deputy,</hi> who is to prepare the Buſineſs ſpeedily, and to lay it orderly before his <hi>Worſhip.</hi>
