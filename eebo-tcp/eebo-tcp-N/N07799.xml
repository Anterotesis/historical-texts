            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>WHEN I laſt wrote to you and ſaid, "that the late meaſures reſpecting <hi>America,</hi> would not only be extremely injurious to the <hi>Colonies,</hi> but alſo to <hi>Great-Britain,</hi>" I little thought I was entring into an engagement, which would oblige me to exceed the uſual limits of a letter: but ſince you deſire to have at large the reaſons in ſupport of this opinion, and I always think it my duty to comply with your requeſts, I will endeavour in the cleareſt manner I can, to lay my ſentiments before you.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>American</hi> continental colonies are inhabited by perſons of ſmall fortunes, who <hi>are</hi> ſo cloſely employed in ſubduing a wild country, for their ſubſiſtence, and who <hi>would</hi> labour under ſuch difficulties in contending with old and populous countries, which muſt exceed them in workmanſhip and cheapneſs, that they have not

                  <p>It has been ſaid in the Houſe of Commons, when complaints have been made of the decay of trade to any part of <hi>Europe,</hi> "That ſuch things were not worth regard, as <hi>Great-Britain</hi> was poſſeſt of colonies that could conſume more of her manufactures than ſhe was able to ſupply them with."</p>
                  <p>"As the caſe now ſtands, we ſhall ſhew that the <hi>plantations</hi> are a ſpring of <hi>wealth</hi> to this nation, that they <hi>work</hi> for us, that their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure <hi>centers all here,</hi> and that the laws have tied them falt enough to us; ſo that it muſt be through our own fault and miſmanagement, if they become independent of <hi>England.</hi>"</p>

                  <bibl> Sir JOSIAH CHILD a diſcourſe on trade.</bibl>
                  <p>"Our plantations ſpend moſtly our <hi>Engliſh</hi> manufactures, and thoſe <hi>of all ſorts almoſt imaginable,</hi> in <hi>egregious quantities,</hi> and employ near <hi>two-thirds of all our</hi> Engliſh <hi>ſhipping;</hi> ſo that we have <hi>more people</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> by reaſon of our plantations in <hi>America.</hi>"</p>

                  </bibl>
                  <p>Sir JOSIAH CHILD ſays, in another part of his work, "That not more than fifty families are maintained in <hi>England</hi> by the refining of ſugar." From whence, and from what <hi>Davenant</hi> ſays, it is plain, that the advantages here ſaid to be derived from the plantations by <hi>England,</hi> muſt be meant chiefly of the continental colonies. <hi>See notes to pages</hi> 12 <hi>&amp;</hi> 13.</p>
                  <p>"I ſhall ſum up my whole remarks on our <hi>American</hi> colonies, with this obſervation, that as they are a certain annual revenue of ſeveral millions ſterling to their Mother Country, they ought carefully to be protected, duly encouraged, and every opportunity that preſents, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved for their increment and advantage, as every one they can poſſibly reap, muſt at laſt return to us with intereſt."</p>
                  <bibl>BEAWES'S Lex merc. red.</bibl>
                  <p>"We may ſafely advance, that our trade and navigation are gently encreaſed by our colonies, and that they really are a ſource of treaſure and naval power to this kingdom, ſince <hi>they work for us,</hi> and <hi>their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure centers here.</hi> Before their ſettlement, our manufactures were few, and thoſe but indifferent; the number of <hi>Engliſh</hi> merchants very ſmall, and the whole ſhipping of the nation much inferior to what now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the Northern Colonies only. <hi>Theſe are certain facts.</hi> But ſince their eſtabliſhment, our condition has altered for the better, almoſt to a degree beyond credibility.—Our MANUFACTURES are prodigiouſly encreaſed, chiefly by the demand for them in the plantations, where they AT LEAST TAKE OFF ONE HALF, and ſupply us with many valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able commodities for exportation, which is as great an emolument to the Mother Kingdom, as to the plantations themſelves."</p>

               </note> reſt of <hi>Europe</hi> interferes with her, and various accidents may interrupt them. The benefit from hence is at <hi>preſent</hi> immenſe; but in <hi>future</hi> times when <hi>America</hi> ſhall be more fully peopled, muſt exceed with prudent management the warmeſt wiſhes of a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Patriot.</p>
            <p>Our chief productions are proviſions, naval ſtores, furs, iron and lumber. Some few colonies yield tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co and indigo. Many of theſe commodities are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to <hi>Great-Britain;</hi> but all that ſhe requires are
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:009950_0005_0F7B3AC104EC4100"/>
vaſtly inſufficient to pay for her manufactures which we want. The productions of ſome of the Southern Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies may perhaps be equal to their demands, but the caſe is widely different with the Northern; for in theſe, the importations from <hi>Great-Britain</hi> are computed to be generally more than double the value of their immediate exportations to that kingdom.</p>
            <p>THE only expedient left us for making our remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances, is to carry on ſome other trade, whereby we can obtain ſilver and gold, which our own country does not afford. Hence it is evident, that if our taking off and paying for her manufactures, is beneficial to <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> the channels by which we acquire money for that purpoſe, ought to be induſtriouſly kept open and uninterrupted.</p>
            <p>OUR trade with <hi>Spain, Portugal</hi> and the foreign plantations in the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> have chiefly anſwered this end, though with much difficulty, the mother country having long ſince drawn the<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>As far as regulations are requiſite to confine the commerce of the colonies to <hi>Britiſh</hi> ſubjects and to <hi>Britiſh</hi> ſhips; to give <hi>Great-Britain</hi> the preference in being ſupplied with naval ſtores, ſo eſſential to her ſtrength at ſea; with commodities neceſſary for carrying on her woollen manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, or ſuch articles as can bear high duties upon them, and thereby make a conſiderable addition to the revenue; or as far as they are requiſite to prevent the colonies from being ſupplied with any thing in the place of <hi>Britiſh</hi> manufactures, they may be reaſonable. Theſe regulations, it is apprehended, eſtabliſh the baſis of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> power; and form ſuch a firm connection between the Mother Country and her Colonies, as will produce all the advantages ſhe ought to wiſh for, or that they can afford her. Any further attempt to ſhackle <hi>ſome</hi> of the colonies in favour of <hi>others,</hi> or to advance the revenue in <hi>America</hi> by reſtraining its trade, is but regulating by a ſevere exerciſe of power, what wants no regulation, and loſing by too much haste to gain.

"Narrow-limited notions in trade and planting, are only advanced by, and can only be of uſe to <hi>particular</hi> perſons, but are always in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to the <hi>public</hi> intereſts, in preventing the full employment of our own people, and giving our rivals and competitors in trade, the opportunity of employing greater numbers of theirs, producing greater quantities of merchandizes, and underſelling us at foreign markets."</p>

We apprehended no deſign formed againſt our liberty. We for a long time enjoyed peace, and were quite free from any heavy debt, either internal or external. We had a paper currency which ſerved as a medium of domeſtic commerce, and permitted us to employ all the gold and ſilver we could acquire, in trade abroad. We had a multitude of markets for our proviſions, lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and iron. Theſe allowed liberties, with ſome others we aſſumed, enabled us to collect conſiderable ſums of money for the joint benefit of ourſelves and our mother country.</p>

The remittances we have been able to make to <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> with all the licence hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto granted or taken, and all the money brought among us in the courſe of the late war, have not been ſufficient to pay her what we owe; but there ſtill remains due, according to a late calculation made by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> merchants, the ſum of four millions ſterling. Beſides this, we are and have been for many years heavily taxed, for the payment of the debts contracted by our efforts againſt the common enemy. Theſe ſeem to be difficulties ſevere enough for young colonies to contend with. The laſt<note n="‡" place="bottom">While the quantity of paper currency is proportioned to the uſes for it, it muſt be beneficial; and therefore to ſink it below that quantity, muſt be prejudicial.</note> ſinks our paper currency very faſt. The former ſweeps off our ſilver and gold in a torrent to <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and leaves us continually toiling to ſupply from a number of diſtant ſprings the continually waſting ſtream.</p>
            <p>THUS drained, we are prohibited by new and ſtricter reſtraints being laid on our trade, from procuring theſe coins as we uſed to do; and from inſtituting among ourſelves bills of credit in the place of ſuch portions of them as are required in our internal traffic; and in this exhauſted condition, our languiſhing country is to ſtrive to take up and to totter under the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional burthen of the STAMP ACT.</p>
            <p>IN defence of the prohibition to inſtitute <hi>bills of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,</hi> it may be said, "that ſome few colonies, by injudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious emiſſions of paper currency, did great injury to indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals."

It is true: But it is as true, that others<note n="‡" place="bottom">No attempt was ever made in this province and ſome others, to pay <hi>Engliſh</hi> debts any otherwiſe than according to the rate of exchange; and no complaint was ever made of injuſtice from the depreciation of the currency.</note> always ſupported the credit of their bills in ſuch a manner, that their emiſſions were of vaſt benefit both to the provinces and to <hi>Great-Britain.</hi> The inconveniencies under which the colonies laboured before theſe emiſſions are well remembred, and were produced by the ſame cauſe that diſtreſſes us at this time; that is, by <hi>Great-Britain's</hi> taking off all our gold and ſilver. There was then ſo little money among ſeveral of them, that a ſtop was put in a manner to buying and ſelling, and even ſhop-keepers were obliged to barter their goods for food. The effect produced by theſe emiſſions was ſurprizing—Trade revived; and the remarkable and immediate<note n="§" place="bottom">

                  <p>In the year 1723 the firſt bills of credit were emitted in <hi>Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania,</hi> to the value of £ 45000. In 1728, part of the firſt emiſſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then ſunk, £ 30000 more were emitted. It appears from the account above, that in ſeven years from 1723 to 1730, the exports increaſed £ 32 599 8 1 ſterling.—In 1738, great part of the preceding emiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons being then ſunk, there was an emiſſion and re-emiſſion amounting in the whole to £ 80000. In five years afterwards it appears by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count above, the exports increaſed near £ 20000 ſterling.</p>
                  <p>In later times when larger emiſſions have been made, the exports have proportionably increaſed. In 1753 £ 55000 were emitted; and in 1756 £ 30000—In 1757, the exports amounted to £ 268 426 6 6—After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our emiſſions were ſtill greater, and in one year of the war, the exports roſe to more than £ 700,000 ſterling.</p>
                  <p>It is not pretended, that the increaſe of our importations is <hi>ſolely</hi> ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the emiſſions of paper money; but it is thought to be a very great cauſe of that increaſe. It is undoubtedly owing in part to the increaſe of people by propagation, and the influx of foreigners. But ſuch <hi>great</hi> and <hi>ſudden</hi> increaſes as have been mentioned in the ſhort ſpace of ſeven or five years, from 1723 to 1730, and from 1737 to 1742, could not in any great degree proceed from the increaſe by propagation; and at that time I think foreigners did not flow in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us in ſuch numbers as they ſince have done. In the war large ſums were brought among us for the maintenance of the fleets and armies, it is true: but that our currency was then of great utility is evident, becauſe when the greateſt quantity of it was paſſing, bills of exchange were lower than they were for a long time before, or have been ſince.</p>
                  <p>It may be objected, that the complaint of the ſcarcity of money in <hi>America,</hi> particularly in this province, cannot be well founded, as we have lately had ſuch large emiſſions. I am very ſenſible how liable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are to errors in queſtions of this nature, and therefore I think my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf obliged to ſpeak with diffidence on the ſubject. Perhaps the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obſervations may in ſome meaſure anſwer the objection. 1ſt. About one half of the emiſſions is ſunk 2dly A very great part of the bills now circulating, are paſſing in the neighbouring provinces. 3dly. Our gold and ſilver are ſent to <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> ſo that but ſmall quantities thereof are now current among us—and therefore we muſt almoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely rely on our paper for the medium of domeſtic commerce. Laſtly, It does not ſeem probable, that we ſhould have heard ſuch great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of the ſcarcity of money, if the extreme reſtrictions of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, had not ſo generally prevented our uſual methods of acquiring it.</p>

<pb n="10" facs="unknown:009950_0009_0F7B3AC41EC136F8"/>
inconveniences were feared from this kind of currency, means might have been found to prevent them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out utterly aboliſhing it: but now, the apprehenſion of miſchiefs that might have been more eaſily obviated, has deprived us of real benefits.</p>
            <p>PERHAPS no mode could be devis'd more advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the public, or to individuals, than our method of emitting bills in this province for our own uſe. They are lent out upon good ſecurity, chiefly real, at the intereſt of <hi>five per cent.</hi> The borrowers are allowed a long term for payment, and the ſums borrowed being divided into equal portions, they are obliged to pay one of theſe with the intereſt of the whole, every year during the term. This renders the payments very eaſy; and as no perſon
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:009950_0010_0F7B3AC4C3A39078"/>
is permitted to borrow a large ſum, a great number are accommodated. The conſequences of ſuch regulations are obvious. Theſe bills repreſent money in the ſame manner that money repreſents other things. As long therefore as the quantity is proportioned to the uſes, theſe emiſſions have the ſame effects, that the gradual introduction of additional ſums of money would have. People of very ſmall fortunes are enabled to purchaſe and cultivate land, which is of ſo much conſequence in ſettling new countries, or to carry on ſome buſineſs, that without ſuch aſſiſtance they would be incapable of managing: For no private perſon would lend money on ſuch favourable terms. From the borrowers the currency paſſes into other hands, encreaſes conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, raiſes the prices of commodities, quickens circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and after communicating a vigour to all kinds of induſtry, returns in its courſe into the poſſeſſion of the borrowers, to repay them for that labour which it may properly be ſaid to have produced. They deliver it, according to the original contracts, into the treaſury, where the intereſt raiſes a fund without the impoſition of taxes, for the public uſe.</p>
            <p>WHILE emiſſions are thus conducted with prudence, they may be compared to ſprings, whoſe water an induſtrious and knowing farmer ſpreads in many mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering rivulets through his gardens and meadows, and after it has refreſhed all the vegetable tribes it meets with, and has ſet them a growing, leads it into a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cevoir, where it anſwers ſome new purpoſe.</p>
            <p>IF it could be poſſible to eſtabliſh a currency through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the colonies, on ſome foundation of this kind, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps greater benefits might be derived from it, than would be generally believed without the trial.</p>

WITH reſpect to the rſtrictions laid on our trade to <hi>foreign plantations,</hi> it has been alledg'd, as a reaſon for them, "that our iſlands ought to be encouraged."

            <p>THERE is a vaſt difference to be made in calculating the gains of any particular branch of buſineſs to the <hi>public,</hi> and to <hi>individuals.</hi> The advantages to the laſt may be ſmall, and yet great to the firſt, or the reverſe.

ſhould ſave in that way, would be chiefly ſpent in this. It may alſo juſtly be added, that our commerce with the foreign plantations, carries to them very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable quantities of <hi>Britiſh</hi> manufactures, for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.<note n="†" place="bottom">See the preceding note.</note>

            <p>IF our importations from them ſhould be re-exported to <hi>Europe,</hi> the profits would center in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> according to the uſual courſe of our trade. The ſtatute paſſed in the twenty-fifth year of <hi>Charles</hi> the ſecond, indeed mentions this practice as injurious.

            <p>THE reſtriction alſo with regard to our iron, is thought particularly ſevere.

Not to inſiſt on the merely po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical advantage of having a commerce with that <hi>proteſtant</hi> kingdom, which by being beneficial to her, may more firmly attach her to our intereſt, it may be obſerved, that the trade of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> to <hi>Sweden,</hi> it is for iron in the groſs, which is afterwards worked up, and large quantities of it re<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>exported; ſo that money may thereby be brought into the kingdom, and a great number of hands is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed. There is a vaſt difference between this trade, and that to <hi>France,</hi> from whence the importations into <hi>Great-Britain</hi> are merely for conſumption, without affording any employment to her people, or any profit by re-exportation. Beſides, if the colonies can get more by carrying their iron to foreign ports, than to <hi>Great Britain,</hi> (and if they cannot, there is no occaſion of a law to compel them to carry it to <hi>Great-Britain</hi>) they will be more able to make larger demands for <hi>Britiſh</hi> manufactures; ſo that <hi>Great-Britain</hi> will gain the profits of our iron, to make up her loſs by what ſhe takes form <hi>Sweden.</hi>

metal, proviſions and lumber, have been found to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer very well at the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> and ſome other mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets; and as the laſt articles are frequently very low, and our foreign trade is reduced to ſo few commodities, the taking away any one of them muſt be hurtful to us. Indeed, to require us to ſend all our iron to <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> is, in the opinion of ſome of our moſt judicious merchants, to require an impoſſibility: For as this article is ſo heavy, and ſuch ſmall quantities can be ſent in one veſſel, they aſſert, that we cannot find freight directly home for one half of it.</p>
            <p>BESIDES the circumſtances already mentioned to prove the injurious conſequences of the late reſtrictions, there is another, which has great force in perſuading me that our trade ought by all means to be more encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged and extended at this time, than was formerly neceſſary. Our ſettlements then comprehended only a narrow ſtrip along the ſhore of the ocean; they were leſs populous; and their diſtance from the ſea ports
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:009950_0017_0F7B3ACC441A52D0"/>
being ſmall, they were ſupplied with every thing they wanted from thence, without any length of inland carriage. But now we have penetrated boundleſs foreſts, have paſſed over immenſe mountains, and are daily puſhing further and further into the wilderneſs, the inhabitants of theſe remote regions, muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity hold very little intercourſe with thoſe which are near the ſea, unleſs a very extenſive commerce ſhall enable theſe to ſupply them with ſuch quantities of<note n="*" place="bottom">It is apprehended, that if the greateſt part of the commodities de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the back country ſhould not be <hi>Britiſh</hi> but <hi>Weſt Indian,</hi> yet it muſt be beneficial to <hi>Great-Britain</hi> to promote this trade by all means. For if the country nearer the ſea grows rich by ſupplying them with the productions of the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> theſe will certainly conſume greater quantities of <hi>Britiſh</hi> manufactures.</note> foreign commodities as they want, and at ſuch prices as they can afford to pay. Every reſtriction on our trade, ſeems to be a reſtriction on this intercourſe, and muſt gradually cut off the connection of the interior parts with the maritime and the mother country.</p>
            <p>But it is unneceſſary to endeavour to prove by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning on theſe things, that we <hi>ſhall ſuffer,</hi> for we <hi>already ſuffer.</hi> Trade is decaying; and all credit is expiring.<note n="†" place="bottom">It is ſaid that in <hi>Virginia,</hi> the ſheriffs, inſtead of raiſing the annual levies, have been obliged to make returns into the treaſury, of enects which they have taken in execution, but could not tell, as there were no bidders for ready money.</note> Money is become ſo extremely ſcarce, that reputable freeholders find it impoſſible to pay debts which are trifling in compariſon to their eſtates. If creditors ſue, and take out executions, the lands and perſonal eſtate, as the ſale muſt be for ready money, are ſold for a ſmall part of what they were worth when the debts were contracted. The debtors are ruined. The cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors get but part of their debts, and that ruins them.
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:009950_0018_0F7B3ACE6F739928"/>
Thus the conſumers break the ſhop-keepers; they break the merchants; and the ſhock muſt be felt as far as <hi>London.</hi> Fortunate, indeed, is the man who can get ſatisfaction <hi>in Money</hi> for any part of his debt, in ſome counties; for in many inſtances, after lands and goods have been repeatedly advertiſed in the public gazettes, and expoſed to ſale, not a buyer appears.</p>
            <p>BY theſe means multitudes are already ruined, and the eſtates of others are melting away in the ſame manner. It muſt ſtrike any one with great ſurprize and concern, to hear of the number of debtors diſcharged every court by our inſolvent act. Though our courts are held every quarter, yet at the laſt term for the county of <hi>Philadelphia</hi> alone, no leſs than thirty-five perſons ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied for the benefit of that act. If it be conſidered, that this law extends only to thoſe who do not owe any ſingle debt above £ 150, that many are daily releaſed by the lenity of their creditors, and that many more remove, without their knowledge, it will not be difficult to form a judgment of the condition to which the people are reduced.</p>
            <p>IF theſe effects are produced already, what can we expect, when the ſame cauſes ſhall have operated longer? What can we expect, when the exhauſted co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies ſhall feel the STAMP ACT drawing off, as it were, the laſt drops of their blood? From whence is the ſilver to come, with which the taxes impoſed by this act, and the duties impoſed by other late acts, are to be paid? Or how will our <hi>merchants</hi> and the <hi>lower ranks of people,</hi> on whom the force of theſe regulations will fall firſt, and with the greateſt violence, bear this additional load?</p>

THESE laſt are to be conſidered in a very different light from thoſe of the ſame claſſes in <hi>Great-Britain. There</hi> the nature of their employments, and the plenty of money give them very little occaſion to make contracts in writing; but <hi>here</hi> they are continually making them, and are obliged to do ſo The STAMP ACT, therefore, will be ſeverely felt by <hi>theſe,</hi> in whoſe welfare the proſperity of a ſtate is always ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted; and<note n="*" place="bottom">In the preſent ſcarcity of money, the ſellers of lands, negroes, &amp;c. &amp;c. always inſiſt on having part of the purchaſe-money in hand—The buyers, unleſs they happen to be rich men, find it impoſſible to comply with this term, unleſs they borrow money, which cannot now be done but in very ſmall parcels from different perſons.—Each of theſe muſt have a bond; and each of thoſe bonds muſt pay a ſtamp-duty of one ſhilling ſterling, if the ſum be above ten pounds and under twenty—and if above twenty pounds and under forty, one ſhilling and ſix <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

            <p>NEITHER are the merchants here by any means able to bear taxes, as they do at home. A very great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them there put ſuch ſtocks into trade, as would be thought large fortunes among us; and our mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants would think themſelves very happy to leave off buſineſs with ſuch eſtates as the others begin with. I ſpeak of the merchants in general; for we have on the continent individuals who are rich, but their number
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:009950_0020_0F7B3ACF4D844420"/>
is too inconſiderable to deſerve any notice or this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. Beſides, the intereſt of money being lower at home than it is here, thoſe who trade on borrowed ſtocks, can do it to much greater advantage there than we can. Indeed, among us it is almoſt impoſſible to get money to trade upon at any rate. How unequal, under the preſent diſadvantages, a merchant's commerce will be to the payment of all the taxes impoſed by the STAMP ACT on his policies, fees with clerks, charter parties, proteſts, his other notarial acts his letters, and even his advertiſements, experience, I am afraid will unhappily prove.</p>
            <p>THUS, I apprehend, that this Act will be extremely heavy on thoſe who are leaſt able to bear it; and if our merchants and people of little ſubſtance languiſh under it, all others muſt be affected. Our mode of taxation, hath always been by making as exact an eſtimate as could be formed of each man's eſtate; by which means, our taxes have been proportioned to the abilities of thoſe who were to pay them. Few perſons are employed in the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of them; their allowance is very moderate; and therefore the expence is ſmall. No exceſſive penalties, no tribes of informers, no dreadful and deteſtable courts are neceſſary. This I imagine, is the mode of taxation, which in young colonies, will be found to be leaſt oppreſſive and deſtructive, and certainly the moſt equal: But by the Stamp Act, the<note n="‡" place="bottom">If a rich man buys land, it is generally from the diſtreſſed, and therefore the ſellers ſituation will oblige him to pay for the deed, when the other inſiſts on it; and when a man borrows money, every body knows who pays for the bonds and mortgages.</note> wealthy who have money to let out at intereſt, or to make purchaſes, and undoubtedly ought to pay the moſt towards the public charges, will eſcape theſe taxes, while the whole

weight of them will fall on the neceſſitous and induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, who moſt of all require relief and encouragement.</p>
            <p>BUT it may be ſaid, "That the merchants will not be affected by theſe taxes, becauſe they will raiſe the prices of their goods in proportion, and that at length <hi>all taxes muſt ariſe from lands.</hi>"</p>
            <p>THIS rule ſeems more applicable to very populous and rich countries, where the manufacturers and land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders through neceſſity or the force of faſhions, have preſſing demands upon the merchants, than to ſuch a country as this, where a great majority of the people live on their lands in a very plain way. For by practiſing a ſtrict frugality and induſtry, <hi>we</hi> may render ourſelves more independent of the merchants, than the circumſtances of more populous and wealthy ſtates will permit the other claſſes of their people to be. The high prices therefore which our merchants impoſe upon their goods, will diſcourage the ſale of them, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently they muſt "be affected by the taxes," which oblige them to raiſe the prices in this manner.</p>
            <p>HOWEVER, granting that all taxes muſt ariſe from lands; it follows, that where the profits of the lands are ſmall, they can bear but ſmall taxes. The more labour is beſtowed on them, the greater the profits <hi>will</hi> be, and the <hi>taxes may</hi> be. In old populous countries there is an opportunity of beſtowing this labour, and the manner of doing it is well underſtood. Thus in <hi>England,</hi> the profits of land are ſo great, as to ſupport a very large number of nobility and gentry in ſplendor, and to afford means of raiſing taxes to an amazing amount. Nor are the workers of the land unrewarded; for the farmers have ſuch long leaſes, and other encouragements, that they thrive and live com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably, and many of them are very wealthy.</p>

            <p>WE are informed, that an opinion has been indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriouſly propagated in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> that the colonies are<note n="§" place="bottom">
                  <p>"It is certain, that from the very time Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh,</hi> the father of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> colonies, and his aſſociates, had projected theſe eſtabliſhments, there have been perſons who have found an intereſt, in <hi>miſrepreſenting,</hi> or leſſening the value of them—The attempts were called chimerical and dangerous. Afterwards many malignant ſuggeſtions were made about ſacrificing ſo many <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> to the obſtinate deſire of ſettling colonies in countries which then produced very little ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. But as theſe difficulties were gradually ſurmounted, thoſe complaints vaniſhed. No ſooner were <hi>theſe lamentations</hi> over, but <hi>others</hi> aroſe in their ſtead; when it could be no longer ſaid, that the colonies were <hi>uſeleſs,</hi> it was alledged that they were not <hi>uſeful enough</hi> to their mother country; that, while we were loaded with taxes, they were abſolutely free; that the <hi>planters</hi> lived like <hi>princes,</hi> while the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>England</hi> laboured hard for a tolerable ſubſiſtence. This produced cuſtoms and impoſitions, which, if grievous to the plantations, muſt turn to our diſadvantage, as well as theirs, and conſequently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come detrimental to both.</p>
                  <bibl>POSTLETHWAYT'S univ. dict. of trade and commerce.</bibl>
                  <p>In purſuance of this deſign to bring down the pride of theſe PRINCELY PLANTERS, ſuch heavy impoſitions were laid in <hi>Great-Britain</hi> on to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco, that the inhabitants of <hi>Maryland</hi> and <hi>Virginia</hi> were diſcouraged from raiſing it. Then the mother country FELT her error, and theſe PRINCES were found to be very poor people. The ſame <hi>unhappy ſpirit</hi> is now producing the ſame miſtake. There wants but a very little more weight upon <hi>Maryland</hi> and <hi>Virginia,</hi> to prevent their raiſing tobacco, and to make them and all their ſiſter colonies ſink under their multiplied burthens.</p>

under an enormous load of debt. Never was there a greater miſtake. This opinion has ariſen from ſlight obſervations made in our cities during the late war, when large ſums of money were ſpent here in ſupport of fleets and armies. Our productions were then in great demand, and trade flouriſhed. Having a number of ſtrangers among us, the people na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally not ungenerous or inhoſpitable, indulged themſelves in many uncommon expences. But the cauſe of this gaiety has ceaſed, and all the effect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, is, that we are to be treated as a rich people, when we are really poor. <hi>Tully</hi> mentions a man who loſt an honourable office, by the homely entertainment he gave the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> when he could have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded a better; but we have loſt vaſtly more by the imprudent exceſs of kindneſs, with which we have
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:009950_0024_0F7B3AD5344871F8"/>
treated the people of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> who have come among us, at an expence that did not ſuit our fortunes.</p>
            <p>To all the diſadvantages that have been mentioned, it muſt be added, that our markets are much more precarious than thoſe at home. It is computed, that one half of the people there live in cities, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently there muſt be a perpetual domeſtic demand for the productions of the earth; and foreign markets are not far diſtant for the overplus. Here the quantity ſold for conſumption among us is ſmall, and moſt of the foreign markets are very remote.</p>
            <p>THESE reaſons induce me to think, that the colonies, unleſs ſome fortunate events, not to be expected, ſhould happen, cannot bear the reſtrictions and taxations laid upon them by their mother country, without ſuffering very ſeverely. What then can we do? Which way ſhall we turn ourſelves? How may we mitigate the miſeries of our country? <hi>Great-Britain</hi> gives us an example to guide us. SHE TEACHES US TO MAKE A DI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STINCTION BETWEEN HER INTERESTS AND OUR OWN. Teaches! She requires—commands—inſiſts upon it—threatens—compels—and even diſtreſſes us into it.</p>
            <p>WE have our choice of theſe two things—to continue our preſent limited and diſadvantageous commerce—or to promote manufactuers among our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, with a habit of oeconomy, and thereby remove the neceſſity we are now under of being ſupplied by <hi>Great-Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is not difficult to determine which of theſe things is moſt eligible. Could the laſt of them be only ſo far
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:009950_0025_0F7BD00DE115B230"/>
executed, as to bring our demand for <hi>Britiſh</hi> manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures below the profits of our foreign trade, and the amount of our commodities immediately remitted home, theſe colonies might revive and flouriſh. States and families are enriched by the ſame means; that is, by being ſo induſtrious an I frugal, as to ſpend leſs than what they <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> can pay for.</p>
            <p>WE have examples in this province, which if imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by others, muſt unavoidably produce the moſt happy effects for us: I mean the examples of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious, frugal, honeſt <hi>Germans.</hi> Their lands are as well cultivated as they can be in this new country, and they have the good ſenſe to require very little proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and cloaths more than they can get from their own farms, and make with their own hands. If we only conſider for a moment the conſequences of ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, ſhould it be general, we muſt be convinced it muſt produce commerce, ſince all ſuperfluities would be exported; and the Owners having few demands in return, <hi>that commerce</hi> would of courſe produce wealth.</p>
            <p>INDEED we ſhall be compelled, I apprehend, generally to imitate theſe examples. The late regulations, and our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant remittances to <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> have extremely leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened the quantity of money among us, and yet theſe remittances are not ſufficient to pay for thoſe things we want from home. Neceſſity will teach us two ways to relieve ourſelves. The one is, to keep the <hi>Britiſh</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures we purchaſe longer in uſe or wear than we have been accuſtomed to do. The other is, to ſupply their place by manufactures of our own. I dont ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe our difficulties will <hi>immediately</hi> produce expert ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts among us; but as the inhabitants here generally
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:009950_0026_0F7B3AD6C5DCBF68"/>
reſide on their lands, and live in a plain ruſtic way, they will be able to ſupply themſelves with many arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. Some author, and I think <hi>Keyſler,</hi> ſays, that in <hi>Switzerland,</hi> every family has all the trades in it that are neceſſary for its uſe. Their work is not, it may be preſumed, at all in the taſte of <hi>London</hi> or <hi>Paris,</hi> but it ſerves their purpoſe; and their coarſe cloaths and ſimple furniture enable them to live in plenty, and to defend their liberty. Something of this kind will be, nay, already is, practiſed by us. It is ſurpriſing to ſee the linen and cloth that have been lately made among us. Many gentlemen in this city dreſs now in ſuits produced, manufactured, and made up in this province. The cloth is not equal in fineneſs to the beſt broad-cloth, but it is warm, ſtrong, and not very homely; and when the <hi>Britiſh</hi> workmen underſtand that they may meer with better encouragement here than they do at home, I believe in a few years we ſhall have very different kinds of cloth among us from theſe we now make. Inſtances are not wanting to juſtify the moſt ſanguine expectations on this head. <hi>Spain</hi> uſed formerly to be entirely ſupplied with cloths from <hi>England;</hi> but in the reigns only of their two laſt kings, <hi>Philip</hi> the Vth, and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the VIth, their manufactures have been improved to ſuch a degree, even by that proud and indolent people, that this commerce has entirely ceaſed in moſt parts of that kingdom. The ſame thing has happened in <hi>France,</hi> notwithſtanding the deſtructive wars in which ſhe has been continually involved. <hi>Switzerland</hi> ſome time ago ſpent large ſums of money in foreign commodities, but now they make excellent cloths, and good ſink, though the ſcheme at firſt laboured under very great difficulties. That country uſed alſo to be ſupplied by <hi>Savoy</hi> with

wine; but the Duke laying a duty upon it, the <hi>Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers</hi> remonſtrated, but in vain. At laſt ſome of the principal men promoted the cultivation of vines, though their predeceſſors had never planted any. The reſult exceeded their hopes.<note n="‡" place="bottom">

            <p>"BEFORE the ſettlement of theſe colonies," ſays <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtlethwayt,</hi> "our manufactures were few, and thoſe but indifferent, In thoſe days we had not only our naval ſtores, but our ſhips from our neighbours. <hi>Germany</hi> furniſhed us with all things made of metal, even to nails.

            <p>THE aſtoniſhing alterations in all theſe particulars, are too well known to need enumeration.</p>
            <p>THESE inſtances, and many others that might be mentioned, may convince us, that nothing is too dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult for men to effect, whoſe hearts are filled with a generous love of their country; and they may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the world of the dangers that attend provoking innovations in commerce. A branch of trade once loſt, is loſt for ever. In ſhort, ſo ſtrong a ſpirit is raiſed in theſe colonies by late meaſures, and ſuch ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:009950_0028_0F7BD010F630ECC0"/>
efforts are already made among us, that it cannot be doubted, that before the end of this century, the modern regulations will teach <hi>America,</hi> that ſhe has reſources within herſelf, of which ſhe never otherwiſe would have thought. Individuals, perhaps, may find their benefit in oppoſing her uſe of theſe reſources; but I hope very, very few, will wiſh to receive benefits by ſuch means. The man who would promote his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts by injuring his country, is unworthy of the bleſſings of ſociety.</p>
            <p>IT has hitherto been thought, by the people of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and I hope it will ſtill be thought, that ſufficient advantages are derived by her from the colonies, without laying taxes upon them. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent them as an "expenſive appendage of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> empire, that can no other way repay the trouble and treaſure they coſt her," is certainly one of the greateſt errors; and to ſpend much time in refuting this notion, would be unneceſſary. Every advantage accruing to the colonies by their connection with the mother country, is <hi>amply</hi>—<hi>dearly</hi>—paid for, by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits derived to her from them, and by the reſtrictions of their commerce. Theſe benefits have been allowed by the beſt writers to be immenſe, and<note n="‡" place="bottom">Chiefly; even the ſupplying her with naval ſtores, &amp;c being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable, when compared with the other advantages.</note> conſiſt in the various employment and the ſupport they afford her people. If the colonies enable <hi>her</hi> to pay taxes, is it not as uſeful to her, as if <hi>they</hi> paid them? Or, indeed, may not the colonies with the ſtricteſt propriety be ſaid to pay a great part of thoſe taxes, when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the <hi>Britiſh</hi> manufactures loaded with the advanced prices occaſioned by ſuch taxes? Or, further, as the colonies are compelled to take thoſe manufactures thus

               <note n="‡" place="bottom">
                  <p>"If it be aſked, whether foreigners, for what goods they take of us, do not pay on <hi>that conſumption</hi> a great portion of our taxes? It is admitted they do."</p>

                  <p>By the conſumption of <hi>Britiſh</hi> manufactures in <hi>America,</hi> we pay a heavier tax to <hi>Great Britain,</hi> than if they were conſumed at home. For in the bringing them here, a vaſt number of merchants, factors, brokers and ſeamen are employed, every one of which muſt have ſuch a profit, as will enable him to ſupport himſelf and his family, if he has any, in a country where every thing is dear by reaſon of the high taxes.</p>
                  <p>So far was the parliament from thinking in the laſt war, that any further taxes ſhould be laid on the colonies, ſo convinced indeed were they that we had exceeded our abilities in the ſupplies we gave to the crown, that ſeveral ſums of money were granted to us as indemnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations for the too heavy expence in which we had involved ourſelves.</p>
                  <p>The ſums thus given, paid part of our debts, but we are ſtill labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the remainder.</p>
               </note> loaded, when they might furniſh themſelves ſo much cheaper from other countries, may not the difference between theſe prices be called an <hi>enormous tax</hi> paid by them to <hi>Great Britain?</hi> May they not alſo be ſaid to pay <hi>an enormous tax</hi> to her, by being compelled to carry their moſt valuable productions <hi>to her alone,</hi> and to receive what ſhe pleaſes to give for them, when they might ſell them at other markets to much greater advantage? Laſtly, may they not be ſaid to pay a heavy tax to her, in being prohibited from carrying on ſuch manufactures as they could have employed themſelves in with advantage, and thus being obliged to reſort to her for thoſe things with which they might ſupply themſelves? If theſe things are ture, and can they be denied! may not the mother country more juſtly be called <hi>expenſive</hi> to her colonies, than they can be called <hi>expenſive</hi> to her?</p>
            <p>WHAT would <hi>France</hi> give for ſuch <hi>expenſive</hi> domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions? Would ſhe refuſe the empire of <hi>North-America,</hi> unleſs the inhabitants would ſubmit to any taxes ſhe ſhould pleaſe to impoſe?

be wretched enough to require it, for one half of the emoluments <hi>Great-Britain</hi> receives from them? In ſhort, the amazing increaſe of the wealth and ſtrength of this kingdom, ſince the reign of queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> in whoſe time the colonies began to be ſettled, appears to be a ſufficient proof of their importance: And therefore I think it may juſtly be ſaid, that THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE POWER AND GLORY OF GREAT BRITAIN ARE LAID IN AMERICA.</p>
            <p>WHEN the advantages derived by the mother coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try from her colonies are ſo<note n="‡" place="bottom">Vide notes to page 4.</note> 
               <hi>important</hi> and <hi>evident,</hi> it is amazing, that any perſons ſhould venture to aſſert, "that ſhe poured out her wealth and blood in the late war, <hi>only for their defence and benefit;</hi> and that ſhe cannot be recompenſed for this expence and loſs, <hi>but by taxing them."</hi>

            <p>IF any man who does not chuſe to ſpend much time in conſidering this ſubject, would only read the ſpeeches from the throne during that period, with the addreſſes in anſwer to them, he will ſoon be convinced <hi>for whoſe benefit Great-Britain</hi> thought ſhe was exerting herſelf. For my part, I ſhould not now be ſurprized, if thoſe who maintain the abovementioned aſſertions, ſhould contend, that <hi>Great Britain</hi> ought to tax <hi>Protugal.</hi> For was not that kingdom "defended by the troops and treaſure of <hi>Great-Britain?</hi>" And how can ſhe be "otherwiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſed for this expence and loſs?" If the protection of <hi>Portugal,</hi> though no taxes are received from thence, was beneficial to <hi>Great Britain,</hi> infinitely more ſo was the protection of the colonies.</p>
            <p>SO far I muſt beg leave to diſſent from theſe gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that if the colonies, by an increaſe of induſtry
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:009950_0031_0F7BD0149C0779E0"/>

If it be conſiderable, it muſt alſo be hurtful in another reſpect.</p>
            <p>It muſt be granted, that it is not merely the bringing money into a nation that makes it wealthy, but the bringing money into it by the general induſtry of its inhabitants. A country may perpetually receive vaſt ſums, and yet be perpetually poor. It muſt alſo be granted, that almoſt all the money acquired by the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies in their other branches of trade, is ſpent by them in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and finds employment for her people. Whatever then leſſens the ſum ſo ſpent, muſt leſſen that employment. This I think will be one conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the STAMP ACT: For our demand will be as much leſs for <hi>Britiſh</hi> manufactures, as the amount of the ſums raiſed by the taxes. So much the fewer <hi>Britiſh</hi> merchants, artiſts, ſeamen and ſhips will be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by us, and ſo much the more diſtreſſed at firſt, and afterwards ſo much the more frugal,<note n="‖" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Great-Britain</hi> will not only loſe in ſuch caſe, the annual amount of the taxes, but the people of <hi>America</hi> eſtabliſhing manufactures through diſcontent, will in time entirely withdraw their intercourſe with her—And therefore her loſs of the whole <hi>American</hi> trade, may be juſtly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to this inauſpicious beginning.</note> ingenious, laborious and independent will the coloniſts become.</p>
            <p>It is evident from the concurrent teſtimony of her own moſt noted authors on this ſubject, that <hi>Great-Britain</hi> is ſure of having our money at<note n="*" place="bottom">See notes to page 4.</note> laſt; and it appears no difficult matter to determine, whether it is better to take it in taxes or trade.—Suppoſe the

Or rather what would ſhe not loſe, by attempting to advance her revenue by means ſo diſtreſſing to commerce?</p>
            <p>BUT if the late reſtrictions ſhall not prove <hi>profitable,</hi> perhaps they may by ſome be called <hi>prudent</hi> for another reaſon. We are informed that many perſons at home affect to ſpeak of the <hi>coloniſts,</hi> as of a people deſigning and endeavouring to render themſelves independent, and therefore it may be ſaid to be proper as much as poſſible to depreſs them. This method for ſecuring obedience, has been tried by many powerful nations, and ſeems to be the conſtant policy of commonwealths: But the attempt in almoſt every inſtance from <hi>Athens</hi> down to <hi>Genoa,</hi> has been unſucceſsful. Many ſtates and kingdoms have loſt their dominions by ſeverity and an unjuſt jealouſy. I remember none that have been loſt by kindneſs and a generous confidence.

                  <p>"All wiſe ſtates will well conſider how to preſerve the advantages ariſing from colonies, and avoid the evils. And I conceive that there can be but TWO ways in nature to hinder them from throwing off their dependence; <hi>one,</hi> to keep it out of their <hi>power,</hi> and the <hi>other,</hi> out of their <hi>will.</hi> The <hi>firſt</hi> muſt be by <hi>force;</hi> and the <hi>latter,</hi> by <hi>uſing them well,</hi> and keeping them employed in ſuch productions, and making ſuch manufactures, as will ſupport themſelves and families comfortably, <hi>and procure them wealth too,</hi> and at leaſt not prejudice their mother country.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Force</hi> can never be uſed effectually to anſwer the end, <hi>without deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the colonies themſelves.</hi> Liberty and encouragement are neceſſary to carry people thither, and to keep them together when they are there; and violence will hinder both. Any body of troops conſiderable enough to awe them, and keep them in ſubjection under the direction too of a needy governor, often ſent thither to make his fortune, and at ſuch a diſtance from any application for redreſs, will ſoon put an end to all planting, and leave the country to the ſoldiers alone, and if it did not, <hi>would eat up all the profit of the colony.</hi> For this reaſon, arbitrary coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries have not been equally ſucceſsful in planting colonies with free ones, and what they have done in that kind, has either been by force at a vaſt expence, or <hi>by departing from the nature of their government,</hi> and <hi>giving ſuch privileges to planters</hi> as were <hi>denied to their other ſubjects.</hi> And I dare ſay, that a few prudent laws, and a little prudent conduct, would ſoon give us far the greateſt ſhare of the riches of all <hi>America,</hi> perhaps drive many of other nations out of it, or into our colonies for ſhelter.</p>
                  <p>There are <hi>ſo many exigencies</hi> in all ſtates, <hi>ſo many foreign wars,</hi> and <hi>domeſtic diſturbances,</hi> that theſe colonies CAN NEVER WANT OPPORTU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NITIES, if they watch for them, <hi>to do what they ſhall find their intereſt to do;</hi> and therefore we ought to take all the precautions in our power, that it ſhall never be <hi>their intereſt</hi> to act againſt that of their native country; an evil which can no otherwiſe be averted, than by keeping them <hi>fully employed</hi> in ſuch trades <hi>as will increaſe their own,</hi> as well as our wealth; for it is much to be feared, if we do not find employment for <hi>them,</hi> they may find it for <hi>us.</hi> The intereſt of the mother country, is always to keep them dependent, and ſo employed; and it requires, all her addreſs to do it; and it is certainly more <hi>eaſily</hi> and <hi>effectually</hi> done by <hi>gentle</hi> and <hi>inſenſible</hi> methods, than by <hi>power</hi> alone."</p>

            <p>BUT if this event ſhall ever happen, which Providence I hope will never permit, it muſt be when the preſent generation and the preſent ſet of ſentiments are extinct. Late meaſures have indeed excited an univerſal and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exampled grief and indignation throughout the colonies. What man who wiſhes the welfare of <hi>America,</hi> can view without pity, without paſſion, her reſtricted and almoſt ſtagnated trade, with its numerous train of evils—taxes

torn from her without her conſent—Her legiſlative aſſemblies, the principal pillars of her liberty, cruſhed into inſignificance—A formidable force eſtabliſhed in the midſt of peace, to bleed her into obedience—The ſacred right of trial by jury, violated by the erection of arbitrary and unconſtitutional juriſdictions—and general poverty, diſcontent and deſpondence ſtretching them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves over his unoffending country?</p>
            <p>THE reflections of the coloniſts on theſe melancholy ſubjects, are not a little embittered by a firm perſuaſion, that they never would have been treated as they are, if <hi>Canada</hi> ſtill continued in the hands of the <hi>French.</hi> Thus, their hearts glowing with every ſentiment of duty and affection towards their mother country, and expecting, not unreaſonably perhaps, ſome marks of tenderneſs in return, are pierced by a fatal diſcovery, that the vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

aſſiſtance which they faithfully afforded her in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending her dominions, has only proved the glorious but deſtructive cauſe of the calamities they now deplore and reſent.</p>
            <p>YET ſtill their reſentment is but the reſentment of dutiful children, who have received unmerited blows from a beloved parent. Their obedience to <hi>Great-Britain</hi> is ſecured by the beſt and ſtrongeſt ties, <hi>thoſe of affection;</hi> which alone <hi>can,</hi> and I hope <hi>will</hi> form an everlaſting union between her and her colonies. May no ſucceſſes or ſuſpicions ever tempt <hi>her,</hi> to deviate from the natural generoſity of her ſpirit—And may no dreadful revolution of ſentiments, ever teach <hi>them,</hi> to fear her victories or to repine at her glories.</p>

            <p>I Have omitted mentioning one thing that ſeems to be connected with the foregoing ſubject.</p>
            <p>WITH a vaſt expence of blood and wealth, we fought our way in the late war up to the doors of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> treaſuries, and by the poſſeſſion of <hi>Florida,</hi> might obtain ſome recompence for that expence. <hi>Penſacola</hi> and the other ports in that country, are convenient places, where the <hi>Spaniards</hi> might meet us, and exchange their ſilver for the manufactures of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and the proviſions of theſe colonies. By this means, a commerce inconceivably beneficial to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> ſubjects, might be carried on. This commerce the <hi>Spaniards</hi> wiſh and have endeavoured to carry on. Many hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand dollars have been brought by them to <hi>Penſacola</hi> to lay out there; but the men of war on that ſtation have compelled them to take back their cargoes, <hi>the receipt of which,</hi> it may from thence be preſumed, <hi>would be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to the intereſts of Great Britain.</hi>—Thus we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive leſs advantage from <hi>Florida,</hi> now it belongs to us, than we did when it was poſſeſſed by our enemies; for then by permiſſion from the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> governors, to trade there, we derived conſiderable emoluments from our intercourſe with them.</p>
            <p>UPON what reaſons this conduct is founded, is not eaſy to determine. Sure no one conſiders <hi>Florida</hi> in the ſame light with <hi>theſe colonies,</hi> and thinks that no veſſels ſhould be permitted to trade there, but <hi>Britiſh</hi> ſhipping. This would be to apply the acts of navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:009950_0037_0F7B3ADFCE8387C8"/>
to purpoſes directly oppoſite to the ſpirit of them. They were intended to preſerve an intercourſe between the <hi>mother country</hi> and her <hi>colonies,</hi> and thus to cultivate a <hi>mutual affection;</hi> to promote the intereſts of <hi>both,</hi> by an exchange of <hi>their</hi> moſt valuable productions for <hi>her</hi> manufacutures; thereby to increaſe the ſhipping of both; and thus render them capable of affording aid to each other. Which of theſe purpoſes is anſwered by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting a commerce, that can be no other way carried on? That is, by forbidding the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to bring their wealth <hi>for us</hi> to <hi>Florida,</hi> which is an unhealthy ſand-bank, held by a garriſon, at a great expence of money, and a greater of lives, that cannot for ages, if ever it will, yield a ſingle advantage to <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> but <hi>that</hi> ſhe refuſes to enjoy.</p>
