            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <head>A NARRATIVE, &amp;c.</head>
               <p>IN conſequence of a partial repreſentation of the conduct of the people who were employed to nurſe the ſick, in the late calamitous ſtate of the city of Philadelphia, we are ſolicited, by a number of thoſe who feel themſelves injured thereby, and by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of ſeveral reſpectable citizens, to ſtep forward and declare facts as they really were; ſeeing that from our ſituation, on account of the charge we took upon us, we had it more fully and generally in our power, to know and obſerve the conduct and behavior of thoſe that were ſo employed.</p>
               <p>Early in September, a ſolicitation appeared in the public papers, to the people of colour to come forward and aſſiſt the diſtreſſed, periſhing, and neglected ſick; with a kind of aſſurance, that people of our colour were not liable to take the infection. Upon which we and a few others met and conſulted how to act on ſo truly alarming and melancholy an occaſion. After ſome converſation, we found a freedom to go forth, confiding in him who can preſerve in the midſt of a burning fiery furnace, ſenſible that it was our duty to do all the good we could to our ſuffering fellow mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals. We ſet out to ſee where we could be uſeful. The firſt we viſited was a man in Emſley's alley, who was dying, and his wife lay dead at the time in the houſe, there were none to aſſiſt but two poor helpleſs children. We adminiſtered what relief we could, and applied to the overſeers of the poor to have the woman buried. We viſited upwards of twenty families that
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:027170_0004_0FD3932EF39644B0"/>
day—they were ſcenes of woe indeed! The Lord was pleaſed to ſtrengthen us, and remove all fear from us, and diſpoſed our<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hearts to be as uſeful as poſſible.</p>
               <p>In order the better to regulate our conduct, we cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led on the mayor next day, to conſult with him how to proceed, ſo as to be moſt uſeful. The firſt object he recommended was a ſtrict attention to the ſick, and the procuring of nurſes. This was attended to by Abſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom Jones and William Gray; and, in order that the diſtreſſed might know where to apply, the mayor ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſed the public that upon application to them they would be ſupplied. Soon after, the mortality increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the difficulty of getting a corpſe taken away, was ſuch, that few were willing to do it, when offered great rewards. The black people were looked to. We then offered our ſervices in the public papers, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſing that we would remove the dead and procure nurſes. Our ſervices were the production of real ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility;—we ſought not fee nor reward, until the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the diſorder rendered our labour ſo arduous that we were not adequate to the ſervice we had aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The mortality increaſing rapidly, obliged us to call in the aſſiſtance of five<note n="*" place="bottom">Two of whom were Richard Allen's brothers.</note> hired men, in the awful diſcharge of interring the dead. They with great reluctance, were prevailed upon to join us. It was very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>mmon, at this time, to find any one that would go near, much more, handle, a ſick or dead perſon.</p>
               <p>Mr. Carey, in page 106 of his third edition, has obſerved, that, "for the honor of human nature, it ought to be recorded, that ſome of the convicts in the gaol, a part of the term of whoſe confinement had been remitted as a reward for their peaceable, orderly behavior, voluntarily offered themſelves as nurſes to attend the ſick at Buſh-hill; and have, in that capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, conducted themſelves with great fidelity &amp;c. Here
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:027170_0005_0FD3933095B5FFA8"/>
it ought to be remarked, (although Mr. Carey hath not done it) that two thirds of the perſons, who ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered theſe eſſential ſervices, were people of colour, who, on the application of the elders of the African church, (who met to conſider what they could do for the help of the ſick) were liberated, on condition of their doing the duty of nurſes at the hoſpital at Buſh-hill; which they as voluntarily accepted to do, as they did faithfully diſcharge, this ſevere and diſagreeable duty.—May the Lord reward them, both temporally and ſpiritually.</p>
               <p>When the ſickneſs became general, and ſeveral of the phyſicians died, and moſt of the ſurvivors were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted by ſickneſs or fatigue; that good man, Doctor Ruſh, called us more immediately to attend upon the ſick, knowing we could both bleed; he told us we could increaſe our utility, by attending to his inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and accordingly directed us where to procure medicine duly prepared, with proper directions how to adminiſter them, and at what ſtages of the diſorder to bleed; and when we found ourſelves incapable of judging what was proper to be done, to apply to him, and he would, if able, attend them himſelf, or ſend Edward Fiſher, his pupil, which he often did; and Mr. Fiſher manifeſted his humanity, by an affectionate at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention for their relief.—This has been no ſmall ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to us; for, we think, that when a phyſician was not attainable, we have been the inſtruments, in the hand of God, for ſaving the lives of ſome hundreds of our ſuffering fellow mortals.</p>
               <p>We feel ourſelves ſenſibly aggrieved by the cenſori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous epithets of many, who did not render the leaſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance in the time of neceſſity, yet are liberal of their cenſure of us, for the prices paid for our ſervices, when no one knew how to make a propoſal to any one they wanted to aſſiſt them. At firſt we made no charge, but left it to thoſe we ſerved in removing their dead,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:027170_0006_0FD39331EA543A38"/>
to give what they thought fit—we ſet no price, until the reward was fixed by thoſe we had ſerved. After paying the people we had to aſſiſt us, our compenſation is much leſs than many will believe.</p>
               <p>We do aſſure the public, that <hi>all</hi> the money we have received, for burying, and for coffins which we our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves purchaſed and procured, has not defrayed the expence of wages which we had to pay to thoſe whom we employed to aſſiſt us.

to ſhew our actual ſituation with regard to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit—but it is enough to exhibit to the public, from the above ſpecified items, of <hi>Caſh paid and Caſh received,</hi> without taking into view the other expences, that, by the employment we were engaged in, we have loſt £.177 9 8. But, if the other expences, which we have actually paid, are added to that ſum, how much then may we not ſay we have ſuffered! We leave the public to judge.</p>
               <p>It may poſſibly appear ſtrange to ſome who know how conſtantly we were employed, that we ſhould have received no more Caſh than £.233 10 4. But we repeat our aſſurance, that this is the fact, and we add another, which will ſerve the better to explain it: We have buried <hi>ſeveral hundreds</hi> of poor perſons and ſtrangers, for which ſervice we have never received, nor never aſked any compenſation.</p>
               <p>We feel ourſelves hurt moſt by a partial, cenſorious paragraph, in Mr. Carey's ſecond edition, of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the ſickneſs, &amp;c. in Philadelphia; pages 76 and 77, where he aſperſes the blacks alone, for having taken the advantage of the diſtreſſed ſituation of the people. That ſome extravagant prices were paid, we admit; but how came they to be demanded? the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is plain. It was with difficulty perſons could be had to ſupply the wants of the ſick, as nurſes;—ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications became more and more numerous, the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence was, when we procured them at ſix dollars per week, and called upon them to go where they were wanted, we found they were gone elſewhere; here was a diſappointment; upon enquiring the cauſe, we found, they had been allured away by others who of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered greater wages, until they got from two to four dollars per day. We had no reſtraint upon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. It was natural for people in low circumſtances to accept a voluntary, bounteous reward; eſpecially under the loathſomneſs of many of the ſick, when na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:027170_0008_0FD39338B47CC868"/>
ſhuddered at the thoughts of the infection, and the taſk aſſigned was aggravated by lunacy, and being left much alone with them. Had Mr. Carey been ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited to ſuch an undertaking, for hire, <hi>Query,</hi> "what would <hi>he</hi> have demanded? but Mr. Carey, although choſen a member of that band of worthies who have ſo eminently diſtinguiſhed themſelves by their labours, for the relief of the ſick and helpleſs—yet, quickly after his election, left them to ſtruggle with their arduous and hazardous taſk, by leaving the city. 'Tis true Mr. Carey was no hireling, and had a right to flee, and upon his return, to plead the cauſe of thoſe who fled; yet, we think, he was wrong in giving ſo partial and injurious an account of the black nurſes; if they have taken advantage of the public diſtreſs? Is it any more than he hath done of its deſire for information. We believe he has made more money by the ſale of his "ſcraps" than a dozen of the greateſt extortioners among the black nurſes. The great prices paid did not eſcape the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of that worthy and vigilant magiſtrate, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew Clarkſon, mayor of the city, and preſident of the committee—he ſent for us, and requeſted we would uſe our influence, to leſſen the wages of the nurſes, but on informing him the cauſe, i. e. that of the people over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding one another, it was concluded unneceſſary to attempt any thing on that head; therefore it was left to the people concerned. That there were ſome few black people guilty of plundering the diſtreſſed, we acknowledge; but in that they only are pointed out, and made mention of, we eſteem partial and injurious; we know as many whites who were guilty of it; but this is looked over, while the blacks are held up to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.—Is it a greater crime for a black to pilfer, than for a white to privateer?</p>
               <p>We wiſh not to offend, but when an unprovoked at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt is made, to make us blacker than we are, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes leſs neceſſary to be over cautious on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count;
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:027170_0009_0FD3933A2BEB9760"/>
therefore we ſhall take the liberty to tell of the conduct of ſome of the whites.</p>
               <p>We know ſix pounds was demanded by, and paid, to a white woman, for putting a corpſe into a coffin; and forty dollars was demanded, and paid, to four white men, for bringing it down the ſtairs.</p>
               <p>Mr. and Mrs. Taylor both died in one night; a white woman had the care of them; after they were dead ſhe called on Jacob Servoſs, <abbr>eſq.</abbr> for her pay, demanding ſix pounds for laying them out; upon ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a bundle with her, he ſuſpected ſhe had pilfered; on ſearching her, Mr. Taylor's buckles were found in her pocket, with other things.</p>
               <p>An elderly lady, Mrs. Malony, was given into the care of a white woman, ſhe died, we were called to remove the corpſe, when we came the woman was lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo drunk that ſhe did not know what we were do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but we know ſhe had one of Mrs. Malony's rings on her finger, and another in her pocket.</p>
               <p>Mr. Carey tells us, Buſh-hill exhibited as wretched a picture of human miſery, as ever exiſted. A profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate abandoned ſet of nurſes and attendants (hardly any of good character could at that time be procured,) rioted on the proviſions and comforts, prepared for the ſick, who (unleſs at the hours when the doctors attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) were left almoſt entirely deſtitute of every aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. The dying and dead were indiſcriminately mingled together. The ordure and other evacuations of the ſick, were allowed to remain in the moſt offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſtate imaginable. Not the ſmalleſt appearance of order or regularity exiſted. It was in fact a great hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſlaughter houſe, where numerous victims were immolated at the altar of intemperance.</p>
               <p>It is unpleaſant to point out the bad and unfeeling conduct of any colour, yet the defence we have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken obliges us to remark, that although "hardly any of good character at that time could be procured" yet only two black women were at this time in the hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:027170_0010_0FD3933C220555D8"/>
and they were retained and the others diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when it was reduced to order and good govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The bad conſequences many of our colour apprehend from a partial relation of our conduct are, that it will prejudice the minds of the people in general againſt us—becauſe it is impoſſible that one individual, can have knowledge of all, therefore a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> ſome future day, when ſome of the moſt virtuous, that were upon moſt praiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy motives, induced to ſerve the ſick, may fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſervice of a family that are ſtrangers to him, or her, and it is diſcovered that it is one of thoſe ſtigmatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wretches, what may we ſuppoſe will be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence? Is it not reaſonable to think the perſon will be abhored, deſpiſed, and perhaps diſmiſſed from em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, to their great diſadvantage, would not this be hard? and have we not therefore ſufficient reaſon to ſeek for redreſs? We can with certainty aſſure the public that we have ſeen more humanity, more real ſenſibility from the poor blacks, than from the poor whites. When many of the former, of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord rendered ſervices where extreme neceſſity called for it, the general part of the poor white people were ſo diſmayed, that inſtead of attempting to be uſeful, they in a manner hid themſelves—a remarkable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this—A po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="11" facs="unknown:027170_0011_0FD39342E1C39DA0"/>
poor man with a little water, "Maſter" replied the good natured fellow, "I will ſupply the gentleman with water, but ſurely I will not take your money for it" nor could he be prevailed upon to accept his boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: he went in, ſupplied the poor object with water, and rendered him every ſervice he could.</p>
               <p>A poor black man, named Sampſon, went conſtantly from houſe to houſe where diſtreſs was, and no aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance without fee or reward; he was ſmote with the diſorder, and died, after his death his family were neglected by thoſe he had ſerved.</p>
               <p>Sarah Baſs, a poor black widow, gave all the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance ſhe could, in ſeveral families, for which ſhe did not receive any thing; and when any thing was offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her, ſhe left it to the option of thoſe ſhe ſerved.</p>
               <p>A woman of our colour, nurſed Richard Maſon and ſon, when they died, Richard's widow conſidering the riſk the poor woman had run, and from obſerving the fears that ſometimes reſted on her mind, expected ſhe would have demanded ſomething conſiderable, but upon aſking what ſhe demanded, her reply was half a dollar per day. Mrs. Maſon, intimated it was not ſufficient for her attendance, ſhe replied it was enough for what ſhe had done, and would take no more. Mrs. Maſon's feelings were ſuch, that ſhe ſettled an annui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſix pounds a year, on her, for life. Her name is Mary Scott.</p>
               <p>An elderly black woman nurſed—with great diligence and attention; when recovered he aſked what he muſt give for her ſervices—ſhe replied "a din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner maſter on a cold winter's day," and thus ſhe went from place to place rendering every ſervice in her pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er without an eye to reward.</p>
               <p>A young black woman, was requeſted to attend one night upon a white man and his wife, who were very ill, no other perſon could be had;—great wages were offered her—ſhe replied, I will not go for money, if I
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:027170_0012_0FD39343EA1141B0"/>
go for money God will ſee it, and may be make me take the diſorder and die, but if I go, and take no money, he may ſpare my life. She went about nine o'clock, and found them both on the floor; ſhe could procure no candle or other light, but ſtaid with them about two hours, and then left them. They both di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that night. She was afterward very ill with the fever—her life was ſpared.</p>
               <p>Caeſar-Cranchal, a black man, offered his ſervices to attend the ſick, and ſaid, I will not take your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, I will not fell my life for money. It is ſaid he died with the flux.</p>
               <p>A black lad, at the Widow Gilpin's, was intruſted with his young Maſter's keys, on his leaving the city, and tranſacted his buſineſs, with the greateſt honeſty, and diſpatch, having unloaded a veſſel for him in the time, and loaded it again.</p>
               <p>A woman, that nurſed David Bacon, charged with exemplary moderation, and ſaid ſhe would not have any more.</p>
               <p>It may be ſaid, in vindication of the conduct of thoſe, who diſcovered ignorance or incapacity in nurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that it is, in itſelf, a conſiderable art, derived from experience, as well as the exerciſe of the finer feelings of humanity—this experience, nine tenths of thoſe employed, it is probable were wholly ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to.</p>
               <p>We do not recollect ſuch acts of humanity from the poor white people, in all the round we have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in. We could mention many other inſtances of the like nature, but think it needleſs.</p>
               <p>It is unpleaſant for us to make theſe remarks, but juſtice to our colour, demands it. Mr. Carey pays William Gray and us a compliment; he ſays, our ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices and others of their colour, have been very great &amp;c. By naming us, he leaves theſe others, in the hazardous ſtate of being claſſed with thoſe who are
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:027170_0013_0FD3934578265038"/>
called the "vileſt." The few that were diſcovered to merit public cenſure, were brought to juſtice, which ought to have ſufficed, without being canvaſſed over in his "Trifle" of a pamphlet—which cauſes us to be more particular, and endeavour to recall the eſteem of the public for our friends, and the people of colour, as far as they may be found worthy; for we conceive, and experience proves it, that an ill name is eaſier given than taken away. We have many unprovoked enemies, who begrudge us the liberty we enjoy, and are glad to hear of any complaint againſt our colour, be it juſt or unjuſt; in conſequence of which we are more earneſtly endeavouring all in our power, to warn, rebuke, and exhort our African friends, to keep a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience void of offence towards God and man; and, at the ſame time, would not be backward to interfere, when ſtigmas or oppreſſion appear pointed at, or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted againſt them, unjuſtly; and, we are confident, we ſhall ſtand juſtified in the ſight of the candid and judicious, for ſuch conduct.</p>
               <p>Mr. Carey's firſt, ſecond, and third editions, are gone forth into the world, and in all probability, have been read by thouſands that will never read his fourth—conſequently, any alteration he may hereafter make, in the paragraph alluded to, cannot have the deſired effect, or atone for the paſt; therefore we apprehend it neceſſary to publiſh our thoughts on the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Had Mr. Carey ſaid, a number of white and black Wretches eagerly ſeized on the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to extort from the diſtreſſed, and ſome few of both were detected in plundering the ſick, it might extenuate, in a great degree, the having made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the blacks.</p>
               <p>We can aſſure the public, there were as many white as black people, detected in pilfering, although the number of the latter, employed as nurſes, was twenty times as great as the former, and that there is, in our
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:027170_0014_0FD39347A96CB0C8"/>
opinion, as great a proportion of white, as of black, inclined to ſuch practices. It is rather to be admired, that ſo few inſtances of pilfering and robbery happened, conſidering the great opportunities there were for ſuch things: we do not know of more than five black people, ſuſpected of any thing clandeſtine, out of the great number employed; the people were glad to get any perſon to aſſiſt them—a black was preferred, becauſe it was ſuppoſed, they were not ſo likely to take the diſorder, the moſt worthleſs were accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſo that it would have been no cauſe of wonder, if twenty cauſe of complaint occurred, for one that hath. It has been alledged, that many of the ſick, were neglected by the nurſes; we do not wonder at it, conſidering their ſituation, in many inſtances, up night and day, without any one to relieve them, worn down with fatigue, and want of ſleep, they could not in many caſes, render that aſſiſtance, which was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: where we viſited, the cauſes of complaint on this ſcore, were not numerous. The caſe of the nurſes, in many inſtances, were deſerving of commiſeration, the patient raging and frightful to behold; it has fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently required two perſons, to hold them from run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away, others have made attempts to jump out of a window, in many chambers they were nailed down, and the door was kept locked, to prevent them from running away, or breaking their necks, others lay vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting blood, and ſcreaming enough to chill them with horror. Thus were many of the nurſes circumſtanced, alone, until the patient died, then called away to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſcene of diſtreſs, and thus have been for a week or ten days left to do the beſt they could without any ſufficient reſt, many of them having ſome of their deareſt connections ſick at the time, and ſuffering for want, while their huſband, wife, father, mother, &amp;c. have been engaged in the ſervice of the white people. We mention this to ſhew the difference between this
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:027170_0015_0FD3934DB3FB9248"/>
and nurſing in common caſes, we have ſuffered equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the whites, our diſtreſs hath been very great, but much unknown to the white people. Few have been the whites that paid attention to us while the black were engaged in the other's ſervice. We can aſſure the public we have taken four and five black people in a day to be buried. In ſeveral inſtances when they have been ſeized with the ſickneſs while nurſing, they have been turned out of the houſe, and wandering and deſtitute until taking ſhelter wherever they could (as many of them would not be admitted to their former homes) they have languiſhed alone and we know of one who even died in a ſtable. Others acted with more tenderneſs, when their nurſes were taken ſick they had proper care taken of them at their houſes. We know of two inſtances of this.</p>
               <p>It is even to this day a generally received opinion in this city, that our colour was not ſo liable to the ſickneſs as the whites. We hope our friends will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don us for ſetting this matter in its true ſtate.</p>
               <p>The public were informed that in the Weſt-Indies and other places where this terrible malady had been, it was obſerved the blacks were not affected with it. Happy would it have been for you, and much more ſo for us, if this obſervation had been verified by our experience.</p>
               <p>When the people of colour had the ſickneſs and died, we were impoſed upon and told it was not with the prevailing ſickneſs, until it became too notorious to be denied, then we were told ſome few died but not many. Thus were our ſervices extorted <hi>at the peril of our lives,</hi> yet you accuſe us of extorting <hi>a little money from you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The bill of mortality for the year 1793, publiſhed by Matthew Whitehead, and John Ormrod, clerks, and Joſeph Dolby, ſexton, will convince any reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able man that will examine it, that as many coloured people died in proportion as others. In 1792, there
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:027170_0016_0FD3934F4C058B90"/>
were 67 of our colour buried, and in 1793 it amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to 305; thus the burials among us have increaſed more than fourfold, was not this in a great degree the effects of the ſervices of the injuſtly vilified black people?</p>
               <p>Perhaps it may be acceptable to the reader to know how we found the ſick affected by the ſickneſs; our opportunities of hearing and ſeeing them have been very great. They were taken with a chill, a head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach, a ſick ſtomach, with pains in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap> limbs and back, this was the way the ſickneſs in general began, but all were not affected alike, ſome appeared but ſlightly affected with ſome of theſe ſymptoms, what confirmed us in the opinion of a perſon being mitten was the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of their eyes. In ſome it raged more furiouſly than in others—ſome have languiſhed for ſeven and ten days, and appeared to get better the day, or ſome hours before they died, while others were cut off in one, two, or three days, but their complaints were ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar. Some loſt their reaſon and raged with all the fury madneſs could produce, and died in ſtrong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions. Others retained their reaſon to the laſt, and ſeemed rather to fall aſleep than die. We could not help remarking that the former were of ſtrong paſſions, and the latter of a mild temper. Numbers died in a kind of dejection, they concluded they muſt go. (ſo the phraſe for dying was) and therefore in a kind of fixed determined ſtate of mind went off.</p>
               <p>It ſtruck our minds with awe, to have application made by thoſe in health, to take charge of them in their ſickneſs, and of their funeral. Such applications have been made to us; many appeared as though they thought they muſt die, and not live; ſome have lain on the floor, to be meaſured for their coffin and grave. A gentleman called one evening, to requeſt a good nurſe might be got for him, when he was ſick, and to ſuperintend his funeral, and gave particular directions
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:027170_0017_0FD393512F36B350"/>
how he would have it conducted, it ſeemed a ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing circumſtance, for the man appeared at the time, to be in perfect health, but calling two or three days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſee him, found a woman dead in the houſe, and the man ſo far gone, that to adminiſter any thing for his recovery, was needleſs—he died that evening. We mention this, as an inſtance of the dejection and deſpondence, that took hold on the minds of thouſands, and are of opinion, it aggravated the caſe of many, while others who bore up chearfully, got up again, that probably would otherwiſe have died.</p>
               <p>When the mortality came to its greateſt ſtage, it was impoſſible to procure ſufficient aſſiſtance, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore many whoſe friends, and relations had left them, died unſeen, and unaſſiſted. We have found them in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſituations, ſome laying on the floor, as bloody as if they had been dipt in it, without any appearance of their having had, even a drink of water for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; others laying on a bed with their clothes on, as if they had came in fatigued, and lain down to reſt; ſome appeared, as if they had fallen dead on the floor, from the poſition we found them in.</p>
               <p>Truly our taſk was hard, yet through mercy, we were enabled to go on.</p>
               <p>One thing we obſerved in ſeveral inſtances—when we were called, on the firſt appearance of the diſorder to bleed, the perſon frequently, on the opening a vein before the operation was near over, felt a change for the better, and expreſſed a relief in their chief com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints; and we made it a practice to take more blood from them, than is uſual in other caſes; theſe in a general way recovered; thoſe who did omit bleeding any conſiderable time, after being taken by the ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, rarely expreſſed any change they felt in the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p>We feel a great ſatisfaction in believing, that we have been uſeful to the ſick, and thus publicly thank
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:027170_0018_0FD39352767C74B0"/>
Doctor Ruſh, for enabling us to be ſo. We have bled upwards of eight hundred people, and do declare, we have not received to the value of a dollar and a half, therefor: we were willing to imitate the Doctor's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence, who ſick or well, kept his houſe open day and night, to give what aſſiſtance he could in this time of trouble.</p>
               <p>Several affecting inſtances occurred, when we were engaged in burying the dead. We have been called to bury ſome, who when we came, we found alive; at other places we found a parent dead, and none but little innocent babes to be ſeen, whoſe ignorance led them to think their parent was aſleep; on account of their ſituation, and their little prattle, we have been ſo wounded and our feelings ſo hurt, that we almoſt concluded to withdraw from our undertaking, but ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others ſo backward, we ſtill went on.</p>
               <p>An affecting inſtance.—A woman died, we were ſent for to bury her, on our going into the houſe and taking the coffin in, a dear little innocent accoſted us, with, mamma is aſleep, don't wake her; but when ſhe ſaw us puther in the coffin, 'the diſtreſs of the child was ſo great, that it almoſt overcame us; when ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded why we put her mamma in the box? We did not know how to anſwer her, but committed her to the care of a neighbour, and left her with heavy hearts. In other places where we have been to take the corpſe of a parent, and have found a group of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ones alone, ſome of them in a meaſure capable of knowing their ſituation, their cries and the innocent confuſions of the little ones, ſeemed almoſt too much for human nature to bear. We have picked up little children that were wandering they knew not where, whoſe (parents were cut off) and taken them to the orphan houſe, for at this time the dread that prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over people's minds was ſo general, that it was a rare inſtance to ſee one neighbour viſit another, and

even friends when they met in the ſtreets were afraid of each other, much leſs would they admit into their houſes the diſtreſſed orphan that had been where the ſickneſs was; this extreme ſeemed in ſome inſtances to have the appearance of barbarity; with reluctance we call to mind the many opportunities there were in the power of individuals to be uſeful to their fellow-men, yet through the terror of the times was omitted. A black man riding through the ſtreet, ſaw a man puſh a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man out of the houſe, the woman ſtaggered and fell on her face in the gutter, and was not able to turn herſelf, the black man thought ſhe was drunk, but obſerving ſhe was in danger of ſuffocation alighted, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Many of the white people, that ought to be patterns for us to follow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, have acted in a manner that would make humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhudder. We remember an inſtance of cruelty, which we truſt, no black man would be guilty of: two ſiſters orderly, decent, white women were ſick with the fever, one of them recovered ſo as to come to the door; a neighbouring white man ſaw her, and in an angry tone aſked her if her ſiſter was dead or not? She anſwered no, upon which he replied, damn her, if ſhe don't die before morning, I will make her die. The poor woman ſhocked at ſuch an expreſſion, from this monſter of a man, made a modeſt reply, upon which he ſnatched <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="20" facs="unknown:027170_0020_0FD39358CDB5AC90"/>
died that night. A white man threatened to ſhoot us, iſſue paſſed by his houſe with a corpſe: we buried him three days after.</p>
               <p>We have been pained to ſee the widows come to us, crying and wringing their hands, and in very great diſtreſs, on account of their huſbands' death; having nobody to help them, they were obliged to come to get their huſbands buried, their neighbours were afraid to go to their help or to condole with them; we aſcribe ſuch unfriendly conduct to the frailty of human nature, and not to wilful unkindneſs, or hardneſs of heart.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the compliment Mr. Carey hath paid us, we have found reports ſpread, of our taking between one, and two hundred beds, from houſes where people died; ſuch ſlanderers as theſe, who propagate ſuch wilful lies are dangerous, although unworthy no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. We wiſh if any perſon hath the leaſt ſuſpicion of us, they would endeavour to bring us to the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which ſuch atrocious conduct muſt deſerve; and by this means, the innocent will be cleared from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, and the guilty known.</p>
               <p>We ſhall now conclude with the following old pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, which we think applicable to thoſe of our colour who expoſed their lives in the late afflicting diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:—

               <p>FOR the perſonal reſpect we bear you, and for the ſatisfaction of the Mayor, we declare, that to the beſt of our remembrance we had the care of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing beds and no more.—</p>
               <p>Two belonging to James Starr we buried; upon taking them up, we found one damaged; the blankets, &amp;c. belonging to it were ſtolen; it was refuſed to be accepted of by his ſon Moſes; it was buried again, and remains ſo for ought we know<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the other was return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and accepted of.</p>
               <p>We buried two belonging to Samuel Fiſher, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant; one of them was taken up by us, to carry a ſick perſon on to Buſh-hill, and there left; the other was buried in a grave, under a corpſe.</p>
               <p>Two beds were buried for Thomas Willing, one ſix feet deep in his garden, and lime and water thrown upon it; the other was in the Potter's field, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knowledge of it we have not.</p>
               <p>We burned one bed with other furniture, and cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing belonging to the late Mayor, Samuel Powel, on his farm on the weſt ſide of Schuylkill river;—we bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried one of his beds.</p>
               <p>For—Dickenſon, we buried a bed in a lot of Richard Allen; which we have good cauſe to believe, was ſtolen.</p>
               <p>One bed was buried for a perſon in front ſtreet, whoſe name is unknown to us, it was buried in the Potter's field, by a perſon employed for the purpoſe; we told him he might take it up again after it had been buried a week, and apply it to his own uſe, as he
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:027170_0022_0FD3935C00EB7D28"/>
ſaid he had lately been diſcharged from the hoſpital and had none to lay on.</p>
               <p>Thomas Leiper's two beds were buried in the Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's field, and remained there a week, and then taken up by us, for the uſe of the ſick that we took to Buſh-hill, and left the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>We buried one for—Smith, in the Potter's field, which was returned except the furniture, which we believe was ſtolen.</p>
               <p>One other we buried for—Davis, in Vine ſtreet, it was buried near Schuylkill, and we believe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues ſo.</p>
               <p>A bed from—Gueſts in Second ſtreet, was buried in the Potter's field, and is there yet, for any thing we know.</p>
               <p>One bed we buried in the Preſbyterian burial ground the corner of Pine and Fourth ſtreets<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and we believe was taken up by the owner, Thomas Mitchel.</p>
               <p>—Millegan in Second ſtreet, had a bed buried by us in the Potter's field—we have no further know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it.</p>
               <p>This is a true ſtate of matters reſpecting the beds, as far as we were concerned, we never undertook the charge of more than their burial, knowing they were liable to be taken away by evil minded perſons. We think it beneath the dignity of an honeſt man, (although injured in his reputation by wicked and envious perſons) to vindicate or ſupport his character, by an oath or le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal affirmation; we fear not our enemies, let them come forward with their charges, we will not flinch, and if they can fix any crime upon us, we refuſe not to ſuffer.</p>
               <p>SIR,
You have cauſe to believe our lives were endanger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in more caſes than one, in the time of the late mortality, and that we were ſo diſcouraged, that had it not been for your perſuaſion, we would have relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed

               <head>An Addreſs to thoſe who keep Slaves, and approve the practice.</head>
               <p>THE judicious part of mankind will think it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, that a ſuperior good conduct is looked for, from our race, by thoſe who ſtigmatize us as men, whoſe baſeneſs is incurable, and may therefore be held in a ſtate of ſervitude, that a merciful man would not doom a beaſt to; yet you try what you can to prevent our riſing from the ſtate of barbariſm, you repreſent us to be in, but we can tell you, from a degree of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that a black man, although reduced to the moſt abject ſtate human nature is capable of, ſhort of real madneſs, can think, reflect, and feel injuries, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it may not be with the ſame degree of keen reſentment and revenge, that you who have been and
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:027170_0024_0FD39362E4EB4B40"/>
are our great oppreſſors, would manifeſt if reduced to the pitiable condition of a ſlave. We believe if you would try the experiment of taking a few black chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and cultivate their minds with the ſame care, and let them have the ſame proſpect in view, as to living in the world, as you would wiſh for your own children, you would find upon the trial, they were not inferior in mental endowments.</p>
               <p>We do not wiſh to make you angry, but excite your attention to conſider, how hateful ſlavery is in the ſight of that God, who hath deſtroyed kings and princes, for their oppreſſion of the poor ſlaves; Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh and his princes with the poſterity of king Saul, were deſtroyed by the protector and avenger of ſlaves. Would you not ſuppoſe the Iſraelites to be utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for freedom, and that it was impoſſible for them to attain to any degree of excellence? Their hiſtory ſhews how ſlavery had debaſed their ſpirits. Men muſt be wilfully blind and extremely partial, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee the contrary effects of liberty and ſlavery upon the mind of man; we freely confeſs the vile habits of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten acquired in a ſtate of ſervitude, are not eaſily thown off; the example of the Iſraelites ſhews, who with all that Moſes could do to reclaim them from it, ſtill continued in their former habits more or leſs; and why will you look for better from us? Why will you look for grapes from thorns, or figs from thiſtles? It is in our poſterity enjoying the ſame privileges with your own, that you ought to look for better things.</p>
               <p>When you are pleaded with, do not you reply as Pharaoh did, "wherefore do ye Moſes and Aaron, let the people from their work, behold the people of the land, now are many, and you make them reſt from their burdens." We wiſh you to conſider, that God himſelf was the firſt pleader of the cauſe of ſlaves.</p>
               <p>That God who knows the hearts of all men, and the propenſity of a ſlave to hate his oppreſſor, hath ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forbidden it to his choſen people, "thou ſhalt not
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:027170_0025_0FD39366193333D0"/>
abhor an Egyptian, becauſe thou waſt a ſtranger in his land. Deut. xxiii. 7." The meek and humble Jeſus, the great pattern of humanity, and every other virtue that can adorn and dignify men, hath command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to love our enemies, to do good to them that hate and deſpitefully uſe us. We feel the obligations, we wiſh to impreſs them on the minds of our black bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and that we may all forgive you, as we wiſh to be forgiven; we think it a great mercy to have all anger and bitterneſs removed from our minds; we appeal to your own feelings, if it is not very diſquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to feel yourſelves under the dominion of a wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſpoſition.</p>
               <p>If you love your children, if you love your country, if you love the God of love, clear your hands from ſlaves, burden not your children or country with them. Our hearts have been ſorrowful for the late bloodſhed of the oppreſſors, as well as the oppreſſed, both ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear guilty of each others blood, in the ſight of him who ſaid, he that ſheddeth man's blood, by man ſhall his blood be ſhed.</p>
               <p>Will you, becauſe you have reduced us to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy condition our colour is in, plead our incapacity for freedom, and our contented condition under op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, as a ſufficient cauſe for keeping us under the grievous yoke? We have ſhewn the cauſe of our inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, we will alſo ſhew, why we appear contented; were we to attempt to plead with our maſters, it would be deemed inſolence, for which cauſe they appear as contented as they can in your fight, but the dreadful inſurrections they have made, when opportunity has offered, is enough to convince a reaſonable man, that great uneaſineſs and not contentment, is the inhabitant of their hearts.</p>
               <p>God himſelf hath pleaded their cauſe, he hath from time to time raiſed up inſtruments for that purpoſe, ſometimes mean and contemptible in your ſight; at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times he hath uſed ſuch as it hath pleaſed him,

               <p>FEELING an engagement of mind for your welfare, we addreſs you with an affectionate ſympathy, having been ourſelves ſlaves, and as deſirous of freedom as any of you; yet the bands of bondage were ſo ſtrong, that no way appeared for our releaſe, yet at times a hope aroſe in our hearts that a way would open for it, and when our minds were mercifully viſited with the feeling of the love of God, then theſe hopes increaſed, and a confidence aroſe that he would make way for our enlargement, and as a patient waiting was neceſſary, we were ſometimes favoured with it, at other times we were very impatient, then the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of liberty almoſt vaniſhed away, and we were in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and perplexity.</p>
               <p>We mention our experience to you, that your hearts may not ſink at the diſcouraging proſpects you may have, and that you may put your truſt in God, who ſees your condition, and as a merciful father pitieth his children, ſo doth God pity them that love him; and as your hearts are inclined to ſerve God, you will feel an affectionate regard towards your maſters and miſtreſſes, and the whole family where you live, this will be ſeen by them, and tend to promote your liberty, eſpecially with ſuch as have feeling maſters, and if they are otherwiſe you will have the favour and love of God dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in your hearts, which you will value more than any thing elſe, which will be a conſolation in the worſt conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you can be in, and no maſter can deprive you of it; and as life is ſhort and uncertain, and the chief end of our hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a being in this world, is to be prepared for a better, we wiſh you to think of this more than any thing elſe: then will you have a view of that freedom which the ſons of God enjoy; and if the troubles of your condition end with your lives, you will be admitted to the freedom which God hath prepared for thoſe of all colours that love him; here the
