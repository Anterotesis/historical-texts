            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <head>A NARRATIVE, &amp;c.</head>
               <p>IN conÅ¿equence of a partial repreÅ¿entation of the conduct of the people who were employed to nurÅ¿e the Å¿ick, in the late calamitous Å¿tate of the city of Philadelphia, we are Å¿olicited, by a number of thoÅ¿e who feel themÅ¿elves injured thereby, and by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Å¿everal reÅ¿pectable citizens, to Å¿tep forward and declare facts as they really were; Å¿eeing that from our Å¿ituation, on account of the charge we took upon us, we had it more fully and generally in our power, to know and obÅ¿erve the conduct and behavior of thoÅ¿e that were Å¿o employed.</p>
               <p>Early in September, a Å¿olicitation appeared in the public papers, to the people of colour to come forward and aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t the diÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿ed, periÅ¿hing, and neglected Å¿ick; with a kind of aÅ¿Å¿urance, that people of our colour were not liable to take the infection. Upon which we and a few others met and conÅ¿ulted how to act on Å¿o truly alarming and melancholy an occaÅ¿ion. After Å¿ome converÅ¿ation, we found a freedom to go forth, confiding in him who can preÅ¿erve in the midÅ¿t of a burning fiery furnace, Å¿enÅ¿ible that it was our duty to do all the good we could to our Å¿uffering fellow mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals. We Å¿et out to Å¿ee where we could be uÅ¿eful. The firÅ¿t we viÅ¿ited was a man in EmÅ¿ley's alley, who was dying, and his wife lay dead at the time in the houÅ¿e, there were none to aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t but two poor helpleÅ¿s children. We adminiÅ¿tered what relief we could, and applied to the overÅ¿eers of the poor to have the woman buried. We viÅ¿ited upwards of twenty families that
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:027170_0004_0FD3932EF39644B0"/>
dayâthey were Å¿cenes of woe indeed! The Lord was pleaÅ¿ed to Å¿trengthen us, and remove all fear from us, and diÅ¿poÅ¿ed our<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> hearts to be as uÅ¿eful as poÅ¿Å¿ible.</p>
               <p>In order the better to regulate our conduct, we cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led on the mayor next day, to conÅ¿ult with him how to proceed, Å¿o as to be moÅ¿t uÅ¿eful. The firÅ¿t object he recommended was a Å¿trict attention to the Å¿ick, and the procuring of nurÅ¿es. This was attended to by AbÅ¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom Jones and William Gray; and, in order that the diÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿ed might know where to apply, the mayor ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiÅ¿ed the public that upon application to them they would be Å¿upplied. Soon after, the mortality increaÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the difficulty of getting a corpÅ¿e taken away, was Å¿uch, that few were willing to do it, when offered great rewards. The black people were looked to. We then offered our Å¿ervices in the public papers, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiÅ¿ing that we would remove the dead and procure nurÅ¿es. Our Å¿ervices were the production of real Å¿en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ibility;âwe Å¿ought not fee nor reward, until the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaÅ¿e of the diÅ¿order rendered our labour Å¿o arduous that we were not adequate to the Å¿ervice we had aÅ¿Å¿um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The mortality increaÅ¿ing rapidly, obliged us to call in the aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance of five<note n="*" place="bottom">Two of whom were Richard Allen's brothers.</note> hired men, in the awful diÅ¿charge of interring the dead. They with great reluctance, were prevailed upon to join us. It was very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>â¢â¢</desc>
                  </gap>mmon, at this time, to find any one that would go near, much more, handle, a Å¿ick or dead perÅ¿on.</p>
               <p>Mr. Carey, in page 106 of his third edition, has obÅ¿erved, that, "for the honor of human nature, it ought to be recorded, that Å¿ome of the convicts in the gaol, a part of the term of whoÅ¿e confinement had been remitted as a reward for their peaceable, orderly behavior, voluntarily offered themÅ¿elves as nurÅ¿es to attend the Å¿ick at BuÅ¿h-hill; and have, in that capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, conducted themÅ¿elves with great fidelity &amp;c. Here
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:027170_0005_0FD3933095B5FFA8"/>
it ought to be remarked, (although Mr. Carey hath not done it) that two thirds of the perÅ¿ons, who ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered theÅ¿e eÅ¿Å¿ential Å¿ervices, were people of colour, who, on the application of the elders of the African church, (who met to conÅ¿ider what they could do for the help of the Å¿ick) were liberated, on condition of their doing the duty of nurÅ¿es at the hoÅ¿pital at BuÅ¿h-hill; which they as voluntarily accepted to do, as they did faithfully diÅ¿charge, this Å¿evere and diÅ¿agreeable duty.âMay the Lord reward them, both temporally and Å¿piritually.</p>
               <p>When the Å¿ickneÅ¿s became general, and Å¿everal of the phyÅ¿icians died, and moÅ¿t of the Å¿urvivors were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauÅ¿ted by Å¿ickneÅ¿s or fatigue; that good man, Doctor RuÅ¿h, called us more immediately to attend upon the Å¿ick, knowing we could both bleed; he told us we could increaÅ¿e our utility, by attending to his inÅ¿truc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and accordingly directed us where to procure medicine duly prepared, with proper directions how to adminiÅ¿ter them, and at what Å¿tages of the diÅ¿order to bleed; and when we found ourÅ¿elves incapable of judging what was proper to be done, to apply to him, and he would, if able, attend them himÅ¿elf, or Å¿end Edward FiÅ¿her, his pupil, which he often did; and Mr. FiÅ¿her manifeÅ¿ted his humanity, by an affectionate at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention for their relief.âThis has been no Å¿mall Å¿atis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to us; for, we think, that when a phyÅ¿ician was not attainable, we have been the inÅ¿truments, in the hand of God, for Å¿aving the lives of Å¿ome hundreds of our Å¿uffering fellow mortals.</p>
               <p>We feel ourÅ¿elves Å¿enÅ¿ibly aggrieved by the cenÅ¿ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous epithets of many, who did not render the leaÅ¿t aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿iÅ¿tance in the time of neceÅ¿Å¿ity, yet are liberal of their cenÅ¿ure of us, for the prices paid for our Å¿ervices, when no one knew how to make a propoÅ¿al to any one they wanted to aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t them. At firÅ¿t we made no charge, but left it to thoÅ¿e we Å¿erved in removing their dead,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:027170_0006_0FD39331EA543A38"/>
to give what they thought fitâwe Å¿et no price, until the reward was fixed by thoÅ¿e we had Å¿erved. After paying the people we had to aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t us, our compenÅ¿ation is much leÅ¿s than many will believe.</p>
               <p>We do aÅ¿Å¿ure the public, that <hi>all</hi> the money we have received, for burying, and for coffins which we our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves purchaÅ¿ed and procured, has not defrayed the expence of wages which we had to pay to thoÅ¿e whom we employed to aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t us.

But, if the other expences, which we have actually paid, are added to that Å¿um, how much then may we not Å¿ay we have Å¿uffered! We leave the public to judge.</p>
               <p>It may poÅ¿Å¿ibly appear Å¿trange to Å¿ome who know how conÅ¿tantly we were employed, that we Å¿hould have received no more CaÅ¿h than Â£.233 10 4. But we repeat our aÅ¿Å¿urance, that this is the fact, and we add another, which will Å¿erve the better to explain it: We have buried <hi>Å¿everal hundreds</hi> of poor perÅ¿ons and Å¿trangers, for which Å¿ervice we have never received, nor never aÅ¿ked any compenÅ¿ation.</p>
               <p>We feel ourÅ¿elves hurt moÅ¿t by a partial, cenÅ¿orious paragraph, in Mr. Carey's Å¿econd edition, of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Å¿ickneÅ¿s, &amp;c. in Philadelphia; pages 76 and 77, where he aÅ¿perÅ¿es the blacks alone, for having taken the advantage of the diÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿ed Å¿ituation of the people. That Å¿ome extravagant prices were paid, we admit; but how came they to be demanded? the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on is plain. It was with difficulty perÅ¿ons could be had to Å¿upply the wants of the Å¿ick, as nurÅ¿es;âap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications became more and more numerous, the conÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence was, when we procured them at Å¿ix dollars per week, and called upon them to go where they were wanted, we found they were gone elÅ¿ewhere; here was a diÅ¿appointment; upon enquiring the cauÅ¿e, we found, they had been allured away by others who of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered greater wages, until they got from two to four dollars per day. We had no reÅ¿traint upon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. It was natural for people in low circumÅ¿tances to accept a voluntary, bounteous reward; eÅ¿pecially under the loathÅ¿omneÅ¿s of many of the Å¿ick, when na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

Å¿huddered at the thoughts of the infection, and the taÅ¿k aÅ¿Å¿igned was aggravated by lunacy, and being left much alone with them. Had Mr. Carey been Å¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited to Å¿uch an undertaking, for hire, <hi>Query,</hi> "what would <hi>he</hi> have demanded? but Mr. Carey, although choÅ¿en a member of that band of worthies who have Å¿o eminently diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed themÅ¿elves by their labours, for the relief of the Å¿ick and helpleÅ¿sâyet, quickly after his election, left them to Å¿truggle with their arduous and hazardous taÅ¿k, by leaving the city. 'Tis true Mr. Carey was no hireling, and had a right to flee, and upon his return, to plead the cauÅ¿e of thoÅ¿e who fled; yet, we think, he was wrong in giving Å¿o partial and injurious an account of the black nurÅ¿es; if they have taken advantage of the public diÅ¿treÅ¿s? Is it any more than he hath done of its deÅ¿ire for information. We believe he has made more money by the Å¿ale of his "Å¿craps" than a dozen of the greateÅ¿t extortioners among the black nurÅ¿es. The great prices paid did not eÅ¿cape the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ervation of that worthy and vigilant magiÅ¿trate, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew ClarkÅ¿on, mayor of the city, and preÅ¿ident of the committeeâhe Å¿ent for us, and requeÅ¿ted we would uÅ¿e our influence, to leÅ¿Å¿en the wages of the nurÅ¿es, but on informing him the cauÅ¿e, i. e. that of the people over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding one another, it was concluded unneceÅ¿Å¿ary to attempt any thing on that head; therefore it was left to the people concerned. That there were Å¿ome few black people guilty of plundering the diÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿ed, we acknowledge; but in that they only are pointed out, and made mention of, we eÅ¿teem partial and injurious; we know as many whites who were guilty of it; but this is looked over, while the blacks are held up to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ure.âIs it a greater crime for a black to pilfer, than for a white to privateer?</p>
               <p>We wiÅ¿h not to offend, but when an unprovoked at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt is made, to make us blacker than we are, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes leÅ¿s neceÅ¿Å¿ary to be over cautious on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count;

therefore we Å¿hall take the liberty to tell of the conduct of Å¿ome of the whites.</p>
               <p>We know Å¿ix pounds was demanded by, and paid, to a white woman, for putting a corpÅ¿e into a coffin; and forty dollars was demanded, and paid, to four white men, for bringing it down the Å¿tairs.</p>
               <p>Mr. and Mrs. Taylor both died in one night; a white woman had the care of them; after they were dead Å¿he called on Jacob ServoÅ¿s, <abbr>eÅ¿q.</abbr> for her pay, demanding Å¿ix pounds for laying them out; upon Å¿ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a bundle with her, he Å¿uÅ¿pected Å¿he had pilfered; on Å¿earching her, Mr. Taylor's buckles were found in her pocket, with other things.</p>
               <p>An elderly lady, Mrs. Malony, was given into the care of a white woman, Å¿he died, we were called to remove the corpÅ¿e, when we came the woman was lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Å¿o drunk that Å¿he did not know what we were do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but we know Å¿he had one of Mrs. Malony's rings on her finger, and another in her pocket.</p>
               <p>Mr. Carey tells us, BuÅ¿h-hill exhibited as wretched a picture of human miÅ¿ery, as ever exiÅ¿ted. A profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate abandoned Å¿et of nurÅ¿es and attendants (hardly any of good character could at that time be procured,) rioted on the proviÅ¿ions and comforts, prepared for the Å¿ick, who (unleÅ¿s at the hours when the doctors attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) were left almoÅ¿t entirely deÅ¿titute of every aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. The dying and dead were indiÅ¿criminately mingled together. The ordure and other evacuations of the Å¿ick, were allowed to remain in the moÅ¿t offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ive Å¿tate imaginable. Not the Å¿malleÅ¿t appearance of order or regularity exiÅ¿ted. It was in fact a great hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Å¿laughter houÅ¿e, where numerous victims were immolated at the altar of intemperance.</p>
               <p>It is unpleaÅ¿ant to point out the bad and unfeeling conduct of any colour, yet the defence we have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken obliges us to remark, that although "hardly any of good character at that time could be procured" yet only two black women were at this time in the hoÅ¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:027170_0010_0FD3933C220555D8"/>
and they were retained and the others diÅ¿charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when it was reduced to order and good govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The bad conÅ¿equences many of our colour apprehend from a partial relation of our conduct are, that it will prejudice the minds of the people in general againÅ¿t usâbecauÅ¿e it is impoÅ¿Å¿ible that one individual, can have knowledge of all, therefore a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Mrs. MaÅ¿on, intimated it was not Å¿ufficient for her attendance, Å¿he replied it was enough for what Å¿he had done, and would take no more. Mrs. MaÅ¿on's feelings were Å¿uch, that Å¿he Å¿ettled an annui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Å¿ix pounds a year, on her, for life. Her name is Mary Scott.</p>
               <p>An elderly black woman nurÅ¿edâwith great diligence and attention; when recovered he aÅ¿ked what he muÅ¿t give for her Å¿ervicesâÅ¿he replied "a din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner maÅ¿ter on a cold winter's day," and thus Å¿he went from place to place rendering every Å¿ervice in her pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er without an eye to reward.</p>

               <p>It is unpleaÅ¿ant for us to make theÅ¿e remarks, but juÅ¿tice to our colour, demands it. Mr. Carey pays William Gray and us a compliment; he Å¿ays, our Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices and others of their colour, have been very great &amp;c. By naming us, he leaves theÅ¿e others, in the hazardous Å¿tate of being claÅ¿Å¿ed with thoÅ¿e who are
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:027170_0013_0FD3934578265038"/>
called the "vileÅ¿t." The few that were diÅ¿covered to merit public cenÅ¿ure, were brought to juÅ¿tice, which ought to have Å¿ufficed, without being canvaÅ¿Å¿ed over in his "Trifle" of a pamphletâwhich cauÅ¿es us to be more particular, and endeavour to recall the eÅ¿teem of the public for our friends, and the people of colour, as far as they may be found worthy; for we conceive, and experience proves it, that an ill name is eaÅ¿ier given than taken away. We have many unprovoked enemies, who begrudge us the liberty we enjoy, and are glad to hear of any complaint againÅ¿t our colour, be it juÅ¿t or unjuÅ¿t; in conÅ¿equence of which we are more earneÅ¿tly endeavouring all in our power, to warn, rebuke, and exhort our African friends, to keep a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cience void of offence towards God and man; and, at the Å¿ame time, would not be backward to interfere, when Å¿tigmas or oppreÅ¿Å¿ion appear pointed at, or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted againÅ¿t them, unjuÅ¿tly; and, we are confident, we Å¿hall Å¿tand juÅ¿tified in the Å¿ight of the candid and judicious, for Å¿uch conduct.</p>
               <p>Mr. Carey's firÅ¿t, Å¿econd, and third editions, are gone forth into the world, and in all probability, have been read by thouÅ¿ands that will never read his fourthâconÅ¿equently, any alteration he may hereafter make, in the paragraph alluded to, cannot have the deÅ¿ired effect, or atone for the paÅ¿t; therefore we apprehend it neceÅ¿Å¿ary to publiÅ¿h our thoughts on the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion. Had Mr. Carey Å¿aid, a number of white and black Wretches eagerly Å¿eized on the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to extort from the diÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿ed, and Å¿ome few of both were detected in plundering the Å¿ick, it might extenuate, in a great degree, the having made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the blacks.</p>
               <p>We can aÅ¿Å¿ure the public, there were as many white as black people, detected in pilfering, although the number of the latter, employed as nurÅ¿es, was twenty times as great as the former, and that there is, in our
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:027170_0014_0FD39347A96CB0C8"/>
opinion, as great a proportion of white, as of black, inclined to Å¿uch practices. It is rather to be admired, that Å¿o few inÅ¿tances of pilfering and robbery happened, conÅ¿idering the great opportunities there were for Å¿uch things: we do not know of more than five black people, Å¿uÅ¿pected of any thing clandeÅ¿tine, out of the great number employed; the people were glad to get any perÅ¿on to aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t themâa black was preferred, becauÅ¿e it was Å¿uppoÅ¿ed, they were not Å¿o likely to take the diÅ¿order, the moÅ¿t worthleÅ¿s were accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Å¿o that it would have been no cauÅ¿e of wonder, if twenty cauÅ¿e of complaint occurred, for one that hath. It has been alledged, that many of the Å¿ick, were neglected by the nurÅ¿es; we do not wonder at it, conÅ¿idering their Å¿ituation, in many inÅ¿tances, up night and day, without any one to relieve them, worn down with fatigue, and want of Å¿leep, they could not in many caÅ¿es, render that aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance, which was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: where we viÅ¿ited, the cauÅ¿es of complaint on this Å¿core, were not numerous. The caÅ¿e of the nurÅ¿es, in many inÅ¿tances, were deÅ¿erving of commiÅ¿eration, the patient raging and frightful to behold; it has fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently required two perÅ¿ons, to hold them from run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away, others have made attempts to jump out of a window, in many chambers they were nailed down, and the door was kept locked, to prevent them from running away, or breaking their necks, others lay vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting blood, and Å¿creaming enough to chill them with horror. Thus were many of the nurÅ¿es circumÅ¿tanced, alone, until the patient died, then called away to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Å¿cene of diÅ¿treÅ¿s, and thus have been for a week or ten days left to do the beÅ¿t they could without any Å¿ufficient reÅ¿t, many of them having Å¿ome of their deareÅ¿t connections Å¿ick at the time, and Å¿uffering for want, while their huÅ¿band, wife, father, mother, &amp;c. have been engaged in the Å¿ervice of the white people. We mention this to Å¿hew the difference between this
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:027170_0015_0FD3934DB3FB9248"/>
and nurÅ¿ing in common caÅ¿es, we have Å¿uffered equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the whites, our diÅ¿treÅ¿s hath been very great, but much unknown to the white people. Few have been the whites that paid attention to us while the black were engaged in the other's Å¿ervice. We can aÅ¿Å¿ure the public we have taken four and five black people in a day to be buried. In Å¿everal inÅ¿tances when they have been Å¿eized with the Å¿ickneÅ¿s while nurÅ¿ing, they have been turned out of the houÅ¿e, and wandering and deÅ¿titute until taking Å¿helter wherever they could (as many of them would not be admitted to their former homes) they have languiÅ¿hed alone and we know of one who even died in a Å¿table. Others acted with more tenderneÅ¿s, when their nurÅ¿es were taken Å¿ick they had proper care taken of them at their houÅ¿es. We know of two inÅ¿tances of this.</p>
               <p>It is even to this day a generally received opinion in this city, that our colour was not Å¿o liable to the Å¿ickneÅ¿s as the whites. We hope our friends will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don us for Å¿etting this matter in its true Å¿tate.</p>
               <p>The public were informed that in the WeÅ¿t-Indies and other places where this terrible malady had been, it was obÅ¿erved the blacks were not affected with it. Happy would it have been for you, and much more Å¿o for us, if this obÅ¿ervation had been verified by our experience.</p>
               <p>When the people of colour had the Å¿ickneÅ¿s and died, we were impoÅ¿ed upon and told it was not with the prevailing Å¿ickneÅ¿s, until it became too notorious to be denied, then we were told Å¿ome few died but not many. Thus were our Å¿ervices extorted <hi>at the peril of our lives,</hi> yet you accuÅ¿e us of extorting <hi>a little money from you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The bill of mortality for the year 1793, publiÅ¿hed by Matthew Whitehead, and John Ormrod, clerks, and JoÅ¿eph Dolby, Å¿exton, will convince any reaÅ¿on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able man that will examine it, that as many coloured people died in proportion as others. In 1792, there
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:027170_0016_0FD3934F4C058B90"/>
were 67 of our colour buried, and in 1793 it amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to 305; thus the burials among us have increaÅ¿ed more than fourfold, was not this in a great degree the effects of the Å¿ervices of the injuÅ¿tly vilified black people?</p>
               <p>Perhaps it may be acceptable to the reader to know how we found the Å¿ick affected by the Å¿ickneÅ¿s; our opportunities of hearing and Å¿eeing them have been very great.

In Å¿ome it raged more furiouÅ¿ly than in othersâÅ¿ome have languiÅ¿hed for Å¿even and ten days, and appeared to get better the day, or Å¿ome hours before they died, while others were cut off in one, two, or three days, but their complaints were Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar. Some loÅ¿t their reaÅ¿on and raged with all the fury madneÅ¿s could produce, and died in Å¿trong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulÅ¿ions. Others retained their reaÅ¿on to the laÅ¿t, and Å¿eemed rather to fall aÅ¿leep than die. We could not help remarking that the former were of Å¿trong paÅ¿Å¿ions, and the latter of a mild temper. Numbers died in a kind of dejection, they concluded they muÅ¿t go. (Å¿o the phraÅ¿e for dying was) and therefore in a kind of fixed determined Å¿tate of mind went off.</p>
               <p>It Å¿truck our minds with awe, to have application made by thoÅ¿e in health, to take charge of them in their Å¿ickneÅ¿s, and of their funeral. Such applications have been made to us; many appeared as though they thought they muÅ¿t die, and not live; Å¿ome have lain on the floor, to be meaÅ¿ured for their coffin and grave. A gentleman called one evening, to requeÅ¿t a good nurÅ¿e might be got for him, when he was Å¿ick, and to Å¿uperintend his funeral, and gave particular directions
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:027170_0017_0FD393512F36B350"/>
how he would have it conducted, it Å¿eemed a Å¿urpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ing circumÅ¿tance, for the man appeared at the time, to be in perfect health, but calling two or three days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Å¿ee him, found a woman dead in the houÅ¿e, and the man Å¿o far gone, that to adminiÅ¿ter any thing for his recovery, was needleÅ¿sâhe died that evening. We mention this, as an inÅ¿tance of the dejection and deÅ¿pondence, that took hold on the minds of thouÅ¿ands, and are of opinion, it aggravated the caÅ¿e of many, while others who bore up chearfully, got up again, that probably would otherwiÅ¿e have died.</p>
               <p>When the mortality came to its greateÅ¿t Å¿tage, it was impoÅ¿Å¿ible to procure Å¿ufficient aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore many whoÅ¿e friends, and relations had left them, died unÅ¿een, and unaÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿ted. We have found them in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Å¿ituations, Å¿ome laying on the floor, as bloody as if they had been dipt in it, without any appearance of their having had, even a drink of water for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; others laying on a bed with their clothes on, as if they had came in fatigued, and lain down to reÅ¿t; Å¿ome appeared, as if they had fallen dead on the floor, from the poÅ¿ition we found them in.</p>
               <p>Truly our taÅ¿k was hard, yet through mercy, we were enabled to go on.</p>
               <p>One thing we obÅ¿erved in Å¿everal inÅ¿tancesâwhen we were called, on the firÅ¿t appearance of the diÅ¿order to bleed, the perÅ¿on frequently, on the opening a vein before the operation was near over, felt a change for the better, and expreÅ¿Å¿ed a relief in their chief com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints; and we made it a practice to take more blood from them, than is uÅ¿ual in other caÅ¿es; theÅ¿e in a general way recovered; thoÅ¿e who did omit bleeding any conÅ¿iderable time, after being taken by the Å¿ick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s, rarely expreÅ¿Å¿ed any change they felt in the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p>We feel a great Å¿atisfaction in believing, that we have been uÅ¿eful to the Å¿ick, and thus publicly thank
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:027170_0018_0FD39352767C74B0"/>
Doctor RuÅ¿h, for enabling us to be Å¿o. We have bled upwards of eight hundred people, and do declare, we have not received to the value of a dollar and a half, therefor: we were willing to imitate the Doctor's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence, who Å¿ick or well, kept his houÅ¿e open day and night, to give what aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance he could in this time of trouble.</p>
               <p>Several affecting inÅ¿tances occurred, when we were engaged in burying the dead. We have been called to bury Å¿ome, who when we came, we found alive; at other places we found a parent dead, and none but little innocent babes to be Å¿een, whoÅ¿e ignorance led them to think their parent was aÅ¿leep; on account of their Å¿ituation, and their little prattle, we have been Å¿o wounded and our feelings Å¿o hurt, that we almoÅ¿t concluded to withdraw from our undertaking, but Å¿ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others Å¿o backward, we Å¿till went on.</p>
               <p>An affecting inÅ¿tance.âA woman died, we were Å¿ent for to bury her, on our going into the houÅ¿e and taking the coffin in, a dear little innocent accoÅ¿ted us, with, mamma is aÅ¿leep, don't wake her; but when Å¿he Å¿aw us puther in the coffin, 'the diÅ¿treÅ¿s of the child was Å¿o great, that it almoÅ¿t overcame us; when Å¿he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded why we put her mamma in the box? We did not know how to anÅ¿wer her, but committed her to the care of a neighbour, and left her with heavy hearts. In other places where we have been to take the corpÅ¿e of a parent, and have found a group of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ones alone, Å¿ome of them in a meaÅ¿ure capable of knowing their Å¿ituation, their cries and the innocent confuÅ¿ions of the little ones, Å¿eemed almoÅ¿t too much for human nature to bear. We have picked up little children that were wandering they knew not where, whoÅ¿e (parents were cut off) and taken them to the orphan houÅ¿e, for at this time the dread that prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over people's minds was Å¿o general, that it was a rare inÅ¿tance to Å¿ee one neighbour viÅ¿it another, and
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:027170_0019_0FD39355EDB57250"/>
even friends when they met in the Å¿treets were afraid of each other, much leÅ¿s would they admit into their houÅ¿es the diÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿ed orphan that had been where the Å¿ickneÅ¿s was; this extreme Å¿eemed in Å¿ome inÅ¿tances to have the appearance of barbarity; with reluctance we call to mind the many opportunities there were in the power of individuals to be uÅ¿eful to their fellow-men, yet through the terror of the times was omitted. A black man riding through the Å¿treet, Å¿aw a man puÅ¿h a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man out of the houÅ¿e, the woman Å¿taggered and fell on her face in the gutter, and was not able to turn herÅ¿elf, the black man thought Å¿he was drunk, but obÅ¿erving Å¿he was in danger of Å¿uffocation alighted, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nd<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>taking the woman up found her perfectly Å¿ober, out Å¿o far gone with the diÅ¿order that Å¿he was not able to help herÅ¿elf; the hard hearted man that threw her down, Å¿hut the door and left herâin Å¿uch a Å¿ituation, Å¿he might have periÅ¿hed in a few minutes: we heard of it, and took her to BuÅ¿h-hill. Many of the white people, that ought to be patterns for us to follow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, have acted in a manner that would make humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Å¿hudder. We remember an inÅ¿tance of cruelty, which we truÅ¿t, no black man would be guilty of: two Å¿iÅ¿ters orderly, decent, white women were Å¿ick with the fever, one of them recovered Å¿o as to come to the door; a neighbouring white man Å¿aw her, and in an angry tone aÅ¿ked her if her Å¿iÅ¿ter was dead or not? She anÅ¿wered no, upon which he replied, damn her, if Å¿he don't die before morning, I will make her die. The poor woman Å¿hocked at Å¿uch an expreÅ¿Å¿ion, from this monÅ¿ter of a man, made a modeÅ¿t reply, upon which he Å¿natched <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>p a tub of water, and would have daÅ¿hed it over her, if he had not been prevented by a black man; he then went and took a couple of fowls out of a coop, (which had been given them for nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿hment) and threw them into an open alley; he had his wiÅ¿h, the poor woman that he would make die,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:027170_0020_0FD39358CDB5AC90"/>
died that night. A white man threatened to Å¿hoot us, iÅ¿Å¿ue paÅ¿Å¿ed by his houÅ¿e with a corpÅ¿e: we buried him three days after.</p>
               <p>We have been pained to Å¿ee the widows come to us, crying and wringing their hands, and in very great diÅ¿treÅ¿s, on account of their huÅ¿bands' death; having nobody to help them, they were obliged to come to get their huÅ¿bands buried, their neighbours were afraid to go to their help or to condole with them; we aÅ¿cribe Å¿uch unfriendly conduct to the frailty of human nature, and not to wilful unkindneÅ¿s, or hardneÅ¿s of heart.</p>
               <p>NotwithÅ¿tanding the compliment Mr. Carey hath paid us, we have found reports Å¿pread, of our taking between one, and two hundred beds, from houÅ¿es where people died; Å¿uch Å¿landerers as theÅ¿e, who propagate Å¿uch wilful lies are dangerous, although unworthy no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. We wiÅ¿h if any perÅ¿on hath the leaÅ¿t Å¿uÅ¿picion of us, they would endeavour to bring us to the puniÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which Å¿uch atrocious conduct muÅ¿t deÅ¿erve; and by this means, the innocent will be cleared from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, and the guilty known.</p>
               <p>We Å¿hall now conclude with the following old pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, which we think applicable to thoÅ¿e of our colour who expoÅ¿ed their lives in the late afflicting diÅ¿penÅ¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:â

               <p>FOR the perÅ¿onal reÅ¿pect we bear you, and for the Å¿atisfaction of the Mayor, we declare, that to the beÅ¿t of our remembrance we had the care of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing beds and no more.â</p>
               <p>Two belonging to James Starr we buried; upon taking them up, we found one damaged; the blankets, &amp;c. belonging to it were Å¿tolen; it was refuÅ¿ed to be accepted of by his Å¿on MoÅ¿es; it was buried again, and remains Å¿o for ought we know<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> the other was return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and accepted of.</p>
               <p>We buried two belonging to Samuel FiÅ¿her, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant; one of them was taken up by us, to carry a Å¿ick perÅ¿on on to BuÅ¿h-hill, and there left; the other was buried in a grave, under a corpÅ¿e.</p>
               <p>Two beds were buried for Thomas Willing, one Å¿ix feet deep in his garden, and lime and water thrown upon it; the other was in the Potter's field, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knowledge of it we have not.</p>
               <p>We burned one bed with other furniture, and cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing belonging to the late Mayor, Samuel Powel, on his farm on the weÅ¿t Å¿ide of Schuylkill river;âwe bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried one of his beds.</p>
               <p>ForâDickenÅ¿on, we buried a bed in a lot of Richard Allen; which we have good cauÅ¿e to believe, was Å¿tolen.</p>
               <p>One bed was buried for a perÅ¿on in front Å¿treet, whoÅ¿e name is unknown to us, it was buried in the Potter's field, by a perÅ¿on employed for the purpoÅ¿e; we told him he might take it up again after it had been buried a week, and apply it to his own uÅ¿e, as he

               <p>Thomas Leiper's two beds were buried in the Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's field, and remained there a week, and then taken up by us, for the uÅ¿e of the Å¿ick that we took to BuÅ¿h-hill, and left the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>We buried one forâSmith, in the Potter's field, which was returned except the furniture, which we believe was Å¿tolen.</p>
               <p>One other we buried forâDavis, in Vine Å¿treet, it was buried near Schuylkill, and we believe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues Å¿o.</p>
               <p>A bed fromâGueÅ¿ts in Second Å¿treet, was buried in the Potter's field, and is there yet, for any thing we know.</p>
               <p>One bed we buried in the PreÅ¿byterian burial ground the corner of Pine and Fourth Å¿treets<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> and we believe was taken up by the owner, Thomas Mitchel.</p>
               <p>âMillegan in Second Å¿treet, had a bed buried by us in the Potter's fieldâwe have no further know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it.</p>
               <p>This is a true Å¿tate of matters reÅ¿pecting the beds, as far as we were concerned, we never undertook the charge of more than their burial, knowing they were liable to be taken away by evil minded perÅ¿ons. We think it beneath the dignity of an honeÅ¿t man, (although injured in his reputation by wicked and envious perÅ¿ons) to vindicate or Å¿upport his character, by an oath or le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal affirmation; we fear not our enemies, let them come forward with their charges, we will not flinch, and if they can fix any crime upon us, we refuÅ¿e not to Å¿uffer.</p>
               <p>SIR,
You have cauÅ¿e to believe our lives were endanger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in more caÅ¿es than one, in the time of the late mortality, and that we were Å¿o diÅ¿couraged, that had it not been for your perÅ¿uaÅ¿ion, we would have relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiÅ¿hed

               <p>THE judicious part of mankind will think it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaÅ¿onable, that a Å¿uperior good conduct is looked for, from our race, by thoÅ¿e who Å¿tigmatize us as men, whoÅ¿e baÅ¿eneÅ¿s is incurable, and may therefore be held in a Å¿tate of Å¿ervitude, that a merciful man would not doom a beaÅ¿t to; yet you try what you can to prevent our riÅ¿ing from the Å¿tate of barbariÅ¿m, you repreÅ¿ent us to be in, but we can tell you, from a degree of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that a black man, although reduced to the moÅ¿t abject Å¿tate human nature is capable of, Å¿hort of real madneÅ¿s, can think, reflect, and feel injuries, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it may not be with the Å¿ame degree of keen reÅ¿entment and revenge, that you who have been and

are our great oppreÅ¿Å¿ors, would manifeÅ¿t if reduced to the pitiable condition of a Å¿lave. We believe if you would try the experiment of taking a few black chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and cultivate their minds with the Å¿ame care, and let them have the Å¿ame proÅ¿pect in view, as to living in the world, as you would wiÅ¿h for your own children, you would find upon the trial, they were not inferior in mental endowments.</p>
               <p>We do not wiÅ¿h to make you angry, but excite your attention to conÅ¿ider, how hateful Å¿lavery is in the Å¿ight of that God, who hath deÅ¿troyed kings and princes, for their oppreÅ¿Å¿ion of the poor Å¿laves; Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh and his princes with the poÅ¿terity of king Saul, were deÅ¿troyed by the protector and avenger of Å¿laves. Would you not Å¿uppoÅ¿e the IÅ¿raelites to be utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for freedom, and that it was impoÅ¿Å¿ible for them to attain to any degree of excellence? Their hiÅ¿tory Å¿hews how Å¿lavery had debaÅ¿ed their Å¿pirits. Men muÅ¿t be wilfully blind and extremely partial, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Å¿ee the contrary effects of liberty and Å¿lavery upon the mind of man; we freely confeÅ¿s the vile habits of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten acquired in a Å¿tate of Å¿ervitude, are not eaÅ¿ily thown off; the example of the IÅ¿raelites Å¿hews, who with all that MoÅ¿es could do to reclaim them from it, Å¿till continued in their former habits more or leÅ¿s; and why will you look for better from us? Why will you look for grapes from thorns, or figs from thiÅ¿tles? It is in our poÅ¿terity enjoying the Å¿ame privileges with your own, that you ought to look for better things.</p>
               <p>When you are pleaded with, do not you reply as Pharaoh did, "wherefore do ye MoÅ¿es and Aaron, let the people from their work, behold the people of the land, now are many, and you make them reÅ¿t from their burdens." We wiÅ¿h you to conÅ¿ider, that God himÅ¿elf was the firÅ¿t pleader of the cauÅ¿e of Å¿laves.</p>

abhor an Egyptian, becauÅ¿e thou waÅ¿t a Å¿tranger in his land. Deut. xxiii. 7." The meek and humble JeÅ¿us, the great pattern of humanity, and every other virtue that can adorn and dignify men, hath command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to love our enemies, to do good to them that hate and deÅ¿pitefully uÅ¿e us. We feel the obligations, we wiÅ¿h to impreÅ¿s them on the minds of our black bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and that we may all forgive you, as we wiÅ¿h to be forgiven; we think it a great mercy to have all anger and bitterneÅ¿s removed from our minds; we appeal to your own feelings, if it is not very diÅ¿quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to feel yourÅ¿elves under the dominion of a wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diÅ¿poÅ¿ition.</p>
               <p>If you love your children, if you love your country, if you love the God of love, clear your hands from Å¿laves, burden not your children or country with them. Our hearts have been Å¿orrowful for the late bloodÅ¿hed of the oppreÅ¿Å¿ors, as well as the oppreÅ¿Å¿ed, both ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear guilty of each others blood, in the Å¿ight of him who Å¿aid, he that Å¿heddeth man's blood, by man Å¿hall his blood be Å¿hed.</p>
               <p>Will you, becauÅ¿e you have reduced us to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy condition our colour is in, plead our incapacity for freedom, and our contented condition under op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preÅ¿Å¿ion, as a Å¿ufficient cauÅ¿e for keeping us under the grievous yoke?

               <p>God himÅ¿elf hath pleaded their cauÅ¿e, he hath from time to time raiÅ¿ed up inÅ¿truments for that purpoÅ¿e, Å¿ometimes mean and contemptible in your Å¿ight; at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times he hath uÅ¿ed Å¿uch as it hath pleaÅ¿ed him,

               <p>We mention our experience to you, that your hearts may not Å¿ink at the diÅ¿couraging proÅ¿pects you may have, and that you may put your truÅ¿t in God, who Å¿ees your condition, and as a merciful father pitieth his children, Å¿o doth God pity them that love him; and as your hearts are inclined to Å¿erve God, you will feel an affectionate regard towards your maÅ¿ters and miÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿es, and the whole family where you live, this will be Å¿een by them, and tend to promote your liberty, eÅ¿pecially with Å¿uch as have feeling maÅ¿ters, and if they are otherwiÅ¿e you will have the favour and love of God dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in your hearts, which you will value more than any thing elÅ¿e, which will be a conÅ¿olation in the worÅ¿t conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you can be in, and no maÅ¿ter can deprive you of it; and as life is Å¿hort and uncertain, and the chief end of our hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a being in this world, is to be prepared for a better, we wiÅ¿h you to think of this more than any thing elÅ¿e: then will you have a view of that freedom which the Å¿ons of God enjoy; and if the troubles of your condition end with your lives, you will be admitted to the freedom which God hath prepared for thoÅ¿e of all colours that love him; here the

power of the moÅ¿t cruel maÅ¿ter ends, and all Å¿orrow and tears are wiped away.</p>
               <p>To you who are favoured with freedom; let your conduct manifeÅ¿t your gratitude toward the compaÅ¿Å¿ionate maÅ¿ters who have Å¿et you free, and let no rancour or ill-will lodge in your breaÅ¿ts for any bad treatment you may have receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from any; if you do, you tranÅ¿greÅ¿s againÅ¿t God, who will not hold you guiltleÅ¿s, he would not Å¿uffer it even in his beloved people IÅ¿rael, and can you think he will allow it unto us?</p>
               <p>There is much gratitude due from our colour towards the white people, very many of them are inÅ¿truments in the hand of God for our good, even Å¿uch as have held us in cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, are now pleading our cauÅ¿e with earneÅ¿tneÅ¿s and zeal; and we are Å¿orry to Å¿ay, that too many think more of the evil, than of the good they have received, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tead of taking the advice of their friends, turn from it with indifference; much depends upon us for the help of our co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour more than many are aware; if we are lazy and idle, the enemies of freedom plead it as a cauÅ¿e why we ought not to be free, and Å¿ay we are better in a Å¿tate of Å¿ervitude, and that giving us our liberty would be an injury to us, and by Å¿uch conduct we Å¿terngthen the bands of oppreÅ¿Å¿ion, and keep many in bondage who are more worthy than ourÅ¿elves; we intreat you to conÅ¿ider the obligations we lay under, to help forward the cauÅ¿e of freedom, we who know how bitter the cup is of which the Å¿lave hath to drink, O how ought we to feel for thoÅ¿e who yet remain in bondage? Will even our friends excuÅ¿e, will God pardon us, for the part we act in making Å¿trong the hands of the enemies of our colour.</p>

               <p>WE feel an inexpreÅ¿Å¿ible gratitude towards you, who have engaged in the cauÅ¿e of the African race; you have wrought a deliverance for many, from more than E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian bondage, your labours are unremitted for their complete redemption, from the cruel Å¿ubjection they are in. You feel our afflictionsâyou Å¿ympathize with us in the heart-rending diÅ¿treÅ¿s, when the huÅ¿band is Å¿eparated from the wife, and the parents from the children, who are never more to meet in this world. The tear of Å¿enÅ¿ibility trickles from your eye, to Å¿ee the Å¿ufferings that keep us from increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ing.

âYour righteous indignation is rouÅ¿ed at the means taken to Å¿upply the place of the murdered babe. You Å¿ee our race more effectually deÅ¿troyed, than was in Pharaoh's power to effect, upon IÅ¿rael's Å¿ons; you blow the trumpet againÅ¿t the mighty evil, you make the tyrants tremble; you Å¿trive to raiÅ¿e the Å¿lave, to the dignity of a man; you take our children by the hand, to lead them in the path of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, by your care of their education; you are not aÅ¿hamed to call the moÅ¿t abject of our race, brethren, children of one father, who made of one blood all the nations of the earth: You aÅ¿k for this, nothing for yourÅ¿elves, nothing but what is worthy the cauÅ¿e you are engaged in; nothing but that we would be friends to ourÅ¿elves, and not Å¿trengthen the bands of oppreÅ¿Å¿ion, by an evil conduct, when led out of the houÅ¿e of bondage. May he, who hath ariÅ¿en to plead our cauÅ¿e, and engaged you as volunteers in the Å¿ervice, add to your numbers, until the princes Å¿hall come forth from Egypt, and Ethiopia Å¿tretch out her hand unto God.</p>
