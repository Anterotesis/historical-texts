         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in their melancholy Exile by the Rivers of <hi>Babylon, Euphrates</hi> and <hi>Tygris,</hi> lamented the Loſs of their religious Solemnities; <hi>We wept,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>when we remembred Zion;</hi> there they endured the Inſults of their Enemies, in demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mirth and a Song, of ſuch who were almoſt overwhelmed with Sorrow and Sadneſs! but this unſeaſonable Demand they juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refuſed to comply with, leſt they ſhould ſeem to forget the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of their Church and Nation, whoſe Proſperity they preferred to all the other Delights of Life: <hi>If I forget thee, O Jeruſalem, let my Right Hand forget her Cunning: If I do not remember thee, let my Tongue cleave to the Roof of my Mouth, if I prefer not Jeruſalem above my chief Joy!</hi>

It will be to his great Honour and Advantage, who by executing Juſtice and equal Severity upon the unrighteous E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of God's Heritage, is hereby an Inſtrument in the Hand of God to vindicate his Honour, execute his Judgments, fulfil his Word, and relieve his People: Thus it was with <hi>Cyrus,</hi> as both ſacred and prophane Hiſtory witneſs, and hence he is call'd God's <hi>Servant,</hi> his <hi>Shepherd,</hi> his <hi>Anointed (Iſ.</hi> 44. <hi>ult.</hi> 45. 1. <hi>Iſ.</hi> 13.3.) and the <hi>Soldiers</hi> which were employ'd in recompenſing upon the aforeſaid Enemies of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the Deeds which they did to them, are called his <hi>ſanctified Ones. (Iſ.</hi> 13.3.) From the Words of our Text thus explained, I would obſerve the following Propoſition, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <hi>That ſuch, who in the Courſe of a lawful War, recompence upon the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of God's Church and People the Injuries they have done to them, are happy Perſons!</hi>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I return to conſider the</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt propos'd, which was, to <hi>Enquire what Kind of War is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful?</hi> In anſwer to which it may be obſerved, that there are two
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:007799_0005_102D8CE4D9B0C070"/>
Kinds of War, <hi>viz. Offenſive</hi> and <hi>Defenſive:</hi> The former is an unjuſt Invaſion of another's Property, from Principles of Ambition and Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice; the Latter, is an Attempt to preſerve or recover our own from the Hands of Violence, or to puniſh ſome publick Injury, which affects the Credit or Intereſt of a Nation or People; this Kind of War, <hi>viz. Defenſive,</hi> when entered into by the ſupreme Magiſtrate with due Caution, after pacific Meaſures have been try'd in vain, and is, in the Mean Time, ſuitably conducted, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be lawful and right, ſeeing it has Juſtice and Right for its Foundation and Scope, and is the Support, the Execution and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence thereof; but <hi>Offenſive</hi> War, being an unjuſt Invaſion of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other's Property, is not only different from, but contrary to this, and therefore ſinful and unjuſtifiable; a clear View of the Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of theſe Kinds of War, is of great Importance in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy, and caſts a Light upon the whole Argument. I proceed to the</p>
            <p n="2">2d propos'd, which was to ſhew, <hi>whence Defenſive War appears to be lawful or right.</hi> Now this, I think, appears evidently from the Suffrage both of <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Revolution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is nothing that <hi>Reaſon</hi> teaches with greater Clearneſs, or inculcates with a ſtronger <hi>Pathes,</hi> than the Excellency and Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of <hi>commutative Juſtice,</hi> or giving to every one his own: Now ſeeing the Deſign, Nature and Tendency of Defenſive War, is to maintain and diſtribute this among Mankind, it muſt therefore of Conſequence be good in itſelf, when under proper Regulations, ſo long as there is any intrinſick Excellency in that Virtue on which it is founded, to which it is directed, and of which it is an Executor: He that oppoſes this, muſt either ſay, that <hi>Juſtice</hi> itſelf, in its own Nature, is bad, or that it is wrong to do or promote what is good; each of which is equally abſurd, and contrary to the Reaſon and Common Senſe of Mankind, as well as everſive of all Virtue and Religion; thoſe therefore that oppoſe Defenſive War, will never be able fairly to carry their Point, till they ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidly prove, that <hi>Juſtice</hi> itſelf is ſinful and wicked, which, if I am not much miſtaken, is a difficult Task.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:007799_0006_102D8CE72A378690"/>I might here obſerve, that ſeeing Offenſive and Defenſive War are Contraries, it therefore follows, That all the Arguments ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced by any againſt Offenſive War, do turn virtually and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequentially in Favour of Defenſive, and are ſo many Proofs of its Excellency and Neceſſity. <hi>E. G.</hi> He that oppoſes the Evil of Injuſtice, does at the ſame Time tacitly recommend its Contrary, whether he will or not, for Contraries can neither be oppos'd or defended together with Reaſon and Propriety; the more abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and dangerous the one is, the more excellent is the other, which is oppos'd to it. So that all the Opponents of War, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexly conſider'd, are of Neceſſity Patrons of one Kind of it, tho', perhaps, without their Knowledge, or againſt their Wills: Now ſeeing Deceit lurks in Genarals, it is but right that the Oppoſers of War, ſhould candidly tell us which Kind they are againſt, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent farther Diſputes about the Matter: As for our Part, we declare expreſly our Abhorrence of <hi>Offenſive War,</hi> as a great <hi>Iniquity,</hi> and are willing to make this evident, not only by <hi>Words,</hi> but by <hi>Actions,</hi> in labouring by main Force to deſtroy that <hi>Monſter,</hi> if milder Meaſures will not anſwer the noble End, of introducing the deſirable Bleſſing of Peace.</p>
            <p>Charity would incline me to think, that the Oppoſers of War, muſt mean Offenſive; for ſurely they wou'dn't knowingly expreſs ſo much Zeal and Invective as is ſometimes uſed in this Argument againſt <hi>Juſtice:</hi> Well, if the Caſe be ſo, we have them upon our Side of the Queſtion; they are, in Effect, warm Advocates for Defenſive War, and this indeed is no ſmall Comfort, that our Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents are ſo friendly in this Debate, we with they would either underſtand us or themſelves, and join with us in proving by <hi>Fact,</hi> the Reality of their Hatred againſt that Abomination that maketh deſolate, <hi>Offenſive War:</hi> Their Invectives againſt it are juſt and commendable, but inſufficient to deſtroy it; Words won't kill that <hi>Hydra;</hi> herein therefore they fail, that they don't join with us Heart and Hand, by Force and Arms to cruſh that cruel <hi>Cocka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice!</hi> May it not be hoped that in Time-coming they will better bethink themſelves, and act a more conſiſtent Part; that they will
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:007799_0007_102D8CE9C99F0340"/>
not ſerve ſo good a Cauſe as preſs'd Men by Conſtraint, but nobly and openly join as VOLUNTEERS!</p>
            <p>But in Addition to the Maxim of Juſtice now mentioned, the Light of Nature teaches every one to preſerve his Life from unjuſt Violence, by the Principle of <hi>Self-Love,</hi> which is implanted in all, and which, when kept within due Bounds, is good and neceſſary, and therefore made by our Lord the Standard of Love to our Neighbour; this Principle diſpoſes us to deſire Life, as well as to fear and ſhun the Approaches of Death; when we therefore neglect a neceſſary and ſeaſonable Self-defence, we are without <hi>natural Affection, Self-haters;</hi> a rare and ſtrange Sort of Monſters in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for <hi>no Man ever hated his own Fleſh, but nouriſheth and cheriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reaſon likewiſe teaches the Propriety and Neceſſity of Self-defence, from the <hi>Capacity</hi> given to this Purpoſe, and <hi>Inclination</hi> to exerciſe it; Man is endowed with Underſtanding and Ability, which the innocent Reſentment common to all, urges to exert in oppoſing Violence, and guarding againſt the Approaches of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: And therefore he that ſuffers his Life to be taken from him, by one that hath no Authority for that Purpoſe, when he might preſerve it by Defence, betrays it, and conſequently is guilty of <hi>Self-Murder,</hi> one of the greateſt of Crimes!</p>
            <p>Conſidering the preſent State of human Nature, to baniſh Self-defence, though proſecuted by Force, would be ſo far from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting Peace, that it would on the Contrary contribute to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Deſtruction</hi> of Mankind! For Injuſtice in this Situation of Things, having no Fear of Puniſhment to check its Courſe, would inundate the World, and introduce univerſal <hi>Anarchy,</hi> Confuſion and <hi>Ruin:</hi> a melancholy Confirmation of which we have lately had in the defenceleſs Frontiers of this ſecure, unhappy Province!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sirs,</hi> If it be not lawful and right, to oppoſe with Force unjuſt Invaders, then the Goods of Providence are given to no valuable Purpoſe, and the beſt of Men are expoſed as an eaſy <hi>Prey</hi> to the Worſt, and that by <hi>God</hi>'s own <hi>Order,</hi> which is abſurd! Is it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional to ſuppoſe, that the Law of Nature, which was deſigned to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:007799_0008_102D880EB6ED89E8"/>
Man's Safety in this World, ſhould countenance ſuch a ſorry Sort of Peace, as tends to promote the very Contrary? no ſurely! For this would, in Effect, charge Weakneſs and Folly upon God himſelf, which to impute to infinite and unerring Wiſdom, is a blaſphemous Reflection!</p>
            <p>Farther, <hi>my Brethren,</hi> give me leave to add, that <hi>Reaſon</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe teaches the Neceſſity of the <hi>Magiſtrates Office</hi> in a Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to puniſh Injuſtice, and to protect our Perſons and Properties; now how can theſe be done without Force and Arms, in ſuch a degenerate World as this is? And if either of theſe be neglected, what is <hi>Government</hi> but an empty Name, a meer <hi>Cypher,</hi> that, inſtead of Honour, deſerves <hi>Contempt!</hi> Such a ſorry Government is much worſe than none a at all; worſe than a State of Nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it binds Mens Hands till they are <hi>robb'd</hi> and <hi>murder'd,</hi> which, otherwiſe, they might uſe in their own Defence!</p>
            <p>Nothing admits of clearer Demonſtration, than that Force and Fighting are eſſential to the Being and Preſervation of Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, in Man's preſent corrupt State; now, if the Caſe be ſo, it is the very ſame (in all Things material) with Defenſive War, the <hi>Subſtance</hi> of both is the ſame, <hi>viz.</hi> Force and Fighting, Bloodſhed and Death; the <hi>Authority</hi> enjoining both is the ſame, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the Magiſtrate, the <hi>End</hi> of both is the ſame, <hi>viz.</hi> the Preſervation of the State; the <hi>Occaſion</hi> the ſame, <hi>viz.</hi> that eaſier Methods will not, at Times, anſwer the aforeſaid Ends: Certainly the Number of <hi>Villains</hi> cannot leſſon their Crimes, nor have <hi>Rogues</hi> of another Nation any Right to rob and murder us with Impunity more than thoſe of our own: Why then ſhould they not be oppos'd with equal Care and Force?</p>
            <p>What is <hi>Civil Government</hi> but the Union of Individuals, for the more effectual Protection of Perſon and Property from Injuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and Violence? whereby a ſufficient Meaſure of Power is, by common Conſent, treaſured up for the Security and Benefit of all the Members of that Body, which is to be exerted to compaſs the aforeſaid important Ends, as the publick Officers of the Society ſhall direct: And hence it is that Perſons who are wrong'd, or in Danger of being ſo, reaſonably fly to the Officers of the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:007799_0009_102D8CEF06FB8D48"/>
for Juſtice and Protection, which if they are abſolutely deny'd, or unreaſonably <hi>deferred,</hi> beyond the proper Seaſon for <hi>Succour,</hi> and many Perſons are in the mean Time <hi>robb'd</hi> and <hi>murder'd,</hi> the principal End of Government is contradicted and deſtroyed; and the People wrong'd and robb'd of their Right, as <hi>Members</hi> of <hi>Society;</hi> nor will it be eaſy to clear ſuch publick <hi>Officers</hi> (or thoſe of them who are acceſſary to the aforeſaid Meaſures) from the Guilt of <hi>Blood!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if <hi>Magiſtracy</hi> and <hi>Defenſive War</hi> be the ſame in Subſtance, as has been obſerved, it is ſtrange that any ſhould be ready to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the one, who ſcruple the other, as if it was a wicked Thing to put a foreign Criminal to Death, but juſt and good to kill one of our own Country and Nation! Wou'dn't it look more like Candour, Humility and Conſiſtency, for ſuch as ſcruple <hi>Defenſive War,</hi> or deny it, to keep clear of <hi>Offices</hi> in the <hi>Government,</hi> which oblige them, if they will act in Character, to do what is equivalent thereto: Then there would be no Need of <hi>ambiguous, general</hi> and <hi>artful</hi> Terms, poſſibly to conceal from vulgar Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance and Prejudice Practices really contradictory to profeſſed Principles; to reconcile ſuch extraordinary Conduct to <hi>common Candour</hi> and <hi>Sincerity,</hi> is a Task ſo difficult, that it vaſtly ſurpaſſes the Reach of an ordinary Underſtanding.</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs I am utterly at a Loſs to conceive the Conſiſtency of Perſons who are principled againſt <hi>Defenſive War</hi> accepting of Offices in the Government, the chief Deſign of which is to defend the Community; it is a Contradiction in Terms as well as Matter, a groſs <hi>Abſurdity;</hi> and this is the more unaccountable, when it is done in a Time of publick Danger; for hereby, if Mens profeſſed Principles may be ſuppoſed to have any Influence upon their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, they will be tempted to take wrong Meaſures, or over-ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proſecute thoſe that are right; and hereby others are kept from the <hi>Helm</hi> in a Storm, whoſe Principles would probably lead them to do what is neceſſary to the Safety of the State.</p>
            <p>Nor is it eaſy to clear thoſe from the Charge of Inconſiſtency, and ſomething worſe, who deſire and expect Protection, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps complain if they have it not, and yet CHUSE into publick Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:007799_0010_102D8CF0F72F26C8"/>
thoſe who are principled againſt it, whether they are not, by the aforeſaid <hi>Choice,</hi> in ſome Degree chargeable with all the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy CONSEQUENCES of ſuch a Government, it is but proper they ſhould ſoberly enquire?</p>
            <p>The Practice of all Nations, not only of the moſt civilized, but even of the moſt rude and barbarous, who all with one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent have oppos'd Force to Force in their own Defence, from the Beginning of the World to this Time, is no inconſiderable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prove that <hi>Defenſive War</hi> is agreeable to the <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Common Senſe</hi> of Mankind; the Denial of it is therefore a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and an Affront to <hi>Common Senſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea the very <hi>Beaſts,</hi> by <hi>natural Inſtinct,</hi> are diſpoſed to defend themſelves, and are provided with Weapons for that Purpoſe; it ſhould therefore be queried, in caſe we make no Reſiſtance when Neceſſity urges, whether we do not act with leſs Wiſdom than <hi>Pagans,</hi> and with leſs Diſcretion than <hi>Beaſts?</hi> Now can it be with Reaſon ſuppoſed, that the <hi>Chriſtian Inſtitution,</hi> which was deſign'd to exalt us above the <hi>Angels,</hi> ſhould, at the ſame Time, ſink us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>Infidels</hi> and <hi>Beaſts?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having offered ſome what reſpecting the Suffrage of <hi>Reaſon</hi> in favour of <hi>Defenſive War,</hi> I proceed to enquire wether <hi>Revelation</hi> in the ſeveral Periods of the Church of God, or Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Heaven towards it, does not coroborate and confirm the aforeſaid <hi>Suffrage?</hi> Here a large Field opens, but the Time allows me to mention only a few Hints.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Patriarchal Age,</hi> I would only offer one Inſtance, <hi>viz.</hi> That of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the <hi>Friend of God,</hi> and <hi>Father of the Faithful,</hi> he trained up his Servants, inſtructed them in the Uſe of Arms, to prepare them for Action, when Neceſſity required; and therefore when he heard that his Brother was taken captive, he arm'd his train'd Servants, ſmote the Enemy, and purſued them. It would have been happy for this poor Province, if ſuch in it who profeſs themſelves to be the ſpiritual <hi>Children of Abraham,</hi> had followed the Example of the <hi>Father of the Fruthful,</hi> in haſtening to the Relief of their diſtreſſed Proteſtant Brethern, it would have ſhown ſome <hi>Brotherly Love,</hi> prevented much Bloodſhed, and given ſome Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:007799_0011_102D8CF2E7E43C08"/>
of their <hi>ſpiritual Claim.</hi> Now that the Almighty approved of this memorable Battle of <hi>Abraham,</hi> is evident from <hi>Melchizedek's</hi> congratulating him on Occaſion of his Victory, and likewiſe by his bleſſing him, and bleſſing God on the ſame Account, and by his receiving Part of the Spoils, all which would have been abſurd and impious, if the Battle itſelf hadn't been lawful. See <hi>Gen.</hi> 14 (18, 19, 20. Verſes.) <hi>And Melchizedek King of Salem, Prieſt of the Moſt high God, bleſſed him, and ſaid, Bleſſed be Abraham of the Moſt High God, Poſſeſſor of Heaven and Earth, and Bleſſed be the Moſt High God, which hath delivered thine Enemies into thine Hands.</hi> Here ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that ſeeing this Battle of <hi>Abraham</hi> was fought before the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Policy and Ceremonies were form'd, was likewiſe an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Action, that concern'd the Goods and Lives of Men, and met with the Divine Approbation, <hi>Defenſive War</hi> muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be morally and unalterably good and lawful.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Moſaick Diſpenſation,</hi> or <hi>Jewiſh Oeconomy,</hi> nothing is more evident, than that divers <hi>Wars,</hi> were carry'd on while that ſubſiſted, by various Worthies, with the divine Approbation and Direction; thus devout <hi>Gideon,</hi> a mighty Man of Valour, was commiſſioned to fight againſt the <hi>Midianites,</hi> and reſcue <hi>Iſrael</hi> from their Tyranny<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (<hi>Judges</hi> 6 14 16.) <hi>And the Lord ſaid, Go in this thy Might, and thou ſhall ſave Iſrael from the Hand of the Midianites, have I not ſent thee! ſurely I will be with thee, and thou ſhalt ſlay the Midi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anites as one Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Pious <hi>Joſhua</hi> was alſo rais'd up of God, to conduct <hi>Iſrael</hi> in their Wars, for which he had the divine Preſcription. (<hi>Joſh.</hi> 8. 1, 2.) <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto Joſhua, take all the People of War with thee and ariſe go up to Ai, and thou ſhall do unto Ai and her King, as thou didſt to Jericho and her King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Farther <hi>David,</hi> the <hi>Man after God's own Heart,</hi> was another In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the like Kind, who praiſes the Almighty that he had <hi>taught his Hands to war, and his Fingers to fight:</hi> He conducted his Battles according to the expreſs Order of God. (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.8.) Well ſeeing <hi>Defenſive War</hi> was enjoin'd by divine Authority under any Diſpenſation, at any paſt Period of Time, it follows neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, either that it is in itſelf innocent, or that God is the Author of
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:007799_0012_102D88158BA487A0"/>
Sin, by enjoining what is in itſelf ſinful: But the latter is blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, and therefore the Former is moſt certainly true; <hi>viz. That Defenſive War is in itſelf innocent and good,</hi> and, if ſo, becomes a Duty, when Providence calls to it by the Neceſſity of Affairs, and the Magiſtrates Order: Why therefore ſhould an innocent Thing be dreſs'd up in Bears-skins and a <hi>Huc-and-Cry</hi> rais'd againſt it? Is this fair or reaſonable?</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> or <hi>New Teſtament Diſpenſation,</hi> there are divers Inſtances which ſufficiently confirm the Point in View. E. G. When the Soldiers ask'd <hi>John the Baptiſt, what they ſhould do?</hi> he did not direct them to lay aſide their <hi>military Employment,</hi> but to <hi>be content with their Wages:</hi> Which ſuppoſes his Approbation, of the Buſineſs they were engaged in, and implies an Encouragement to continue in it; it cannot be with Reaſon imagined, that this inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Perſon, would give Inſtruction how to conduct an Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment obſolutely ſinful; for that would be to give Direction how to commit Iniquity, which is abſurd! No, if he had judged that Manner of Life to be ſinful, he would have ſaid ſo; for indeed he had not only an Opportunity, but a proper Call to this Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, in Anſwer to the Queſtion propoſed to him; nor was he ever known to mince the Matter.</p>
            <p>Farther, Theſe Words of our Lord, recorded <hi>John</hi> 18.36. do expreſly declare his Approbation of <hi>Defenſive War; If my Kingdom were of this World, then would my Servants fight, that I ſhould not be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the Jews.</hi> Here the Redeemer ſignifies that temporal Kingdoms ſhould be protected by <hi>Fighting</hi> or by <hi>War</hi> and <hi>Force.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of the like Tendency is the following Declaration of Chriſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by the Evangeliſt <hi>Matthew,</hi> Chap. 24, and 43d Verſe, <hi>But know this, that if the good Man of the Houſe had known in what Watch the Thief would come, he would have watched, and not ſuffered his Houſe to be broken up.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This our Lord ſpeaks of with Approbation, and therefore here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by teaches the Lawfulneſs and Neceſſity of oppoſing Robbers by Force, and of preparing for this Oppoſition: <hi>The good Man would have watched, and would not have ſuffered.</hi> Well, if we ſhould reſiſt one Robber, much more many, becauſe the Danger is greater;
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:007799_0013_102D8CF6F4513BF8"/>
and if we ſhould reſiſt Robbers, when they only attempt to take away our Goods, much more when they attack our Lives, which are of more Importance.</p>
            <p>Another memorable Paſſage of our Saviour to the ſame Purpoſe, is that directed to the Apoſtle <hi>Peter, Mat.</hi> 26.53, 54. <hi>Thinkeſt thou that I cannot pray to my Father, and he ſhall preſently give me more than</hi> 12 <hi>Legions of Angels; but how then ſhall the Scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it muſt be.</hi> The Meaning of which is plainly this, that Chriſt muſt die for the Sins of his People according to the Scriptures, and therefore the Uſe of Force to protect his Life in this extraordinary Situation, was unneceſſary and inconſiſtent; but that if the Caſe had been otherwiſe, he would have us'd a military Force for his Protection againſt unjuſt Violence. Our Lord ſpeaks of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> as <hi>military Troops,</hi> and ſignifies that on Suppoſition his Caſe was ordinary, and he attack'd by the Hand of Violence, he would uſe Means to obtain an <hi>arm'd Force</hi> for his Protection; and did not the great Doctor of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> who well knew the Mind of his Maſter and Lord, actually do this, when a Conſpiracy was form'd by the <hi>Jews</hi> againſt his Life: (See <hi>Acts</hi> the 23d Chap.) I hope then there is no Harm in following our Lord and his chief Apoſtle.</p>
            <p>Here it may be farther obſerved, reſpecting the laſt Inſtance, that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> before he apply'd for a Military Force to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect him, had the poſſitive Promiſe of God that he ſhou'd preach the Goſpel of Chriſt at <hi>Rome,</hi> and conſequently be protected from the preſent Combination againſt his Life (<hi>Acts</hi> 23.11.) in which Promiſe he doubtleſs truſted, yet notwithſtanding he tho't it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to uſe the proper outward Mean for his Defence, <hi>viz.</hi> an arm'd Force; this plainly ſhews the Conſiſtency thereof with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God, and a Dependance on him.</p>
            <p>Nor ſhould theſe Words of our Saviour be overlook'd, <hi>are ye come out againſt me as againſt a Thief with Swords and with Staffs;</hi> here the bleſſed Jeſus ſignifies his Approbation of the Uſe of <hi>Arms</hi> and <hi>Force</hi> againſt a <hi>Thief</hi> to bring him to Juſtice, well if in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt, this be lawful and neceſſary againſt one; it is
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:007799_0014_102D8CF9225F7FE0"/>
much more ſo againſt many: Nor is there any good Reaſon why we ſhou'd be more tender of <hi>Foreign,</hi> than Domeſtick <hi>Thieves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the <hi>Centurion</hi> or <hi>Roman Captain</hi> addreſs'd our Saviour on Account of his ſick Servant, and us'd his Military Office as an Argument to obtain his Requeſt, our Lord granted the Petition infere'd by that Argument, and commended the Faith encourag'd by it: which conſidering the Call the Redeemer then had to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his Mind in Relation to <hi>Defenſive War</hi> fairly imply his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of it.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Defenſive War</hi> be ſinful, then to what purpoſe or with what conſiſtency did our Lord command every one of his Diſciples, that had <hi>no Sword, to ſell his Garment and buy one, (Luke</hi> 22.39.) and why is <hi>Cornelius</hi> Captain of the <hi>Italian</hi> Company ſo highly honour'd by Heaven and Earth, and adorn'd with the moſt amiable Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, of being <hi>a devout Man, and one that fear'd God with all his Houſe,</hi> which <hi>gave much Alms to the People, and pray'd to God always;</hi> and in the mean Time no <hi>Cenſure</hi> paſt upon his military Office by an inſpir'd Apoſtle, ſent for by divine Direction, to inform him of his Duty, and that under the expreſs <hi>Promiſe</hi> of an <hi>Angel,</hi> that ſaid Apoſtle ſhou'd tell him what he ought to do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance therefore, one of two Things neceſſarily follows, either that the Angel's Promiſe fail'd, or that <hi>Cornelius</hi> ought not to deſert his military Station, but the former is impoſſible, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the latter is true, and thus the labouring Point is gain'd, <hi>that Defenſive War is lawful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> ſpeaks with Honour and Approbation of the Bravery and martial Exploits of divers antient Heroes, who <hi>through Faith ſubdued Kingdoms, waxed valiant in Fight, and put to Flight the Armies of Aliens</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Here obſerve, that War and Fighting in a good Cauſe is ſo far from being contrary to Faith, that they are Fruit of it. Thoſe therefore who inſtead of bringing forth this Fruit condemn ſuch as do, ſhou'd enquire how they will prove their Faith to be of the ſame kind with that of <hi>David, Samuel</hi> and the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</hi> Hebrews. 11.32, 33.</note>: And in diverſs other Paſſages of Scripture, God himſelf who is the beſt Judge of Truth, Excellency and Worth, ſpeaks with Honour of
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:007799_0015_102D8CFB2BEECF98"/>
military Bravery, and hence the Perſons poſſeſ'd of it are call'd <hi>mighty Men of Valour,</hi> it is therefore a ſorry Sort of Goſpel, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts the Judgment of God himſelf and his inſpir'd Servants; that CASHIERS from the Catalogue of Virtues, <hi>Fortitude and military Bravery,</hi> which are ſo noble in themſelves and neceſſary to the publick <hi>Weal,</hi> and Dubs in their room either ſordid Coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice, or ſtupid Negligence, or rather both together, which are as baſe in themſelves, as pernicious and deſtructive to Society. Unreaſonable and abominable is that pretended Chriſtianity, which directs us to take more Care for the Support of our Bodies, than the Protection of our <hi>Lives,</hi> which our <hi>Lord</hi> tells us are <hi>better than Food and Rayment.</hi> If ſome have been protected in Dangers miraculouſly, ſo others have been fed in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, well, ſeeing the Caſes are Parallel, why will not ſuch who expect Protection without the Uſe of Arms, try whether they can live without Food, a little Trial of this, if we cou'd but perſuade them to it, would ſoon convince them of the Folly of their Faith, or rather Preſumption, and be of more Service than many Arguments. But to preced,</p>
            <p>Give me leave farther to obſerve, that the Argument before us'd of the MAGISTRACY in Favour of <hi>Defenſive War</hi> from Reaſon, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd by Revelation, and that not only in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> but the <hi>New:</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in his <hi>Epiſtle to the Romans,</hi> obſerves, that <hi>the Magiſtrate is a Miniſter of God, to execute Wrath upon him that doth Evil, and ſhou'd not bear the Sword in vain,</hi> and elſewhere Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors are ſaid to be ſent for <hi>the Puniſhment of evil Doors, and Praiſe of thoſe that do well, that under them we may live peaceable and quiet Lives, in all Godlineſs and Honeſty;</hi> and hence we are told, that <hi>he that ſheds Man's Blood, by Man ſhall his Blood be ſhed;</hi> we are likewiſe enjoin'd to <hi>give Tribute to Ceſar,</hi> and to <hi>be Subject to the higher Powers,</hi> becauſe <hi>there is no Power but of God:</hi> Well, if Government be a Divine Inſtitution, and <hi>Force</hi> and <hi>Fighting</hi> are eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to it, as both Reaſon and Revelation aſſure us, then ſuch as oppoſe <hi>Defenſive War,</hi> if they will be conſiſtent with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, muſt alſo oppoſe all civil Order and Government upon the Earth, which if put in Practice wou'd ſoon open ſuch a Scene
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:007799_0016_102D8CFD353385A8"/>
of Confuſion, Deſolation and Blood, as wou'd entirely ruin the whole human Race. It is but right, <hi>that all they that take the Sword</hi> (without or againſt juſt and lawful Authority) <hi>ſhou'd periſh with the Sword,</hi> Matt. 26.52. and that he that <hi>leadeth into Captivity ſhould go into Captivity.

            <p>Once more, if we muſt without Oppoſition, tamely and ſordid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuffer all that is dear to us, as Men and Chriſtians, to be made an eaſy Prey of by our unrighteous and implacable Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, then we are in a worſe Condition under the Goſpel than ever Mankind were in before it; then the laſt, the brighteſt and moſt gracious Diſpenſation of God towards Men, inſtead of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging our Priveleges as it profeſſes, has overſet them all at one <hi>Stroke,</hi> and left us in a State of the moſt abject Slavery, and dreadful <hi>Vaſſalage</hi> to the Luſts of every Invader, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Truth of the Scriptures, and to the Wiſdom and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, as well as entirely everſive of all human Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in this Life<note n="†" place="bottom">I might here add to the <hi>Suffrage</hi> of Reaſon and Revelation, that of the <hi>Chriſtian Church,</hi> the primitive Fathers of which declared their Sentinents in Favour of Defenſive War, witneſs <hi>Clement, Clemens Alexandrinus, Irenius, Origen, Tertullian, Minutius Felix, Cyprian, Chriſoſtom, Nazarius, Baſil, Auguſtine, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe, Cyril, Gregory Nazianzen, Gregory Niſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

The Lawfulneſs of Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive War under proper Regulations, was not ſo much as diſputed, and far leſs was the Denyal of it made a Term of Communion by any (of Note) or by any Society of Chriſtians for above 1500 Years after Chriſt; and therefore the Opinion that every kind of War is in itſelf a great Evil, and that ſuch as are for the defenſive Kind, ſhou'd be caſt out of religious Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; is a novel upſtart Notion, of very late Date, as contrary to Antiquity as to Scripture and Reaſon.

            <p>This Undertaking, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> is ſo much the more excellent and worthy of Commendation, as it is diſintereſted and voluntary, tho' attended with Fatigue and Expence: Hereby you act up to the Reaſon of Men and the Zeal of Chriſtians, of Proteſtants, of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons!</hi> expreſſing by Action a real Reward to your Religion and Liberty, to your King and Country, to your Friends and dear Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latives; for by this Undertaking you declare that you will not tamely and ſordidly give them all up to the Luſts of our inveterate Enemies, without ſtriking a ſtroke in their Defence: Go on, <hi>Sirs,</hi> in the Name of God, and be not diſcouraged by any Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or Reflections you may meet with in the Proſecution of your Deſign, which is honeſt and honourable, and of Service to your Country!</p>
            <p>Now in order to proſper herein, give me Leave with Humility and Earneſtneſs to intreat you, to endeavour with Speed and Vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence to be ſincerely <hi>religious</hi> yourſelves; this is the beſt Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive for hazardous Enterprizes, the beſt Foundation of undiſguiſed <hi>Patriotiſm,</hi> and undaunted <hi>Courage,</hi> as well as the moſt probable Mean to obtain <hi>Succeſs,</hi> to this End therefore bewail your Offences againſt God, accept of the Redeemer, and obey his Laws.</p>

avoid thoſe unhappy Contentions which ſpring from <hi>Pride</hi> as their Source, and are as ſcandalous as prejudicial to Society, not only by marring the Comfort of it, but by rendering (frequently) the moſt noble Deſigns, and promiſing Appearances, abortive.</p>
            <p>Beware, <hi>my Brethren,</hi> of a narrow, bitter <hi>Party-Spirit,</hi> ſlight not each other becauſe of different Sentiments in Religion or Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, for ſuch a Diverſity is unavoidable in the preſent State of Imperfection: However you may differ in other Matters, yet agree in this common and noble Cauſe, <hi>the Defence of your Country,</hi> and the rather becauſe by its excellent Conſtitution, it maintains your <hi>Religious Liberty</hi> inviolate!</p>
            <p>O preſerve the Union of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> among yourſelves, without this your military Aſſociations are neither like to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable or comfortable to yourſelves, or ſerviceable to your Country; and ſeeing your Companies are not formed by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint of Authority, but by your own Choice, and have no Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of private Intereſt to encourage their Continuance; there is of Conſequence the greater Need of the aforeſaid Union, without which they are not like to be of long Duration.</p>
            <p>But I proceed to offer a few Words to ſuch of the Inhabitants of this City, who have not hitherto join'd in the late <hi>Aſſociations for Defence,</hi> or <hi>military Companies: My Friends and Brethren,</hi> when any, in a Time of publick Danger and Diſtreſs, freely and voluntarily of their own Motion, <hi>offer themſelves</hi> to defend their Country by <hi>Force</hi> and <hi>Arms,</hi> and avenge its Wrongs, it furniſhes ſufficient Matter for Thankfulneſs and Praiſe to Almighty God, who has ſtirr'd them up thereto, and gives great Pleaſure and Delight to ſuch as have their Country's Good at Heart; but the Enemies of our Religion and Liberty are griev'd at ſuch a Sight. (See <hi>Judges</hi> 5. 2. 9. And <hi>Nehemiah</hi> 2.10, 19, 20.) <hi>Praiſe ye the Lord for the avenging of Iſrael, when the People, willingly offered themſelves; my Heart is towards the Governors of Iſrael, that offered themſelves willingly among the People, bleſs ye the Lord! When Sanballet the Horonite, and Tobiah, the Servant, the Ammonite, heard of it, it griev'd them exceedingly, that there was come a Man to ſeek the Welfare of the Children of Iſrael: Then ſaid I unto them, Ye ſee the Diſtreſs that we are in, how Jeruſalem lyeth
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:007799_0029_102D8D17C3BAB258"/>
waſte, come and let us build up the Wall, that we be no more a Reproach; but they laught us to Scorn, and deſpiſed us; then anſwered I them, and ſaid, the God of Heaven he will proſper us, therefore we his Servants will ariſe and build, but you have no Portion, nor right, nor Memorial in Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sirs,</hi> It is exceeding agreeable to devout Minds, and God ſhou'd be acknowledged for it, when not only Perſons of a lower Order, but thoſe of the higheſt, are VOLUNTEERS in the Cauſe of their God and their Country, and appear in Arms in Defence thereof, altho' they might plead Excuſe becauſe of their Dignity; <hi>My Heart is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Governors of Iſrael, that offer'd themſelves willingly among the People;</hi> As if the gallant inſpir'd Heroine <hi>Deborah</hi> had ſaid, I high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſteem and heartily love thoſe brave <hi>Patriots,</hi> who do not inſiſt upon the little Punctillio's of their Honour, when all their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and civil Privileges are at Stake; no, great Souls, in ſuch important Conjunctures, treat ſuch Trifles with a noble Negligence; ſurely thoſe Eagles will not meanly drop their ſublime Flight, to catch Flies, nor fooliſhly loſe the Subſtance by graſping at a Shadow!</p>
            <p>I would therefore entreat you, <hi>my Brethren,</hi> to encourage theſe <hi>military Companies,</hi> by joining in them, and punctually attending the Times of their Exerciſes, as well as by bleſſing God for them, and imploring his Bleſſing upon them!</p>
            <p>But I return to offer a brief Addreſs to the <hi>military Gentlemen</hi> of this City, and others; <hi>Sirs,</hi> If it ſhould pleaſe Providence to call you to any Engagement againſt our Enemies, with Deſign either to aſſiſt or pretect your diſtreſſed <hi>Brethren,</hi> or avenge the Affronts of your <hi>Sovereign,</hi> and your <hi>Country's</hi> Wrongs; I hope you are determin'd by divine Help to undertake the important Enterprize with Readineſs, and to proſecute it with Reſolution, Bravery and Firmneſs; <hi>for happy ſhall he be, that rewardeth them as they have ſerved us.</hi> The <hi>Cauſe</hi> is juſt and important, if any Thing is or can be ſo, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Defence</hi> of our Country, and all the <hi>Religious and Civil</hi> Privileges which that endearing Word contains!
