            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>JULIA.</head>
            <p>IF thou art a Curate, O Reader, and haſt already <hi>one</hi> pariſh in thy poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, be contented, and ſeek not to have <hi>two.</hi> Be aſſured that contentment is better than to have <hi>two livings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many good people beſides Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare have been born upon the Avon; and one of them was the Curate of the Pariſh of Elmwood. Of a family of nine people, parents and children, only he and his daughter Julia remained.</p>
            <p>This old Parſon could do many things beſides eat his pudding, drink his Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber (both which he loved affectionately), and collect his tithes;—thoſe important qualifications which have been, from time immemorial, annexed to the office of a Country Curate. He carried the Sciences in his head, and the Arts in his heart—I mean, ſo far as they are connected with manners or ſentiment. Beſides all this he preached an excellent
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:035759_0003_10066822D0C93DC0"/>ſermon, wore his own gray hairs, and had the gout: but, above all, he loved, moſt dearly loved, his daughter Julia.</p>
            <p>And well did ſhe deſerve his love.— Sweet Maid! If ever I forget thee, may my fancy loſe her flights, and my pen its movements! If ever I forget the majeſtic elegance of thy form—or the liquid blue ſwimming in thy eye—or the half roſe, half lily colours glowing in thy cheek, like the ſtreaks of the weſt in a July evening—Oh! if I remember not the lovely confuſion o'er all thy fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, when I firſt beheld thee in the arms of thy Raviſher—may I ceaſe to dream of thee!—If I do not, Julia! mayſt thou never think of me!</p>
            <p>Such was the daughter of the Curate of Elmwood—a fair form, and a pure heart!—It was nouriſhed in the pure boſom of a father.</p>
            <p>Though the manſion of theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented relations roſe in the centre of the Pariſh, it was neither ſtately nor proud: like its inhabitants, it was modeſt, and ſeemed to retire into an obſcure and
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:035759_0004_100668247AAAF778"/>ſilent glade, formed between various clumps of ſhrubbery, and a ridge of riſing ground. At a ſmall diſtance roll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſilver Avon, ever muſical, now mantling over a rocky channel, and now gliding through green plains and fields covered with wild flowers.</p>
            <p>Through theſe fields, and along theſe ſkirted banks, full oft did the Curate and his daughter purſue their walk. In that ſweet hour of the evening, when the ſun ſeems dropping behind the hills, and throws a feeble but pleaſing beam o'er the landſcape, then might you ſee them walking arm in arm, and ſlowly, on the Avon ſide. "Julia, (he would ſay to his daughter) my dear Julia, you and my Pariſh are the comfort of my life. Ye all are my children—but you, Julia, you are my Friend. The thirſty loves not to drink, nor the weary to reſt, more than I love to look upon <hi>you.</hi> What would become of me, Julia, wert thou gone? and when I am gone, my daughter, what will become of thee?"—I hope, father, we ſhall die
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:035759_0005_100668272F84C798"/>both together,"—"God grant it! God grant it!" anſwered the old man.</p>
            <p>Thus peaceably glided on their lives, till an unlucky accident in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring pariſh diſturbed their tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity. The Vicar of that pariſh died. Now, the moment our Curate was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of this, it rouſed one of his worſt paſſions: he had now but one wiſh to be gratified in this world; and that was—to have the neighbouring vicarage in his poſſeſſion. "My dear father (ſaid the unambitious Julia), have we not competence? and does not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petence afford us happineſs? and is not this ſufficient?"—Ay, all that was very true: but then the vicarage lay ſo ſnug juſt at his own door; and he wanted to have it in his power to leave ſomething to his Julia after his death; and, now that he was ſo very old, and ſo very gouty, what a comfortable thing it would be to have a Curate under him, to perform ſervice when he was confined at home! The thing was evidently a ſnug thing, and would be very conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient:
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:035759_0006_10066829E0A62780"/>beſides, he knew the Patron of the living—he had been his ſchool fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low—as good a nobleman as ever was born—he was certain of ſucceſs—It was impoſſible that he could not ſucceed—he had ſet his heart upon the thing—and Julia, his child, could not oppoſe it.</p>
            <p>Here he was right. Julia would ſooner have expired at his feet. She yielded the point with a ſmile.</p>
            <p>But much remained yet to be done. The Curate had talked like a man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with calculations, and his fancy (old as it was) got the ſtart of his judgment. He did not conſider that Lord C—, the patron of the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, reſided at London, and that his own limbs were too gouty to carry him thither—for perſonal application is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary in theſe caſes: beſides, the Clergy, though they are continually adviſing their flocks to keep their eyes fixed upon the good things of Heaven only, have a ſtrange trick of keeping their own eyes conſtantly fixed upon the good things of this earth:
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:035759_0007_1006682B662AA910"/>every moment, therefore, was impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant; to loſe a minute was to loſe the Curacy; and while he was talking, ſome other reverend brother, who had no gout in his toes, no daughter to provide for, no want of an aſſiſtant Curate, might be poſting to his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in Berkely Square.</p>
            <p>The old man became now greatly agitated; and that boſom which ought to have been the manſion of reſignation and peace, was diſturbed by reſtleſs wiſhes and ill timed deſpair. The ſympathetic ſoul of Julia was rouſed; her heart throbbed with guiltleſs pangs, and ſhe felt for the griefs of her father. She tried to ſoothe him, but tried in vain: ſhe argued againſt his wiſhes, but ſhe was arguing againſt the follies of old age, which are incurable. The Curacy was loſt, and he was reſolved to bewail it.</p>
            <p>The evening came, but came not as uſual; this man of deſpair was uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of its charms. His ſoul was deaf to the voice of Nature, even when her
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:035759_0008_1006682D29313638"/>notes were ſweeteſt—at the cloſe of the day. He liſtened not to the carols of the hinds, nor to the ruſtic muſic of the fields: the flocks cluſtered in the mead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ows unnoticed; and the ſun poured his evening glories over the landſcape un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarded. Even Julia did not charm him: he ſaw her kneel at his ſide with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out emotion, and he heard her ſighs in ſilence.</p>
            <p>Here a father and a friend was loſt to happineſs—the only friend too ſhe had in the world—and ſorrows much leſs than theſe would have murdered the peace of Julia. She had already knelt by the ſide of her father: ſhe now claſped his hand cloſely in her own, and fixing her blue eyes pathetically on his countenance, begged that he would not refuſe her one requeſt— "What was that?"—To permit <hi>her</hi> to go to London, in queſt of the Curacy.</p>
            <p>Electricity could not touch him quicker. The voice of Julia was pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetic, and it awakened him. His af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections returned in an inſtant: he lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:035759_0009_1006682FDDB485D0"/>over his daughter, and gave her to underſtand that it was impoſſible to grant her requeſt; that he would not part with her for a Biſhopric; and that ſhe muſt not think to part with him. She replied; he anſwered; and ſhe re-anſwered: in ſhort, the conteſt was long, ſtubborn and eloquent; and though there was not much learning in it, it abounded with nature, a richer quality. Suffice it to ſay that Julia con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered; and ſhe obtained with great difficulty what ſhe called the honourable office of being her father's meſſenger.</p>
            <p>It has been obſerved already that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch is one of the few roads to prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. As no time was therefore to be loſt, it was agreed upon that ſhe ſhould ſet off the next morning. The War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick ſtage paſſed through the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring market town, and ſhe might walk thither to meet it. The old man retired to get ready his letters, and Julia to make her little preparations for her journey.</p>
            <p>How they ſlept, themſelves know
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:035759_0010_100668328F7A3050"/>beſt; but when the morning came, the Curate's opinions were entirely changed. "He had thought better upon the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and he was reſolved not to let her go. The roads were dangerous, and London was ſtill more ſo—beſides, ſhe might turn ſick—or the coach might be overturned—ſhe might be killed—and he would never ſee her more." Julia knew that theſe fears were only the tender works of timid nature, and ſhe oppoſed them. In ſhort, the conteſt was renewed with its former warmth; and the affection of the daughter tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed once more over the tenderneſs of the Father. He conſented again to let her go, on condition that <hi>Joe</hi> (his labourer, his gardener, his footman, his hoſtler, his every thing) ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend her with his friendly care—ſhould be the companion of her journey.</p>
            <p>Now this <hi>Joe</hi> was the awkwardeſt mortal—Never, ſure, did a more ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſquire page it at the heels of a fair lady. Neither the Sancho of Don Quixote, nor the Pedrillo of Roſalva,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:035759_0011_100668341290E248"/>were more arrant children of Nature— were guided by more native ſimplicity. He and his occupation ſeemed made for each other, ſo exactly were they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively fitted. He was never fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous but for two things; viz. for whiſtling, after his team, the loudeſt and moſt muſical notes of any in the whole village—and for knitting ſtock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: this was all the reputation he had in the world; and he was now going to ſet out for London (where he had never been) in high expectation of ſeeing fine things and fine folks, but without any idea of receiving treatment different from what he met with in the pariſh of Elmwood.</p>
            <p>Now, reader, ſtop a moment, and bethink thee of this plan and of this journey; and then confeſs that they were highly worthy of the politic heads which gave them birth. A village vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, attended by a village boor—both equally accuſtomed to travelling, and the buſtle of an Engliſh turnpike road— both equally ſkilled in the knowledge
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:035759_0012_10066835969CE8F0"/>of men and of their characters—are ſetting our for London—for <hi>London,</hi> I ſay—in queſt of a Curacy! The thing was worthy of a Village Curate. The deſcent of Eneas into Hell was, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of this, walking upon carpets.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Facilis deſcenſus Averni,</l>
               <l>Sed revocare gradum—</l>
            </q>
            <p>Our travellers were now ready to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin their walk to the market town, which was but four miles diſtant. Without palfrey, armour, or other ret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inue than the children of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood (who regarded Julia as the good and fair Genius of the village) the cavalcade ſet out. Julia and her father led the van, and the reſt followed. Joe, as if conſcious that he was entering upon a ſervice of danger, aſſumed a ſtatelier port and a more auguſt viſage; and, with a clean ſhirt in his left pocket, much good bacon and cheeſe in his right, and a luſty ſapling in his hand, he towered majeſtic forward in the midſt of the children, with ſtern aſpect and long ſtrides.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:035759_0013_100668371FB4DA10"/>
The company had now walked a mile, and were to part. On this trying occaſion I could ſay much, but will not. To deſcribe the glances of affection and the looks of love which gliſtened in every eye, which played in every fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, would be extremely tedious to many of my gentle readers: I ſhall therefore content myſelf with informing them, that in this difficult ſcene the ſimple heart of the Curate failed him; his eyes confeſſed it, and he played the woman. The ender Julia caught the ſoft contagion; and from her it paſſed to the little villagers who compoſed her train. Joe, who now ſaw what was paſſing all around him, was not willing to be ſingular: his eye forgot its haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs for a moment, and he mixed his plaintive notes in the concert of woe.— Thus they are all crying together.</p>
            <p>But theſe lamentations were ſoon over. The Curate, taking his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by the hand, ſhowered bleſſings and advices upon her in great plenty; told her to be cautious, prudent and expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious;
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:035759_0014_1006683B0615FBC0"/>that while ſhe took care of her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſhe was ſerving him; and then again wiſhing her ten thouſand bleſſings, bade his child adieu. The Curate marched ſlowly back at the head of his young flock, and our two travellers ſes forward to the market town with a haſty pace and high expectations.</p>
            <p>Having now begun a journey, we muſt be expeditious. They arrived at the market town, met the ſtage coach, and took their reſpective ſtations—Julia in the inſide, and Joe, like her guardian angel, perched above her upon the top. Now why ſhould I loiter to rehearſe the trivial adventures of a ſtage-coach journey—how, always as town roſe to view after town, hill after hill, and county after county, the ſpirits of Joe roſe in proportion, and ſtill he whiſtled on both loud and long, like the lark at day break; or how, though all the ſilly people in the coach ſtared continually at Julia, the timid Julia durſt not ſtare at them? or why ſhould I relate the idle ſmall talk, the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:035759_0015_1006683C8B15AD50"/>regard, and the uncourteous gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry, with which ſhe was entertained by a fooliſh officer of the guards (thoſe coxcomb troops), who is well known to be a fop in the Drawing room and a fribble on the Parade? Otherwiſe they went ſmoothly on, till they arrived at the Lane which is three miles on the weſt ſide of Uxbridge; when a very civil gentleman came to the window, and deſired them to give him all the money they had. The gentleman at the window was far from being unpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite, conſidering he had declared war againſt Society. He beſpoke them very gently, beginning at the right hand, and following them all, man by man, and woman by woman, till he went round to the left ſide. The officer was unhappily firſt, and he gave his purſe with a ſullen ſilence. Julia was next, and held her little money in her hand, but durſt not look towards the window. A meagre cockney gave all, but begged a few ſhillings back to carry him to St. Paul's. A little fat woman
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:035759_0016_1006683E0FE0E930"/>ſurrendered her purſe with a threat; and a plain dreſſed man regretted he had not more for ſo civil a gentleman.</p>
            <p>When they arrived at the inn at the next ſtage, each one expreſſed his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows as his feelings prompted: but they were now to enter upon their laſt ſtage, and none had ſuch weighty cauſe to be aggrieved as Julia, who had not a friend before her. To go forward was madneſs, and to go back was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. What was ſhe to do?—She called in Joe, and aſked if he had provided himſelf with any money, in caſe of an emergency.—"Yes, that he had—and there it was at her ſervice,"—throwing down his entire flock upon the table, which in the whole amounted to the ſum of three ſhillings and nine pence. This made deſpair more black. It was her firſt misfortune; and ſhe thought it but a rough entrance into the world, for one who never deſerved it.</p>
            <p>The officer now entered the room; and ſeeing Joe there, began to upbraid him for ſuffering the highway man to eſcape,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:035759_0017_10066840B8C23A48"/>when he was ſeated ſo advantageouſly at the top, with an oaken ſapling in his hand—"You ſtupid oaf! (ſaid this military hero) why did you not attack him?"—"'Caſe I had not a ſword by my ſide, like you (replied Joe, with the greateſt frankneſs)—he—he—he! icod every man to his traid, meaſter!"—Theſe arguments were unanſwerable.</p>
            <p>The officer now walked up to Julia, whoſe embarraſſment he perceived; and taking her aſide, told her he gueſſed the cauſe of her ſorrow, and that he was happy he had it in his power to remove it: "for (continued he) I know the road too well to venture my all upon it, and to leave myſelf unprovided with reſouces. Here (ſays he, untying his ſtock, and ſhaking out of it a ſlender green purſe) here is my <hi>corps de reſerve:</hi> I gave the robber a few ſhillings, and I ſecured this for your uſe." Now Julia examined the face of this affair ſimply as it ſtood. It was a caſe of neceſſity; and ſhe thought it ridiculous for one who was many, many miles from Elm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:035759_0018_10066842411FA4B8"/>and who had not two pence in her pocket, to refuſe the loan of a few guineas, which would remove all her ſorrows. She might probably have an opportunity of hinting the matter to Lord C—when ſhe ſaw him, who would no doubt advance the money upon the Curacy and thus all would be right again. She therefore thanked him politely, and told him that when ſhe ſaw her noble friend Lord C—, ſhe hoped to be able to repay him. "Lord C—! (ſays he)—what—you are going to viſit him?"—Yes, Sir.—"O—a relation I preſume, Madam?" No, Sir—only a friend: his Lordſhip and my father were great friends when they were young, and at ſchool—"Ay, ay—your father, I preſume, Madam, lives in the country?"—Yes, Sir; he's Curate of Elmwood, near —in Warwickſhire. "Your viſit, Ma'am—is it a viſit of pleaſure or buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?"—Buſineſs, Sir: I am only come to town with a letter from my father to Lord C—to ſolicit the Curacy of
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:035759_0019_10066844ED9A29F0"/>—.—" O I underſtand you, Ma'am. Lord C—is my particular acquaintance, and it will give me pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure to be your protector and your guide, till I deliver you ſafely and hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourably to his Lordſhip.—Would you chooſe to alight, Ma'am, at any particular place in London?"—No (ſaid the ſimple Julia) I intend to ſtay at the Inn all night, and to wait upon his Lordſhip in the morning.—" Ah! Madam (replied the officer), you do not know the confuſion, the diſguſt, and danger which you will meet with at the Inn: I have a mother in town, who lives elegantly: be prevailed upon to be lodged this night at her houſe. She will receive you with cheerfulneſs, and treat you with tenderneſs. May I periſh, Madam—may I beg the honour to know your name, Madam?"—Julia. —"May I periſh, Miſs Julia, but I am intereſted in your caſe as ſincerely as if you was my ſiſter!" This laſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal was better and better. To meet ſo good a friend at once!—She was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:035759_0020_1006684672B19D88"/>her father's prayers for her were heard; and ſhe thought ſhe could not be too thankful to Heaven—nor to the Gentleman. She accepted his officer; and they mounted the ſtage coach once more.</p>
            <p>As the ſtage coachman was at this place paid his full demands, there was nothing to be done but to roll into town, and go where they pleaſed. The fat woman lived in Holborn, and the coach ſtopt to ſet her down. "Here too, Madam (ſaid the officer to Julia), we may get out for we are near our home." The artful abruptneſs and hurry of the ſummons—the conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of finding herſelf ſuddently in the midſt of the immenſe metropolis, where ſhe already ſaw ſtrange things, and expected to ſee ſtill ſtranger—her total ignorance of every thing around her—her hopes—her expectations—her ſimplicity—all contributed to throw her mind into confuſion, her ſpirits into a flutter: ſhe forgot every thing—ſhe forgot even Joe—and Joe, alas! forgot
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:035759_0021_1006684932B6BE08"/>her; for he was exactly in the ſame predicamant. He was aſtoniſhed: he was in a new world: his recollection forſook him, and a miſt wandered over his eyes: he ſet nailed to the top of the coach, with his mouth open, looking at every thing, and ſeeing nothing. In this cloud Julia eſcaped; and ſhe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpoke nor looked around her, till her gallant commander led her into Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln's Inn Fields—Now when a young Gentleman, with a young Lady by his ſide, who is reſolved to follow him, finds himſelf in Lincoln's Inn Fields, the road to Covent Garden lies direct: 'tis only going up Queen ſtreet, croſſing the <hi>Lane</hi> and the <hi>Acre,</hi> and you're there. He conducted her into that well known houſe ſituate between the gate of the Theatre and the Piazza Coffee houſe. The polite inhabitants of this houſe received the young gentleman with all the freedom and civility of an old ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, which convinced Julia that he was <hi>quite at home.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, gentle reader, while Julia and
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:035759_0022_1006684BEE2AB1F0"/>her friend are ſeated at a bottle of Madeira, rocollect, and confeſs wheth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er we have not travelled to good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. From the banks of the Avon— from the manſion of innocence—from the warm boſom of a father—to place our Heroine on the very brink of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition at once!—by Pegaſus, it was rapidly done! Other authors, indeed, have, by degrees, from adventure to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, from ſcene to ſcene, carried their Heroines into very extreme dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; but we, fully reſolved to excel all that have ever gone before us, have ſeated her upon the pinnacle of ruin at once.—And now, ye guardian ſpirits (if ſuch ſpirits there be, as certain di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines have told us) whether ye be Sylphs, Genii, or Fairies—if ye have indeed any regard for innocence, and a virgin too—now open your golden eyes, and now ply your ſilver pinions—for inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence is in danger.—And now, thou wretched old man, thou ambitious Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate of Elmwood—rekindle your piety, and redouble your prayers—for your
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:035759_0023_1006684D731BE490"/>daughter, your Julia, <hi>is in a Bagnio</hi>— and without a fear!</p>
            <p>Every thing that paſſed around Julia in this houſe appeared too plauſible for her eyes to be opened, or her ſuſpicion to be rouſed—(for ſhe had never been in a Tavern before: and as to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſant tinkling of bells, and the inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant running of waiters—why, bells and ſervants muſt be in all great fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and no doubt, muſt be continually employed)—The deception, I ſay, was good, and every thing appeared ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely well, except one thing: it puzzled her to conceive why they ſhould be conducted into a <hi>bed chamber!</hi> But perhaps (ſhe thought) it was the faſhion in London, and what was that to her?</p>
            <p>Julia drank very ſparingly, but not ſo her companion; he was to attempt the gaining of a difficult poſt, and the coward wanted ſpirits. It is a tribute paid to virtue, that, though it be lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the poſſeſſion of but a frail and weak woman, its ſpoiler, before he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:035759_0024_1006684F308975F8"/>to ruin it, muſts call to his aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance foreign aid, acquire fictitious ſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its and debaſe himſelf into a brute. The ſecond bottle began to tune the ſpirits of our Hero: his veins ſwelled, his pulſe quickened, his eyes gliſtened, and his cheek glowed: he ſnatched the hand of Julia, fed upon it with fury, and devoured it with a tumult of unholy love: if indeed he loved Julia, it was with the love of a tyger.</p>
            <p>She ſtarted from his embraces, and retreated ſome paces from her chair. He followed, and renewed the attack, and Julia her reſiſtance: he grew ſtronger, he grew wilder, his hand was wandering over her charms (where hand never wandered before), and he became furious; Julia became faint—ſhe was yielding—her tender frame was exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſhe could now only ſhriek. A ſhriek was a new thing in theſe apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and it alarmed a gentleman in the adjoining room, who, with his coat off, a dirty boot on one leg, and his face glowing and beſmeared with ſweat,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:035759_0025_10066851ED107408"/>kicked open the door, and ruſhed vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently into the room, with all the zeal of a man who was to aſſiſt the diſtreſſed. The Officer let go his hold of Julia, and ſhe threw herſelf breathleſs upon a chair. The man in diſhabille ſtared at them both alternately, now at Julia, and now at the Officer, and at length broke ſilence:</p>
            <p>"What! force!—Why, thou dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and ſilly animal, what a dirty buſineſs is this you are engaged in— <hi>forcing</hi> a woman to your wiſhes!—To <hi>force</hi> a woman in any place is a mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that no man of honour will ſtoop to—but to force one <hi>here</hi> in <hi>this</hi> houſe— D-mn—n! you ſcoundrel! get out— walk off, or I'll kick you."</p>
            <p>We need not be ſurprized that the Officer was mean enough to take his advice. He looked at the man in diſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bille as if he had recollected ſomething, and left the room precipitately.</p>
            <p>"And now, my angel (ſaid the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman in the boot to Julia, taking her by the hand), let us drink a glaſs or two
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:035759_0026_1006685372872288"/>and I dare ſay <hi>we</hi> ſhall agree better."— Oh, Sir! (replied Julia, claſping her bands and falling on her knees before him)—have mercy on me!—pity me!—or you will kill me—"Pſhaw, my dear! I never kill <hi>quite</hi> upon theſe occaſions — you will but <hi>die</hi> at the moſt.—But, Child, you look d-mn'd ſerious upon this buſineſs—Is any thing the matter with you?"—Oh, Sir I (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered Julia, in the midſt of many tears) I don't know where I am, and I don't know where to go—I am juſt come to town in the Warwick ſtage.— "In the Warwick ſtage!—what thro' Uxbridge?'—Yes.—"And was that fellow one of the company?"—Yes. —"Whe—w!—And you met a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayman, didn't you?"—Yes.—"That was me, by G-d!" Here Julia ſhriek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, terrified at the ſound of the name; but he ſtopped her in good time: "You muſt not be afraid (ſaid he), for I won't hurt you. Tell me honeſtly, are you virtuous or not?—that is, are you a maid?"—Oh! <hi>upon</hi> my honour, Sir.—
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:035759_0027_100668562338A9A0"/>"How came you here, then, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with that fellow?"—When you took—when I loſt all my money, he advanced ſome for me; and as I had no friends in London, promiſed to take care of me, and bring me to his moth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's till tomorrow, when I could have finiſhed all my buſineſs.—"Then you are <hi>really</hi> honeſt?"—As I love Heaven and my Father, Sir, I am.—"Then thou art a lovely girl and 'tis pity ſo fine a woman <hi>ſhould 'be</hi> honeſt. But I believe you, and ſhall be your friend— ſhall guard you from harm—for, by G-d! I am a man of honour! and though misfortune and my evil ſpirit force me ſometimes to the highway, I ſcorn to do a mean thing, by G-d!— In the firſt place, as you loſt your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, you ſhall divide this purſe with me. In the next place, you are now in a houſe full of wh-res and ſcoundrels —I muſt leave it myſelf in a minute, in caſe that fellow ſhould have <hi>twigg'd</hi> me, and I fancy you had better leave it too. Truſt yourſelf with me, and I
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:035759_0028_10066857A6164268"/>ſhall take care of you till morning." Julia told him he could not ſerve her more agreeably than by carrying her to the Inn where the ſtage and Joe were. That, he ſaid, was more than he durſt do; but he would carry her to a place equally or more ſecure. So ſaying, he returned to his room, to throw off part of his <hi>road dreſs,</hi> and adjuſt the reſt.</p>
            <p>If the Reader has a fancy worth two pence, he will conceive how Julia's thoughts were employed in this interval, till they are interrupted by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the highwayman, who appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed now to be a handſome and genteel young fellow. He paid the reckoning, and they departed: it was now between nine and ten in the evening.</p>
            <p>They had not quitted the Piazza, when four of Sir John Fielding's men ruſhed forward, and ſeized the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayman with the moſt incredible activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. They ſwept him away, as the whirlwind ſweeps away the leaves in autumn, and whirls them, the Lord knows
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:035759_0029_1006685A8EE412A0"/>where. Julia ran rapidly away, nor caſt one look behind. She continued to go forward (as ſhe thought), till ſhe had run a great way; and then ſtopping for breath, ſhe was exactly on the ſpot from whence ſhe ſet out—ſhe had only run <hi>round</hi> the Garden, not ſuſpecting but ſhe was going forward in a ſtraight line. "Madam! Madam! (ſays an Iriſh chairman to her) do you want a chair?" I don't know what I want. My fait, but <hi>I</hi> do—you want to be carried to Mother H—'s, my jewel, which I and Connor yonder can do in five minutes."—My good friend, if you can carry me to any honeſt place, I ſhall bleſs you for ever.—" Honeſt <hi>plaſe!</hi>—Devil burn me, my honey, an if I know one honeſt <hi>plaſe</hi> in the whole town—Ha, ha, ha!—honeſt <hi>plaſe!</hi>—Ah, you cunning Devil you!—To be ſure you want to go to an honeſt <hi>plaſe!</hi>—Ha, ha, ha!—Here you, Mr. Watchman—this Lady wants to go to an honeſt <hi>plaſe</hi>—Can't you ſhew her the way?" "Aye, that I can (roplied the
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:035759_0030_1006685D4277B2D8"/>watchman)—Ah, Madam, it is you?—I know you of old—Come along, come along with me: you ſhall go to the honeſteſt place in all King George's dominions—the <hi>Round houſe.</hi>"—The watchman happened juſt at that time to want a pot of beer; but Julia not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding his meaning, to the Round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe he led her in triumph.—Ah, Julia, Julia, ah!</p>
            <p>She had been hitherto overwhelmed in a kind of inſenſibility: the ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and horror of the laſt adventure were too powerful for her; her faculties loſt their power, and her recollection was ſuſpended; ſhe was led by the watchman without ſeeing whither ſhe was going, and ſhe was dragged along without feeling that he held her by the arm. But ſhe had not been long ſeated at the top of the bench, where they placed her near the fire, before ſhe awakened from her ſtupor. She awakened, looked around, and ſaw herſelf ſeated in the midſt of a horrible aſſembly, whoſe viſages would
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:035759_0031_1006685EC7304D30"/>make Angels weep and Demons trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. High above the reſt, like the Evil Spirit in Pandemonium, ſat the Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Night, a beef headed knave, with a pipe in his mouth, and a tankard on a ſtool before him.—"Here (ſaid this man in office) you, ſnoring Dick, reach this here tankard to that there Lady, and then bring her before me for examination.—Oh, ſhe won't drink!—Well, well, that's all one—if ſhe does not drink ſhe'll pay; ſo bring her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward here."</p>
            <p>Julia now advanced: her cheeks were ſuffuſed with tears, her breath quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and her whole frame trembled.</p>
            <p>"Ay, ay (ſays the Conſtable), you may well ſhake when you look at me. — Hem! what account can you give of yourſelf, Miſs?—No, that's not it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: I'll begin with you, I think, Miſter Watchman—Where did you find this here Lady here, Snoring Dick?"</p>
            <p>"Found her! (replies Dick) why, pleaſe your Worſhip, I found her pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a gemmun's pockets."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:035759_0032_100668608DE7F3A8"/>
"Picking a gemmun's pockets!—Mercy on us!—O ho, Miſs, you may well ſhake when you look at me—Well, Dick, go on."</p>
            <p>"And ſo, Sir, as ſhe was a picking the gemmun's pockets, as I was a ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I comes cloſe behind her, and lays hold of her hand in the fact."</p>
            <p>"In the fact?"</p>
            <p>"In the fact."</p>
            <p>"Tranſportation, to be ſure.—Well, go on, Snoring Dick."</p>
            <p>"And ſo, Sir, as I catches her hand, ſhe turns about, ſtoops down for one of her pattens, and before you could ſay <hi>Pervey,</hi> hits me the naſtieſt blow in the ſkull I ever had in my life ſince the great riot—You pleaſe to feel, Miſter Conſtable. the hugeous lump it has raiſed on my ſkull."</p>
            <p>"Ay, God bleſs me! ſo it is—it's a thumper, i'faith!"</p>
            <p>"A thumper! It will ſtand damages. I never had ſuch a blow in my life—I warant ye it bleeds under my hair. It floundered me like a ſtock fiſh."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:035759_0033_1006686339A9F298"/>
"Ay, ſhe wanted to murder you."</p>
            <p>"Yes."</p>
            <p>"Oh; the horrid monſter!—Well, Madam, have you nothing to ſay for yourſelf?—Ah, you impudent—Dick, take off her patten, that we may carry it as a witneſs before Sir John in the morning."</p>
            <p>"Ay, that I will, Miſter Conſtable; the patten will ſpeak for itſelf, and a damn'd heavy patten it is."</p>
            <p>Dick ſtooped for it, but Julia <hi>wore no pattens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"Ah, the cunning Devil! (continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Dick) ſhe has thrown them away. I thought I heard her throw ſomething away as we came along.</p>
            <p>"Oh, let her alone! (ſaid the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable)—ſhe's a knowing one: but ſhe ſhall doll it in Bridewell to morrow, for all that.—Ay, you may well ſhake when you look at me, you bloody-minded— You may now return to your ſeat."</p>
            <p>As Julia was returning to her bench, ſhe trembled inceſſantly, but never ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:035759_0034_10066865EAAAAF08"/>a ſyllable.—" Oh, (ſays Dick) ſhe's dumb founded with the highouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her crime." "No, (replies a ſecond) ſhe's drunk." "Not ſo far gone neither (echoes a third) but a quartern of gin would recover her."</p>
            <p>"Ay, ay, (ſays the Conſtable) there's no doubt but ſhe'll drink; and it's her turn now to ſend out. Pleaſe, Madam, to give this gemmun money for a gallon of Trueman's beſt, and for half a gallon of hot, and for four papers of tobacco, and for a loaf, an for three pound of Cheſhire.—Here, Scout; walk over, Sirrah, to the Lady, and make her your Sunday's bow—Bring every thing of the beſt, and then we'll drink to the Lady's health, and to poor Snoring Dick's head; and old Uglyface in the corner yonder will ſing us the comical ſong about the Cat and the Taylor, and make his wry faces, and we'll be as happy as Princes."</p>
            <p>When this oration was finiſhed, Scout made his obeiſance to Julia.—She was juſt able to aſk him what he wanted?—
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:035759_0035_1006686770244B88"/>"Money, Madam."—How much muſt you have?—"Oh, you may let me have five or ſix ſhillings, and I'll make the beſt market I can, and return you the reſt faithfully, Madam, upon my honour!—And if that won't be enough, I'll return for more."</p>
            <p>Julia felt in her pocket for her purſe (which the highwayman had given her) but ſhe could not find it—it was gone:</p>
            <p>On ſeeing this, the Preſident bawled out immediately, that it was "a ſham!" and Julia proteſted in vain. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany around heard this with an arch ſmile; the watchmen ſhook their heads, and the Conſtable grew noiſy; which awakened an old gentleman who had hitherto ſtept very ſoundly in a corner. Eſtimating the thing as favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably as poſſible, he had not above half the appearance of a gentleman. The truth is, he was no other than the well known Mr. B— who once had three thouſand a year, though he has not now ſixty; but being a man of plain man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and a generous diſpoſition, is ſtill
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:035759_0036_10066868FA4C3D78"/>well received among his relations, and ſtrangers who know him. He had been lounging, as uſual, for eight or nine hours, in a Coffee houſe in the Garden, and then withdrew, as he frequently does, to the watch houſe, either to ſleep or drink. On this laſt account, he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded there with ſome degree of reſpect.</p>
            <p>He naturally inquired the cauſe of the noiſe; and the majority informed him, that it was "only a <hi>Madam</hi> there, who pretended ſhe had loſt her purſe." Julia now appealed to him in her turn; and, with that unaffected ſimplicity which ever clothes the words of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and truth, informed him, that a watchman had taken hold of her unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly in the ſtreet; that ſhe was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itive ſhe had her purſe at that time, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a gentleman had given it to her but two minutes before;</hi> that from that time ſhe had only walked thither with the watchman, and now ſhe miſſed her mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ey."</p>
            <p>"Which watchman was it?" ſaid the gentleman.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="unknown:035759_0037_1006686A9D6836A8"/>
"Me—" replied Snoring Dick boldly.</p>
            <p>"Was it <hi>you?</hi> (repeated Mr. B.—) Ah, Dick! you and I, you know, are old acquaintance, and it is long ſince I have known you to be a ſcoundrel.— Therefore, Sirrah, deliver the purſe."</p>
            <p>"Me! (anſwered Dick)—Have I the purſe?—I'll be d—mn'd if I have any purſe about me."</p>
            <p>"You hav'n't?"</p>
            <p>"No."</p>
            <p>"And you won't deliver?"</p>
            <p>"No—"</p>
            <p>"Why then, Mr. Conſtable, I charge you with—"</p>
            <p>"Except indeed (interrupts Dick eagerly) ſomething that I picked up on the ſtreet, as I was coming along with that there lady."</p>
            <p>"Ah, you old fox! (ſaid the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man) I thought I ſhould unkennel you. Where is this <hi>ſomething</hi> which you <hi>picked up from the ſtreet?"</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"Here it is—but it does not belong to her."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:035759_0038_1006686E76C66660"/>
"Pray, Madam (ſaid Mr. B—, addreſſing Julia) is this your purſe?"</p>
            <p>"If it has a gold taſſel at either end (anſwered Julia) it is mine, Sir, upon my honour."</p>
            <p>It had ſo, was delivered to her, and Mr. B—immediately retired back into his corner to ſleep.</p>
            <p>Julia now willingly paid all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands made upon her; and the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent obſerved to her, "that as to be ſure as how ſhe was a good natured lady, and civil, and all them there things, and had <hi>given a good account</hi> of herſelf, why, to be ſure, ſhe might now go about her buſineſs."</p>
            <p>Julia thanked him, but n. entioned, that ſhe did not know whither to go till morning. "Not know! (ſaid the Conſtable)—why there are five hundred beds round you, where you may ſleep for half a crown."—But ſhe was a ſtranger in town, and did not chooſe to venture into ſtrange houſes.</p>
            <p>"Lord, Ma'am, (obſerved Snoring Dick) for ſixpence I'll conduct you to a
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:035759_0039_10066870009AE458"/>
               <hi>bagnio</hi> where you will be as ſafe as if you was in a tower."—She ſtarted at hearing a <hi>eagnio</hi> mentioned.—"Why then, Ma'am, if ſo be as you are ſo ſhy and a'n't proud, hire me well, and I'll let you ſleep in my houſe.—There's no body there but my wife.—I'll ſeek but five ſhillings, and your purſe can well ſpare that."</p>
            <p>This propoſal did not require to be repeated. Julia took him at his word. Even though he took her purſe, as he was a poor man, ſhe thought ſhe might be ſafe in his houſe for a night. Beſides, ſhe was pleaſed with the thoughts of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in company with a woman once more. With Dick, therefore, ſhe went into one of the little ſtreets behind Long Acre, and followed him into a three pair of ſtairs room, humble enough, indeed, but where all was ſilence. Dick awakened his wife, told her the ſtory, whiſpered to her to look ſharp after her lodger, and left them.</p>
            <p>Julia chatted a little while with her landlady, and found her to be civil
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:035759_0040_10066871C8476A50"/>enough, for a watchman's wife. The firſt thing ſhe begged of her was to be favoured with pen, ink, and paper. She got theſe readily; the landlady re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to bed; and Julia wrote the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing letter:</p>
            <p>"Ah! my dear father, ſhall we ever meet again?—When ſhall we meet—?— Are you well?—Shall I ever ſee you? and ah! ſhall you ever ſee me?</p>
            <p>"I am now—alas! I do not know where I am—nor where I have been— nor where I ſhall be to morrow. I ſeem an outcaſt from ſociety: I have not met one friend ſince I left you: every one deceives me—every one inſults me: they have treated me cruelly—they have broken my heart. Even <hi>Joe</hi> has forſaken me: he has deſerted me, or he is loſt—or I know not what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of him.</p>
            <p>"Ah, my father! my dear father!— that Heaven which we both ſerve, let that Heaven bear witneſs, that <hi>one</hi> wiſh alone fills my whole ſoul—the wiſh to ſee you, once more, to talk with you,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:035759_0041_1006687488DEACF8"/>to gaze upon you, to ſit once more by your knee—I would ruſh into your boſom: I would wet it with my tears, but I would never forſake it—never, never!</p>
            <p>"They are not mankind who ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round me—I do not live among the human race: theſe are the habitations of the Furies. When ſhall I leave them? Shall I ever quit the dreary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion where I now write?—I tremble— Shall I never more ſee Elmwood?— Shall I never more fly into the boſom of my father!"</p>
            <p>"And oh! (continued Julia, in words half ſtifled with grief) if it be poſſible, as my father has told me, that dreams have any meaning and that the ſoul is moſt ſuſceptible of theſe viſionary im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions when it is moſt o'ercharged with woe—moſt ſurely this night I ſhall converſe with my father." She ſealed theſe hopes with a ſhower of tears.</p>
            <p>Now, gentle reader, if it has been at any time your fate, (as it has been mine,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:035759_0042_10066877374F6898"/>and as it is at this moment many a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler fellow's) to be ſitting in that lofty habitation called a garret, plunged in deep diſtreſs—no two pence in your purſe, no mirth in your heart, and no beef in your belly—when, throwing your eyes around the rayleſs walls, you are conſcious that ſighs and tears are the only commodities in plenty about you—if this has been your caſe, you muſt well know the comfort that ariſes from ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding your ſorrows in ſecret—the relief that flows from a ſhower of ſolitary tears. In ſuch a ſituation, next to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantaneous and abſolute relief, it is the firſt of bleſſings, and Julia now felt it in all its force. Her heart was eaſed, and ſhe hoped for a night of reſt and for better days. Having then ſealed up her letter, ſhe retired to a bed ſo humble that it kiſſed the very ground.</p>
            <p>Watching and grief had given her too good an appetite for ſleep not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy it. Whether or not ſhe dreamed, I cannot really inform my reader, becauſe ſhe never informed myſelf of this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance.
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:035759_0043_10066878C099BB78"/>This I know, that ſhe ſlept nine hours inceſſantly, and, when ſhe awoke, found her head reſting upon the partition wall which roſe at the back of her bed. It conſiſted only of a ſingle file of boards, and was full of crevices. Her ear lay upon one of them, and it conveyed to her the moſt doleful accents that ever ſtruggled from the human breaſt. She ſtarted, and applied her eye to the crevice, but every thing was ſolitary: ſhe ſaw no one. The voice ceaſed. It ceaſed only for a moment. Again it murmurs, weeps, laments, ſobs, and again it ceaſes. Her ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetic ſoul followed it through all its va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riations; and, led by a ſoft humanity, ſhe mourned with the mourner through every change of his woe. She applied her eye a ſecond time, but could ſee nothing. A moment after, the voice was renewed. It was now more queru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, then more plaintive, and at length died away upon her ear, as if it had expired for want of ſtrength. She heard it no more.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="unknown:035759_0044_1006687A43879C38"/>
For the preſent, Julia ſuppreſſed her feelings, and aroſe. Snoring Dick had retired for an hour, to ſleep away the fatigues of the night and of the beer-pot. His wife was at breakfaſt, (tea) and invited Julia to partake. She con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented willingly; and the woman, who had but one diſh, politely offered it to her gueſt, and took for her own uſe a pint pot from which her huſband had been drinking beer.</p>
            <p>This repaſt over, Dick awakened; and Julia, who was during breakfaſt-time deviſing what meaſures to follow, propoſed at firſt to engage him to go along with her to the inn where Joe and the ſtage coach were; but on recollect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the dangers ſhe had already experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced in the ſtreets, ſhe reſolved not to venture upon it again, without a better guide than her friend the watchman. She therefore judged it more prudent to hire him to go to the inn, and to bring Joe along with him to the place where ſhe was. Dick readily aſſented to this propoſal, for the hire of a half
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:035759_0045_1006687CF3379E38"/>crown; which, he ſtipulated, ſhould be paid him before he ſet off, as well as the crown for the bed. All this he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieved on the ſpot, with the letter for her father to be put into the Poſt Office. He now departed, aſſuring her, that though ſhe had not the name of the inn to give him, he could diſcover it.</p>
            <p>This buſineſs happily adjuſted, the groans in the adjoining apartment roſe upon Julia's mind. She had purpoſely delayed her inquiries till Dick's depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whom ſhe knew to be unbleſſed with humanity. His wife, by a ſofter temper and a more complacent behav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iour, had recommended herſelf better to the obſervation of Julia, and ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved her ſympathies for her ear. Aſſuming, therefore, that eager and ſerious aſpect which the face wears when we are in earneſt, ſhe inquired who were the inhabitants of the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manſion? "An old man, (anſwered the woman) who I fancy is ſometimes in diſtreſs; but we have too many wants of our own to mind any others."—In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:035759_0046_1006687FA41B60B0"/>as the woman was when ſhe ſaid this, Julia felt herſelf intereſted, and conceived much more than was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. Seeing her hoſteſs not very fond of ſocial woe, ſhe ſuppreſſed her emotions, and in a ſhort time after ſtole out into the ſtair caſe. The door of the man in diſtreſs was exactly oppoſite to the watchman's, and ſhe gently knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at it. There was no anſwer. She knocked more loudly, but all was ſilence.—"Alas! (ſaid ſhe to herſelf) if your grief is paſt utterance, I muſt enter without leave." She raiſed the latch, and entered.—It was a piteous ſight, and worthy of the tears of thoſe bright eyes which now ſhed them ſo plentifully. Imagine in your own mind, this lovely girl bending over a bed, which contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it, ſtretched along under a tattered rug, a man upon whoſe features Heaven ſeemed to have poured its bittereſt pangs. He was alive, but had ceaſed to groan becauſe he could groan no longer. In his arms were two chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. His left was circled round one
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:035759_0047_1006688128AECB80"/>who was aſleep,—his right round one who was—dead. He gazed upon Julia without any emotion, and made not an effort to move even his head. He looked as if he was RESIGNATION. That great Poet who ſuffered no ſcene of the ſoul and no ſituation of nature to eſcape him, has almoſt deſcribed him. He ſeemed.</p>
            <q>
               <l>—to pine in thought,</l>
               <l>And, with a green and yellow melancholy,</l>
               <l>He lay like Patience on a monument,</l>
               <l>Smiling at Grief.</l>
               <bibl>SHAKESPEARE.</bibl>
            </q>
            <p>Here was that feaſt of exquiſite grief, that luxury of ſenſibility, which is fit only for thoſe exalted ſouls who move in the higher departments of humanity—It was fit for Julia.</p>
            <p>At length Julia ſpoke. "Poor—poor man! what can relieve you?"—He ſhook his head—<hi>Nothing.</hi> Here Julia's ſympathy once more broke looſe: her tears poured down inceſſantly. Tears are infectious. Two or three trick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led down from the poor man's eye. "May
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:035759_0048_10066882AD22FA38"/>God bleſs you! (ſaid he) you have ſhed the firſt tears that have been ſhed for me theſe ten years. The fountain of my ſorrows is almoſt exhauſted, but I have ſtill a drop to mix with your's." "Poor—poor man! (returned Julia) what ſhall I do to ſerve you?"—" O nothing! (he replied) nothing!—One of my children is dead, and the other will be ſo in half an hour—I am waiting for its death, and I ſhall then follow it."—"Alas! (ſaid Julia ſitting upon the bedſide) would not you have it live? Is it impoſſible to recover it?" He anſwered, "I hope it is." She then attempted to take hold of if; but he preſſed it cloſer to his ſide, and would not let it go. "I pity you, (ſaid Julia) and wiſh to relieve you: you and your child may ſtill live. Suffer me to be your friend." At this he only ſhook his head, and attempted to ſmile, as if to tell her it was impoſſible. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, not to be guided longer by a man who was in deſpair, ſhe was reſolved to adminiſter to the woes of the wretched. Sue left the room, and returned to the
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:035759_0049_100668843A813BE0"/>watchman's wife. She ſlightly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to her where ſhe had been, told her there was great diſtreſs, and begged of her to go out for a little wine, to be warmed for the uſe of the ſick. The woman (who was not deſtitute of much good nature, though it was ſtrongly ſeaſoned with that vice ſo peculiar to good natured people, indifference) read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily obeyed. The wine which ſhe brought was warmed, and carried in by Julia herfelf to the ſolitary father. She inſiſted that her landlady ſhould not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company her; from an opinion, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, that this ſcene of ſorrows was too ſacred for the profane eye of the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar.</p>
            <p>The man of deſpair, (naturally enough, in his ſituation) refuſed relief; but Julia inſiſted on the thing, and ſhe had ſhed too many tears to be refuſed. He deſired, however, that ſince they <hi>muſt</hi> be relieved, the child ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved firſt. "As for you (ſaid he, withdrawing his arm from the child, which Julia was taking hold of, and
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:035759_0050_100668882B859618"/>turning to the one that was dead) as to you, my dear and lamented girl—my laſt and my beſt beloved—you have cloſed your eye upon me, and you are ſmiling at life in the boſom of your mother. You were weary of hearing your father's groans. You fled to invite him to follow." He now kiſſed it, gazed upon it, hugged it, and wept upon it; and then dried the tears off its face, as if it could be conſcious of the favour.</p>
            <p>In the mean time Julia was very buſy about <hi>her</hi> child, but her aſſiduities were almoſt baffled. The child had opened its eyes, but it refuſed to open its mouth. In ſhort, ſhe was obliged to call to her aſſiſtance her hoſteſs, who readily came, and between them they poured down ſome warm wine mixed with water in its throat. Still it was inſenſible; and at length it was thought prudent to carry it to the next room, to be nurſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fire; which the hoſteſs did.</p>
            <p>Julia now adminiſtered to the father, and he was revived. The balmy ſtrength of the wine recalled his expir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:035759_0051_10066889B0385088"/>ſpirits, and warmed a heart which was almoſt cold. The firſt uſe he made of his new acquired ſtrength was to thank his benefactreſs, and to enquire for his child. Being informed where it was, he ſeemed to be ſatisfied. Julia ſoon after prepared for him a bit of bread, thin and toaſted, which he ate with ſome difficulty. This, however, paved the way for his recovery; and in about two hours he was tolerably eaſy and ſtrong. The child in the oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er room made a ſlower progreſs back to life, but they did not deſpair.</p>
            <p>This child (a boy) having been put to bed again, the watchman's wife reſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her uſual occupations; while Julia, whoſe gentle faculties were ſtill attuned to ſoftneſs and diſtreſs, waited upon the father, and preſſed him warmly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal the origin and progreſs of his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes. He ſhook his head at this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt; and told her it would be a hard taſk; beſides that, ſhe had already ſhed tears enough that day upon his account. However, he complied: and Julia,
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:035759_0052_1006688B57F91D90"/>ſitting upon his bed ſide, her cheek leaning upon her left hand, liſtened to a tale of deep and deſperate diſtreſs. "Behold before you (ſaid he,) ſtarved with hunger and covered with rags, a man who has long fought for his King, and ſpilt for him his deareſt blood— whoſe body is covered with wounds, in defence of that country which now leaves him as you ſee him! Such is the balm they have applied to my wounds!" —Though his notes were querulous, they were eloquent. But truth is always eloquent.—At preſent I am neither in leiſure nor in the humour to repeat them; and perhaps I never ſhall.</p>
            <p>When he finiſhed his melancholy tale, he caught hold of the hand of Julia, and preſſed it to his boſom.—"This boſom was once warm (ſaid he): but though it is cold, you are welcome in it. I cannot thank you; but my boy will live and do it, when I am crumbling in that grave from which you have drawn me for a moment." Julia, with that true politeneſs which is natural to virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:035759_0053_1006688CE5CB6E28"/>minds, begged him to accept ſome money for his preſent neceſſities, and promiſed to viſit him till it could be no longer in her power</p>
            <p>It was now rather more than dinner time, but neither Dick nor Joe appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Julia was growing uneaſy. Four o'clock ſtruck, out brought no comfort with it. It was five—but nobody ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived —Six—ſeven—eight—nobody! During theſe intervals ſhe had paid fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent 02 viſits to the man in diſtreſs, and applied every lenitive ſhe could invent to his affliction; and ſhe charged her hoſteſs with great ſincerity, at whatever time ſhe went away, to be attentive to his neceſſities 'till her return, which would be hoth certain and quick. So he was for the preſent pretty well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for.</p>
            <p>I have ſaid it was now eight o'clock, and nobody appeared. She became very, very uneaſy. It was now half paſt eight. "Still nobody!—Good Heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en! are my misfortunes never to end?" —it ſeems <hi>not,</hi> Julia: for about a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:035759_0054_10066890DC783D10"/>before nine two of Sir John Fielding's men entered with Dick—drunk, very drunk—at their head.</p>
            <p>Ah! it is as I always thought it— This dirty world has but few good per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in it, and theſe few it is continually harraſſing and peſtering with its evils— nor does it often ceaſe till it breaks their hearts. Shame on it, that an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent beautiful Curate's daughter, who never prayed for the good things of this world, nor for the evil upon its inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, ſhould not be ſuffered to <hi>go upon an errand</hi> for her father without moleſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and misfortunes! I repeat it— Shame upon ſo dirty a world!</p>
            <p>Now, gentle reader, whatever your thoughts upon this affair may be, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is that Sir John Fielding's men are come in queſt of Julia; and (as one of our great Poets ſays in one of his <hi>Tragedies,</hi> which, however, he ſtyles a <hi>Comedy</hi>) I'll lay you plums to pippins that you cannot conjecture their buſineſs with her.</p>
            <p>To underſtand it, then, your men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:035759_0055_10066892610B8C88"/>muſt recur to the adventures of Julia with the highwayman. He had met her in the bagnio, and given her a purſe with money in it, and in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture together from thence the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayman was apprehended. Julia fled, and was afterwards by chance conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the round houſe—as we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore related at large. Now the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayman was apprehended upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the courageous Officer of the Guards, of whoſe heroic and military virtues we have already ſpoken ſo loudly. Juſt when this coxcomb arrived at the office, the fat woman of Holborn had alighted there upon the ſame buſineſs. When the highwayman therefore was apprehended, the firſt buſineſs thought neceſſary was to ſearch him, and all the different purſes of the company were found upon him, except that of the fat woman. It was agreed that he could not have ſpent it in ſo ſhort a time: <hi>ergo,</hi> he muſt have given it away. To cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborate the ſuſpicion, the men recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected that a woman was along with
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:035759_0056_1006689429BAF3F0"/>him when he was apprehended, and the coxcomb Officer confirmed it. The caſe was therefore plain: Julia muſt have the purſe in her poſſeſſion. Away they ſally, with the Officer at their head, through ſtreets, bagnios, taverns, and night houſes: but in vain: ſhe was no where to be found. The next night, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween eight and nine, one of them met Dick the watchman. (Dick was at this time returning home to Julia without any anſwer or information; for inſtead of going on her errand, he went to get drunk with her money.) The thief taker inquired of him by chance, as the adventure happened within his cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit, if he had ſeen ſuch a lady—after deſcribing her very minutely. "Seen her (ſays Dick)! why, ſhe is at my houſe." This information was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for the ſervant of Juſtice: he took Dick by the arm, and ſummoning one of his companions, ſet off for the lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Julia.</p>
            <p>We have already ſeen them introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed where ſhe was. They ſeized her
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:035759_0057_10066895B75FA8C0"/>without ceremony, and proceeded, as uſual to ſearch her. The fatal purſe, ſo remarkable for the golden taſſel at either end, was in a moment found.—This confirmed the ſuſpicion, and ſhe was carried away as an accomplice.—When will perſecution ceaſe to follow Virtue?</p>
            <p>Sir John was not that night at home, and they informed her that ſhe muſt be impriſoned till morning. <hi>Impriſoned!</hi> She ſhrieked at the very ſound—"Pſhaw! (ſaid one of them, ſeeing her confuſion) you need not be terrified, I aſſure you, Ma'am: we are not going to a common priſon. I have a pretty, little, ſnug houſe, and as cloſe as a cage, where you may ſleep as ſafely and ſoundly as in your own bed chamber. No difference in the world, I aſſure you, Ma'am—only that every door and win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow in the houſe is incloſed with ſtrong and triple iron bars. That's all, I aſſure you, Ma'am: and notwithſtanding all theſe advantages, it will coſt you only a <hi>guinea</hi> for your bed—not a farthing
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:035759_0058_100668988768A6F8"/>more, I aſſure you, Ma'am. I keeps the beſt uſage, the beſt <hi>tendance,</hi> and the beſt wines in the garden, I aſſure you, Ma'am!—Lord, Ma'am then, what do you pout at? no cauſe to be terrified, I aſſure you, Ma'am!"</p>
            <p>Eloquent as this language was, and comfortable, it did not greatly gladden the heart of Julia. But there was no choice in the caſe, and ſhe followed her guides. Arrived, they led her into an upper apartment, where there was a fire, and good furniture. She was left alone for ten minutes; at the end of which the landlord waited upon her, and aſked what ſhe choſe for ſupper. "Noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing"—What did ſhe chooſe to drink, then? "nothing." (Oho, replied he) an' if ſo be that you are ſo ruſty, good night to you with all my heart." He then turned upon his heels; and pulling the door after him with fury, locked it with a key which grated as it turned, amidſt the rattling of chains and the clanking of iron bars.</p>
            <p>Dreadful ſounds to ſuch an ear as
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:035759_0059_1006689B4352A1B8"/>Julia's! Her teeth gritted, and her joints trembled. This was the ſevereſt ſtroke of all. To be impriſoned! and as an accomplice of a highwayman too! "But ſhe ſubmitted to Heaven, where all her wiſhes reſted: her hopes leaned upon that, and upon the prayers of her father."</p>
            <p>She retired to bed, but could not ſleep; her misfortunes ſtill interrupted, and occupied her whole ſoul. She tried again, but in vain: and to this purpoſe ſhe recollected the lines of her favourite Young. Sleep, ſays he,</p>
            <q>
               <l>— Like the world, his ready viſit pays</l>
               <l>Where fortune ſmiles: the wretched he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſakes;</l>
               <l>Swift on his downy pinions flies from woe,</l>
               <l>And lights on lids unſullied with a tear.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Her mind recurred to the ſcenes that were paſt, and reluctantly brooded over the gloomy aſſemblage. And in truth, when we reflect upon it, her caſe was rather hard. It was now only the third night ſince ſhe had quitted the peaceful manſion houſe of Elmwood, and the
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:035759_0060_1006689D0FB68D70"/>arms of her father.—The firſt night ſhe was ſomewhere upon the road; the ſecond ſhe was in a bagnio, and in a round houſe, and in a garret; and the third ſhe was in priſon. Each of theſe misfortunes was a mountain upon her mind, under which it ſtruggled; but by the ſtruggle it only became more feeble.</p>
            <p>At length the ſoul by its powerful and violent workings, overcame the body. Wearied with affliction, her ſpirits languiſhed, and nature ſunk into ſlumber. Sleep of this kind, though not always the moſt placid, is the heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſt. She ſlept till eight in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when ſhe aroſe. At nine they paid her a viſit, and ſhe ate ſome breakfaſt; and at ten ſhe was carried, with a beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heart, in a coach to Bow ſtreet.</p>
            <p>Here ſhe did not wait long for the appearance of the Juſtice, for every thing was prepared; even the unhappy highwayman was in waiting, as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the examination. Indeed, it was thought moſt proper to begin with queſtioning him apart upon the ſubject,
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:035759_0061_1006689E927A7BE8"/>and then with examining Julia; and by the compariſon of their reſpective evidences the truth might be eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</p>
            <p>When the highwayman had been examined upon his own account, an obſtinacy natural to men in his deſperate ſituation prevented him from giving any account of the purſe which was miſſing. But now, when he was informed that Julia was really in cuſtody, that honour which was not yet entirely extinguiſhed in his heart, was rouſed for her ſafety. He ingenuouſly told Sir John the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the purſe, with even its moſt minute circumſtances; that he had robbed her amongſt the reſt! that he afterwards met her accidentally in the bagnio, and gave her the money only with a view of reſtoring her own; that he had not been above ten minutes in her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and that ſhe was in every reſpect innocent of the crime with which ſhe was charged.</p>
            <p>Julia was next examined, and her evidence moſt exactly ſquared with the
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:035759_0062_100668A28E946FE8"/>former. Ingenuous as uſual, ſhe took up the ſtory at Elmwood, and carried it forward to the ſtory of the purſe; and ſhe told her little tale with that truth and ſimplicity which can never be counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited. Yet frequent attempts are made to imitate theſe amiable virtues, and the Juſtice was ſenſible of this: he had heard her mention that ſhe had letters for Lord C—, and he deſired to ſee them. Theſe ſhe inſtantly produced to vouch for her ſincerity. She added too, that there was <hi>ſomewhere</hi> in town a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who could confirm her words beyond ſuſpicion; but alas! poor <hi>Joe!</hi> ſhe knew not where to find him. "<hi>Joe!</hi> (ſaid one of the Juſtice's men who ſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind Julia)—what, is your name <hi>Julia,</hi> madam?" Yes (replied Julia)." The man immediately ran out, and brought back in his hand the <hi>Daily Advertiſer,</hi> in which he read the following adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement.</p>
            <p>"If a ſarten yung Lady, Miſs Jullia—(whoſe name is nothing to nobody, and which I doan't mention here, becauſe I
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:035759_0063_100668A4121E6D80"/>doa'nt think it proper)—ſees this, this is to let you kno, Miſs Jullia, that Joe duſn't kno where you be, and that you duſn't kno where Joe is, for he is to be found at the ſine of the Swain with too Necks in Lad Lane, and no where elſe, as wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs my hand by me. <hi>JOE—,"</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This very extraordinary advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is copied <hi>verbatim et literatim</hi> from the real paper, which I have now in my poſſeſſion. Julia liſtened to it with attention, and confeſſed her feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in her eyes, which gliſtened with expectation. Not contented with an aural information, ſhe ſnatched the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and devoured the precious morſel with her own eyes. In ſhort the ſimplic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of the thing ſpoke for itſelf, and Joe it was moſt undoubtedly.</p>
            <p>But it may be neceſſary to explain this affair. I again ſummon the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory of my readers back to that time of our hiſtory, when Joe and Julia un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckily parted in Holborn. Joe did not look for her till the coach ſtopt in
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:035759_0064_100668A5D9C2D940"/>the Inn yard, and then he waited at the door of it for her appearance. He thought her long in coming, but his patience was not exhauſted. The reſt of the company had been out of the coach ſome minutes. At length he ventured to thruſt in his head—but ſhe was not there! He ſtarted back on his heel, and gazed wildly round the yard, but in vain. Oppoſite to him he ſaw the door of a public room open, and he ruſhed in without ceremony: from thence he ſallied into the kitchen, ſtrode into the parlour, threw his eye into the bar, and peeped into the larder. Wounds! he looks furious, and he is almoſt breathleſs! He marched into the ſtables, and in ſhort into every place where he ſaw a door open to receive him—but all would not do: ſhe was not to be found. He returned to the coach, took one peep more into it, but all was ſolitary! "God bleſs my heart (ſaid Joe to himſelf fidgetting, and ſcratching among his auburn hair) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect and ſave me from all temptations
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:035759_0065_100668A761616CE8"/>and evil ſpirits! I wiſh I could ſee Miſs Julia again." Now, at laſt, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought him of what he ought to have done at firſt, viz. to queſtion the coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man concerning the affair, and the coachman informed him of the whole truth. This information in no degree abated his anxiety. "Didn't ſhe leave no word with you for me?" (ſaid he to the coachman.) No.—"Don't you know where ſhe went?"—No.—"Don't you think ſhe'll come here this night?"—I can't tell you upon my word—Joe with downcaſt looks and folded arms meaſured the ſpace acroſs the yard with long and melancholy ſtrides. He walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the paſſage of the houſe, and marked the clock. He counted the hours, as they rolled ſlow and heavy, but he ſaw not his miſtreſs. It was now ten o'clock, but no Julia came.—Alas! alas!</p>
            <p>They are not the ſevereſt, but they are the moſt anxious moments the mind knows, when the poſſeſſor of it, ſimple, timid, and honeſt, feels himſelf far
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:035759_0066_100668AB809BD688"/>from home, and forſaken in the midſt of ſtrangers. Theſe moments Joe now felt in all their bitterneſs. He went to bed without hope, and he aroſe in the morning in deſpair. He grieved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly, and he wiſhed for the boſom of a friend to lean his griefs upon it. At length he diſcloſed his mind to the hoſtler, and the hoſtler gave him his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. It was this: <hi>to advertiſe.</hi> Every body, he ſaid, did it, upon every ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. "Always when he loſt a <hi>horſe,</hi> he advertiſed for it; and why might not Joe do the ſame now for <hi>Julia?</hi> It would certainly lay open the whole af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, for advertiſements could do any thing."</p>
            <p>At this time Joe ſtood too greatly in need of comfort, not to take any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice that was offered to him. But he thought this advice excellent. He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly wrote with great care the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement we have already repeated, and the hoſtler ſent one of his boys with him to the Daily Advertiſer.—And
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:035759_0067_100668AD060A8240"/>this is the hiſtory of this extraordinary advertiſement.</p>
            <p>When the Juſtice found ſo many cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances ſpontaneouſly conſpiring to vindicate her innocence, that her amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſimplicity ſubjected her to ſo many dangers, and that ſhe was the object rather of a polite humanity than of perſecution, he reſolved to intereſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in her ſafety. And in the firſt place, he ordered one of his men to go and conduct Joe to his miſtreſs. As to the fat woman, the Juſtice told her that her money ſhould be taken care of; and the highwayman was remanded to priſon.</p>
            <p>Joe arrives. I have not time to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe every thing; but my readers may be aſſured that the meeting. between him and Julia was full affectionate. Suffice it to ſay, that Julia preſſed him warmly by the hand, and half cried with joy; and that Joe took faſt hold of the ſkirt of her robe, as if he dreaded her running away from him once more.</p>
            <p>The friends thus met, the Juſtice
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:035759_0068_100668AE8C8B6918"/>politely aſked Julia how he could moſt effectually ſerve her? She replied, that her only buſineſs in town was to deliver her letters to Lord C—, and that if he would favour her with a guide thith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſhe would always remember him with the moſt unfeigned gratitude. This ſhe obtained; and, once more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging her obligations to the Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, they all ſet off for Berkeley ſquare.</p>
            <p>Here they ſoon arrived. The guide leaving them at the door. Joe imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately took off his hat, for he thought it high treaſon to be covered within ſix yards of a Lord's door: they knocked, but were told by the porter his Lordſhip was not at home. Julia ſaid ſhe was ſorry for that, becauſe ſhe had <hi>letters of importance</hi> for him. "I can't help that (anſwered the porter,) he's not at home; and he'll not be at home—I don't know when he'll be home."—But could not you gueſs Sir;—becauſe a <hi>great deal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon it.</hi>—"Lord, Ma'am (replied Cerberus)! I tell you I know nothing about it."—Sounds ſo ungentle, utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:035759_0069_100668B18ED63F90"/>by ſo rude a voice, frightened Julia effectually, and ſhe haſtened away from the door; and Joe, ſorrowful enough, was preparing to follow—when the porter beckoned him back with a <hi>hem!</hi> and the motion of his finger. "Pray, my lad, (ſaid this dog in office) who is that?</p>
            <p>My miſtreſs (anſwered Joe.)</p>
            <p>"Ay—from the country, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe?"</p>
            <p>Yes (replied Joe): I come from the country too.</p>
            <p>"O—ſo I ſee—ſo I ſee.—You are not acquainted, I find, with the <hi>ways</hi> in this town?"</p>
            <p>No, Sir, (ſaid Joe)—not with <hi>all</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>Why, then—(come hither—your ear a moment) I have the honour to be Lord C—'s porter) and my maſter has or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered me—that is, I and my maſter have agreed—to receive no letter here, unleſs the bearer gives me a crown.—However, as you and your miſtreſs are ſtrangers, and I am a man of honour,
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:035759_0070_100668B44063CEC8"/>I'll be more merciful to you, and ſo conſent to take only half a crown—But mum—ſly—not a word for your life—for if my maſter was to hear I <hi>take ſo little,</hi> he'd turn me out of my place.</p>
            <p>Sure I am, maſter, (anſwered Joe) we are both very much obliged to you for being ſo kind.—But then what can you do for us, if ſo be that my Lord a'n't at home?</p>
            <p>"Pſhaw, man! (ſaid the porter) run after your miſtreſs and bring the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and I'll ſatisfy you about that."</p>
            <p>O—an' that be all (replied Joe) I can pay the money myſelf.</p>
            <p>He drew out his laſt half crown, and gave it. He then ran after Julia, and as he went he murmured to himſelf—"Icod tho' wern't that a <hi>Lord's</hi> houſe it looks hugely like bribery and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion."</p>
            <p>Our two travellers now returned, and were received by the porter with a more gracious complaiſance. He now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed them that, tho' his Lordſhip was
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:035759_0071_100668B5C5E9A048"/>out of town, he was only at his villa, and would certainly return to town to dinner; but that if they were in a hurry, my young Lord was at home, and that he had leave to open his father's letters in his abſence. Julia delivered her pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et to the porter, and they were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to walk into the anti chamber. The letters were ſent up to the noble youth in his dreſſing room.</p>
            <p>Now in order to prepare my readers for a very important aera in the life of my heroine, it may be neceſſary to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late what this noble youth was. A fooliſh grandmother had leſt him three thouſand a year independent of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and of his age; all which, with three thouſand more, he gallantly ſpent like a man of ſpirit, long before the year was done. He uſed to ſay, that every kingdom in Europe contributed to furniſh his ſeraglio: he only meant by this, that he kept in pay one French, one Spaniſh, one Italian, one Scandina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian, one German, one Iriſh, and one Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh nymph, all at one time; which he
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:035759_0072_100668B74BAA5BD0"/>actually did. He was deep in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret at Soho, very deep in the myſteries at Arthur's. He boaſted—and he had a right to do it—that he had killed five waiters, and ſhot two clergymen, and ſeven hundred ſheep; which laſt feat he performed as follows. He was a fowler when at his father's eſtate in the country; and when he had been unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful in purſuit of game, he always diſcharged his piece into the body of a ſheep. As this amuſement exactly hit his taſte, he would ſometimes recharge, and rediſcharge, till perhaps before his return home, he would leave half a dozen dead upon the field. He fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently obſerved, that this was an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſement which ought to be practiſed by all Noblemen, in order to fit them to <hi>command in the field</hi> in time of war, in the ſervice of their country.—He boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed too, that he had killed fifteen women by <hi>breaking their hearts</hi> with a hopeleſs paſſion. This, however, was (to uſe an old and honeſt Engliſh phraſe) a <hi>lie:</hi> for he never killed but one woman, and
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:035759_0073_100668B9FB8050A8"/>that was by <hi>breaking</hi>—not her <hi>heart,</hi> but her <hi>neck,</hi> and then throwing her into the horſe pond, where he ſwore ſhe had drowned herſelf—But <hi>ſhe</hi> was only a dairy maid. He boaſted alſo—But, in ſhort, we are tired with repeating his glories. Suffice it to ſay, that he is at preſent the pink of the young Peerage, and the ornament of mother II—'s—and St. James.</p>
            <p>Such was the youth to whom the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the father of Julia was carried. He opened it, and on reading the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing paragraph,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>"I have preſumed, my Lord, to ſend my</hi> Daughter <hi>as the bearer of this petition,"</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>On reading this, he rang his bell with great haſte, and enquired if the <hi>bearer</hi> was below? Being informed that ſhe was, he flew down the ſtairs, and, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Julia's face, with the moſt polite courteſy be deſired her to walk up ſtairs while he conſidered of her letter. The ſervants were ordered at the ſame time to conduct Joe into the hall, and be
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:035759_0074_100668BCAC1DF200"/>civil to him. Julia aſcended after her noble patron.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>— Hic pauca defunt. We muſt here paſs ever the hiſtory of half an hour, becauſe it is not yet ripe for relation. —</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time Lord C—'s Chaplain, who had been with his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in the country, arrived at the houſe. He came home before his Lordſhip, to finiſh ſome buſineſs of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to himſelf before dinner time. When he entered, he obſerved Joe ſtaring about in the hall, and perceiving him to be a ſtranger from the country, entered into converſation with him. He had not many queſtions to aſk, for Joe with his uſual frankneſs told him the
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:035759_0075_100668BE2FCD0B98"/>whole hiſtory—about himſelf, about Julia, and Julia's buſineſs, and where ſhe was now, and with whom. Now this Chaplain was plain in his manners and equally plain in his dreſs—ſo plain that he ſcarcely appeared to be <hi>of the cloth.</hi> Though an enemy to blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, he was far from being a coward; though a Churchman, he was no hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite; and though he deteſted ſubſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Thirty nine Articles, he was allowed to be a very honeſt man.</p>
            <p>The Chaplain, having finiſhed his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview with Joe, was retiring to his own apartment. He had not opened his door, when a loud ſhriek ſaluted his ear—then another—and another. A thouſand ideas ruſhed upon his mind. He knew Julia by report, and he knew his young Lord by experience. There was no doubt of the buſineſs below. He haſtened down the ſtairs, and liſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a moment at the key hole. He could only perceive that ſome perſons were engaged in a violent ſtruggle, and that the chairs were knocked againſt
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:035759_0076_100668BFD996B090"/>each other. He tried to enter, but the door was locked. Placing his ſhoulder againſt it, therefore, he forced it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with gentleneſs and with eaſe. He entered; and lo!—Innocence was once more in diſtreſs!</p>
            <p>The hair of Julia was diſhevelled, and a handkerchief was drawn cloſe over her mouth, which prevented her cries. Her cloak and handkerchief lay upon the floor, and the arms of her ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſher were twined cloſely around her. A ſhoe had dropped from her foot, and many of the pins had quitted her boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>om.—Unfortunate girl! doomed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually to be the prey of cowards and ſcoundrels!</p>
            <p>The noble youth quitted his hold when the Chaplain appeared, and, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing to him, exclaimed in a thtreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening tone, "How dare you, Sir, force your impertinence upom <hi>me</hi> in my own dreſſing room?"</p>
            <p>"My Lord—(returned the young man, putting his left hand in his boſom, and giving him a full but indifferent
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:035759_0077_100668C28F92ADD8"/>look)—My Lord—does it ſuit your high ſpirit to be told, that you are the meaneſt—O by far the meaneſt creature in your father's houſe? Noble, without worth—and proud, without dignity— you are beneath the pimp who caters for your appetites.—Poor, pitiful, wretched animal! I do not pull you by the noſe—I do not kick you on the breech—I do not laſh you round the room—I do not in any degree deign to chaſtiſe the wretch, who has ſtooped to inſult a woman.—Go, then, you boaſter! retire into your cloſet, and bluſh in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate; and remember that you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced yourſelf to be forced to hear theſe ſtinging truths even from ſo hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a man as your father's Chaplain.—I ſcorn, Sir, to tell your father that you are a ſcoundrel; but do not forget that for the future I conſider you as my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior."</p>
            <p>He finiſhed: and taking Julia by the hand, he led her out of the room, and drew the door behind him.</p>
            <p>He conducted her into his own apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:035759_0078_100647710A8F4328"/>and ſympathized with her in that ſtrain of humane politeneſs which is ever inſeparable from undebauched minds. After ſhe had compoſed her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he diſtantly enquired (as if he had not known) into her buſineſs. This was exactly a repetition of Joe's narration.</p>
            <p>"I thank you, Madam, (ſaid he) for your politeneſs. You will ſee Lord C— in about an hour; but previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oulſly I think it my duty to inform you of what ought not to be longer conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from you—it is now one o'clock— Exactly at ten—about three hours ago—Lord C— appointed me to the Curacy you are come to ſolicit. This information in no degree ſtartled Julia, nor unruffled her features. She obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that ſince her father had not been lucky enough to obtain the Curacy, ſhe was happy the appointment was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon a man who reſembled him ſo much in his virtues.</p>
            <p>At the time ſpecified Lord C— arrived. Julia was introduced o him by the Chaplain, and he ſent to his ſon
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:035759_0079_100668C6C5D76450"/>for her letters. On reading them he confirmed what the Chaplain had men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
            <p>He then turned to Julia, ſaluted her with that virtuous freedom for which he was always remarkable, and fondly converſed with her about the moments he had ſpent with her father about fifty years ago. He next inſiſted that ſhe ſhould ſtay with him two or three days; to which ſhe with the utmoſt difficulty aſſented, and of which ſhe informed her father by letter. When the young Lord heard that Julia was to continue her viſit, he aſſumed ſome pretence for retiring to his father's villa till her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture.</p>
            <p>Need I mention, that the Chaplain ſelt the force of the eyes of Julia? Alack! from the moment he firſt ſaw her in tears, his heart was wounded to the core—for the tears of a woman are irreſiſtable. Indeed the only good lines in one of our new tragedies are to this purpoſe:</p>
            <pb n="81" facs="unknown:035759_0080_100668C84C7DF7B0"/>
            <q>
               <l>—Unſkilful they</l>
               <l>Who dreſs the Queen of Love in wanton Smiles:</l>
               <l>Brighteſt ſhe ſhines amidſt a ſhow'r of tears:</l>
               <l>The graces that adorn her beauty moſt</l>
               <l>Are ſoftneſs, ſenſibility, and pity.</l>
               <bibl>ALONZO.</bibl>
            </q>
            <p>Now with regard to this Chaplain— Julia, on her part—But I will not ſay any thing about it. Be it ſuffcient to obſerve, that from the moment a man evinces his courage and his honour, the heart of a virtuous woman is ready to receive him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>—Hic multa deſunt. Here we muſt leap over the hiſtory of three days, for</hi> Julia <hi>will have it ſo.—</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the morning of the fourth day, Julia and the Curate were preparing to ſet off on their journey for the banks
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:035759_0081_100668CB1A750A70"/>of the Avon: ſhe to her father, and he to take poſſeſſion of his Curacy. Before their departure, he begged once more a word with her in private. He led her towards a very diſtant part of the houſe, into an humble apartment poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed by one of the old family nurſes, whoſe favourite he long had been. Now, though it may ſeem ſtrange that he ſhould lead her thither as a place of retirement, certain it is that it was by far the moſt retired and ſecret ſpot in the houſe, for the old woman was completely deaf, and almoſt blind: A few more days would cloſe her eyes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. In this humble manſion, he ſat at one ſide of a table, oppoſite to Julia, and he told her he had one favour to beg. "Three days (ſaid he,) my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Julia, are paſt, in which I told you the true tale of my heart You liſtened, it is true, but ſo faintly liſtened, that my hopes are ſcarcely kept alive. Before we depart—before we enter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the buſtle of a high road—deign to beſtow on me one mark, to give me
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:035759_0082_100668CDCD5B28B0"/>one aſſurance, that you do not deteſt me. Were it but—" The bluſhes and ſmiles of Julia interrupted him. She ſtretched her hand to him acroſs the table, and he almoſt devoured it with kiſſes.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, they ſat off on their jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, attended by the truſty Joe. Without any accident, they arrived in due time at Elmwood. The father, overpowered by love and tenderneſs, ſunk at the ſide of his daughter. The daughter, agitated by affection and joy, filled the boſom of her father with ſighs, and revived him with the plenty and warmth of her tears. The evening was ſpent in the recital of her adventures: while Joe, in the centre of the green, had the whole village col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected around him, and related to them the wonders of London.</p>
            <p>I muſt now cloſe this hiſtory. Sev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral months have elapſed ſince the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove events happened, and the young Curate is now happy in the warm boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>om
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:035759_0083_100668CF50119A08"/>of his Julia. Julia too is bleſſed, for the houſes of her huſband and of her father are adjoining to each other.</p>
