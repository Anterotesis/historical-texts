            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AGREEABLY to your requeſt contained in your letter of the 29th of Auguſt, 1789, I have at laſt ſet down to communicate ſuch facts to you, upon the ſubject of migration to this country, as have been the reſult of numerous enquiries and faithful obſervation. I am aware that this ſubject has been handled in a maſterly manner by doctor Franklin, in his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent little pamphlet, entitled "Advice to thoſe who would wiſh to remove to America," but as that valuable little work is very general, and as many important changes have occurred in the affairs of the united ſtates ſince its publication, I ſhall endeavour to comply with your wiſhes, by adding ſuch things as have been omitted by the doctor, and ſhall accommodate them to the preſent ſtate of our country.</p>
            <p>I ſhall begin this letter by mentioning the deſcriptions of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who ought not to come to America.</p>
            <p>I. Men of independent fortunes who can exiſt only in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and who can converſe only upon public amuſements, ſhould not think of ſettling in the united ſtates. I have known ſeveral men of that character in this country, who have rambled from ſtate to ſtate, complaining of the dulneſs of each of them, and who have finally returned and renewed their former connexions and pleaſures in Europe.</p>
            <p>II. Literary men, who have no profeſſional purſuits, will often languiſh in America, from the want of ſociety. Our authors and ſcholars are generally men of buſineſs, and make their literary purſuits ſubſervient to their intereſts. A lounger in book ſtores, breakfaſting parties for the purpoſe of literary converſation, and long attic evenings, are as yet but little known in this country. Our companies are generally mixed, and converſation in them is a medley of ideas upon all ſubjects. They begin as in England with the weather—ſoon run into politics—now and then diverge into literature—and commonly conclude with facts relative to commerce, manufactures and agriculture, and the beſt means of acquiring and improving an eſtate, Men, who are philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:022390_0003_0FB86DE04036C770"/>
or poets, without other purſuits, had better end their days in an old country.</p>
            <p>III. The united ſtates as yet afford but little encouragement to the profeſſors of moſt of the fine arts. Painting and ſculpture flouriſh chiefly in wealthy and luxurious countries. Our native American portrait painters who have not ſought protection and encouragement in Great Britain, have been obliged to travel occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally from one ſtate to another in order to ſupport themſelves. The teachers of muſic have been more fortunate in America. A taſte for this accompliſhment prevails very generally in our large cities: and eminent maſters in that art, who have arrived here ſince the peace, have received conſiderable ſums of money by exerciſing their profeſſion among us.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now mention thoſe deſcriptions of people, who may better their condition by coming to America.</p>
            <p>I. To the cultivators of the earth the united ſtates open the firſt aſylum in the world. To inſure the ſucceſs and happineſs of an European farmer in our country, it is neceſſary to adviſe him either to purchaſe, or to rent a farm which has undergone ſome improvement.</p>
            <p>The buſineſs of ſettling a new tract of land, and that of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving a farm, are of a very different nature. The former muſt be effected by the native American, who is accuſtomed to the uſe of the axe and the grubbing hoe, and who poſſeſſes almoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſively a knowledge of all the peculiar and nameleſs arts of ſelf-preſervation in the woods. I have known many inſtances of Europeans who have ſpent all their caſh in unſucceſsful attempts to force a ſettlement in the wilderneſs, and who have afterwards been expoſed to poverty and diſtreſs at a great diſtance from friends and even neighbours. I would therefore adviſe all farmers with moderate capitals, to purchaſe or rent improved farms in the old ſettlements of our ſtates. The price and rent of theſe farms are different in the different parts of the union. In Pennſylvania, the price of farms is regulated by the quality of the land—by the value of the improvements which are erected upon it—by their vicinity to ſea ports and navigable water—and by the good or bad ſtate of the roads which lead to them. There is a great variety, of courſe, in the price of farms: while ſome of them have been ſold for five guineas—others have been ſold at lower prices, down to one guinea, and even half a gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:022390_0004_0FB86DE1B8F84E08"/>
per acre, according as they were varied by the above circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
            <p>It is not expected that the whole price of a farm ſhould be paid at the time of purchaſing it. An half, a third, or a fourth, is all that is generally required. Bonds and mortgages are given for the remainder, (and ſometimes without intereſt) payable in two, three, five, or even ten years.</p>
            <p>The value of theſe farms has often been doubled and even trebled, in a few years, where the new mode of agriculture has been employed in cultivating them: ſo that a man with a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate capital, may, in the courſe of fifteen years, become an opulent and independent freeholder.</p>
            <p>If, notwithſtanding what has been ſaid of the difficulties of effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an eſtabliſhment in the woods, the low price of the new lands ſhould tempt the European farmer to ſettle in them, then let me add, that it can only be done by aſſociating himſelf in a large company, under the direction of an active and intelligent Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican farmer. To ſecure even <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> company of European ſettlers from diſappointment and want in the woods, it will be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to clear a few acres of land the year before, and to ſow them with grain, in order to provide ſubſiſtence for the company, till they can provide for themſelves, by clearing their own farms. The difficulties of eſtabliſhing this new ſettlement, will be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leſſened, if a few cabins, a griſt and a ſaw mill be erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, at the ſame time the preparations are made for the temporary ſubſiſtence of the company. In this manner, moſt of the firſt ſettlements of the New England men have been made in this country. One great advantage, attending this mode of ſettling, is, a company may always carry with them a clergyman and a ſchoolmaſter, of the ſame religion and language with themſelves. If a ſettler in the woods ſhould poſſeſs a taſte for rural elegance, he may gratify it without any expenſe, by the manner of laying out his farm. He may ſhade his houſe by means of ancient and venerable foreſt-trees. He may leave rows of them ſtanding, to adorn his lanes and walks—or cluſters of them on the high grounds of his fields, to ſhade his cattle. If he ſhould fix upon any of thoſe parts of our weſtern country, which are covered with the ſugar-tree, he may encloſe a ſufficient number of them to ſupply his family with ſugar; and may confer upon them at the ſame time the order and beauty of a fine orchard. In this manner, a highly-improved ſeat may be cut out of the woods
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:022390_0005_0FB86DE76F6335D8"/>
in a few years, which will ſurpaſs both in elegance and value a farm in an old ſettlement, which has been for twenty years the ſubject of improvements in taſte and agriculture. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template a dwelling-houſe—a barn—ſtables—fields—meadows—an orchard—a garden, &amp;c. which have been produced from ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal creation by the labour of a ſingle life, is, I am told, to the proprietor of them, one of the higheſt pleaſures the mind of man is capable of enjoying. But how much muſt this pleaſure be increaſed, when the regularity of art is blended in the proſpect, with the wildneſs and antiquity of nature?</p>
            <p>It has been remarked in this country, that clearing the land of its woods, ſometimes makes a new ſettlement unhealthy, by expoſing its damp grounds to the action of the ſun. To obviate this evil, it will be neceſſary for the ſettler either to drain and cultivate his low grounds, as ſoon as they are cleared, or to leave a body of trees between his dwelling houſe, and the ſpots from whence the morbid effluvia are derived. The laſt of theſe methods has, in no inſtance that I have heard of, failed of preſerving whole families from ſuch diſeaſes as ariſe from damp or putrid exhalations.</p>
            <p>To country gentlemen, who have been accuſtomed to live upon the income of a landed eſtate in Europe, it will be neceſſary to communicate the following information, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that farms, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of the unproductive woodland, which is generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with them, ſeldom yield more than three or four per cent. a year in caſh, except in the neighbourhood of large cities. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, from the facility with which money eno may be ſaved in a few years, to purchaſe land in this country, tenants will not accept of long leaſes: and hence they are not ſufficiently intereſted in the farms they rent, to keep them in repair. If country gentlemen wiſh to derive the greateſt advantage from laying out their money in lands, they muſt reſide in their vicinity. A capital of five thouſand guineas, inveſted in a number of contiguous farms, in an improved part of our country, and cultivated by tenants under the eye and direction of a landlord, would ſoon yield a greater income than double that ſum would in moſt parts of Europe. The landlord in this caſe muſt frequently viſit and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the ſtate of each of his farms: and now and then he muſt ſtop to repair a bridge or a fence in his excurſions through them. He muſt receive all his rents in the produce of the farms. If the tenant find his own ſtock, he will pay a half of all the grain he
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:022390_0006_0FB86DE939E78838"/>
raiſes, and ſometimes a certain proportion of vegetables and live ſtock, to his landlord. The diviſion of the grain is generally made in the field, in ſheaves or ſtacks, which are carried home to be thraſhed in the barn of the landlord. An eſtated gentleman, who can reconcile himſelf to this kind of life, may be both hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and uſeful. He may inſtruct his tenants by his example, as well as precepts in the new modes of huſbandry: he may teach them the art and advantages of gardening: he may inſpire them with habits of ſobriety, induſtry, and economy; and thereby become the father and protector of a dependant and affectionate neighbourhood. After a buſy ſummer and autumn, he may paſs his winters in the boſom of ſociety, in any of our cities, and in many of our country villages.</p>
            <p>But ſhould he be diſinclined to ſuch extenſive ſcenes of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he may confine his purchaſes and labours to a ſingle farm, and ſecure his ſuperfluous caſh in bonds and mortgages, which will yield him ſix per cent.</p>
            <p>Under this head, it is proper to mention, that the agricultural life begins to maintain in the united ſtates, the ſame rank that it has long maintained in Great Britain. Many gentlemen of education among us have quitted liberal profeſſions, and have proved, by their ſucceſs in farming, that philoſophy is in no bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs more uſeful or profitable, than in agriculture.</p>
            <p>II. MECHANICS and MANUFACTURERS, of every deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will find certain encouragement in the united ſtates. During the connexion of this country with Great Britain, we were taught to believe that agriculture and commerce ſhould be the only purſuits of the Americans: but experiments and reflexion have taught us that our country abounds with reſources for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures of all kinds; and that moſt of them may be conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with great advantage in all the ſtates. We are already nearly independent of the whole world for iron-work, paper, and malt liquors: and great progreſs has been made in the manufactories of glaſs, pot-aſh, and cloths of all kinds. The commercial habits of our citizens have as yet prevented their employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing large capitals in thoſe manufactories: but I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that if a few European adventurers would embark in them with capitals equal to the demand for thoſe manufactures, they would ſoon find an immenſe profit in their ſpeculations. A ſingle farmer in the ſtate of New York, with a capital of five thouſand pounds, has cleared one thouſand a year by the manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture of pot-aſh alone.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:022390_0007_0FB86DEC409AD0D0"/>
Thoſe mechanical arts, which are accommodated to the infant and ſimple ſtate of a country, will bid faireſt to ſucceed among us. Every art, connected with cultivating the earth—building houſes and ſhips, and feeding and clothing the body, will meet with encouragement in this country. The price of proviſions are ſo different in the different ſtates, and even in the different parts of the ſame ſtate, and very ſo much with the plenty and ſecurity of money, that it would be difficult to give you ſuch an account of them, as would be uſeful. I need only remark that the diſproportion between the price of labour and of proviſions, is much greater in every part of the united ſtates, than in any part of Europe: and hence our tradeſmen every where eat meat and butter every day: and moſt of them realize the wiſh of Henry IV. of France, for the peaſants of his kingdom, by din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not only once, but two or three times, upon poultry, in every week of the year.</p>
            <p>It is a ſingular fact in the hiſtory of the mechanical arts in this country, that the ſame arts ſeldom deſcend from father to ſon. Such are the profits of even the humbleſt of them, that the ſons of mechanics generally riſe from the lower to the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable occupations: and thus their families gradually aſcend to the firſt ranks in ſociety among us. The influence, which the proſpects of wealth and conſequence have in invigorating in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry in every line of mechanical buſineſs, is very great. Many of the firſt men in America, are the ſons of reputable me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanics or farmers. But I may go farther, and add, that many men, who diſtinguiſhed themſelves both in the cabinet and field, in the late war, had been mechanics. I know the Britiſh offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers treated the American cauſe with contempt, from this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance: but the event of the war ſhewed, that the confidence of America was not miſplaced in that body of citizens.</p>
            <p>III. LABOURERS may depend upon conſtant employment in the united ſtates, both in our towns and in the country. When they work by the day, they receive high wages: but theſe are ſeldom continued through the whole year. A labourer receives annually, with his boarding, waſhing, and lodging, from fifteen to eighteen guineas, in the middle ſtates. It is agreeable to obſerve this claſs of men frequently raiſed by their induſtry from their humble ſtations into the upper ranks of life, in the courſe of twenty or thirty years.</p>

IV. PERSONS who are willing to indent themſelves as ſervants for a few years, will find that humble ſtation no obſtacle to a future eſtabliſhment in our country. Many men, who came to America in that capacity, are now in affluent circumſtances. Their former ſituation, where they have behaved well, does not preclude them from forming reſpectable connexions in marriage, nor from ſharing, if otherwiſe qualified, in the offices of our country.</p>
            <p>V. The united ſtates continue to afford encouragement to gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the LEARNED PROFESSIONS, provided they be prudent in their deportment, and of ſufficient knowledge: for ſince the eſtabliſhment of colleges and ſchools of learning in all our ſtates, the ſame degrees of learning will not ſucceed among us, which ſucceeded fifty years ago.</p>
            <p>Several lawyers and phyſicians, who have arrived here ſince the peace, are now in good buſineſs: and many clergymen, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of England, Scotland, and Ireland, are comfortably ſettled in good pariſhes. A miniſter of the goſpel in a country place muſt not expect to have all his ſalary paid in caſh: but he will notwithſtanding ſeldom fail of obtaining a good ſubſiſtence from his congregation. They will furniſh his table with a portion of all the live ſtock they raiſe for their own uſe: they will ſhoe his horſes—repair his implements of huſbandry—and aſſiſt him in gathering-in his harveſts, and in many other parts of the buſineſs of his farm. From theſe aids, with now and then a little caſh, a clergyman may not only live well, but, in the courſe of his life, may accumulate an handſome eſtate for his children. This will more certainly happen, if he can redeem time enough from his parochial duties, and the care of his farm, to teach a ſchool. The people of America are of all ſects: but the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of them are of independent, preſbyterian, epiſcopal, bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt, and methodiſt denominations. The principles held by each of theſe ſocieties in America, are the ſame as thoſe which are held by the proteſtant churches in Europe, from which they derive their origin.</p>
            <p>VI. SCHOOLMASTERS of good capacities and fair characters, may expect to meet with encouragement in the middle and ſouthern ſtates. They will ſucceed better, if they confine their inſtructions to reading, writing, Engliſh grammar, and the ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of number and quantity. Theſe branches of literature are of general neceſſity and utility: and of courſe every townſhip will
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:022390_0009_0FB86DF210E034A8"/>
furniſh ſcholars enough for the maintenance of a ſchoolmaſter. Many young men have riſen by means of the connexions they have formed in this uſeful employment, to rank and conſequence in the learned profeſſions in every part of this country.</p>
            <p>From this account of the united ſtates, you will eaſily perceive, that they are a hot-bed for induſtry and genius in almoſt every hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man purſuit. It is inconceivable how many uſeful diſcoveries neceſſity has produced within theſe few years, in agriculture and manufactures, in our country. The ſame neceſſity has produced a verſatility of genius among our citizens: hence we frequently meet with men who have exerciſed two or three different occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations or profeſſions in the courſe of their lives, according to the influence which intereſt, accident, or local circumſtances have had upon them. I know that the peculiarities, which have been mentioned in the American character, ſtrike a European, who has been accuſtomed to conſider man as a creature of habit, formed by long eſtabliſhed governments, and hereditary cuſtoms, as ſo many deviatons from propriety and order. But a wiſe man, who knows that national characters ariſe from circumſtances, will view theſe peculiarities without ſurpriſe, and attribute them wholly to the preſent ſtate of manners, ſociety, and government in America.</p>
            <p>From the numerous competitions in every branch of buſineſs in Europe, ſucceſs in any purſuit, may be looked upon in the ſame light as a prize in a lottery. But the caſe is widely different in America. Here there is room enough for every human talent and virtue to expand and flouriſh. This is ſo invariably true, that I believe there is not an inſtance to be found, of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious, frugal, prudent European, with ſober manners, who has not been ſucceſsful in buſineſs, in this country.</p>
            <p>As a further inducement to Europeans to tranſport themſelves acroſs the Ocean, I am obliged to mention a fact that does little honour to the native American; and that is, in all competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for buſineſs, where ſucceſs depends upon induſtry, the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean is generally preferred. Indeed, ſuch is the facility with which property is acquired, that where it does not operate as a ſtimulus to promote ambition, it is ſometimes accompanied by a relaxation of induſtry in proportion to the number of years or generations which interpoſe between the founder of an American family and his poſterity. This preference of European mechanics ariſes likewiſe from the improvements in the different arts, which
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:022390_0010_0FB86DF48CCAB050"/>
are from time to time imported by them into our country. To theſe facts I am happy in being able to add, that the years of anarchy, which proved ſo diſguſting to the Europeans who ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived among us immediately after the peace, are now at an end, and that the united ſtates have at laſt adopted a national go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment which unites with the vigour of monarchy and the ſtability of ariſtocracy, all the freedom of a ſimple republic. Its influence already in invigorating induſtry, and reviving credit, is univerſal. There are ſeveral peculiarities in this government, which cannot fail of being agreeable to Europeans, who are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ſettle in America.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The equal ſhare of power it holds forth to men of every religious ſect. As the firſt fruits of this perfection in our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, we already ſee three gentlemen of the Roman catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic church, members of the legiſlature of the united ſtates.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Birth in America is not required for holding either power or office in the federal government, except that of preſident of the united ſtates. In conſequence of this principle of juſtice, not only in the national government, but in all our ſtate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, we daily ſee the natives of Britain, Ireland, and Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, advanced to the moſt reſpectable employments in our country.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By a late act of congreſs, only two years reſidence in the united ſtates are neceſſary to entitle foreigners of good cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter to all the privileges of citizenſhip. Even that ſhort period of time has been found ſufficient to give ſtrangers a viſible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the ſtability and freedom of our governments.</p>
            <p>It is agreeable to obſerve the influence which our republican governments have already had upon the tempers and manners of our citizens. Amuſement is every where giving way to buſineſs: and local politeneſs is yielding to univerſal civility. We differ about forms and modes in politics: but this difference begins to ſubmit to the reſtraints of moral and ſocial obligation. Order and tranquility appear to be the natural conſequence of a well-balanced republic: for where men can remove the evils of their governments by frequent elections, they will ſeldom appeal to the leſs certain remedies of mobs or arms. It is with ſingular pleaſure that I can add further, that notwithſtanding the viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of our diſſenſions about independence and the federal go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, there is now ſcarcely a citizen of the united ſtates, who is not ſatisfied with both, and who does not believe this country
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:022390_0011_0FB86DF660818498"/>
to be in a happier and ſafer ſituation, than it was, in the moſt flouriſhing years of its dependence upon Great Britain.</p>
            <p>The encouragement held out to European emigrants, is not the ſame in all the ſtates. New England, New York, and New Jerſey, being nearly filled with cultivators of the earth, afford encouragement chiefly to mechanics and labourers. The inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of New England have far ſurpaſſed the inhabitants of the other ſtates, in the eſtabliſhment of numerous and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table manufacturies. Theſe wonderful people diſcover the ſame degrees of induſtry in cultivating the arts of peace, that they did of enterprize and perſeverance, in the late war. They alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy export large quantities of wrought iron, hats, women's ſhoes, cheeſe, and linen and woolen cloth. The ſtate of New York has likewiſe diſcovered a laudable ſpirit for manufactures and domeſtic improvements. European artiſts, therefore, cannot fail of meeting with encouragement in each of the above ſtates.</p>
            <p>Pennſylvania affords an equal aſylum to all the deſcriptions of people that have been mentioned, under the ſecond head of this letter. Agriculture, manufactures, and many of the liberal arts ſeem to vie with each other for preeminence in this ſtate. Each of them is under the patronage of numerous and reſpectable ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties. No ſtate in the union affords greater reſources for ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>building, malt liquors, maple ſugar, ſail cloth, iron work, woolen and linen cloths, pot-aſh, and glaſs. Coal, likewiſe, abounds on the ſhores of the Suſquehanna, a large river which runs through half the ſtate. The variety of ſects and nations, which compoſe the inhabitants of this ſtate, has hitherto prevented our having any ſteady traits in our character. We poſſeſs the virtues and weakneſſes of moſt of the ſects and nations of Europe. But this variety has produced ſuch a colliſion in opinions and intereſts, as has greatly favoured the progreſs of genius in every art and ſcience. We have been accuſed of being factious by our ſiſter ſtates. This muſt be aſcribed chiefly to our ſtate conſtitution, which was eſtabliſhed by violence in the beginning of the late war, and which was never aſſented to by a majority of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. But that majority have at length aſſerted their power. A convention, compoſed of an equal repreſentation of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, has met and formed a new conſtitution, which comprehends in it every principle of liberty and juſt government. From the excellency of this conſtitution—from the harmony it has reſtored to our citizens—from the central ſituation of our ſtate—
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:022390_0012_0FB86DF78064E808"/>
from the number and courſes of our rivers—from the facility with which we are able to draw the reſources of the lakes to the Delaware—from the wealth of our capital—and above all, from the induſtry and ſober habits of our citizens—there can be no doubt that Pennſylvania will always maintain the firſt rank, for national proſperity and happineſs, in the united ſtates.</p>
            <p>There is one circumſtance, peculiar in a great degree to Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania, which cannot fail of directing the eyes of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of ſeveral of the European nations to this ſtate—and that is, the natives of Britain, Ireland, Germany, France, Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and Holland, may here meet with their former fellow ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and receive from them that welcome and aſſiſtance, which are the natural conſequences of the tie of country. So ſtrongly does this principle operate in America, that the natives of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many and Ireland have formed themſelves into ſocieties in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Philadelphia, for the expreſs purpoſe of protecting, adviſing, and aſſiſting their countrymen, as ſoon as they ſet their feet upon the ſhores of Pennſylvania.</p>
            <p>It has been ſaid, that the lands in Pennſylvania are dearer than in ſome of our ſiſter ſtates. They ſell, it is true, for a greater nominal ſum, than the lands of the neighbouring ſtates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but in the end, they are much cheaper. The ſoil is deep, rich, and durable, and from the ſuperior induſtry and ſkill of our farmers, our lands are more productive than thoſe of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; hence their higher price: for the price of lands is always in a ratio to their quality, produce and ſituation: hence likewiſe, we are able to tell the value of a farm in any part of the ſtate, by firſt finding out the quantity of grain an acre will produce, and the price of this grain at the neareſt mill or ſtore, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome little allowance for the improvements which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with the farm. This remark is ſo univerſally true, that a farmer never miſtakes the application of it in purchaſing land. There is a certain inſtinct, which governs in all purchaſes and ſales of farms, and which ariſes out of the principle I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned: it is in general as accurate, as if it aroſe out of the niceſt calculation. It is from an ignorance or neglect of this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, that ſo many of our citizens have migrated to Kentucke, under a deluſive expectation of purchaſing lands cheaper than in the old ſtates. They are, in fact often much dearer, when you eſtimate their price by the profit of the grain which is cultivated upon them. For inſtance: an acre of land in Kentucke,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:022390_0013_0FB86DFA886A82B0"/>
which ſells for a quarter of a guinea, and yields 30 buſhels of corn, at four pence ſterling per buſhel, is dearer than land of the ſame quality in Pennſylvania, at a guinea per acre, that yields the ſame quantity of corn, which can be ſold at the neareſt mill or ſtore for two ſhillings ſterl. per buſhel. To cure this paſſion for mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grating to the waters of the Ohio, there is but one remedy, and that is, to open the navigation of the Miſſiſſippi. This, by raiſing the price of produce, will raiſe the value of land ſo high, as to deſtroy the balance of attraction to that country. This truth is at preſent a ſpeculative one; nor do I ſuppoſe it will be reduced to practice, if nations continue to be what they have been, until the waters of the Ohio and Miſſiſſippi have been dyed with the blood of two or three hundred thouſand men.</p>
            <p>The ſtates to the ſouthward of Pennſylvania poſſeſs immenſe reſources for political happineſs: but while they tolerate negro ſlavery, they can never be an agreeable retreat for an European. This objection applies chiefly to the ſea coaſts of thoſe ſtates; for in the weſtern parts of them, the land is cultivated chiefly by freemen. The ſoil and climate of the extenſive weſtern country of thoſe ſtates is kind and mild to a very great degree. There Europeans may proſper and be happy.</p>
            <p>Thus, ſir, have I complied in a few words with your requeſt. In communicating many of the facts contained in this letter, I have not conſidered you ſimply as a citizen of London, or a ſubject of the crown of Britain. The whole family of mankind, I know are your brethren: and if men be happy, I am ſure it is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of indifference to you whether they enjoy their happineſs on this ſide or on the other ſide of the Atlantic ocean.</p>
            <p>From a review of the facts that have been mentioned, you will perceive that the preſent is the age of reaſon and action in Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca. To our poſterity we muſt bequeath the cultivation of the fine arts and the pleaſures of taſte and ſentiment. The foreigners who have viſited and deſcribed our country, without making allowan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for thoſe peculiarities which ariſe from our preſent ſtate of ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, have done as little honour to their underſtandings, as they have done to human nature. Nor have thoſe Europeans diſcovered more wiſdom, who have blended with the American character, the accidental diſorders, which were the offspring of our late public commotions. They reſembled the ſwelling of the ſea, which ſucceeds a ſtorm. At preſent, they have as perfectly ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as the diſorders produced by the civil wars in England, in the laſt century.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:022390_0014_0FB86DFE9B5803E8"/>
It is ſomewhat remarkable that in every age, great inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and great revolutions in human affairs have taken place in a quick ſucceſſion to each other. The many curious machines for leſſening labour, which have lately been diſcovered in Europe, will neceſſarily throw many thouſand artificers out of employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Perhaps the late ſucceſsful application of the powers of fire and water to mechanical purpoſes in your country, was delayed until the preſent time, only that the ſanctuary of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional government might be perfectly prepared to receive and protect thoſe induſtrious bodies of people, who formerly lived by the labour of their hands, and who might otherwiſe become a burden to the countries in which they had been deprived of the means of ſupporting themſelves. Perhaps, too, the revolutions, which are now going forward in ſeveral of the governments on the continent of Europe, have occurred at the preſent juncture for a purpoſe equally wiſe and benevolent. The firſt effect of the eſtabliſhment of freedom in thoſe countries, will be to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote population, by reducing taxes, diſbanding ſtanding armies, and aboliſhing the vows and practices of celibacy: for I take it for granted that military inſtitutions in the time of peace, and monaſtaries of all kinds, muſt yield to the preſent force and cultivated ſtate of human reaſon, in thoſe countries, which are now the theatres of revolutions in favour of liberty. This increaſe of population will require an increaſe of territory, which muſt be ſought for in the united ſtates: for it is not probable that men who have once taſted of the ſweets of liberty, will ever think of tranſporting themſelves to any other country. This outlet for ſupernumerary inhabitants from the nations of Europe, will eventually promote their intereſts and proſperity: for when a country is ſo much crouded with people, that the price of the means of ſubſiſtence is beyond the ratio of their induſtry, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages are reſtrained: but when emigration to a certain degree takes place, the balance between the means of ſubſiſtence and induſtry is reſtored, and population thereby revived. Of the truth of this principle there are many proofs in the old coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of all the American ſtates. Population has conſtantly been advanced in them by the migration of their inhabitants to new or diſtant ſettlements.</p>
            <p>In ſpite of all the little ſyſtems of narrow politicians, it is an eternal truth, that univerſal happineſs is univerſal intereſt. The divine government of our world would admit of a controverſy,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:022390_0015_0FB86E01CC645148"/>

            <p>I ſhall conclude this long letter by the two following re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks:</p>
            <p>I. If freedom, joined with the facility of acquiring the means of ſubſiſtence, have ſuch an influence upon population—and if exiſtence be a title to happineſs—then think, ſir, what an ocean of additional happineſs will be created, by the influence which migration to the free and extenſive territories of the united ſtates will have, upon the numbers of mankind.</p>
            <p>II. If wars have been promoted in all ages and countries, by an over proportion of inhabitants to the means of eaſy ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, then think, ſir, what an influence upon the means of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting human life, migration to America, and the immenſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the productions of the earth, by the late improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in agriculture, will probably have, in leſſening the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and reſources of nations to carry on war. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of heaven are often accompliſhed by means in which there is no departure from the common operations of nature. If the events, which have been alluded to, ſhould contribute in any degree to put an end o<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
