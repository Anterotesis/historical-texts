            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Senſe of the great Evil of Sin, is eſſential to true Repentance. It may be laid down as a general <hi>Maxim,</hi> that "we cannot be ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably affected towards Things, unleſs we ſee them as they are." Be they, on the one Hand, ever ſo amiable and lovely, yet if their Beauty is not ſeen, our Hearts will be untouch'd. Even the infinite Glory and Excellence of GOD will not excite our Eſteem and Love, if we have no Senſe of it: And let the moral Beauty of the divine Government be ever ſo great, altho' it may raviſh the heavenly World, who ſee it, yet we, while blind to it, ſhall be wholly unmoved: And be the Goſpel-way of Salvation, by free Grace thro' <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ever ſo glorious, yet if the Glories of it are not diſcern'd, we may be far from admiring that divine Conſtitution.— So, on the other Hand, let <hi>Sin</hi> be ever ſo great an Evil, yet if the great Evil of it is not ſeen, we ſhall never be ſuitably affected towards it. Tho' it deſerves to be hated ever ſo much, and tho' there be ever ſo great Reaſon that we ſhould be humbled and abaſed before God on the Account of it, and mourn in the Bitterneſs of our Hearts for it, and be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of, and watch againſt it, as the greateſt of Evils;
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:006963_0004_102AD2FE8B3AB1E0"/>yet we ſhall not, unleſs it be ſeen as it is. Did we ſee it perfectly as it is, we ſhould feel towards it perfectly as we ought: But unleſs we ſee it in ſome Meaſure as it is, we ſhall feel towards it in no Meaſure as we ought.—So that a Senſe of the great Evil of Sin is plainly eſſential to true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.—And, indeed, it is that, from which Repentance does nextly and moſt immediately take its Riſe. Love to God, Faith in Chriſt, and Hope in the Mercy of God thro' Him, prepare and diſpoſe the Heart to mourn for Sin: But it's a Senſe of the great Evil of Sin, which immediately affects the Heart with Sorrow, and humbles and abaſes the Soul before the Lord.—<hi>My Sin is ever before me— Againſt Thee have I ſinned—Thou art juſt, when thou ſpeakeſt—Have Mercy upon me, O God.</hi> So alſo St. <hi>Paul,—The Law is ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual—I am carnal, ſold under Sin—Oh, wretched Man that I am, who ſhall deliver me!</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. vii. 14, 24.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Now,</p>
            <p>The Evil of Sin ariſes from our Obligations to do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. And the more ſtrongly we are obliged to do our Duty, the more wicked is it in us to neglect it, or go contrary to it,—and the more are we to blame,—and the greater Cauſe have we to be ſorry and penitent.</p>
            <p>We may be under various Kinds of Obligations to the Practice of Virtue. The Honour and Authority of God may oblige us—The Welfare of our Fellow-Creatures may oblige us—and our own preſent and future Happineſs may oblige us too: and therefore we may be to blame, and have Cauſe of Repentance, on ſeveral Accounts; and that, for the Evil contained in one particular Action, viewed in various Reſpects, as it is— againſt God—our Fellow-Men—or our own Intereſt, for this World and the next.—And as is our Senſe of theſe Things, ſo ſhall we be affected; i. e. we ſhall be ſorry and blame our ſelves accordingly.</p>
            <p>For let our Obligations be ever ſo great; yet, if they are not ſeen, we ſhall not feel our ſelves obliged, or look upon our ſelves to blame, when we do wrong. And if ever we
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:006963_0005_102AD300113D48C8"/>do blame our ſelves at all, it will be only as we have gone contrary to ſuch Obligations as we are <hi>ſenſible</hi> of. Altho' we may be to blame, in other Reſpects; yet we ſhall not blame our ſelves. If we be to blame, for inſtance, for go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contrary to the Honour and Authority of God; yet we ſhall not be diſpoſed to blame our ſelves on that Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, unleſs we are ſenſible, how that the Honour and Authority of God did oblige us. If we are ſorry for what we have done, at any Time, it will be only on ſuch Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, on which, we ſee, we have done Wrong; and for ſuch Reaſons, for which, we ſee, we ought to have done otherwiſe.—Thus, if we ſee our great Obligations to all Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and Righteouſneſs, ariſing from the Nature of God, and the Reaſonableneſs of his Government, Sin will, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, appear as an infinite Evil. But if we ſee our ſelves under no Obligations to God, but <hi>merely</hi> in Way of Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude for the Kindneſſes we have received, we ſhall feel to blame for our Sins, <hi>only</hi> as they are Inſtances of Ingratitude. And in a Word, in what Reſpects ſoever, we ſee our ſelves obliged to do right, in thoſe Reſpects we ſhall feel ourſelves to blame when we do wrong; and that, in exact Proportion to the Weight, with which, a Senſe of our Obligations lies on our Spirits.</p>
            <p>Hence,</p>
            <p>Perſons of an <hi>Epicurean</hi> and Atheiſtical Temper, who ſee themſelves under no Obligations to Virtue, but merely from preſent Self-Intereſt, as a virtuous Conduct tends to their preſent Eaſe, Profit &amp; Honour; if they neglect their Duty, and do wrong, they will blame themſelves, and be ſorry, only becauſe they have hurt themſelves, and gone contrary to their own Intereſt for this World.—But if Perſons have ſome belief of a future State, and of the Rewards and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments of another Life; they may be ſorry for their Sins, becauſe by them they have forfeited Heaven, and expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed themſelves to Hell.—Or if they are under the Influence of a compaſſionate Temper, or of natural Affection, and have injured a Neighbour, a Friend, or near Relative; Nature may prompt them, on that Account, to be ſorry.—Or, if they
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:006963_0006_102AD3025BEF17B0"/>firmly believe, that God loves them, that Chriſt died for them, and that they are made Heirs of eternal Glory; and ſee, that by their Sins, they have been guilty of great Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude towards their almighty Benefactor; they may, merely, from natural Gratitude, be ſorry on that Account.—But if the great Evil of Sin, as it is AGAINST A GOD OF INFINITE GLORY, be not ſeen; they will not mourn for Sin on that Account. And yet if that which conſtitutes the great Evil of Sin, is not ſeen; and Sin is not hated and mourned for, upon the Account of that, which is it's chief and principal Malignity, our Repentance is not genuine. It is of Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance therefore, that we know wherein the great Evil of Sin does really conſiſt.—For which Purpoſe, let us attend to the Words of our Text, which contains the Confeſſion of a true Penitent, and exhibits the Sentiments of a contrite Heart. <hi>Againſt Thee, Thee only, have I ſinned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where <hi>obſerve</hi> (1.) The particular Sins referred unto in theſe Words, viz. <hi>Murder</hi> and <hi>Adultery.</hi> For this <hi>Pſalm</hi> was compoſed after that <hi>Nathan</hi> the <hi>Prophet</hi> came to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> and reproved him, and denounced the Judgments of God againſt him for thoſe Sins. And in this <hi>Pſalm</hi> he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly refers to the Sin of <hi>Murder,</hi> which he had been guilty of. v. 14. <hi>Deliver me from Blood-guiltineſs, O God!</hi> And 'tis ſuppoſed, he has Reference to his other Sin, in thoſe Words, v. 10. <hi>Create in me a</hi> CLEAN <hi>Heart, O God!</hi>—Now it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly and juſtly obſerved, that ſome Sins are immediately committed againſt GOD, ſuch as, <hi>Blaſphemy, Idolatry</hi> &amp;c. while other Sins immediately reſpect our Neighbour, and are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to him, as was <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>Murder</hi> and <hi>Adultery.</hi>—And yet, it ſeems, if we injure our Neighbour, God is ſinned againſt, and we are to blame principally on that Account.—</p>
            <p>For <hi>obſerve</hi> (2.) The great Evil of <hi>David</hi>'s Sins, as ſet forth in his Confeſſion, and that which made them ſo exceeding hainous, was, that they were <hi>committed againſt God.—Againſt Thee, Thee only</hi> (Thee chiefly and principally) <hi>have I ſinned.</hi> He had injured <hi>Uriah,</hi> and done wrong on that Account: he had expoſed himſelf to Reproach among his Subjects, and to Anguiſh in his own Heart, and was to blame for
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:006963_0007_102AD303E4963218"/>bringing ſo great a Calamity on himſelf.—But the Greatneſs of his Sin conſiſted in its being <hi>againſt God.</hi> And this ſeems to ſwallow up all his Heart, and to overwhelm him with Sorrow. <hi>Againſt thee, thee only, have I ſinned.</hi> And on this Account, his Sin appeared ſo great to him, that he was ready to juſtify God, in the dreadful Sentence which God denounced againſt him, by <hi>Nathan</hi> the <hi>Prophet:</hi> That his <hi>Wives ſhould be defiled in the Sight of the Sun,</hi> the <hi>Sword never depart from his Houſe,</hi> and that his <hi>Child ſhould die.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Sam. xii.</note> 
               <hi>Thou art juſt when thou ſpeakest, and clear when thou judgest.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Pſal. 51.4.</note> God had ſent <hi>Nathan</hi> to charge home his Sin and Guilt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and to tell him, that by what he had done, he had <hi>deſpiſed the Lord,</hi> and <hi>deſpiſed the Commandment of the Lord,</hi> and given Occaſion to the <hi>Enemies of God to blaſpheme</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">2 Sam. xii. 9, 10, 14.</note> — He had <hi>deſpiſed the LORD,</hi> and <hi>deſpiſed the Commandment of the LORD;</hi> for God had ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt not Kill, Thou ſhalt not commit Adultery;</hi> for <hi>I am the LORD.</hi> But <hi>David</hi> had practically ſaid,
<q>I will commit Adultery with <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> and gratify my Luſt, for all that God ſays: and I will murder her innocent Huſband <hi>Uriah,</hi> that I may hide my Sin and Shame by this wicked Means, notwithſtanding the divine Prohibition. I don't care for God, nor his Law, or Authority, ſo much, but that I will go thro' with my Deſigns, and that, let come what will; for I value my Luſt more than God, and my Reputation more than his Honour; and therefore neither God, nor his Law, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority or Honour will I regard.</q> This was the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of <hi>David</hi>'s Conduct! And this is the Language of every Sin!—And thus he deſpiſed the <hi>Commandment</hi> of God, and deſpiſed <hi>God himſelf.</hi> And this was, with good Reaſon, charged home upon him, as the great Evil of his Sin; and for which God would ſeverely puniſh him. And in a Senſe of this, with a broken Heart, he cries out, <hi>Againſt thee, thee only, have I ſinned, and done this Evil in thy Sight: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou art juſt when thou ſpeakeſt, and clear when thou judgeſt.</hi>—And thus we ſee wherein the <hi>great Evil</hi> of <hi>David</hi>'s Sins did conſiſt, both in the Sight of God, and to his own
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:006963_0008_102AD30575860AA8"/>Senſe and Apprehenſion after he was become a ſincere Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent. And becauſe every Sin is as really committed againſt God, as thoſe were; and ſo, what was true, in this Caſe, will hold true, in all other Caſes: Therefore from the Words, we may make this <hi>Doctrinal Obſervation,</hi> viz.</p>

               </p>
               <p>And here,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Sin <hi>is contrary to the</hi> Nature <hi>of God.</hi>—A ſinful Nature and a holy Nature are in direct Oppoſition; they are a <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Contrariety</hi> to each other. <hi>The carnal Mind is Enmity against God.</hi>
                  <note n="‖" place="bottom">Rom. viii. 7.</note> And Sin is <hi>that abominable Thing which God's Soul abbors.</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Jer. xliv. 4.</note> The <hi>holy one of Irael</hi> is a Being of infinite Underſtanding, and of perfect Rectitude; and has a compleat and comprehenſive View of all Things; and in all Caſes ſees what is right &amp; ſit &amp; beautiful to be done—how the DEITY ſhould be loved and honoured in the World which he has made—and how his Creatures and Subjects ſhould live to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in mutual Love and Benevolence, and not an unjuſt or cruel Act be ever done thro' out all his Dominions. And as God ſees what is right and fit and beautiful, and what is contrary; ſo he is accordingly affected towards Things. <hi>He loves Righteouſneſs, and hates Iniquity.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal. xiv. 7.</note> — Let God be eſteemed, reverenced, honoured and obeyed—Let Love and Good-will prevail and be eſtabliſhed among his Subjects— Let every Thing of a contrary Savour be eternally baniſh'd his Dominions; and God will be well pleaſed: But if any Diſhonour is done to the DEITY, or Injury to our Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Subjects, nothing can diſpleaſe him more: for there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing he hates like Sin: It is <hi>the abominable Thing which his Soul hates.</hi> Sin is more odious and deteſtable to him, than the moſt abominable Thing on Earth is to us. His Averſion to it is vehement beyond the Conception of any finite Mind.
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:006963_0010_102AD30BD3F64678"/>His Averſion to it is abſolutely infinite.—In this Reſpect therefore Sin is againſt God. It is a going directly contrary to his Nature; and that in the moſt tender Point; in a Thing which comes neareſt his Heart. Nothing is ſo croſs to him, nothing can diſoblige him ſo much, or diſpleaſe him, or grieve his Heart, like this.—As when a Man's Wife de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts from him, and commits Whoredom with another Man, and breaks his Heart by her ill Carriage: So, ſays God, <hi>I am broken with their whoriſh Heart.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Ezek. vi. 9. <hi>I am broken with their whoriſh Heart.</hi> From the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-Relation between God and his People <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they are ſaid to be <hi>married unto him,</hi> Jer. iii. 14. and hence, their going from God to Idols is called <hi>Whoredom.</hi> And to prefer an Idol before the true God was a very <hi>provoking</hi> thing: Therefore he ſays, <hi>I am broken with their who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh Heart.</hi> But to prefer a vile Luſt before God ſeems to be in like Manner provoking: it is a Kind of ſpiritual Idolatry. And yet, this is done in every Act of Sin. No Sin can be committed, but God is <hi>grieved.</hi> Eph. iv. 30.</note> And therefore, ſays he, to his beloved People, <hi>It ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but WALK CONTRARY unto me; then,</hi> ſuch a Conduct would be ſo intolerably provoking, I will not, I cannot bear it, but <hi>I will WALK CONTRARY unto you alſo in FURY.</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Lev. x.vi. 27, 28.</note> But a ſinful Conduct is called a <hi>walking con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to God,</hi> in Scripture, not only becauſe it is thus in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Contrariety to the divine Nature: but alſo becauſe</p>
               <p n="2">2. Sin <hi>is againſt the</hi> Law, Authority <hi>and</hi> Government <hi>of Almighty GOD</hi> — For, as God hates Sin with an infinite hatred; ſo he has with the utmoſt Engagedneſs forbidden it: ſaying, <hi>Curſed is every one, that continues not in ALL Things written in the Book of the Law, to do them.</hi>
                  <note n="‖" place="bottom">Gal. iii 10.</note>—As Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the World He ſets up himſelf againſt Sin; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding it with <hi>all his Authority,</hi> and ſtanding ready to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh it with <hi>all his Power:</hi> and it is even one main End of his univerſal Government, to diſcountenance and ſuppreſs it, throughout all his Dominions.</p>
               <p>No doubt, Almighty GOD has Right to govern the World: for originally He is abſolute LORD of it; and by
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:006963_0011_102AD30D69C1B280"/>NATURE he is GOD MOST HIGH: and his GOD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HEAD and his LORDSHIP give him an undoubted Right of Government. And accordingly He has taken the Throne, ſet Himſelf up at the Head of the Univerſe, and undertaken the Government of all Things, and eſpecially of the whole Syſtem of Intelligences.—And,</p>
               <p>No doubt, his Government is WORTHY to be univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally ſubmitted unto: for it is all perfect and glorious. His Laws and his Diſpenſations are perfect in Wiſdom, Recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and Goodneſs: and even as He himſelf is infinitely worthy of all Love and Veneration, ſo that his very Being affords infinite Ground of Joy among his Creatures; even ſo his Government is juſt like himſelf, and exhibits his very Image, and is WORTHY univerſally to be rejoyced in. As it is written, <hi>The Lord reigneth; let the Earth rejoyce.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal. xcvii. 1.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore it is the <hi>fitteſt</hi> and <hi>happieſt</hi> Thing in the World, to be, and do, juſt what he requires: And in his Favour, and under the Protection of his almighty Arm, there muſt be the moſt abſolute Safety and Security.—So that it might reaſonably have been expected, that all his Subjects, thro'out all his Dominions, would join to ſay, LET GOD REIGN FOR EVER; and that they would all, with one Heart, have exulted at the Thought of being in Subjection to ſuch a KING.</p>
               <p>But the Sinner comes in, and diſſents from his whole Conſtitution, and that both in Heart and Life.
<q>As for his Law, ſays he,
I do not like it, and will not obey it. As for his Authority, I do not own it, and will not regard it. As for his univerſal Government and glorious Kingdom, it is not to my Mind—I revolt—I will not have him <hi>to reign over me.</hi>
                     <note n="‖" place="bottom">Luk. xix. 14.</note> I can preſcribe better Rules to live by. I will not be dependent on him, nor in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to him.</q> Thus the Sinner revolts from his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, caſts off his Authority, breaks his Law, and in the Language of <hi>Scripture, rebels againſt the Lord.</hi> For, in <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> THIS is always conſidered as GOD's WORLD, He
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:006963_0012_102AD35A730A7B88"/>our rightful LORD and KING; and all our Duty is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined, and all Sin is forbidden, by his AUTHORITY; and therefore every Act of Sin is conſidered as an Act of <hi>Rebellion againſt the Lord,</hi> and Sinners have the Character of <hi>Rebels.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Deut. ix. 24. Ezek. xx. 8. 13, 21.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Now, in as much as God ſtands ready, at the Head of the Univerſe, to employ his infinite Wiſdom &amp; almighty Power, to diſcountenance all Rebellions, and ſuppreſs and cruſh all obſtinate Rebels, and maintain good Government thro'out his Dominions; ſo that, Things being thus, there is no Way for the obſtinate Rebel to eſcape an eternal Overthrow, and everlaſting Shame and Contempt: it is therefore in his Heart, to wiſh the ALMIGHTY dethroned, his whole Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment overturned, and the Sword of Juſtice wreſted from Him. And had he ſufficient Power on his Side, the latent Temper of his Heart would ſoon form into the terrible Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution; nor would he delay venturing on the dreadful Attempt.—Thus, Sin is againſt the Law, Authority, and univerſal Government of Almighty GOD. Hence, God eſteems the Sinner as his <hi>Enemy:</hi> and accordingly, Sinners are called <hi>Enemies to God,</hi> in <hi>Scripture.</hi>
                  <note n="‖" place="bottom">Rom. v. 10. Col. i. 21.</note> And are ſaid to be even <hi>Enmity againſt him.</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. viii. <hi>7. The carnal Mind is Enmity againſt God. N. B.</hi> The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> means here to give the Character of <hi>every Chriſtleſs Sinner.</hi>— For to be <hi>carnally minded</hi> and to be <hi>in the Fleſh,</hi> is one and the ſame Thing, in the Language of the <hi>Apoſtle;</hi> as is evident from <hi>ver.</hi> 8. But he looks upon all as <hi>being in the Fleſh,</hi> who <hi>have not the Spirit of Chriſt dwelling</hi> in them; as is plain from <hi>ver.</hi> 9. And thoſe who <hi>have not the Spirit of Chriſt, are none of his,</hi> ver. 9. Every Chriſtleſs Sinner is therefore <hi>in the Fleſh,</hi> and at <hi>Enmity againſt God.</hi> This is the Doctrine of St. <hi>Paul.</hi> And juſt thus God looks upon every unregenerate Sinner; however they look upon themſelves. — And no wonder; for let Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects conduct ſo towards an earthly <hi>Prince,</hi> as all unregenerate Sinners do towards God, and their <hi>Prince</hi> would look upon them as <hi>Enemies:</hi> Read <hi>Luk.</hi> xix. 14, 27.</note> 
                  <hi>And they are not,</hi> ſays the <hi>Apostle, ſubject to the divine Law, neither indeed can be.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this leads me to add, that</p>
               <p n="3">3. Sin <hi>is againſt the</hi> Being <hi>of God.</hi>—For, ſince God is at the Head of the Univerſe (as was before ſaid) and unchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geably determined to maintain good Government through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:006963_0013_102AD35CB8F67D30"/>all his Dominions, and poſſeſſed of an almighty, irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Power; there is no hope, that the obſtinate Rebel ſhould eſcape Puniſhment, <hi>ſo long as God lives:</hi> for ſo long as God lives, God will reign: and ſo long as God reigns ſupreme, obſtinate Rebels cannot eſcape: for God's Determination to puniſh Sin is immutable as his very Being: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if God lives, the impenitent Sinner muſt die.—But thoſe, who are Enemies to God, had rather there ſhould be <hi>no God,</hi> than that themſelves ſhould be puniſhed.</p>
               <p>When once a Creature has become ſo vile and impious, as to revolt from the Government of the MOST HIGH, and begin Rebellion, and enter the Liſts againſt the ALMIGH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TY; if left to himſelf, without any Reſtraint, or hope of Mercy, (and we know, God was not obliged, to open a Door of Hope, to any Rebel in his Dominions,) and if armed with ſufficient Power to bear down all before Him; we may eaſily gueſs, to what Length he would carry Things. The ſame Diſpoſition, which moved him to begin Rebellion, would naturally excite him to go on. By his firſt Act of Rebellion his Life and Soul are for ever fórfeited, according to Law, and might juſtly have remained ſo. To repent, and undo what he had done, and humble himſelf, and ſue for Mercy, is what a Sinner, in ſuch a Caſe, would never do. And as to the threatned Puniſhment, he could never think of bearing that. He would venture upon the boldeſt and the moſt DREADFUL Deeds, but that he would carry his Point: Deeds, almoſt too dreadful to think of, and hardly fit to hint at.—<hi>Whoſoever hateth his Brother, is a Murderer,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Joh. iii. 15.</note> as it is written; and would therefore murder his Brother, if left to his own Heart, without any Reſtraint, and having ſufficient Ability and Opportunity in his Hands: What then would the Wretch do, who hates his Maker, is an Enemy to his God, and even Enmity againſt him!— We ſee how a guilty World has treated the <hi>SON of God</hi>—We ſee how they have treated the <hi>Prophets,</hi> &amp; <hi>Apostles.</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Mat. xxi. 33—39. Mat. xxiii. 29—37.</note> And we may eaſily gueſs what dreadful Work there would be, were the Sinner an over-match for OMNIPOTENCY. Such is the inexpreſſible Malignity of Sin.</p>

4. Sin <hi>is againſt the</hi> Honour <hi>of God.</hi> 'Tis even a deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Lord, and a treating the MOST HIGH with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.—All his <hi>Perfections</hi> are deſpiſed; and conſider'd as our <hi>Creator, Preſerver, Governour, Redeemer,</hi> and the <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> of <hi>all Good,</hi> he is deſpiſed by Sin.</p>
               <p>Hear the contemptuous Language of the Sinner's Conduct.— "God ſees you, O Sinner! and will you dare to tranſgreſs?" <hi>Yes, his all-ſeeing Eye ſhall not terrify me</hi>—<q>God is near at Hand! you are in his very Preſence! O Sinner, will you venture to offend?</q>

                  <hi>Yes, I will do as I pleaſe, let him do his worſt.</hi>—<q>But remember, he is of purer Eyes than to behold Iniquity! Oh, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do not that abominable Thing, which his Soul hates!</q> 
                  <hi>I care not what he loves, nor what he hates: I will pleaſe my ſelf, let him take it as he will.</hi>—<q>But conſider, he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably determin'd to render to every one according to their Deeds, to him that doth Evil, Tribulation and Wrath! and who can ſtand before him, when once he is angry! for our God is a conſuming Fire! Therefore, O Sinner, forbear.</q> 
                  <hi>No, I'll not be reſtrained: I'll gratify my Luſts, at all Adventures. For I regard not his Threats.</hi>—
<q>But he is a Being of infinite Goodneſs and Mercy, Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Forbearance; and this ſhould lead you to a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Mind, O Sinner!</q> 
                  <hi>No, no, I deſpiſe his Goodneſs,
Long-ſuffering and Forbearance; and I can be hard-hearted enough to go on, in ſpite of all his tender Mercies.</hi>— <q>But, O Sinner, infinite Wiſdom pronounces, that this your Way is your Folly! and cries, Turn, O Turn at my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof! leſt otherwiſe, ere long, I laugh at your Calamity, and mock when your Fear comes! and will you not be dictated by the infinitely wiſe God?</q>—<hi>No, no, I know what is beſt for my ſelf, and that better than be does; and I chuſe to be my own Director, and to walk in my own Ways."</hi> 
                  <q>But is he not the God that made you? Have not his
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:006963_0015_102AD360B6816A38"/>Hands formed you? Are you then your own? Are you not the Lord's? And ought you not therefore to be for him?</q> 
                  <hi>I renounce the God that made me: I diſown his Right to me: I will not be for him, but for my ſelf; for I will pleaſe my ſelf, altho' he is grieved.</hi>—<q>But conſider, He has nouriſhed and bro't you up tenderly, as his own Child; &amp; fed &amp; cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you all your Life long! and will you be more ſottiſh than the Ox and the Aſs?</q> 
                  <hi>Yes, Yes, after all, I will rebel againſt Him.</hi>—<q>But how can you anſwer it? for He is your ſovereign LORD and KING, you are under his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, bound by his Law, and accountable at his Tribunal: and you know what Threatnings he has given out. And now, if you have any Regard for him, in any Reſpect, how dare you go on?</q> 
                  <hi>Theſe Things move me not. I will walk in the Ways of my own Heart: nor will I be controuled. I know not the Lord, nor will I obey him. And in the midſt of all his Thunders, I can be at Eaſe in Zion, and chant to the ſound of the Viol.</hi>—<q>But if you go on thus to deſpiſe the Lord, and to deſpiſe his Law, Authority &amp; Government; what will be your End, O Sinner! will not his Wrath wax hot, and ſmoke againſt you, &amp; conſume you? Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, therefore, how that after all this Wickedneſs he offers to be reconciled thro' Jeſus Chriſt; and invites you to Repentance! TURN YE, TURN YE, WHY WILL YE DIE! and offers to be your God, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Portion. And now, what Anſwer do you make, O Sinner!</q> 
                  <hi>Why, look on us, and obſerve our Conduct, and you and all the World may ſee, that we make light of it, and go our Ways, one to his Farm, and another to his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize: whereby we plainly declare, that we deſpiſe the Grace of the Goſpel, and had rather have the World for our Portion than God himſelf.</hi>—Thus God, in every Point of Light, is diſeſteemed, diſreſpected, deſpiſed, and even treated with Contempt in the common Conduct of the Sinner.</p>
               <p>Any vile Luſt is preferred before all the Fulneſs of God. Thoſe Things and Ways which pleaſe the Devil, God's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate Enemy, and the moſt malicious and hateful Being in the Univerſe, are choſen, before thoſe Things and Ways
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:006963_0016_102AD3630FEE2FA0"/>which pleaſe <hi>Jehovah,</hi> the greateſt and beſt of Beings. His Authority is trampled on, at whoſe Preſence the Mountains melt and the Earth trembles. A Worm of the Duſt ſets up himſelf above the moſt high GOD, and his Will above God's, and his Intereſt above God's Glory. If God offers Heaven, Sin deſpiſes it: if he threatens Hell, Sin diſregards it: If he pleads the dying Love of his SON, and the Riches of his Grace, and beſeeches the Sinner to be reconciled, Sin ſlights it all: or if he commands Men to do their Duty to one another, Sin regards it not: and that notwithſtanding his Right to us as his Creatures, and Authority over us as his Subjects, and our Obligations to him as the LORD OUR GOD. And thus the MOST HIGH is by Worms of the Duſt treated with Diſreſpect and Contempt, and that to his Face, and in the Sight of the Sun, in his own World, before his Creatures, before his Friends &amp; Enemies; tending to bring a public Odium upon him &amp; his Ways, and to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and encourage Rebellion throughout all his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſink him and his Government into univerſal Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit, and bring an everlaſting Reproach upon his great Name: Thus Sin is againſt the <hi>Honour</hi> of God—And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this View of Things, may it not, in the</p>

               <p>To look down from Heaven, the Throne of his Holineſs and Glory, upon this World, which he has made for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and ſurvey all Mankind, by Nature his Creatures, by Right his Subjects. deſigned to ſhew forth his Praiſe; and behold and ſee how they are revolted from his Government, turned Enemies to his Majeſty, and combined together in Rebellion againſt his Crown and Dignity.—They are ſet in a Way which is not good, a Way moſt contrary to his Heart, full of Impiety towards God, and Injuſtice and Cruelty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards one another.—They diſregard his Laws, trample un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Foot his Authority, deſpiſe his Goodneſs, and bid Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to his Vengeance.— And they are ſo much againſt
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:006963_0017_102AD36554795D10"/>him, that were their Influence and Power ſufficient to carry the Point, they would ſoon take the Field.—The Tendency of their common Conduct is, to dethrone his Majeſty, to overturn his Government of the Univerſe, to bring him into the deepeſt Contempt, and every Thing that is Right and Good into the utmoſt Diſgrace, and to introduce Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, Confuſion and Miſery into his Dominions, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion which ſhould ſpread like a contagious Peſtilence throughout all his Kingdoms, until all his Subjects ſhould revolt, and all join to treat him with Hatred &amp; Contempt, and even wiſh him not to be.</p>
               <p>And if the Sun in the <hi>natural Syſtem</hi> ſhould be extinct, and all the Light turned into Darkneſs, and the whole natural World flung into the utmoſt Confuſion, every Orb diſplaced, every Thing turned upſide down, it would not repreſent half ſo dreadful and diſtreſſing a Scene; as would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately be opened to View, could Sin, without Controul, and with Power irreſiſtible, bear down all Good and Right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, and riſe up to all to that Height of Wickedneſs and Ruin, to which it naturally tends.— And would not ſuch a moral Syſtem of Intelligences exhibit to view a Sight infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely diſtreſſing to ſuch a Being as God is, were it beyond his Power and Wiſdom ever to regulate Things? But to ſuch a Paſs Sin tends to bring the moral World.</p>
               <p>So far as we are able to conceive, it ſeems eſſential to every intelligent Being, to be liable to mental Pain and Diſtreſs, when they are croſſed in the moſt tender Point; when their Nature and Will, Intereſt and Honour, and every Thing that is dear to them, is counteracted and deſpiſed, and, as it were, trampled under Foot: and they in the mean Time unable ever to regulate Things.—So it is evidently with Mankind; with bad and good.— <hi>Ahab</hi> took to his Bed, and refuſed to eat; becauſe <hi>Naboth</hi> denied him his <hi>Vineyard.</hi>

               <p>Not that we are to ſuppoſe, that He, who is <hi>over all God bleſſed for ever,</hi> is indeed really pained and diſtreſſed at the Sight of the ſhocking Conduct of his rebellious Creatures. For, altho' he nas a full comprehenſive View of the whole of it; yet, at the ſame Time, he as plainly foreſees to what a Reſult and Iſſue all Things will finally be brought, by his infinite Wiſdom and almighty Power: whereby his Authority and Government will be but the more eſtabliſhed throughout all his Dominions, and his Name and his Law but the more revered. And altho' a Number of obſtinate rebels will be eternally miſerable, under the Puniſhment they juſtly deſerve; yet, in the whole, God will be more glorious, and perhaps the Syſtem more happy too, than if Sin had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:006963_0019_102AD36968093CB0"/>been permitted, and Miſery had been for ever unknown. Such Power and Authority has he over all Things to order and over-rule, and ſuch is his Wiſdom, and ſuch his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Juſtice and Goodneſs, that he both knows he can, and knows he will, finally bring Good out of Evil, Light out of Darkneſs, Order out of Diſorder, and Holineſs, Harmony and Peace, out of all the Sin, Confuſion and Uproar; and all that has happened ſhall, thro' a long Eternity, ſerve as a Means, in the Sight of all Worlds, to eſtabliſh his Throne, confirm his Government, make his Law honourable, his Juſtice appear tremendous, his Grace glorious, and Sin an exceeding great and dreadful Evil. Therefore he enjoys a perfect Tranquility and an undiſturbed Felicity, altho' a World of Wickedneſs lies open to his View, and Millions of Things are tranſacted, which have a natural tendency to <hi>grieve</hi> him (and that not merely <hi>forty Years long,</hi> but from Age to Age ever ſince the World began)—to <hi>weary him</hi>— to <hi>vex his holy Spirit</hi>—to <hi>break his Heart</hi>—to <hi>preſs him as a Cart is preſſed, that is full of Sheaves.</hi>

               <p>But no Thanks to the Sinner, that God is happy. He is no Friend to God's Felicity. His Ways tend to grieve and diſtreſs the HOLY ONE of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and that which is God's Comfort, is a Terror to the Sinner.

And therefore the greater our Obligations are to God, the greater is the Evil of ſinning againſt him. Our Obligations to love, honour &amp; obey God, originally ariſe from his Worthineſs to be loved, honoured and obeyed by us: But he is infinitely worthy to be loved, honoured &amp; obeyed by us: therefore our Obligations to do ſo, are infinite: and ſo, to ſin againſt him muſt be eſteemed an infinite Evil.</p>

                  <pb n="18" facs="unknown:006963_0020_102AD36B00E825B0"/>
But it is quite beyond our Capacity to comprehend the Vileneſs there is in treating God, as the Sinner does; unleſs we could, as he can, comprehend all his <hi>Greatneſs</hi> &amp; <hi>Glory,</hi> and fully ſee all the <hi>Grounds</hi> and <hi>Reaſons</hi> there are for us to Love, Reverence and Obey him, and feel all their binding Force.—God is fully conſcious to himſelf, that he is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely worthy of all Love, Honour and Obedience, for what he is in Himſelf: beſides that he is the Maker and Lord of the Univerſe; the Maintainer &amp; Upholder of the World, and rightful King and Sovereign over all. He is fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious, there is infinite Reaſon for us to rejoyce in him, exult in his Government, and be glad in his Service; and that the contrary Temper and Conduct of his Creatures, is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely unreaſonable and wicked. And altho' we can't com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the <hi>exceeding Vileneſs</hi> of riſing in Rebellion againſt the MOST HIGH; yet we may be eaſily convinced, that it is an infinite Evil. Yea, if we are but really convinced that God is infinitely great and glorious, it will be to us ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evident, that he is infinitely worthy of all Love, Honour and Obedience: and that, conſequently, to diſeſteem, deſpiſe and diſobey him, is infinitely vile. — 'Tis low and mean Thoughts of God, which cauſes ſecure Sinners to be inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the great Evil of Sin.— Thoſe <hi>Hereticks</hi> who deny the infinite Evil of Sin, do but, by the Means, proclaim to the World their Ignorance of the DEITY.—Had not God known Sin to be an infinite Evil, he would never have threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned an infinite Puniſhment; even, the eternal Pains of Hell, where <hi>the Worm ſhall never die,</hi> and the <hi>Fire ſhall never be quenched.</hi>

<note n="‡" place="bottom">Gal. iii. 10.</note> nor will it any more, throughout eternal Ages, at all be doubted, whether Sin be an infinite Evil.</p>
               <p>And thus we have taken a brief and general View, of the Evil of Sin, as it is againſt God.—We might indeed here enter into a great variety of Particulars, and largely ſhew, how Sin, as it is againſt God, is aggravated on many Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts; not only conſidering merely what he is in himſelf, but the <hi>Relations</hi> he ſtands in to us, and we to him, our <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance</hi> on him, his <hi>Right</hi> to us, his <hi>Authority</hi> over us, the <hi>greatneſs of redeeming Love,</hi> the <hi>freeneſs of Goſpel-Grace,</hi> &amp;c. And it might be diſtinctly conſidered, how amazingly vile it is, for ſuch as we be, to treat ſuch a one as God is, in ſuch Sort, under ſuch Circumſtances, and notwithſtanding ſuch additional Bonds and Obligations lying upon us.—But I muſt omit this, and paſs on</p>

III. To prove, that <hi>the GREAT EVIL of Sin conſiſts in THIS, that it is againſt GOD.</hi>—And this may eaſily appear.— For a few Words may ſoon make it evident, that, altho' Sin may really be a very great Evil, as it is injurious to our Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Men, or to our Selves; yet it is not ſo aggravated and heinous, by infinite <hi>Odds,</hi> in theſe Reſpects, as on Account of its being againſt GOD.—To injure our Fellow Creatures, is wrong, very wrong; but what is a Worm of the Duſt, compared to the LIVING GOD? <hi>If one Man ſin againſt another, the Judge ſhall judge him;</hi> (and ſome Recompence may be made,) <hi>but if a Man ſin againſt the Lord, who will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat for him?</hi> (or make any Atonement for his Crime?)
<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Sam. ii. 25.</note> Yea, if by ſome Act of Sin we could do the greateſt Injury to the whole Creation; yet what is the whole Creation com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with GOD, the ALMIGHTY CREATOR? It is all but as <hi>a Duſt of the Ballance, or a Drop of the Bucket.</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Iſai. xl. 17.</note> We may ruin <hi>our ſelves</hi> by Sin; we may plunge our ſelves headlong into Deſtruction: but what are we, compared with the GREAT JEHOVAH? <hi>Leſs than nothing and vanity.</hi>
                  <note n="‖" place="bottom">Iſai. xl. 15.</note> And what is a guilty Rebel worth, compared with the MAJESTY of HEAVEN? To riſe up in Rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the GREAT GOD, go contrary to him, affront him, and treat him with Contempt, is evidently the moſt wicked and heinous Thing that poſſibly can be done. For here the GREATEST and BEST of Beings is inſulted: yea, a BEING who is infinitely better than all other Beings put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. This is therefore the greateſt Evil there is in Sin, by infinite Odds.</p>
               <p>And accordingly thus we find the Matter ſtands in Scrip ture-Account. When Men are guilty of ſuch wicked Deeds, as are injurious to Themſelves, or to their Fellow-Creatures, yet by God, the righteous Judge, they are blamed and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for theſe Sins, principally and chiefly, under the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their being committed <hi>againſt the LORD.</hi>—Thus, when the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were diſheartned by the evil Report of the <hi>Spies,</hi> and refuſed to go up againſt the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> and talked of making <hi>Captains,</hi> and <hi>returning</hi> to <hi>Egypt;</hi> altho'
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:006963_0023_102AD3735F258A90"/>this Conduct tended to diſinherit themſelves and their Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> for ever, yet it is not on this Account, chiefly, that they were blamed, and ſo dreadfully puniſhed (Nay, it is not ſo much as once mentioned, to ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate their Crime, or to ſhew the Juſtice of their Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) But it was all becauſe they had <hi>finned againſt the LORD.</hi>—God had ſaid, that he would drive out the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons before them: but they would not believe him. God had commanded them to go up &amp; take Poſſeſſion: but they would not obey him. They did not believe he would be as good as his Word; they were afraid to run ſuch a Venture, as to truſt his Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity; they had rather rebel againſt his Command, return to <hi>Egypt.</hi> Wherefore God is repreſented as being greatly affront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed &amp; provoked, and as <hi>ſwearing in his Wrath,</hi> that <hi>they ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver enter into his Rest.</hi>

                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Numb. xiv. 28, 29.</note> But why was God ſo angry? <hi>Becauſe they had rebelled againſt the Lord,</hi>

                  <hi>would not believe him,</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">ver. 11.</note> nor <hi>bearken to his Voice:</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">ver. 22.</note> i.e. Not becauſe their Conduct was to their own Damage, but becauſe it offered an Affront to God. Altho' it does not appear, that they had acted with a Deſign to affront the ALMIGHTY; but rather from a Principle of Self Preſervation. Juſt as Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners now a-days do, who turn their Backs upon the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly <hi>Canaan,</hi> and luſt after the <hi>Leeks</hi> and <hi>Onions</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the Pleaſures of Sin, not with any Deſign to affront God; but from Self-Love, and to gratify the Deſires of their Hearts, all in purſuit of Happineſs. But yet really in Fact they turn their Backs upon the ALMIGHTY, and deſpiſe his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; and for their offering this Affront to the DEITY, Damnation is threatned; and not ſo much becauſe they go contrary to their own Intereſt.—And ſo again, there is the Inſtance of <hi>David,</hi> who, it is plain, had no Deſign to affront the MOST HIGH: but firſt he meant to gratify his Luſt with <hi>Uriah</hi>'s Wife; &amp; afterwards contrived to ſave his Credit by taking away <hi>Uriah's</hi> Life: yet obſerve his <hi>Charge</hi> and his <hi>Doom</hi> from the Mouth of the Lord— <hi>Becauſe thou hast deſpiſed the Lord, &amp; deſpiſed the Commandment of the Lord, and given the Enemies of the Lord occaſion to blaſpheme;</hi> therefore ſo and ſo will I puniſh you.
<note n="**" place="bottom">2 Sam. 12.</note> Therefore ſays <hi>David</hi> to God, <hi>Against
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:006963_0024_102AD37501CC57A8"/>Thee, Thee only, have I ſinned.</hi>—See alſo that Confeſſion in <hi>Daniel</hi> ix. 9—12. And that large Repreſentation of the Nature of what paſſed between God and his People of old, and the Reaſons and Grounds of the Judgments inflicted upon them, in <hi>Ezek.</hi> xx.throughout.—The Scripture ever ſuppoſes, that all Manner of Sin, of what Kind ſoever, is committed againſt the Lord, who is conſtantly conſidered as GOVERNOUR of the World; and therefore the Sinner is viewed as a <hi>Rebel.</hi>—But to <hi>rebel againſt the Lord,</hi> is to <hi>deſpiſe him,</hi> and to <hi>deſpiſe his Commands,</hi> in Scripture-Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.—But to <hi>deſpiſe GOD MOST HIGH,</hi> is infinitely more vile, than to injure ſuch Worms of the Duſt, as we Mortals; becauſe God is <hi>infinitely greater and better.</hi>

As it is written, <hi>The Fool ſaith in his Heart, There is no God: corrupt are they.</hi> For having no Senſe of God upon their Hearts, or of the Importance of his Honour and Glory; they are prepared to imagine, that the Happineſs of the Creature is of the greateſt Importance of any Thing in Heaven or Earth. As tho' the Creature were better than the Creator—which is to make a God of the Creature—which prepares the Way in their Scheme, to make a Creature of GOD, i. e. of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, who is over all GOD bleſſed for ever,</hi>—who yet, ſay they, is but a mere Creature.—For valuing themſelves ſo high, and GOD ſo low, hence they ſee but little or no Evil in Sin as it is <hi>againſt God:</hi> and ſo feel little or no want of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, or of an Atonement: ſo no need of a GOD, to interpoſe and die in their Behalf: a meer Creature might anſwer all the Ends need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: therefore they are prepared to think <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was no more: and it is not what the <hi>Scripture</hi> ſays, but what ſuits with their own No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which, to them, will appear true, or by them be believed.</note> This therefore is the <hi>great Evil in Sin,</hi> which is reſpected, when <hi>temporal Judgments</hi> are threatned in the <hi>old Teſtament,</hi> and when <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Damnation</hi> is threatened in the NEW: ſo that it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently a Point, every where in the BIBLE, taken for granted, that the great EVIL of Sin conſiſts in its being committed <hi>againſt GOD.</hi>

               <p>REMARK I. <hi>How</hi> different <hi>a Thing is SIN from what an apoſtate rebellious World naturally imagine!</hi>—How blind are we naturally to the infinite Greatneſs, Majeſty and Glory of GOD! How inſenſible of the Honourableneſs of the almighty Lord of Heaven and Earth, and of his Worthineſs to be loved, honoured and obeyed!—If any of our Fellow-Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals deſpiſe, affront or injure us, they touch, as it were, the Apple of our Eye: but God may be abuſed, and we take little or no Notice of it. A thouſand Times Men break his Laws, and a thouſand Times they deſpiſe &amp; affront him by their ſinful Doings; while they are poſſeſſed of ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious Degree of Stupidity, as not to paſs a ſingle Tho't upon it. And ſhould any charge them with <hi>deſpiſing the Lord,</hi> there are many would be ready to ſay (with thoſe <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.6.) <hi>Wherein have we deſpiſed him?</hi>
                  <q>You deſpiſe God in your Cloſets, in your Family Worſhip, in your publick Worſhip, and at the Lord's Table: and yet, O ſecure Sinner, will you ſtill ſay, <hi>Wherein do I deſpiſe him?</hi> You give your choiceſt Affections to Idols, and offer <hi>the Blind and the Sick to the Lord:</hi> yea, a <hi>blind</hi> and a <hi>dead</hi> Heart.—Is it not burdenſome to maintain ſecret Prayer? and more tedious to ſpend an Hour alone with God, than a whole Day with vain Company? And is not this to deſpiſe the Lord? Offer ſuch Treatment to your Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions? Let them ſee that you are weary of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; even then, when you are waiting upon them with
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:006963_0026_102AD37B5DA69380"/>Pretences of the greateſt Reſpect: and will they accept it at your Hands? or be pleaſed with your Conduct? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, you are continually deſpiſing God in your daily Courſe, by a Diſpoſition to take greater Delight in the Things of the World, and in the Way of Sin, than in the ever bleſſed God: and by a Diſpoſition to love your ſelf more than Him; and be more concerned for your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Intereſt in the World, than for God's Glory, and the Intereſt of his SON's Kingdom.—And you deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe the Lord, and deſpiſe the Commandments of the Lord, in every of your Thoughts, Words and Actions, that are in any Meaſure injurious to your Fellow-Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</q>—But ſuch is the Sottiſhneſs of a ſecure Sinner, that he ſcarce paſſes a ſingle Thought upon it, for Days and Weeks and Months and Years, how the infinitely glorious and ever-bleſſed GOD, is by him continually affronted and deſpiſed.</p>
               <p>But, turn the Tables—Let the ſecure Sinner meet with Abuſes from his Neighbours: let him be deſpiſed: let him be ſcorned: let even his Inferiours treat him with Contempt: let his Name be caſt out as evil, by all Men: let every Man's Hand be againſt him, to defraud him in their Dealing with him, to diſappoint him and vex him: And now he will feel it; it will reach his Heart; he will think of it Night and Day; aggravate it continually; and be ready to cry out,
<q>Never was Mortal abuſed as I am! Never were there ſuch wicked Doings in the World before!</q>
               </p>
               <p>If GOD is deſpiſed, affronted, and abuſed; the Sinner's Heart is a <hi>Heart of Stone:</hi> he can't feel it: for he does not care for God.—But let it come to his own Caſe; and his Heart is a <hi>Heart of Fleſh,</hi> very tender; as tender as the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of one's Eye: every T<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="4 letters">

Nor, indeed, is it very ſtrange, that a rebellious World care
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:006963_0027_102AD37CE28A6840"/>ſo little for God's Honour. For this is the Nature &amp; Way of <hi>Rebels</hi> in earthly Kingdoms; when they have caſt off their rightful Sovereign, and turned Enemies to him, they care not what becomes of him, nor how he is treated.

Yea, if he would give <hi>his Firſt-born for his Tranſgreſſion, and the Fruit of his Body for the Sin of his Soul,</hi> it would not avail.
<note n="*" place="bottom">Micah vi. 7.</note> It is eaſy, for a haughty Worm to deſpiſe the <hi>Majesty</hi> of Heaven: but it is beyond the Reach of all created Nature, to make a proper Amends to God for ſuch an Injury. It is, even between Man &amp; Man, eaſier to do Wrong, than to undo it: but it is clean beyond the whole Creation, to make Amends to God for the leaſt Sin. For it requires an infinite Atonement: but if all finite Creatures in Heaven and Earth ſhould join together to do &amp; ſuffer their utmoſt, it would not amount to any Thing infinite. — And beſides, What can a Creature do towards making the leaſt Degree of Atonement for Sin? For, what he does, muſt either be, what God requires, or what God does not require. If it be what God does not require, God will not accept of it; for there is no Virtue in it: And if it be no more than what God requires, it is no more than his Duty. And his paying a preſent Debt, can't atone for a Fault that is paſt. The Creature is not his own, he wholly belongs to God, and all that he hath; he has nothing therefore to give to God, but what is his own already. If he gives himſelf to God, wholly to God, it is the moſt that he can do: and yet he was wholly the Lord's before. It is beyond the Capacity of the Creature, therefore, to make the leaſt Degree of Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for Sin. He may juſtly lie under the whole Guilt, and be expoſed to the whole Puniſhment of it, notwithſtanding the utmoſt he can do: If ever he is ſaved, therefore, it muſt be by free Grace thro' Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

And therefore, inſtead of imagining, that you deſerve better at the Hands of God than once you did, you will naturally ſee, that you grow more and more unworthy and ill-deſerving.

               <p n="6">6. <hi>Is it become natural to you, to be</hi> afraid of <hi>SIN, of all Sin, as the greateſt Evil?</hi> Are you afraid of ſecret, as well as open Sins? Of ſinful Thoughts, as well as ſinful Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? Of an ungracious, unholy Frame of Heart, as well as an unholy Life? Are you afraid of having your Heart turn away from God, the Fountain of all Good? Of loſing a Reliſh for ſecret Prayer? Of wandering Thoughts on the Sabbath, and at Sacrament? And are you afraid of whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever tends thereto; ſuch as, vain Company, a merry Way of Living, Love to the World, neglecting to watch the Heart? Do you make Conſcience of walking with God, and of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Communion with the <hi>most High,</hi> in your Cloſets, and Families, and in the Houſe of God? Or does not a Round of Duties, and Form of Religion, content you? — Do you make Conſcience of loving your Neighbour as your ſelf, and doing as you would be done by; paying your Debts, at the Time agreed upon, and ſhewing Mercy to the Poor? Do you make Conſcience of it, to bridle your Tongue, to avoid Tattling, and acting as buſy-bodies in other Men's Matters? Do you make Conſcience of it, not to miſpend your Time, in fruitleſs Viſits,—at Taverns,—in Frolicks, or in any other vain or unprofitable Way: but to devote your Time and all your Talents, to the Service of God?—If you ſee your Obligations to God, you will make Conſcience of pleaſing
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:006963_0037_102AD394CBF101C0"/>him in all Things. If you ſee the great Evil of Sin, you will be afraid of it in every Shape. If it appears to you as the <hi>greatest of Evils,</hi> you will be <hi>moſt</hi> afraid of it. You will be more afraid of Sin, than of any worldly Loſs, or than of any Reproach, or Shame, or Suffering, or than even of Death it ſelf. However it may be with a good Man, for a Fit, this is his habitual Temper.
<note n="*" place="bottom">Luk. xiv. 26.</note> Indeed, in general, Men are but little afraid of Sin: they will go into the Way of it: they will run into Temptations, to Taverns, to Frolicks, to vain Company; and care but little or nothing, about the Love of God, and ſecret Prayer: no, nor ſo much as whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are honeſt in their Dealings, and true to their Promiſes: And yet, alas! are ready to imagine themſelves to be the Children of God.</p>
               <p>However, an habitual Senſe of the great Evil of Sin, is ſo eſſential to vital Piety, that without it, Men (let their paſt Experiences and their preſent Pretences be what they will) are but mere <hi>Hypocrites.</hi> Their Repentance is counterfeit: their Faith is falſe: their Religion is all unfound. If you know not the great Evil of Sin, you <hi>know nothing,</hi> yet, <hi>as you ought to know.</hi> You are a Stranger to God, ignorant of your own Heart, and of the deplorable Condition you are in, and to this Day are unhumbled, impenitent and unpardoned. Wherefore, conſider theſe Things, anſwer theſe Queſtions; and ſee, and ſay, what is your State.</p>
               <p>Oh! how doleful is the State of ſecure, Chriſtleſs Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners! At Enmity againſt God! Rebels againſt the Majeſty of Heaven! Their Frame of Heart and Manner of Life, a continual deſpiſing the Lord! a Grief to the <hi>holy One of Iſrael!</hi> a conſtant Provocation! And yet alas, they know it not; nor does it once enter into their Hearts: They go on at Eaſe, and are merry, as tho' all were well. And lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle think, what is juſt before them — The Day of Accounts drawing nigh—a Day of Darkneſs—of Gloomineſs—and of thick Darkneſs—and of great Wrath!</p>

Awake, O ſtupid Sinner! Look round; ſee what you do; ſee where you are; and conſider what will be the End. <hi>Can your Hands be ſtrong,</hi> or <hi>your Heart endure,</hi> O guilty Rebel, when GOD ALMIGHTY ſhall come forth to deal with you, according to your Crimes!—</p>
               <p>Behold, now is a Day of Grace: and God is ready to be reconciled: a Door of Mercy is opened, by the Blood of the Son of GOD: Pardon and Peace are proclaimed to a rebellious, guilty World.—<hi>Repent, therefore, and be converted; that your Sins may be blotted out.</hi>—But if <hi>after your Hardneſs and impenitent Heart,</hi> you will venture to go on, <hi>treaſuring up Wrath against the Day of Wrath;</hi> you are like to know it, to your everlaſting Sorrow, that it is a fearful and horrible Thing, to <hi>ſin againſt the LORD.</hi>
