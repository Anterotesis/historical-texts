            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It was <hi>in the Sanctuary,</hi> that the distressed <hi>Psalmist</hi> saw a plain and easie way out of the perplexing Intricacies, of those sad Tentations, in which he had been so far bewildered, and well-nigh lost, <hi>Psal. 73.16, 17.</hi> By Scripture-Light, in the forementioned case, we may easily discern, not onely that it is, but how it comes to pass; and be informed, That the holy and blessed God is never more gloriously Just, then when most dreadfully Severe against such as despise, and will not obey his Gospel. No Judgements are more direfull, and to be dreaded, then <hi>Spiritual;</hi> nor are any nearer such, then they who have, and improve not, but set light by, and abuse the Gospel and Grace of our Lord Jesus.

                  <p>And the Lord said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous; I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me: and if not, I will know.</p>

            <p>BEhold the solemn <hi>Inquisition</hi> which the Lord made concerning the abominable <hi>filthiness</hi> of the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> which cried unto Heaven for vengeance. In the description whereof observe,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The fearfull <hi>Aggravation</hi> of their wickedness. <hi>The cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and their sin is very grievous. Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> were ancient Cities in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> situate in the Vale of <hi>Siddim,</hi> bordering upon the Tribe of <hi>Judah.</hi> There were two other Cities, which perished with them, <hi>viz. Admah</hi> and <hi>Zeboim,</hi> Deut. 29.23. but <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> are onely named in my Text, because as they were the most notable and famous for estate and greatness, so they were the most notorious and infamous for sin and lewdness. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.46. <hi>Sodom and her daughters.</hi> The sins of <hi>Sodom</hi> were many and great, but that which was the most grievous of all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was their abominable <hi>filthiness</hi> in all manner of <hi>Vncleanness.</hi> Ezek. 16.49, 50. <hi>Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, Pride, fulness of bread<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and abundance of Idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy, and they were haughty, and committed abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation before me.</hi> This their wickedness <hi>cried</hi> unto Heaven for vengeance. A figurative expression, holding forth the heinousness and notorious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their sin and wickedness.

            <p>The <hi>Sodomites</hi> were extremely wicked, prodigiously unclean, mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strously profuse in all manner of lechery, obscenity and lasciviousness. <hi>Gen.</hi> 13.13. <hi>The men of Sodom were wicked, and sinners before the Lord exceedingly:</hi> Wherefore the Lord visited them with the Sword, and brought them into servitude and bondage to their Enemies, to whom they continued in subjection twelve years, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.1—4.

against them the second time, overthrew their Armies, sent the people into Captivity, and their goods became a prey to their Enemies, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.10, 11. Nevertheless, through the wonderful patience of God, they were rescued by the hand of <hi>Abraham</hi> for <hi>Lots</hi> sake, and the Lord spared them yet fifteen years longer. But in stead of being gained or reclaimed thereby, they increased and multiplied their wickedness, and filled up the measure of their sin, growing so impudent and outragious in their Villany and Lewdness, that the Cry thereof went up to Heaven, and the <hi>Lord</hi> himself came down in the likeness and similitude of a man, accompanied with two of his holy <hi>Angels,</hi> to make search and diligent <hi>Inquisition</hi> concerning their clamorous and crying Wickedness; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Triall, found it to be most prodigious.

            <p>Now that no man may plead ignorance, nor be able to say another day, that the Ministry did not acquaint them with the nature and hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nousness of this Transgression, let us with holy modesty, in the fear of God, enquire,</p>
            <p>Quest. 1. <hi>What is that Abominable Vncleanness, which crieth in the ears of the Lord of Hosts, and hastneth divine Vengeance?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It is expressed by and comprehended under those two terms, <hi>Fornication,</hi> and <hi>going after strange flesh,</hi> Jude <hi>ver.</hi> 7. <hi>Fornication</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken in a large sense, comprehends not onely <hi>Whoredome</hi> and <hi>Self-pollution,</hi> but also <hi>Adultery,</hi> Matt, 5.32. and <hi>Incest,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.1. <hi>Going after strange flesh,</hi> comprehends <hi>Sodomy</hi> and <hi>Bestiality.</hi> These are the severall sorts of Abominable Uncleanness, which cry for Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Self pollution,</hi> when a man practiseth uncleanness, and commits filthiness with his own body alone. This was the sin of <hi>Onan</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Son of <hi>Judah,</hi> who out of envy and malignity against his Brother deceased, lest he should raise up seed to him, abhorred the lawful use of the Marriage-bed, and most impurely defiled himself. Which fact of his, was so detestable in the sight of God, that he slew him by his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate hand, and suffered not such a Villain to live upon the face of the earth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 38.9, 10. Seducers are called <hi>filthy dreamers that defile the flesh,</hi> Jude <hi>ver.</hi> 8.

hatefull and an odious sin, and usually the fruit and punishment of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure thoughts and fancies in the day-time.

Of <hi>Instruction.</hi> This may serve to <hi>Vindicate the holy Name of God,</hi> and clear in Throne, in his dreadful <hi>Severity</hi> toward this vile and wicked <hi>Youth,</hi> in making him a Pattern and Monument of his fierce Wrath and Indignation. It may be some among us stand astonished and amazed at this fearfull and tremendous hand of God, in making such a <hi>Youth,</hi> a Childe of Religious Parents, and that in his tender years, such a Dreadful Example of Divine Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance. I pray consider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>heinous</hi> and <hi>atrocious</hi> nature of his Sin and Transgression. It is a <hi>Crying</hi> sin; it makes a clamorous noise in the ears of the holy God: it will not suffer God to rest in Heaven. It doth not onely trouble our <hi>Israel,</hi> but it troubles and disquiets the God of <hi>Israel.</hi> This his sin is <hi>exceeding grievous</hi> in the sight of God: it is an Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination; it is Confusion. It defiles the Land; the Earth groans under the burthen of such Wickedness. You pity his Youth and tender years, but I pray pity the holy Law of God, which is shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully violated; pity the glorious Name of God, which is horribly profaned; pity the Land, which is fearfully polluted and defiled.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Consider the <hi>Equity</hi> of Gods severe Dispensation towards this vile <hi>Youth.</hi> The Lord hath proceeded slowly and leisurely, and hath endured this wicked <hi>Youth</hi> with much long-suffering, untill his sin grew to this prodigious height, and cried for Vengeance. For, (as he himself confesseth) he lived in Disobedience to his Parents; in Lying, Stealing, Sabbath-breaking, and was wont to flee away from Catechism. He would not hearken to the Voice of God, and therefore he gave him up to his own hearts lust. He was extremely addicted to Sloth and Idleness; which is a great breeder and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risher of Uncleanness. The standing Pool gathers filth, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours Toads and filthy Vermine. Lust is usually warm and stirring

in idle bosomes. He gave himself to Self-pollution, and other So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domitical wickedness. He often attempted Buggery with several Beasts, before God left him to commit it: at last God gave him over to it, and he continued in the frequent practise thereof for several Moneths. Being at length, by the good hand of God, brought under the Yoke of Government and Service, (which might have bridled and restrained him from such wickedness) he violently brake away from his Master, and with an high hand boldly and impudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, like a childe of <hi>Belial,</hi> shook off that Yoke of God, casting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and disgrace upon his Master. Having now obtained a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious liberty, he grew so impudent in his wickedness, as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit this horrid Villany in the sight of the Sun, and in the open field, even at Noon-day; proclaiming his sin like <hi>Sodom.</hi> Though he be a Youth in respect of years, yet he is grown old in wickedness, and ripe for Vengeance. The Church cannot be cleansed, untill this wicked person be put away from among us. <hi>Ishmael</hi> stood in the same relation to the Church of God, was younger in years, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing convict of a heinous Transgression, though far inferiour to this before us, was cast out, and that according to the Commandment of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.9.10, 11, 12. If we will not pronounce such a Villain Accursed, we must be content to bear the Curse our selves. The Land cannot be cleansed, untill it hath spued out this Unclean Beast. The execution of Justice upon such a notorious Malefactor, is the onely way to turn away the wrath of God from us, and to consecrate our selves to the Lord, and obtain his Blessing upon us. <hi>Numb.</hi> 25 4. — <hi>Hang them up before the Lord against the Sun<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the fierce anger of the Lord may be turned away from Israel.</hi> Exod. 32.29. <hi>Consecrate your selves to day to the Lord, even every man upon his Son, and upon his Brother, that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day.</hi>

               <hi>VSE</hi> II. Of <hi>Exhortation</hi> unto us all, To <hi>sanctifie the Name of God</hi> in this tremendous Dispensation, in making such an one amongst us a Sign and an Example of Vengeance. When <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> were burnt with fire, for offering strange fire before the Lord, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> said unto <hi>Aaron. This is that which the Lord spake, saying, I will be sanctified in them that come nigh to me, and before all the people I will be glorified,</hi> Lev. 10.3. This is the right interpretation and true improvement of such signal and judicial Strokes, <hi>viz.</hi> To san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie the Name of God according to his Word, and give him the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:000186_0013_0FA3176846DFA0D8"/>
honour and glory due unto his Name. <hi>Psal</hi> 9.16. <hi>The Lord is known by the judgement which he executeth: the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion, Selah.</hi> This is a deep Meditation. Let us look upon this sad and woful Example with diligent Observation; let it sink down into our hearts, ponder and weigh it in the Causes, Circumstances and Aggravations thereof. Let our thoughts dwell upon this lasting Monument of Divine Wrath. Content we not our selves with transient thoughts, in contemplating such a permanent Sign and Example of Vengeance, lest God lose of that Honour and Glory which he expects from us, and we fail of that Spiritual fruit which we might and ought to reap thereby.</p>
            <p>Quest. <hi>How should we sanctifie the Name of God in this tremendous Dispensation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> I. In general. <hi>Fear and Tremble</hi> before this holy Lord God. Isa. 8.13. <hi>Sanctifie the Lord of Hosts himself, and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.</hi> The fearful Judgements of God executed upon the wicked, ought to strike a holy fear and dread of God into the hearts of the Hearers and Spectators thereof. <hi>Rev.</hi> 15.4. <hi>Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorifie thy Name? For thou onely art holy: for all Nations shall come and worship before thee; for thy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are made manifest.</hi> This is that which the Lord expects and looks for. When the Enticer to Idolatry is stoned to death, the Lord saith, <hi>All Israel shall hear and fear, and shall do no more any such wickedness, as this is, amongst you,</hi> Deut. 13.11. When the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous Contemner of the Sentence of the Supreme Council is put to death, the Lord saith, <hi>All the people shall hear and fear, and do no more presumptuously,</hi> Deut. 17.13. When the False Witness is punished according to his demerit, the Lord saith, <hi>Those which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main shall hear and fear, and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil among you,</hi> Deut. 19.20. When the Stubborn and Rebellious Son is stoned to death, the Lord saith, <hi>All Israel shall hear and fear,</hi> Deut. 21.21. When God cut off the Nations, made their Towers desolate, laid their streets waste, and destroyed their Cities, the Lord said to <hi>Judah, Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive instruction, Zeph.</hi> 3.6, 7. It hath been the ancient manner, and commendable practise of the people of God, to tremble at the execution of Gods Judgements upon the wicked. When <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and all his host were drowned in the Red Sea, <hi>Israel saw that great work which the Lord did upon the Egyptians; and the people feared the Lord, and believed
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:000186_0014_0FA317690792F318"/>
the Lord, and his servant Moses,</hi> Exod. 14.31. <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phira,</hi> being convict of horrible Hypocrisie and Dissimulation, of sacrilegious Fraud, and prodigious Lying, and presumptuous tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God, yea and of mutual Agreement and Conspiracy therein, were smitten by Gods immediate hand, and fell down dead at the Apostles feet, and <hi>great fear came upon all the Church, and upon as many as heard these things,</hi> Acts 5.11. <hi>Davids</hi> observation of the grievous mischief that ensued upon the vile and vicious courses of the wicked, how the Lord trod them down as the mire of the street, and put them away like dross, and cast them out to the dunghill, it made not onely his Soul, but also his <hi>flesh,</hi> even his whole man to <hi>tremble</hi> before God, and to be horribly afraid of the like sins, lest he or his should incur the like Wrath and Vengeance: <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.120. <hi>My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; and I am afraid of thy Judgements.</hi> And indeed there are many and weighty Reasons, why the execution of Judgements upon the wicked, should make such awfull impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions upon the hearts of the Spectators. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. There are sins with the Spectators, as well as with the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers, which deserve the like Judgements, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.10. — <hi>Are there not with you, even with you, sins against the Lord your God?</hi> If we ransack our own hearts, and search and try our wayes, we shall finde such sins with us, as may justly provoke Divine Wrath and Vengeance. Our cursed Natures are propense and inclined to all manner of sins. Every imagination of the thoughts of the heart of man is onely evil continually, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5. The heart is the Seed-plot of Murther, Adultery, Fornication, Lasciviousness, and of all manner of iniquity, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.19, 20. The gross and flagitious practises of the worst of men, are but Comments upon our Nature. Who can say, I have made my heart clean? The holiest man hath as vile and filthy a Nature, as the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> or the men of <hi>Gibeah.</hi> Yea, there are many actual sins and transgressions with us, which if God should enter into judgement with us, would bring heavy wrath upon us. <hi>In many things we all offend. There is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good and sinneth not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The holy and just God hateth sin where-ever he seeth it, and is impartial in the execution of Justice. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17. <hi>If ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons, judgeth according to every mans work, pass the time of your sojourning here in fear.</hi> The Judgements that light upon some<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are testimonies of the jealousie of God, and
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:000186_0015_0FA31769C5AF4AB0"/>
his severity against all sin. The Lord hates sin now, as much as ever he did formerly. Whoredome, Adultery, Self-pollution and Sodomy, are as odious and abominable in his sight now, as ever they were heretofore.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Gods End in inflicting remarkable Judgements upon some, is for Caution and Warning to all others. The <hi>Sodomites</hi> suffering the vengeance of eternal fire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are set forth for an Example, not of Imitation, but of Caution and Admonition, <hi>Jude</hi> ver. 7. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Lots</hi> wife looking back, became a Pillar of Salt, to season after-generations, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.32. <hi>Korah</hi> and his Company became a Sign, to warn all succeeding Ages to beware of Faction and Sedition, <hi>Numb.</hi> 26.10. The destructive Calamities that befell the <hi>Israelites</hi> in the Wilderness, happened for Ensample, and are written for our Admonition, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.6, 11. Christs Severity against <hi>Jezabel</hi> and her Paramours, is an Instruction to all the Churches, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.22, 23. <hi>Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit Adultery with her into great Tribulation, except they repent of their deeds: and I will kill her Children with death; and all the Churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you, according to your works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Fearful Judgements do likewise abide all other impenitent sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, as well as those that are made Examples. <hi>Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish,</hi> Luke 13.3, 5. The particle [<hi>likewise</hi>] is to be understood of the certainty, not of the similitude of punishment. Perdition is the certain portion of every impenitent sinner. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Repentance there is no escaping the Wrath of the Almighty.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The fear and dread of the Majesty of God, upon the sight of the Mischief that follows upon any sinful and wicked course, will make men wise and wary. <hi>Smite a scorner, and the simple will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware,</hi> Prov. 19.25. <hi>When the scorner is punished, the simple is made wise,</hi> Prov. 21.11. The fear of God will curb and restrain men from the like sins. <hi>All Israel shall hear and fear, and shall do no more any such wickedness, as this is, among you,</hi> Deut. 13.11. <hi>A wise man feareth, and departeth from evil,</hi> Prov. 14.16. The fear of God will reduce and recover such as are fallen into the like Snares and Temptations. <hi>Jude</hi> ver. 23. <hi>Others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire, hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.</hi> Bold and presumptuous sinners cannot be saved, except they be made afraid of the Wrath and Vengeance of God. If lewd and filthy persons
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:000186_0016_0FA3176AE8AE0448"/>
be not scared and frighted out of their vile Haunts and lascivious Courses, by the Terrour of Wrath and Judgement, there is no hope of their Salvation.</p>
            <p>All these Considerations are a sufficient Conviction of our duty in reference to this sad and woful Spectacle before us. Hath the Lord singled out one of our Congregation, Apprehended and Arraigned him for his Abominable Lewdness, cast him out of his Visible King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, delivered him into the hand of Satan, made him an <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema</hi>; yea, and cut him off by the hand of Justice, and swept him away as dung and filth from the face of the earth? Let no man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult over him, nor yet flatter himself in his sins, but let us all learn to fear and tremble before the Lord, who <hi>walketh in the midst of the golden Candlesticks,</hi> having <hi>his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet like fine brass,</hi> and <hi>will have all the Churches to know, that he searcheth the reins and hearts, and rendreth unto every man according to his works.</hi> We have often heard the voice of the <hi>Word,</hi> and have neglected and despised it, now hearken to the <hi>Voice of the Rod,</hi> and of him that hath appointed it. Such Judgements as these have a voice, a loud voice, a clamorous voice, a dreadful voice, calling to all <hi>Israel,</hi> to <hi>Hear and fear, and do no more so wickedly.</hi> The denun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciations of Wrath against vicious and unclean persons, have for a long time sounded daily in our ears, and have not been believed no<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> regarded by many: behold now the Execution of Vengeance upon this lewd and wicked Youth, whom God hath Hanged up before the Sun, and made a Sign and an Example, an Instruction and Astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to all <hi>New-England</hi>; which is as a Divine Seal annexed to all the former Comminations.</p>
            <p>Is there any root of bitterness among us, that beareth gall and wormwood, who hath not onely heard the words of the Curse pronounced, but hath also seen the Curse executed in this dreadful manner, and yet is not afraid to go on impenitently in the same sins, even in Idleness, in Stubbornness, in Lying, in Stealing, in Profaning the Lords-day, and in all manner of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Uncleanness; but <hi>blesseth himself in his heart, and saith, I shall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of mine heart, and adde drunkenness to thirst?</hi> I shall have peace, though I live in Self-pollution, in Fornication, in Sodomy and Bestiality? Know, that your sin is inexcusable, and your destruction inevitable, <hi>The Lord will not spare you, but the anger of the Lord, and his jealousie shall

smoke against you, and all the Curses that are written in this book, shall lie upon you, and the Lord shall blot out your name from under heaven,</hi> Deut. 29.18, 19, 20. <hi>God shall wound the head of his enemies; and the hairy scalp of such an one, as goeth on still in his trespasses,</hi> Psa. 68.21. When the sight or report of Gods Judgements executed upon the wicked, doth not awe the heart, nor deter from the like ungodly practises, it is a great aggravation of sin, and provocation of wrath. Jer. 3 8. <hi>And I saw, when for all the causes whereby back-sliding Israel committed Adultery, I had put her away, and given her a bill of divorce, yet her treacherous sister Judah feared not, but went and played the harlot also.</hi> For any to go on in the sin of Uncleanness, after such a solemn Warning as this, it is to sin presumptuously; it is to sin in contempt of the Holiness of God, in contempt of the Jealousie of God, in contempt of the fierce Wrath and Indignation of the Almighty. He that will rush into the Gulf, and cast himself into the Whirlpool, where he hath seen his neighbour drowned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his eyes, he is a wilful Self-murtherer.</p>
            <p>Go to now, ye wanton and lascivious persons, go on in your Frolicks and mad Pranks, take your swinge in your lusts and vicious courses; <hi>He that is unclean, let him be unclean still; he that is filthy, let him be filthy still:</hi> He that is addicted to Self-pollution, let him continue therein still; he that is a Fornicator, let him be a Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor still; he that is a Sodomite, let him be a Sodomite still; he that is a Beast, let him be a Beast still. Make haste, and fill up your mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: run through all sorts of vile lusts; <hi>work all uncleanness with greediness.</hi> Justifie this poor Condemned Wretch in all his Villany: Be a Comfort to your lewd Predecessors, who are long since gone down to the lowest Hell, and lie in the nether parts of the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Pit.

Let the awfull Apprehension of the Wrath of God, which hath lighted upon this Youth, be a Bridle to curb and restrain the rest of our Youth, and all others, from indulging themselves in any kinde of Carnal Uncleanness.

The sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual and voluptuous <hi>Epicure</hi> is a fit Sty for the unclean Spirit to lodge in.

            <p n="4">4. Beware of <hi>Disobedience</hi> to Parents and Masters in Families, and of casting off the Yoke of Government, which would check and restrain the Enormities of Youth.

If men grieve away the holy Spirit of God, it is just with God to let loose the unclean Spirit, and give him a Commission to haunt them. A profane person may easily become a Fornicator, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.16. He that despiseth the holy Ordinances and Spiritual Priviledges, preferring the satisfaction of his sensual Appetite, above Gospel-mercies, may easily fall into the sin of Uncleanness. <hi>The children of disobedience,</hi> who cannot be perswaded to embrace the Gospel, and yield up themselves in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed subjection to Christ, they are usually addicted to vile lusts, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.5, 6. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.5, 6.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Let the fear and dread of God move and provoke such as are guilty of the sin of <hi>Vncleanness,</hi> timously to <hi>Repent,</hi> and turn to God, lest they also perish. <hi>Luke</hi> 13.3, 5. <hi>Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.</hi> If God hath not spared this lewd Youth, but made him an Example, how shall he spare thee, who art an old practitioner in Sodomitical wickedness?

eyes had been formerly full of Adultery, now are they filled with the salt Tears of Repentance. Her hair she was wont to plait, and adorn her self therewith to please her Paramours, but now she makes it a Towel to wipe the feet of Christ. Her lips which she formerly used to unclean and whorish kisses, she now applies to Christs feet. Her choice and precious Ointment, such as formerly she anointed her self and her bed withall for her Lovers, she pours out upon the feet of the Lord Jesus. Lament and bewail the filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of thy <hi>Heart</hi> and <hi>Nature,</hi> which is the Spring and Fountain, whence all the streams of <hi>Vncleanness</hi> flow. <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.5. <hi>Behold, I was shapen in iniquity: and in sin did my mother conceive me.</hi> Cry unto the Lord to purge and cleanse thee from the guilt and filth of thy sin. <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.7. <hi>Purge me with hysop, and I shall be clean; wash me, and I shall be whiter then the snow.</hi> Your sin cries for Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, do not you neglect to cry for Mercy.

Gangrene in his ear or hand: either cut off the gangrened part, or Soul and Body shall be cast into hell fire, where the worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. Indulgence to thy Lusts is cruelty to thy Soul: Thy life shall go for their life. What a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is this, for the satisfaction of a vile lust, to expose thy self to everlasting Torments? Oh! you purchase your pleasures at a dear rate! you must suffer the vengeance of eternal fire. What, art thou a compleat Sensualist? Thou withholdest thy heart from no carnal joy, or fleshly delight. Thou hast two eyes, and two hands, and two feet; thou canst not endure to maim and mangle the body of sin, and render thy self absurd and ridiculous to the world: Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, thou hadst better go a Creeple to Heaven, then being a perfect Epicure to be cast into Hell, into the fire that never shall be quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.43 — 48. If once thou hast <hi>escaped</hi> out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> tremble to think of <hi>returning</hi> thither again. <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.11. <hi>Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee, go and sin no more.</hi> Nay, look not back, lest thou become a Pillar of Salt. <hi>Remember Lots wife.</hi> A man that hath been sick of a dangerous Disease, and is hopefully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, if he relapse through carelesness, his condition is far more dangerous then at the first. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20. <hi>If after they have escaped the pollutions of the world, through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again intangled therein and overcome, the latter end is worse with them then the beginning.</hi> When the unclean Spirit is gone out of a man, he is restless untill he returneth again: he delighteth not so much to dwell any where, as in his old habitation; he is resolved to assail and recover his former possession: He is not afraid of the length of the siege, or the strength of opposition.

Great care and circumspection is here to be used, for the prevention and timous eradication of any root of bitterness that may trouble and defile us: <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.15, 16. <hi>Looking diligently, lest any man fail of the grace of God, lest any root of bitterness springing up, trouble you, and many be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed: lest there be any Fornicator, or profane person.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What Means are to be used?</p>
            <p n="1">1. Diligent <hi>Instruction. Prov.</hi> 22.6. <hi>Train up a Childe in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it.</hi> Sow the Principles of Piety in tender years, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Solemn <hi>Charges and Commands. Solomons</hi> father taught him, and said unto him, <hi>Let thy heart retain my words: Keep my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments and live, get wisdome, get understanding, forget it not,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.3, 4, 5 His Mother also taught him Chastity and Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and with holy Precepts fore-armed him against the vicious inclination of his Nature, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Yea, King <hi>David</hi> gave him (as his Successor in the Throne) a solemn Charge in the audience of all <hi>Israel,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.9.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Serious <hi>Reproofs</hi> of Instruction: <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.23, 24. <hi>Save them with fear.</hi> Fright and startle them out of their lewd Courses: <hi>Pluck them as brands out of the fire,</hi> Jude <hi>ver.</hi> 23.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Seasonable <hi>Correction</hi> for their folly and lewdness. <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.15. <hi>Foolishness is bound in the heart of a Childe: but the Rod of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection shall drive it far from him. Eli</hi>'s lenity and indulgence to his wicked Sons, brought inevitable ruine upon his house.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Faith and Prayer.</hi> Is thy <hi>Son</hi> haunted by an unclean Spirit? follow the Example of the <hi>father</hi> of the <hi>Lunatick</hi>; Bring thy Son to Christ, affectionately spread his afflicted and distressed condition before him: He is able to cast out Satan, though he rage never so much, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.38, 39, 42. Is thy <hi>Daughter</hi> haunted by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Spirit? Follow the Example of the <hi>Syrophaenician</hi> woman; Fall down at the feet of Christ, beseech him to cast forth the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil out of thy Daughter, <hi>Mark</hi> 7.25, 26. Be not offended nor discouraged by reason of any difficulty, objection or temptation

which the Lord exerciseth you withall, but through the grace of Christ wrestle through all by Faith and Prayer, you shall certainly obtain your request, and that with advantage. There is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of evil Spirits, some are more wicked then others, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.45. but the worst kindes may be cast out by Fasting and Prayer, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.21. Faith is the Instrument, under God, that expels Satan out of his old possession. Fervent Prayer quickens Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Religious Fasting is a special help and futherance to fervent Prayer.</p>
            <p>To conclude. Be pleased to account of this Doctrine, as of the Angels Message to <hi>Lot,</hi> to arise and depart out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> lest he should be consumed in the iniquity thereof; and look at these Instructions and Exhortations, as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels laying hold upon his hand, while he lingred, and upon the hand of his Wife and two Daughters, the Lord being merciful to him, and bringing him forth out of that cursed City. 'Tis an Angelical Service to pluck poor sinners out of the Snare of Lasciviousness.</p>
