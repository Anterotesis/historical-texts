            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>Preface.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>THE</hi> following eſſay was originally deſigned for the uſe of the writer's Farmer only: to whom the want of time, and the want of practice had rendered READING, a work of his utmoſt exertions and induſtry to accompliſh—who would have viewed a large treatise, as a moſt formidable undertaking; but might receive with great pleaſure, the ſame matter thrown into a ſmall compaſs—in which he could ſee, almoſt at a glance, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant object of his thoughts and occupation, treated of in a conciſe and reaſonable manner, which might become the entertainment of his winter evenings, and from the various new hints and remarks con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained therein, lead him to try the truth of them by the unfailing teſt of experiment, and excite in him a laudable ambition of excelling in the line of his profeſſion.</p>
            <p>The appendix to the following eſſay, is little more than an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgment of various voluminous publications on the ſubject of agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture and good huſbandry, fitted to the uſe of Farmers in New-England. But in the Addreſs it has been attempted to point the Farmer's mind to a ſerious attention to a ſyſtem of oeconomics, in the various branches of his occupation, and in the relations he has to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain with thoſe around him.—It is there ſaid, "that more is gained by ſowing than by hard labor"—even labor muſt be oeconomical—e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually diſtant from indolence on the one hand, and from hurry on the other—he who is over wrought to day, on the morrow muſt require ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernumerary hours of reſt and relaxation, to retribute the exceſs. But the thrift of a ſaving man is regular and certain, though gradual and almoſt imperceptible. After a few years of ſyſtematical oeconomy, he looks back with aſtoniſhment on the aggregate amount of ſavings, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of articles ſeemingly below the waſte of a moment's conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

            <head>The Character of a complete Farmer.</head>
            <p>A COMPLETE Farmer is a moſt careful, Induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious and frugal, as well as reputable and uſeful man: and unleſs carefulneſs, induſtry and oeconomy are united in the character, it will be an imperfect one. Although a Farmer cannot live without labor, by labor alone he never can grow rich and reputable. Much depends upon his laying out and performing certain kinds of labor in the times and ſeaſons when they ought to be performed. If he will not cart out his ſummer dung, nor plough thoſe lands in the fall, which he means to ſeed in the following ſpring—if he will not put his ſeeds into the ground early, and as ſoon as the ſeaſon will admit—if he will not attend to his Fences and ſee that they are ſufficient—and if he will not cut his graſs when it is ripe and do ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery thing neceſſary to ſecure it in good order; he will be perpetually hurried from one kind of labor to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and every one will be ſlighted: his flax will not be well coated, nor his grain properly filled out; his corn will be ſhortened for want of being well hoed, and his graſs will become dead and dry away in the field. Let every kind of labor, therefore, be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in due ſeaſon. A complete Farmer is alſo a man of great carefulneſs and ſolicitude; without care, the ſevereſt labor on the beſt of Farms, will never produce riches nor plenty. If the Farmer will
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:030307_0005_0FE5B041E62FA280"/>not milk his cows in ſeaſon—ſee that they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly tended—go to the male in the right time for the next year's profit; and that his dairy is neatly and carefully managed, he may labour without ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, will have a ſmall, poor breed of cattle, &amp; never enjoy a fulneſs of good butter, and cheeſe. It is care which makes a flock increaſe and grow to a good ſize, which brings forth the profits of a dairy, and which fills the houſe of the Farmer with good things. If he will not carefully inſpect his fields and meadows, and ſee that his fences are in good order, his graſs and his corn will be cropt by his cattle: and if he will not gather and put them up carefully and in due ſeaſon, he will have a ſhort and a mouldy crop. If he mows, rakes, and fodders his cattle in a careleſs ſlovenly manner, his flock will be pinched through the winter, and become poor and louſy in the ſpring —poor oxen too poor to do the labor of the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon—poor cows, with little or no milk, and wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed calves and poor horſes, too feeble to draw, and too weak to ride with ſafety. If his ſwine, poultry and ſtock in general, and if his carts, rakes and tools of all kinds, are not carefully attended to, the Farm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er never can grow rich and reſpectable. It is atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which gradually collects from various ſources, and covers the ſoil with manure; it is attention which cauſes the hills, fields and valleys to yield their increaſe, and advances and completes the moſt bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial improvements. There is a third virtue without the practice of which, the Farmer can never attain to wealth and independence: I mean oeconomy. Without this both labor in raiſing, and care in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the fruits of the earth, are abſolutely thrown away. Oeconomy is an excellent virtue in any man: it is indiſpenſible in the affairs and profeſſion of a Farmer. And of this he ſhould never be unmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:030307_0006_0FE5B043777A87A8"/>when he looks into his barn, his cellar, or his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret, or even his paſtures; to ſay nothing of his fields, mowing lands and meadows. But Farmers, as well as other men, are too apt to forget, that in their purſuits after riches, almoſt every thing depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on oeconomy joined with care and induſtry. A fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, induſtrious man, bleſſed with but a common ſhare of underſtanding, will undoubtedly ſucceed and advance his intereſt, beyond what ever he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, when he firſt ſet out in life: provided no ſingular providential evil ſhould overtake him. More is gained by ſaving than by hard labor. A Farmer therefore whoſe utmoſt profits are ſmall and ſlow, as he cannot grow rich ſuddenly from his profeſſion, ſhould be a rigid and ſteady oeconomiſt. He ſhould conſider the ſaving he may make in every thing: in his fuel, tools, clothes, meat, drink, and pocket ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences; above all in his Time, which is equal to ſo much money in hand. Every day that his neighbour runs down to market on his horſe, with a pound or two of butter and a few eggs, if he ſtays at home and keeps ſteady to his labor, he gets two, if not three days the ſtart of him. While his neighbour waſtes his time and ſpends his money by this impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and trifling purſuit he ſaves both time and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, in dreſſing and improving his lands, and which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand all his attention. There is no leiſure hour to be found on a farm from early in the ſpring, till late in the fall. Through all that whole period, a good farmer knows how to ſpend every hour profitably on his lands. He can have no time to paſs in idleneſs—in chatting with people as they paſs by—in making needleſs viſits—in attending courts, horſe races, taverns, and the like. By theſe means the public is annually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of many thouſands of buſhels of Potatoes, corn, tons of hay, &amp;c. and individuals themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:030307_0007_0FE5993C5C6977D0"/>poor, and fall into the worſt of habits—into idleneſs, gaming, drinking, &amp;c. There is no kind of oeconomy in the Farmer, which will not be well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded. Early riſing will contribute to his health, and preſerve his fields from the inroads of unruly creatures, which commonly begin their treſpaſſes juſt as the day begins to dawn. Cloſe mowing and careful raking, will enable him to winter one cow ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary. Feeding his hogs by weeds and other vegetable ſubſtances, will enable him to pay his ſhoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers. Scraping his door and barn yards, after rains and ſhowers, will clothe his boy. Saving his early apples, and which are commonly loſt entirely, will pay his taylor, his poultry well attended, will pay his maid. His calves will pay all his taxes, and ſome part of his hired labor, if proper care be taken of them. In fine, let a Farmer who poſſeſſes only fifty acres of good land—who owes no man, and who has a common bleſſing on the labors of his hands, ſtrictly attend to the management of his affairs; live a life of patient induſtry, and practice agreeable to the principles of oeconomy, and I think he may live well—may be excuſed the hardeſt of labor—leave his hoe and ſpade to the next generation, by the time he has ſeen Fifty years, when moſt men begin to think of comfort, eaſe and independence.</p>

            <head>The importance of Manure.</head>
            <p>TOO much cannot be ſaid upon the ſubject of manure. The vaſt importance of this article has not been ſufficiently attended to by Farmers in gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral, although it is the principal ſource of their riches. Without it, after all their care and labor, they can have but miſerable crops of graſs, flax, corn, &amp;c. A man muſt plough, hoe, mow, rake and hire, more on poor, than on rich land: and it will take a much greater number of acres to ſupport his family comfortably. And it requires the ſame quantity of ſeed; is much harder to till, and is taxed the ſame as rich land; and after all produces not one half the profits. Every Farmer, therefore, who wiſhes to reap the fruits of his labor and care; to improve his lands and increaſe his ſubſtance; and to live eaſy ſome future day, ſhould carefully attend to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of his manure. And here I would obſerve, that the hogſtye, properly attended, will be found to be one of the greateſt and richeſt ſources of this important article. Almoſt any quantity may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from it; provided the Farmer will be as care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to feed the ſtye, as the ſwine confined in it. All kinds of weeds, potatoe tops, ſtraw, pomace, broken peat, dreſſings of flax, butt-ſtalks, roots and vegetables of every kind, will ſoon become the richeſt of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure, when thrown into the hogſtye. Three or four ſwine in this way, will make twelve or fifteen loads in a year; the value of which, where dung is ſcarce and dear, will be four pounds at leaſt. Several ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:030307_0009_0FE5B04B710A17A8"/>Farmers of my acquaintance, are perſuaded that the greateſt profits in keeping ſwine, ariſe from their ſties. A ſmall proportion of this manure, mixed with ſoil and rubbiſh, would be ſeen in a field of potatoes, or of indian corn. And the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity to be made in one ſtye, well ſupplied with weeds and other vegetable ſubſtances through the year, is almoſt incredible; ſome have ſaid, that "forty loads" may be obtained in this way, from ten, or twelve ſwine, in one year only. And great quantities of excellent manure for dreſſing graſs land, may be obtained by ploughing, or cutting up green ſward two or three inches thick, by the ſides of roads, walls, &amp;c. and laying it in heaps, graſs ſide down, for eight or ten months. A little lime mixed with it, would render it fit for uſe much ſooner. One would think, that a Farmer who mows over three or four acres of land, naturally good, but worn down, and which yield not more than fifteen or twenty hundreds of hay—who cultivates as many acres of indian corn, on a ſoil equally as good, but ſtarved and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted, and which return him ſixty or ſeventy buſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els only; when he looks into the fields of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, which are not better, if quite ſo good, in point of ſoil, but which are richly manured, and yield three times the crops yearly, muſt be convinced of the vaſt importance of manure; and of the amazing ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages to be derived from this great and capital ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle in the cultivation of the earth. The Chineſe, who may be ſtiled a vaſt nation of Farmers, as agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture is their moſt honorable and their principal employment, pay the greateſt attention to it. The urine of families is all carefully ſaved; and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe of every kind of vegetable ſubſtance which the earth produces, through their labor and care, is made to contribute to reproductions. And, as very little
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:030307_0010_0FE5B04D04A56C30"/>can be done in the farming line, in the ſtates of New-England, without manure, excepting new lands, which from the general deluge have increaſed in rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by the falling of leaves, and other ſubſtances ſcattered on their ſurfaces, it ought to be conſidered and attended to moſt carefully. And there can be no judicious Farmer among us, who does not endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor to obtain large quantities of this article, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, if poſſible, to the propoſed cultivation and improvements of the next year.</p>
            <p>We read, that the lands of the rich man brought forth plentifully, but this was not merely becauſe the poſſeſſor was rich; for, the lands of the wealthy, will be no more productive, than thoſe of the poor, if they neglect to manure and cultivate them properly. The truth is, a plenty of manure and a judicious, ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cultivation, will ſoon put a new face upon almoſt any lands whatever. And if Farmers in general would pay more attention to the increaſe of their manure, they would experience a decreaſe in their labors, and receive a much greater profit from them. A few a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres of good land richly manured and highly cultivat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed would ſupport their families confortably. And there is ſcarcely any ſoil, but which, by theſe means, would give a prudent man a decent living. And that Farmer in this ſtate who will not give his attention to this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, cannot reaſonably expect any great profits from cultivating the earth, nor to become reſpectable in his profeſſion.</p>

            <head>On Labor.</head>
            <p>WHEN I have been riding in the country in a very hot day, and ſeen Farmers mowing and hoeing in the full blaze of the noon day ſun, the cuſtom of thoſe Farmers with whom I was converſant when a Lad, has immediately occured to my mind. In the months of June, July and Auguſt, they retired ſo early to reſt, that they ſeldom needed a candle to light them to their beds: and they roſe as early in the morning as they could ſee to work. In the heat of the day, unleſs a ſhower, or ſome thing extra cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them to exert themſelves, they laid aſide their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors for an hour or two, and indulged themſelves in a comfortable nap after dinner. This gave them freſh ſtrength and vigor: and they went forth to the labor of the evening, with ſpirit and pleaſure. And if Farmers would work as early and late as they could, in the ſummer ſeaſon, they might reſt from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leven until two o'clock, and eſcape the intenſe heat and thirſt of the day: and not be one half ſo much fati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued as others, who begin their labor late in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing—at ſix or perhaps ſeven o'clock; &amp; who, to perform the labors of the day, muſt bear the heat and burden of it, and go to their beds at night exceeding weary, and quite exhauſted. From eleven 'till two, you may walk round your farm, ſtir hay, or do any light labor, without fatiguing yourſelf in the leaſt. This walk will refreſh your ſpirits; and may ſave your lands from the inroads of unruly cattle, ſheep, ſwine, &amp;c. Walls and other fences ſhould often be inſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:030307_0012_0FE5B05396B00778"/>if you wiſh to preſerve the fruits of your labors, and half an hour, or more, in the time and ſeaſon of it, devoted to this purpoſe, would not fail of being well rewarded—Theſe hints may be improved on: and I cloſe this paper by obſerving, that mowing and hoeing, both for comfort and profit, ſhould be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed early in the morning and late in the evening. The labor of a Farmer is hard in general; a great part of the year it is ſevere; and even when pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence has alone done all that ſhe can do, and which is not a little, ſtill, in the ſweat of his face ſhall he eat bread.</p>

            <head>Exchanging Work.</head>
            <p>FARMERS who handle but little money, ſhould be cautious of entering into caſh engagements; they will find it more convenient to exchange Labor, than to hire and pay money. Neighbors who have lands to break up, and teams to connect together, may do this buſineſs cheaper, by exchanging with each other, than by hiring help and cattle. It will of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten be found mutually beneficial to make exchanges, even in mowing and hoeing. Through a difference in the ſituations and ſoils of farms, though adjoining each other; and through early cultivation in the one, and late in the other, it frequently happens, that the corn, graſs, flax, &amp;c. on one, is forwarder and ripe ſooner by ſeveral days, than on the other. In this caſe it would be prudent to unite their labors and not to hire; this would be almoſt ſo much ſaved. But then, theſe exchanges ſhould never make any alteration, either in meats or drinks, in the Farmer's family. For, if any extra proviſion is made an extraordinary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence is incured. The chief uſe of land, and that which makes it principally beneficial and profitable to a man, is this, it gives him employment: It is of very little advantage or profit to him who does not labor upon it in perſon. A Farmer ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be cautious of hiring much help; and at no time more than he can fully and profitably employ and readily pay. And to do this if he hires for a month, or for a year he ſhould endeavour to raiſe a ſurpluſage of ſome one, or of ſeveral articles to the amount of the labor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:030307_0014_0FE5B05765CD1020"/>wages at leaſt. And if he does this, even then, he finds that a year's wages are not eaſily paid: it will take off a conſiderable part of his corn, flax, dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or ſome other produce.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Farmers who hire much labor done, will ſoon be convinced, if men of ſenſe, that ſcarce any farm will yield ſix per cent. and keep up the neceſſary repairs: and that although they poſſes flocks and herds, and are the proprietors or owners of the ſoil, they are but little more than ſtewards to their laborers. And this ſhould excite them to labor induſtriouſly with their own hands, and to do all they can within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. When diet and labor are ſcarce and dear, and a man has ſeveral farms, or more land to improve and cultivate, than he can take care of, unleſs he hires a number of laborers, he ſhould let, or put them to the halves, as it is called, to honeſt and induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men, if he can find them. For, the difference between hiring laborers and boarding them, and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or putting out a farm, as above, the produce of which may amount to eighty or an hundred pounds, would be twenty, or twenty-five per cent. in favor of the proprietor. And he will not have the trouble of providing for, and paying a number of people: ſome of whom, after all his attention and punctuality toward them, will not acknowledge themſelves ſatisfied and contented. Good help, as it is called, is generally ſcarce and dear, and with difficulty obtained; and a Farmer who hires careleſs, ignorant and ſlothful labor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, notwithſtanding all his own induſtry, will never grow rich.</p>

            <head>The profits of a Nurſery.</head>
            <p>TO this intereſting ſubject ſo little attention has been paid for many years paſt, that the ſcarcity and price of fruit, are now ſo exceeding great, as almoſt to prohibit the uſe of it. How ſurprizing a neglect in the Farmer who lives in New-England, the climate and ſoil of which are more than favorable to the prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agation of various kinds of delicious fruits. The citizens of New-York have reſiſted this careleſs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolent diſpoſition, and been well rewarded for their induſtry. Conſiderable ſums of money are annually remited them from this State for the productions of their nurſeries, purchaſed at a moſt extravagant price, although the riſk of tranſporting them is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great. And I have no doubt, that the Farmers of Maſſachuſetts would ſoon find it to their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage would they engage in this buſineſs. Their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors are often beſtowed upon productions, not of one half the importance and value. For, although it is commendable in the Farmer to raiſe a portion of ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery article conſumed in his family, provided his lands can eaſily be made to produce it; yet, a little patch of tobacco, or of pumpkins, ought not, year after year, to prevent the cultivation of a nurſery: the profits of which, within the term of ſeven years, would be vaſtly greater than could poſſibly ariſe from the cultivation of thoſe vegetables, in the ſame pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod and proportion.</p>
            <p>Twenty years ago the writer obtained half a pole of land, in the corner of a gentleman's garden, and filled it with young appletrees; taken up carefully
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:030307_0016_0FE5B060A040E5A0"/>with the point of a knife, when they had four, or ſix leaves on them, as they ſhot out of the pomace ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered round a neighboring <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. When they were four years old he grafted them cloſe to the ground; and three years after he ſold them for more than FIVE POUNDS ſterling. They were remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to a ſuitable ſituation, and now form a moſt beautiful and productive orchard. Thus profitable was that little effort in the nurſery way. There have been many others of the like kind, on a larger ſcale, and all very advantageous. One in particular ſhall be mentioned.</p>
            <p>About ten years ago, a very worthy gentleman in my neighbourhood, poſſeſſed of a fine taſte, and of an excellent judgment in the management of a nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, began the propagation of fruit and other trees: partly for his amuſement, and partly for the uſe of his farm. Since which he has furniſhed a moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and extenſive garden, with a rich and vaſt vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, from his own nurſeries: and now has an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the fineſt apples, plumbs, peaches, apricots, cheries, &amp;c. From ſo great a number of young and thrifty trees, bearing and coming on to bear, one can ſcarcely pretend to gueſs at the quantity of fruit which they will yield in the period of four, or five years more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>[The following account is taken from his Gardener.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"In the ſpring of the year, 1790, when I engaged in the ſervice of E. H. D. <abbr>Eſq</abbr> his gardens were not ſo extenſive as they now are; and his nurſery was ſmall, compared with what it is at preſent. But lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle was done in it that year. Some apple, pear, and fruit trees were planted; and a collection of ſeeds made for the following year: in which, apple, pear, plumb, apricot, peach, cherry, mulberry, elm, button
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:030307_0017_0FE5B0626BA04238"/>wood ſeeds, &amp;c. were ſowed, all of which have fully anſwered the expectations of the proprietor, and of the beſt judges of propagating theſe kinds of trees. Yearly additions have been made to this nurſery, and it now takes up nearly one acre and one quarter of land. The whole of the expence beſtowed upon it, from 1790 to 1795, does not exceed, in my opinion, the ſum of forty pounds. And this year, trees have been taken from it, and ſold, to that amount: and had there been enough of a ſuitable age and growth, for tranſplanting, one hundred pounds worth might have been diſpoſed of. Not to mention the great number of trees taken out of this nurſery, to ſupply the proprietor's own gardens, and thoſe preſented to his friends, it now contains more than two thouſand of button wood trees, five years from the ſeeds, and from ſeedlings brought from the town of Boylſton, one thouſand of which are more than ſeven feet high, and which are to be removed next ſpring, to a ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſituation, for the purpoſe of a woodlot for the uſe of his farm. Including theſe, there are now in this nurſery about fourteen thouſand trees; many of them are ſmall, and have not been inoculated. I eſtimate them on an average, at ſix pence: and at this low price the value of them will be THREE HUNDRED and FIFTY POUNDS, the nett proceeds, on profits of one acre and one quarter of land improved in this way. For, the trees which have been taken up and diſtributed on the farm, with thoſe which have been given away, would more than pay the rent of the land, and the expence of fencing it. And it ought to be obſerved, that a very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable portion of the labor beſtowed on this nurſery, might have been performed at times when little elſe could have been done."</p>
            <p>Here we ſee the exertions and rewards of induſtry
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:030307_0018_0FE5B063FA299E30"/>in the cultivation of a nurſery. And one would think that this example would be followed by many atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and judicious Farmers among us. But if it ſhould not, this is certain, viz. that it is an example of great induſtry, and well worthy the attention of the public.</p>
            <p>But it may be obſerved, that if Farmers in general ſhould attend to the cultivation of fruit trees they would ſoon become plenty, and be of little value. To determine this matter, let them conſider, how great a number of their neighbours, and who might raiſe corn in plenty, do nevertheleſs neglect to cultivate ſo much of it as would ſupply their families, although bread is the ſtaff of life. Good huſbands only will be the rivals of thoſe who may engage in the propagation of fruit trees. And this will give thoſe who engage in the buſineſs, two chances at leaſt, out of three, in favor of a ready market for their productions of this kind. And beſides, old orchards are mouldering away; new farms are rapidly increaſing; and a country without bounds is daily ſoliciting a ſupply from the nurſery. When nurſeries were numerous; when orchards, now decayed and paſt bearing, were in their full ſtrength and vigor; and when money was very ſcarce—even then—forty years ago, appletrees from the nurſery would fetch eight pence each; and there is no great probability that they will ever be much cheaper in this State.</p>

            <head>The advantages of an Orchard.</head>
            <p>WHEN we ſurvey the country around us, of which our induſtrious Anceſtors took poſſeſſion about one century and an half ago, we ſee the ruins of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny once beautiful and flouriſhing orchards: and we are ſurprized that their deſcendants have endeavored no more to counteract thoſe ravages of time, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placing the labors of their hands. To excuſe this negligence it has been obſerved, that young orchards will not ſucceed on thoſe lands from which old ones have been removed; though peartrees will, and laſt for more than one generation. But if this obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be juſt, and it is more than probable that it may be, for large trees muſt impoveriſh the ground on which they grow, there is ſcarcely any conſiderable farm on which ſome new ſituation may not be found on which to place an orchard. Any ſoutheaſt proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, or an hill dripping towards the ſouth, which is a moſt excellent ſituation, or even the ſides of roads and fences around paſtures and mowing lands, will anſwer very well. Trees thus placed will yield a great plenty of fruit; increaſe the graſs; afford a comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſhelter for cattle, and be highly ornamental. It would be judicious to propagate a large proportion of ſweet apples: as they afford a rich repaſt for the table of the Farmer; are equal in value to any other apples for cyder; and will almoſt fatten ſheep and ſwine. One would imagine, that the profits and pleaſures ariſing from an orchard, would ſtimulate the Rarmer to propagate the appletree; but in noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:030307_0020_0FE5B071F6887EB8"/>perhaps, has the preſent generation been more deficient. Many farms on which ſcarcely an apple is now to be ſeen, abounded with thoſe of the firſt quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty fifty years ago. Cyder was then ſo plenty that it would not fetch more than two or three ſhillings, at the preſs, per barrel; nor more than five or ſix in the market. In that part of the country in which the writer then lived, about a dozen miles from Boſton, apples, pears, plumbs, cherries and peaches were exceeding plenty. Boys were ſeldom or never known to rob fruit trees of any kind: and the poor had only to aſk and gather what they wanted. I know of no tree in this country which produces a greater variety of fruit; ſcarcely any two, unleſs grafted, or innoculated, being of the ſame taſte and flavor, which can be uſed in a greater variety of ways, and preſerved for a longer ſpace of time, than that which I am recommending. In bloom the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletree makes a moſt beautiful appearance, and the fruit of it, even in its crude ſtate, affords an agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble tart. Although it is ſaid by naturaliſts, that the crab is the pooreſt of all apples, they differ in many eſſential reſpects from each other. Some are ripe in July, and highly agreeable to the palate: others are mature in Auguſt, and in September; and ſo on, in ſucceſſion, 'till late in October, when all come to perfection, and there is the greateſt variety and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance. While ſome are moſt excellent for pyes, and others for ſauce, a greater proportion are for eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and may be preſerved through the winter, with no other expence than barreling, or boxing them up: and all of them may be converted into a very whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, vinous liquor, which will keep through the whole of the year. But ſome have obſerved, that appletrees are liable to froſts, worms, catterpillars, &amp;c. and therefore they neglect the propagation of them.
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:030307_0021_0FE5B074999D6B38"/>Apply this reaſoning to flax, barley, and to corn: ſhall we neglect theſe things becauſe they are ſubject to froſts, worms, mildews, and the like evils? It is true, that apples are not ſo neceſſary as bread; but they are very grateful and profitable. If only one tree out of twenty ſet out by the farmer, ſhould flouriſh and bear fruit, within twenty years after the propagation of it, he will receive a tenfold reward for all his expence and trouble. Let your appletrees be carefully planted out; well ſecured from ſheep and cattle; and judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly grafted; then you may comfort yourſelf with the reflection, that you have laid the foundation of that wealth which will grow and increaſe as you ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance in years, and eventually deſcend to your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Could I name a certain tree, which would grow rapidly; and extend its branches far and wide; and which would laſt for a century or more; and that this tree within leſs than a dozen years after the ſeeds of it had been ſowed, would ſtart up and bear a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of little ſilver pieces, equal in value to the ſixteenth or even the ſixtieth part of a dollar, would you not endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor to propagate that tree? Why, then, can you not be perſuaded that all the profits of this tree may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alized, if you will cultivate the appletree? Although the fruit of this tree is another kind of property, and differs in appearance from thoſe little pieces of ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, it will as certainly produce them, as if the tree itſelf had borne them. Whatever you cultivate, and which produces ſilver, is the ſame in point of profit, as ſilver itſelf.</p>
            <p>There is one conſideration more on this ſubject, and which may not be unworthy of your attention. Many Farmers who hire a number of laborers are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged thereby to pay a very heavy tax, to which their forefathers were entire ſtrangers. I mean the expence incurred by RUM, and which is more prejudicial to
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:030307_0022_0FE5B0762D329A38"/>their intereſts than froſts and caterpillars are to their orchards. And I can ſee no way of withſtanding this growing evil, but through the influence and increaſe of CYDER. When this liquor was plenty, and when good ſmall beer held a reſpectable place in the Farmer's cellar, the beſt of laborers—men who would reap, or hoe an acre per day, in light land, and go home at night contented with their wages, were ready to be hired—there were enough of theſe characters wiſhing to work, and the Farmer had not to court them into his ſervice. And I have no doubt, was cyder as plenty, and good ſmall beer in as much reputation in theſe days, as they were fifty or ſixty years ago, Farmers would ſoon experience an altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in their favor. The man who will not labor chearfully and faithfully when he has victuals enough, and good cyder and beer, is not worth his keeping. If then, you would reap the above profits and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and rid yourſelf of this needleſs and burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome tax, cultivate the appletree; and endeavor to excel in the quantity and quality of your cyder, which is annually increaſing in value.</p>
            <p>I ſhall cloſe by obſerving, that every apple tree in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes the value of the farm on which it grows. Thoſe farms on which good orchards are placed will commonly be in demand, and greatly preferred to thoſe which have none. Indeed a judicious man will not readily buy a farm which has no orchard on it; becauſe it wants one eſſential advantage; more eſpecially if it be near a market town. A young and flouriſhing orchard, has rendered many an old and worn-out farm ſaleable.</p>

            <head>The management of Cyder.</head>
            <p>MANY Farmers who ſpare no expence nor labor in preparing their pork, veal and mutton in the beſt manner, with the view of obtaining the higheſt prices for thoſe articles, pay very little attention to another equally as important a part of their produce; and which would well reward them for all their cares and pains beſtowed upon it; I mean cyder. That which is ſweet and good, will fetch one ſixth part more at leaſt, than that which is four and ordinary. This muſt be an object to the Farmer, even when he has but one or two tons to diſpoſe of: and when he has three, or four times that quantity to ſell, it becomes of great importance to him. If his lot is caſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in eight or ten miles of a market town, this ſixth part will almoſt defray the expences of carting the whole. And this kind of cyder will meet with a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſale: the man who offers it, will not be obliged to ſtand a great many hours in the heat of the day, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, in fly time, or in a ſtorm, and after all his anxiety, and the ſufferings of his cattle, to court a chapman. And whatever the feelings of thoſe may be, who regard neither the quality of the article they have for ſale, nor the trouble and artifice they are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to ſubmit to, in order to diſpoſe of it, the Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer who knows that his meat, meal, cyder, &amp;c. are really good, when he ſhall hear them commended and receive a generous price for them, will enjoy the approbation of his own heart and go home rejoicing. It muſt be of as much advantage to a Farmer, as it is to a merchant, or to a mechanic, to eſtabliſh and
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:030307_0024_0FE5B07E354592C0"/>ſupport a reputable and good character. But, that good cyder may be more common, and that thoſe Farmers who have orchards may be benefited by this publication, let them attend to the following directions, communicated by a reſpectable Gentleman: and who, for a number of paſt years has experienced the utility of them.</p>
            <p>"Let the Farmer who wiſhes to have the cleareſt, ſweeteſt and beſt of cyder, ſee that his apples are fully ripe, and perfectly ſound before they are ground. And two or three days after the cyder has been well made in the common way, and before it begins to ferment, let him take out the head of a caſk which will contain one hundred gallons, and ſet it upright, with a faucet or plug placed in it near the bottom. Then let him empty his barrels into it, and grate one quarter of a pound of chalk into the liquor: let it be ſtirred with a ſtick, the end of which has been broomed, until it begins to ferment. Then let it ſtand for two, or three days, according as the weather may be, when all the pomace will riſe and float on the top of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor. Then let it be drawed off into caſks perfectly ſweet and new, for bad caſks will ſpoil the beſt cyder if put into them, and let it ſtand without giving it vent, 'till the beginning of February following, when it muſt be racked off. Cyder, naturally good and managed in this way, is equal, in the opinion of many Gentlemen, to ſmall wines; and will always fetch a generous price in the market. If it ſhould not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly clear in the ſpring, after it is racked off, take a pound of good coarſe ſugar, with two or three eggs, break them into the ſugar, ſhells and all, &amp; add to them half a pint of fine ſand; beat them well together; put them into the barrel of cyder; ſtir the liquor with a broomed ſtick, until it ſhall be found to fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

            <p>I ſhall cloſe this paper by obſerving, that there may be a very great advantage derived from grafting fruit of the apple kind, even when the orchard is intended for cyder only; provided a number of trees be ſet with one kind of fruit, and a number with another kind, and ſo on: for all theſe different kinds will have their ſeveral periods of perfection; and may be made into cyder as they become ripe. This is not the caſe with ungrafted apples: in their natural ſtate, and taken promiſcuouſly as is common, ſome will be crude, or not ripe, ſome in perfection, and ſome rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ripe; and from ſuch a collection good cyder can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reaſonably be expected.</p>
            <p>To give a fine amber, or curious color to cyder, not naturally ſo, let it lay in the promace fifteen or twenty hours, before it is put into the vat or cheeſe to be preſſed, and take care that no water comes near it.</p>

            <head>Keeping a Day Book.</head>
            <p>BOTH merchants and mechanics are greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to their books of accounts, for information and ſucceſs in the ſeveral branches of their buſineſs, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and correct entries. The tranſaction of every day ſhould be correctly noted. The time when you plough, ſow, plant, mow, pull flax, cut fuel, gather corn, potatoes, &amp;c. and the quantity and quality of manure laid on each field, ſhould be carefully notic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. You will then know the ſeaſon when labor muſt be done the next year, in thoſe fields, and the kinds and proportions of manure required to dreſs them. Farmers ſhould weigh all their pork, beef, butter and cheefe; and meaſure all their grain, corn, potatoes, &amp;c. and indeed, every article they lay up for winter; and alſo the time when they kill their creatures and the food on which they were fatted. This will ſhew the quantity they conſume, what, and how much of each article, and how much they may have to diſpoſe of. Days on which they hire labor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; the labor performed on thoſe days, and the price paid for that labor, ſhould be entered. This will ſhew what time and labor muſt be performed the next year, the price of it, and the money which may be wanted to carry on the buſineſs of the farm. Every farmer ſhould mark the day on which his cows, mares, &amp;c. aſſociate with the males of their ſeveral kinds; he will then be able to provide proper room, &amp;c. for the reception of their young and to attend to their keeping in due ſeaſon, and which ought to be a little better then common, at thoſe periods.
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:030307_0027_0FE5B08170225788"/>For want of this attention, multitudes of calves, lambs, pigs, &amp;c. are annually loſt. The ages of lambs, calves, colts, &amp;c. ſhould be carefully noted, and the weight of them when killed; as this will point out thoſe ewes, cows, &amp;c. which are beſt for breeders; which is a very material branch of knowledge, in regard to the growth and value of a ſtock of cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. In ſhort, the Farmer ſhould note the buſineſs of every day, how and where he paſt it, and what the weather was; and he ſhould not forget, that ſo much of the goodneſs of his crops depends upon early and ſeaſonable cultivation, that he had better give any price for labor than be belated; more depends on this than farmers in general ſeem to be ſenſible of. Flax, ſowed early, will have a better coat, and more ſeed than when ſowed late. Barley ſowed early will not be liable to blaſt and mildue; and indian corn planted and hoed in good ſeaſon, will not be ſo liable to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from drought, and from froſts, and will be fuller and heavier, than when planted late, poorly ploughed, and indifferently hoed. Graſs land on which manure is ſpread early, will yield a much better crop, than if ſpread late, and <hi>one</hi> load of graſs, cut when ripe, and before it withers and turns white in the field, will be of more value than <hi>two</hi> loads of the ſame kind, cut after it is ripe, dried away and weatherbeaten: it has loſt its juices in this ſtate, which is all that is valuable. Our ſummers are ſo ſhort, that every poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible advantage ſhould be taken for early cultivation: for negligence and inattention in the ſpring, will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be followed by cold and hunger of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing winter.</p>
            <p>But to return. A Farmer ſhould keep a careful entry of all his fodder; the quantity and quality of each kind: for, he may wiſh to purchaſe and winter a cow or two extraordinary—and an account of the
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:030307_0028_0FE5B08301C0BEE8"/>manure made by his ſwine, by ſcraping of the roads, his yards, by mud, barn dung, &amp;c. for, this will ſhow him at once, how much land to break up, and the ſtrength he will have for the next year's cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivation: if he neglects this branch of good huſband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he cannot expect to form a juſt eſtimate, either of the labor or profits of the next year. To avail himſelf of many of the advantages which ſtand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with his ſitutation and farm, he muſt attend to theſe things, many of which may appear of little or of no conſequence in the eyes of the maſs of farm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; but they certainly deſerve their very ſerious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. Laborers, unleſs upon ſome urgent occaſions, ſhould never be hired by the month, nor even for a ſingle day, in the winter ſeaſon; when the days are ſhort, cold and ſtormy, and when an induſtrious man can hardly earn his living. The quantity of pork, beef, cyder and other proviſions expended, in other words, almoſt thrown away, by this imprudent prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, will certainly be miſſed, and ſeverely felt in the following ſpring and ſummer; unleſs and additional ſtock of each be laid up to ſupport it in the fall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding. The farmer may hire labor in the ſpring, to get a good crop in the ground in due ſeaſon; in the ſummer, to ſecure his graſs; and in the fall of the year, to gather in his harveſt; but not in the winter, when nothing can be raiſed, either for the uſe of man or beaſt.</p>
            <p>And here I obſerve, that every Farmer ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to cultivate and take care of his own lands; and not let the profits of them depend on hirelings more than he cannot poſſibly avoid. And he ſhould never work within door, while any thing can be done to advantage without; nor ſet himſelf, or his laborers, to that work in fair, which can be done in foul weather.</p>

            <head>Contracting Debts.</head>
            <p>A FARMER, as his lands yield but one crop in a year, and as the proceeds of that cannot be received 'till late in the fall, or the winter, ſhould take as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle as poſſible on credit: for of all that he raiſes he will have but little to ſpare, unleſs he deprives his family of ſome of the comforts and conveniences of their lives. It will take a conſiderable proportion of a large ſtock of cattle, as they riſe, to raiſe even an hundred dollars, in common times; and theſe are the only times on which he ought to form his calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations. What by over dry, or by otherwiſe unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable ſeaſons, he ſhould bear in mind, that every ſeventh or eighth year, will be but indifferent in point of profit; and on which all his exertions will but juſt render his family comfortable. Inſtead, therefore, of ſpending all, in years of plenty, he ſhould endeavor to lay up ſomething, againſt thoſe days of ſcarcity. Debts may, ſoon be contracted, and to a ruinous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount, if care be not taken to avoid them. When a Farmer owes his merchant, his ſchoolmaſter, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borers, &amp;c. and when he has paid them all off, he will find that a very conſiderable part of his crops are diſpoſed of and gone. And he ought to reflect, when he lays himſelf under pecuniary obligations to his neighbors, that ſome of them are entirely igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of his reſources, and of the only ſeaſon in which he can conveniently diſcharge them. A man who never ſows, thinks not of the time for reaping. Creditors may call for their monies, when it will not
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:030307_0030_0FE5B08B73663400"/>be in his power to ſatisfy them, without making a moſt injurious ſacrifice of his ſtock, or ſome other things—they may call when his crops are on the grounds; or in the ſpring, before they are put into the earth; and when all his induſtry and labor can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſave him. It is greatly to the diſadvantage of any man to be in debt, moſt commonly, and to no man more, perhaps, than to the Farmer. But here, I expect the Farmer will obſerve that there are ſo many temptations, and that ſuch is the faſhion of the times at preſent, that it is almoſt impoſſible for him to keep clear of debts. I acknowledge and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the truth of his obſervation: but there are remedies at hand, with which to counteract theſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils. A good ſhare of prudence, and a manly ſpirit of ſelf-denial, will ſecure him, at all times, againſt them. Let him, in the firſt place, guard againſt the cry of good bargains, for, it has often been the caſe, that men, for a little and convenient piece of land, have paid very dear. Either the day of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was not duly conſidered, and provided for; or the ſoil did not anſwer their expectations—was not rich, well ſenced and watered; or it was a purchaſe beyong their ability. Again, the Farmer ſees his neighbour, not more wealthy in lands, ſtock, or ready money, than himſelf, mounted on an excellent horſe, or riding in an elegant chaiſe quite at his eaſe and pleaſure; while he has but an ordinary creature, both for his own, and for his wife's accommodation; and feels himſelf moſt ſenſibly affected. Pride, or a deſire of appearing to an equal advantage, ſteps in at once to the relief of his mortified feelings, and he immediately reſolves to excel, or at leaſt to equal him in outward appearance. But before he takes a ſingle ſtep in this weighty affair, he ought to conſider the age and circumſtances of the man who he wiſhes
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:030307_0031_0FE5B08D06BCDA80"/>to rival. He may be an older man than him, and have labored more years; he may have been more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious, careful and oeconomical; or his family may not have been ſo large and expenſive—he may have more ſons,—poſſeſs better faculties, and know how to ſave in one thing, what he expends extra in anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. And if he has labored more years, and taken bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter care of his lands, crops, ſtock, manure, &amp;c. he may well ride while others go on foot who have not paid an equal attention to their farms. But if he had not labored more years than you had—had no pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar advantages above you, nor been a better huſband, and you cannot afford to buy an elegant horſe, or a fine chaiſe, the man deſerves your pity, rather than your envy. Conſider this matter, and how painful the reflections ariſing from it, after a few years of gay and flaſhy appearance, to be turned out of doors, and to leave your wife and children to the cold hand of charity! Surely, this muſt operate againſt the paſſion you wiſh to indulge; get the better of all theſe idle and fooliſh ſenſations; render you quite ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, although you ſee your neighbours finer than you are, and lead you to avoid all needleſs and ruinous expences.</p>
            <p>It is true, there is a peculiar pleaſure in appearing, and living equal to thoſe of our rank and ſtation, and which we hardly know how to relinquiſh; but it is much wiſer to ſacrifice a little, yea a great deal to our feelings, than to be reduced to dependence. Nothing, indeed, can exceed the folly of thoſe, who live beyond their ſtated incomes, and who are ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to maintain an appearance, without the means with which to do it.</p>
            <p>Let it therefore be the deſire of the Farmer, to cultivate and improve the ſoil on which he lives, with the greateſt attention, and to confine his expences to
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:030307_0032_0FE5B08EE2BD0548"/>the annual income of his lands. This will ſave him from the pains of many an anxious and diſtreſſing hour as he paſſes along through life, and ſoften his pillow, when in the hour of death.</p>

            <head>Cloathing and Diet.</head>
            <p>THE earth is the parent of us all: her breaſts are inexhauſtible: the Farmer is her firſt born: and yet, how often does he forfeit her bleſſing! Every man who tills the ground, and who endeavours not to live, as much as poſſible, upon the productions of his own labor, is guilty of this extravagance. The Merchant may indulge in foreign luxuries, may eat, drink and wear, ſuch articles as are not the growth and manufacture of his own country, as he imports them, and as they come cheaper to him, than to thoſe who buy of him, and conſume the greater part of them. And the Mechanic, from his profeſſion, is <hi>obliged</hi> to live upon the productions of other men's labors; but the Farmer is the moſt independent man in the world, as he may raiſe every article for his own conſumption—bread, milk, pork, beef, butter and cheeſe, potatoes, wool, flax, cyder, beer,—and what other good things can he then ſtand in need of? you will ſay, perhaps, a little coffee, a little tea, ſugar, rum, &amp;c. I acknowledge, that thoſe little things, all but the laſt mentioned, may now and then be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged in; provided the Farmer, and his family, will be contented to perform a conſiderable portion of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary labor, and to uſe theſe things more oeconomically, or ſparingly, through the year. For rum, freely uſed, will ſoon reduce, and render poor, the moſt wealthy Farmer. If he ſhould expend but one gallon per week, from the ſpring to the laſt of autumn, ſeven months only—it will form a direct
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:030307_0034_0FE5B09341C28BD8"/>tax, of ſix or ſeven pounds; and which is more, perhaps, than all his ſtate, county, town and pariſh taxes put together. I have ſaid a <hi>direct</hi> tax; and it often proves as heavy an evil <hi>indirectly:</hi> that is to ſay, it takes time to run to the ſhops for it; it takes time to ſit and chat over it; and it takes time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover from the baneful effects of it. For, it gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally impairs the ſtrength, as it weakens the powers of the ſtomach, and eventually brings on premature old age, to ſay nothing of the manifold contentions and quarrels excited by the uſe of it. I am now ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this article, uſed to exceſs, as it is but too commonly. In hot and ſultry weather, a moderate portion of it, well diluted, ſix parts, at leaſt, out of ſeven, with water, when the laborer is greatly fatigued, exceeding thirſty, and compelled to drink immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, may not be prejudicial: but even then, good cyder, and malt liquors, are much better, and more ſalutary, both for the body and purſe of the Farmer. Our fathers tilled the ground without it, were ſtrong and vigorous, left their farms unmortgaged, and died in a good old age. I wiſh I could ſay, that their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendants had not acquired very different habits, not a little unhappy for themſelves and for their children. When men of ſixty, or of ſeventy years of age, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect the days of their youth, they cannot but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, how eaſy and independent their fathers paſt their days. When the Collector or Tax-gatherer came, and which was ſeldom oftener than once in a year, to receive their ſeveral aſſeſſments, he commonly 05 found them laid up and ready for him.—It was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſcandalous in thoſe who obliged him to call a ſecond time for his due; and as to thoſe perſons who were compelled by a courſe of law to pay their juſt debts, they fell into open and great diſgrace thereby.
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:030307_0035_0FE5B094CFB48200"/>And to what was this owing—to what cauſes, under GOD, were they indebted for their freedom, eaſe and independence, but their induſtry, and care againſt contracting debts for luxuries, and for things not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; and to their making it an irrevocable rule, not to eat, drink nor wear ſcarcely any thing which was not raiſed on their farms, and which was not the fruit of their own labors. In thoſe days, when the rites of hoſpitality were peculiarly attended to, rum, tea, &amp;c. were hardly known: and the daughters of the moſt wealthy and independent farmers, the mothers of many of the more reſpectable perſons now living in theſe States, ſeldom appeared in ſilks. And it would be highly advantageous to Farmers in theſe days, if they would endeavor to raiſe more on their lands for their own conſumption, and to buy leſs of unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry articles imported from abroad. That Farmer who has not money at intereſt, and who can only make both ends of the year meet by his own labors, before he purchaſes any ſuperfluous article for his family, ſhould look into his cellar, corn-barn, &amp;c. and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider whether he has any, and how much grain, but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, cheeſe, &amp;c. to ſpare, over and above that portion which muſt be diſpoſed of, to pay his laborers, taxes, and a number of incidental demands. Let him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon the toil and labor thoſe articles have coſt him, which he will acknowledge to be very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and more than enough to convince him of their value and importance. Let the extraordinary induſtry of the Farmer's daughters, with the profits of a good yard of poultry, bear ſome kind of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the luxuries he purchaſes; and then he will not feel thoſe expenſes ſo heavily, and his affairs will continue to wear a good aſpect.</p>

            <head>Engaging in Law-ſuits.</head>
            <p>THE Farmers of New-England in general, are too apt to contend with each other in the law; and to refer, even the moſt triſling controverſies between them, to the deciſions of Courts of Juſtice. But they ought to guard againſt this ruinous practice, as they would againſt the greateſt diſappointments and misfortunes. For if they will attend to the fruits of this unhappy paſſion, they will ſee that but few, if any, have been benefited, while multitudes have been utterly ruined by it. So great are the unavoidable expenſes of time, counſel, witneſſes, attendance, fees of officers, and ſo many the vexations of mind, that in general, a man had better compound with his neighbor in a quiet and peaceable manner, and give him his coat, although he had previouſly taken away his cloak, than ſubmit to the manifold evils which may poſſibly ariſe from a proceſs in law. But you will ſay, he may gain the cauſe, and then—to which it may be replied, he may looſe it and <hi>then.</hi>— Farther you may obſerve, that there are certain cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, with which you are obliged to be connected occaſionally, who are ſo given to contention that it is next to impoſſible to keep up an amicable correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with them.—They will encroach, deceive, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs and pay no conſcientious regard to their conduct and engagements. Doubtleſs there may be ſuch cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters: but if you know them, it muſt be your own fault, in ſome meaſure, if difficulties ariſe between you and them. It is imprudent to have any great
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:030307_0037_0FE5B09C954FCB98"/>intimacy, or much to do with a man of a diſhoneſt contentious ſpirit. And yet, it muſt be acknowledged, that it may ſometimes be a duty which you owe to the public, as well as to yourſelf, to oppoſe his baſe and diſhoneſt attempts. As, where a man challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges the title you have to your lands, when he might as well claim the lands and tenements of any other neighbor—to oppoſe, and if poſſible, ſuitably puniſh ſuch a character, ſo avaricious and wicked, every man ought always to be ready and willing. Such men in neighborhoods and in ſociety, are like foxes and wolves in a flock of ſheep: and we have to lament the lot of that man who is obliged to come forward, and to expoſe them at his own expenſe. But to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the vexations and expences which unavoidably follow from ſuits and proceſſes in law, <q>ſtudy to be quiet, and to do your own buſineſs—keep your ſhop, and your ſhop will keep you.</q> Avoid tav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erns, horſe-races, ſhooting-matches and gaming-ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. Pay all your little, as well as your greater debts punctually. Give your laborers their hard ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned wages daily, or at leaſt, weekly; and cloſe all your accounts with every man, at the cloſe of every year. Uſe the creatures and goods of your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, when hired, or borrowed, as carefully, or more carefully, than you would if they were your own—be truly charitable, and look upon all men as your bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. Accuſtom yourſelves to do little ſavors for your neighbors, and without any expectations, of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from them. Overlook things ſaid and done by them, when they were angry, miſtaken, or heated with liquor. Never attempt to take the advantage of them, however they may expoſe themſelves; but throw the mantle of charity over their weakneſſes. Remember that you alſo are a man; and that benevolence is the law of your nature. Above all things, make it your
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:030307_0038_0FE5B09E53F131B0"/>ſtudy and endeavour, <hi>to regulate and controul your paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and appetites.</hi> An example of this kind, may be followed by your neighbors; and if it ſhould, it would put an end to contentions of all kinds; and ſave you from the expences and vexations of the law; which, though neceſſary and good in itſelf, may prove the moſt permanent ſource of diſtreſs, to thoſe who raſhly and wantonly engage in it.</p>
            <p>☞ <q>FOR every thing you buy or ſell, let or hire, make an exact bargain at firſt; and be not put off to an hereafter by one that ſays to you, we ſhall not diſagree about trifles.</q>

            <head>Good Neighborhood.</head>
            <p>IT will contribute not a little to the intereſt and the comfort of the Farmer, to keep up a good correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence with his neighbors: and to do this, he muſt keep good fences, orderly cattle, and borrow as little as poſſible. A great part of the contentions which have taken place among neighbors in the country, ſome of which have been carried to the moſt ſerious and diſtreſſing length, will be found, upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, to have originated in poor fences, unruly cattle, and borrowing. A principal object with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good Farmer, is the ſecurity of his crops; and when he has been at great pains and expence in enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his lands on his own part; and his neighbor's cattle, ſheep or ſwine, break in and deſtroy the fruits of his labors, through the inattention he has paid to his part of the ſame, it will give him not a little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs: and repeated inroads, from the ſame cauſe, will bring on a coldneſs, and lead him, at length, to ſeek a redreſs, through the diſagreeable and expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive medium of law. One unruly ox, horſe or ſheep, has proved the ruin of all ſocial and friendly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, between thoſe who had long lived in the moſt neighborly habits and familiarities; the advantages and pleaſure of which, ought not to have been haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arded for five times the value of thoſe creatures. And many Farmers, though rich in lands, ſpend more time in running to their neighbors after ſaws, ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, awls, hatchets, a few nails, and a little wire to ring an hog with, &amp;c. than would purchaſe all thoſe
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:030307_0040_0FE5B0A1CAC362E8"/>articles out right. It muſt be acknowledged, that we are all dependen tupon each other, in a degree; and that every Farmer muſt borrow, occaſionally, or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer; but obligations of this kind do not ariſe one half ſo often from neceſſity, as from mere careleſſneſs, and a want of a manlike attention to things. But if you muſt borrow, take care leſt you abuſe the thing borrowed, and return it immediately after you have done with it; and never depend upon borrowing it, again and again, as many do, but conſider with your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, whether you cannot make, or afford to buy it. A farmer ſhould endeavor, never to be deſtitute of meat, meal, butter, cheeſe, &amp;c. on any day in the year; and it is ſcarcely honeſt to live by wearing out his neighbours tools. But although he ſhould avoid borrowing as much as poſſible, he ought to be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to lend to every neighbor who would return the article lent, in good order, and as ſoon as he ſhould have done with it; and it is a breach of truſt, or, to ſay the leaſt, great neglect in him not to do it. It often proves a great diſadvantage to a Farmer, when he has one or two men in his ſervice, and is engaged in a piece of labor, to have one of his tools in this, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother in that neighbors hands, he ſcarcely knows where to look for them—borrowed of him, perhaps ſix, or ſeven months before, and carried a mile or two out of his way; and which is not an uncommon caſe. On this branch of the ſubject I ſhall only obſerve far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that a man ought to lend to every neighbor, worthy of his confidence, whenever he requeſts the favor, if he can ſpare the article deſired, and to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of no man, but when preſſed by urgent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity.</p>
            <p>I have obſerved, that bad fences, and unruly cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, are often the cauſes of contention between neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:030307_0041_0FE5993AD4F478B0"/>and to theſe fences we may add one or two more, viz. a difference in religious, and in political ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. In regard to the former, it is the privilege and duty of every man to determine for himſelf. And no man who lives "ſoberly, righteouſly and godly," can be a bad neighbor, under whatever donomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of chriſtians, he chuſes to be conſidered. To deſpiſe ſuch a man, and not to feel intereſted in his welfare, and not to treat him with all the love and kindneſs due to a neighbour, although he calls himſelf a baptiſt, or a ſocinian, or an epiſcopalian, indicates a narrow &amp; contracted mind. And the ſame obſervation may be applied in regard to the political ſentiments of your neighbor; and who, ſo long as he continues a quiet and peaceable ſubject of the government under which you both live, deſerves your reſpect and love and candor; although he does not engage in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of the party, which you think proper to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronize and eſpouſe. I only add, that theſe ſubjects deſerve a degree of attention, however trifling they may be conſidered by ſome? not only, as they may reſpect the happineſs of the preſent neighborhood in which you live; but as they may affect thoſe who may come after us: for, prejudices and opinion often deſcendt the third, and even to the fourth generation.</p>

            <head>Education.</head>
            <p>IT is in the power of almoſt every Farmer who lives in New-England, to beſtow ſuch a degree of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation on his children and apprentices, as will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to common reading, writing and arithmetic. And greatly to the diſhonor of the father of a family it muſt be, when his offspring and others under his care, are found to be ignorant of theſe neceſſary and important acquiſitions. And this is but one part of the charge againſt ſuch a character: for, neglected through his inattention and want of care on this head, they themſelves are moſt irreparably injured. It is like taking away a right eye, and cutting off the right arm from thoſe whom natural affection, every hour, admoniſhes him in the moſt perſuaſive language, to guard, inſtruct and foſter in his boſom.</p>
            <p>Conſider this matter in great ſeriouſneſs—After you are gone off the ſtage of life, your ſons are to come forward and to tranſact the concerns of the public: They are to compoſe in part, the legiſlature of the land in which you now live; and to go through the ſame or a more important routine of the public ſervices than you have done. But this will be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible unleſs they have received ſuch a degree of ſcholaſtic education, at leaſt, as is commonly beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and which the public, in great wiſdom and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eroſity offers to every one in this land of light and knowledge. Circumſtanced as they are, I can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of no apology for thoſe Farmers in New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land who do not endeavour to have their children and apprentices inſtructed in all the more common
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:030307_0043_0FE5B0A98D7ED198"/>and neceſſary branches of knowledge; as the means afforded for theſe ends are as common as the manna was formerly, which fell round about the tent doors of the Iſraelites: and of which heavenly food every man might freely gather as much as he wanted, or as much as was neceſſary.</p>
            <p>And yet, through ignorance, covetouſneſs, or ſome other inimical mean, the children of Farmers are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten brought up like the wild aſſes colt.</p>
            <p>Let me requeſt you, who are parents and heads of families, and who are careleſs and unconcerned in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the inſtruction and information of thoſe whom GOD has placed under you, to reflect upon your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; and to conſider how you will be able to anſwer for this criminal neglect to yourſelves, to your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and to GOD. Conſider the days of youthful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence; in which the mind is ready to receive the moſt uſeful impreſſions; and in which, curioſity, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulation, and a deſire of pleaſing and excelling, are peculiarly influential: And if you wiſh to ſee your ſons uſeful, and your daughters reſpectable, give them ſo much education at leaſt, as ſhall qualify them for the common occupations and offices of the country in which you live.</p>
            <p>Do we not ſay, "we ſee?" muſt it not then be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable in us if we walk not agreeable to the light of which we boaſt, and do not endeavor to render, poſterity as wiſe and as happy as we ourſelves are? Then let it never be ſaid, that a man, or a woman born and brought up in New-England, can neither read nor write, nor knows any thing of the uſe and powers of figures. Allow your children time and opportunity for improving in all the common and more uſeful branches of knowledge. A learned ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ucation is out of the queſtion: the writer is plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only for that meaſure of information which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:030307_0044_0FE5B0AB1C71C4D0"/>neceſſary, and which you may, and are in duty bound to beſtow upon them. One would think it unneceſſary to add any thing more on this ſubject: but it may not be amiſs to obſerve ſtill farther, that every Farmer ought to be qualified to keep and adjuſt his own accounts; and which, although tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling in compariſon with thoſe of the Merchant, ought, nevertheleſs, to be attended to with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt exactneſs, if he would do juſtice to himſelf and to his neighbors, and avoid one very fruitful ſource of contention. I add further, that, as young people in general, when the buſineſs of the day is over, will be ready to engage in ſome purſuits of intereſt or pleaſure, the ſous of thoſe Farmers who have been taught to read, write and cypher well, inſtead of ſpending their evenings in idleneſs, or at taverns, may find a moſt grateful and uſeful amuſement, in the peruſal of ſome good author; in endeavoring to improve their hands in writing; or in reviſing their paſt labors in arithmetic. The fact is this, when there comes on a ſtormy diſagreeable change of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and when little or nothing can be done to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage on the farm, and many ſuch days occur eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry year, a young man will not be at a loſs how to employ thoſe leiſure hours to advantage, and to find a moſt agreeable amuſement at home. Theſe neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary accompliſhments of a common ſchool education, have proved a ſource of innocent amuſement to many, and been the means of preſerving them from various temptations and misfortunes. Therefore, if you regard your own happineſs, the innocent amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of your children, and their future uſefulneſs, and would guard them againſt the ſnares of vice, give them a good common education, at leaſt.</p>

            <head>Appendix.</head>
            <p>APPLES, for winter, ſhould be gathered by hand —firſt of October—middle of the day, when fair and dry weather—ſpread thin on a chamber floor, 'till late in November, then barreled up, and put in a cool place in the cellar.</p>
            <p>AUTUMN. In this ſeaſon cart out your ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer dung; and plough all your land to be ſeeded the next ſpring. One ploughing at this time, will anſwer for one in the ſpring, when your team is feeble, and ſave ſpring labor, which is very precious.</p>
            <p>BARLEY ground ſhould be ploughed twice, or three times—ſowed early—two buſhels to one acre— ploughed in immediately after ſowing—no grain is harder to ſprout; and none requires more ripening in the field.</p>
            <p>BEES. Their houſe is too well known to need a deſcription. In May and June they generally ſend forth ſwarms; and to manage them on theſe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, let your Bee houſe be made ſo tall as to admit three tier of hives, one above another. Let the hives be ten inches deep, and 12 or 14 broad. An under hive is made with a round hole through the top, of three inches diameter, covered with a ſliding ſhutter. One of theſe hives ſhould be placed directly under an inhabited hive, before they are diſpoſed to ſend out a new ſwarm. Inſtead of ſwarming they will deſcend
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:030307_0046_0FE5B0AFB54FE360"/>into the hive below; and when that is full, let them find another beneath it; they will take poſſeſſion of the lowermoſt. They begin at the top and build downwards. When a hive is taken up, inſtead of deſtroying the bees, drive in the ſhutter, and run a long thin knife round, to part it from that which is below it: ſlip the hive off upon a ſmooth board, and carry it into your dwelling-houſe, and open one of the windows of the room, after the hive is laid on its ſide. This muſt be done in a cool morning, and when the ſun gets up and the air grows warmer, the bees will quit the hive, and go into the hive next to the place whence they were taken. Thoſe bees which are found among the honey, ſtiff and unable to fly, may be thrown into a tub of water: they will ſoon recover their activity and go after their companions.</p>
            <p>BURNETT grows well on the pooreſt of ground. One acre will yield three loads of hay—cut it twice— forty buſhels of ſeed to an acre—better than oats for horſes—the ſtraw, when threſhed, better than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon hay. Burnett keeps green all the winter, and grows—no froſt hurts it—may be cut and given to cattle in the ſpring, as ſoon as the ſnow is gone, they will eat it greedily. It may be uſed fall and ſpring, as long, and as ſoon as the ground is bare. It would be proper to have paſtures of it.</p>
            <p>CABBAGES require moiſt, rich land. The later taken up the better, in a dry and windy day—ſet them heads down, 'till carried into the cellar, and then heads up, and cloſe together, where they may have a little froſt—warmth ſoon deſtroys them.</p>

<pb n="48" facs="unknown:030307_0047_0FE5B0B25CDCC370"/>weeks. After the firſt fortnight, mix in ſkimed milk, or hay tea, or meal and water. When they are a month old, place ſome ſweet hay in cleft ſticks, and they will ſoon learn to eat it. As ſoon as graſs is grown, turn them out—give them milk and water for a few days, and houſe them for a few nights— they ſhould be houſed early in the fall and kept warm in the winter.</p>
            <p>CATTLE. If you muſt pinch them, do it in the beginning, rather than in the cloſe of winter. They feel the firſt coming of cold weather ſeverely; and the ſpring may open early. It hurts them to graze in the winter—ſhould be confined to the barn yard, and there watered—will ſave all their dung. They ſhould be houſed in cold rains, which hurt them more than the ſevereſt dry cold. To increaſe manure, ſome Farmers keep a numerous ſtock; but the juſt rule is this, no more cattle than will eat all your fodder. In general, one load of hay will make one load of dung. Eſtimate your dung by your fodder.</p>
            <p>CARROTS, ſow on ſandy, or loamy land— plough, or dig 12 inches deep—ſow laſt week in April. A little dung ſufficient to dreſs the ground— will yield abundantly—good for fattening cattle, ſwine and ſheep.</p>
            <p>CLOVER will grow on any ſoil—dry, ſandy, loamy, or gravelly—bears drought better than any other graſs, as it comes forward early, and has a long tap root. Sow ten pounds to an acre—in England they ſow twenty—you may buſh, or plow it in—it requires leſs manure than any other graſs—mow it in June, when the heads are about half turned, and in the morning. Spread, turn and rake it into cocks before night—next day, open, ſpread and turn it once or twice, and cock it again; and let it ſweat a
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:030307_0048_0FE5B0B3EB3D59E8"/>day, or two before houſing. This graſs requires all your attention in making it—it enriches land—laſts but two years, and is the only hay that will fat an horſe without provender. It is moſt excellent for ſwine to feed on—one acre of rich land, well ſet with it, will keep twenty hogs well, from the beginning of May, to the end of October, without any other food: and the ſwine will enrich the land.</p>
            <p>COLT, to break him, never ſtrike, but often lead him by the ſide of another horſe, with a bridle. When he walks well, bring him to trot after him. Then lead him often in the ſaddle. Then put on a ſmall weight, and gradually increaſe it. Then let one hold, and another mount him, and ride after another horſe, in a ploughed field, 'till he learns the uſe of the bit, and will ſtop, or go on at your pleaſure. By this eaſy method you will break your colt, without breaking his ſpirits.</p>
            <p>COW. Great attention ſhould be paid to ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable a creature. At the loweſt eſtimate, her value muſt be more than five pounds per annum. She ſhould be milked morning and evening, at the ſame time in the day, as near as poſſible—when near calv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, put her into a pen by herſelf—when calved, give her warm drink for the firſt two days—if ſhe does not clean, give her a bucket of warm water, in which ſome wood aſhes have been put—card her gently du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the winter, 'till near the time of her calving, then ceaſe. Keep no more cows than you can feed plentifully, both winter and ſummer. Rich paſtures in ſummer, will afford an abundance of milk for but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and cheeſe; and good keeping in winter, will give you fat calves in the ſpring. Farrow cows ſhould have corn as well as good hay, or milking them for twelve months will render them very thin
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:030307_0049_0FE5B0B5CBC69278"/>and poor. In very hot weather cows ſhould be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered three times in a day, and placed in ſhady paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Farmers ſhould bear it in mind, that a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row cow is not ſo profitable by one third part, as one which calves annually.</p>
            <p>CYONS, ſhould be cut in February, or in March, and may be ſtuck in moiſt mud, or in clay. They will keep two, or three months: but I prefer thoſe taken immediately from the tree. Avoid ſuckers.</p>
            <p>DUNG. There are ſeveral kinds of dung, as there are of ſoils on which to lay it.</p>
            <p>ASHES. Beſt for low, moſſy lands, ſpread even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the ground. A few buſhels, ſowed juſt before a rain, a good top dreſſing for an acre—fifteen buſhels a full dreſſing—it will be ſeen for ſeveral years—peat aſhes beſt—fifteen buſhels to an acre. DOOR DUNG for mellons—COW-DUNG for a warm, ſandy ſoil. HOGS-DUNG for flax, corn and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatoes, and for all kinds of vines. HORSE-DUNG for a low, wet ſoil. HUMAN-ORDURE mixed with a great quantity of ſoil, for cold, ſour land, and for recruiting old pear-trees, SHEEP AND FOWLS DUNG, for a wet ſour ſoil. SLAUGH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER-HOUSE-DUNG is very excellent. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide theſe ſeveral kinds of dung, there are other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nures, ſuch as LIME, for a cold, ſtiff clay ſoil, 120 buſhels to an acre—it deſtroys moſs—mixed with green ſward, in layers, the compoſition will be ſit for uſe in ſix months, in ſummer. URINE, OR STALE, is alſo excellent manure, and when ſaved, of as much value nearly, as the dung itſelf of the ſtock. And to ſave it in SUMMER, as ſoon as your barn-yard is cleared out, in the ſpring, take the firſt leiſure hour, and take care to find ſuch an hour, to cart in a large quantity of loom, mud, clay, rubbiſh, broken peat,
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:030307_0050_0FE5B0BB37CB3FB8"/>or even ſand; which will abſorb the urine, and being mixed with the dung, make a moſt excellent ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure. In winter, a great part of the ſtale may be ſaved, if you have a tight floor, by giving the cattle a plenty of litter: every night a freſh layer of chaff, flax-dreſſings, or whatever the barn affords. MUD from ponds, in the opinion of ſome Farmers, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to good dung for Indian-corn, planted on a dry, gravelly ſoil: SEA-MUD alſo is very good; but all kinds of mud are better when laid in the barn-yard and trodden into the dung and ſtale of the cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. They ſhould be ſhovelled into heaps, and lay a few days before they are carried into the fields for uſe. Some Farmers have long and narrow cow-yards by the ſides of roads, or elſewhere, in which they yard their cattle every night; and every two or three days, they plough them deep. This mixture of ſoil, dung and ſtale, is ſaid to be equal to any manure which is made. It muſt be very good for graſs land, ſpread as ſoon as the crop is mowed off.</p>
            <p>EWES. Breeders ſhould have long and fine wool. From October firſt, to November twentieth keep the males from them—feed them well for ſome days before yeaning. Let them have good feed from their firſt going to paſture, 'till the middle of July— this will make fat lambs, and the ewes themſelves will be fit for market.</p>
            <p>FLAX, a moſt uſeful and profitable crop to the farmer—does beſt in moiſt land—at nine pence per pound, one acre will gain ſix pounds clear profit. After the ground is well manured with old and rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten cow-dung, or with the contents of the hog ſtye, plough and mix the ſoil well—it cannot be too much pulverized, and then, in early ſeaſon, which will give the beſt coat to the flax, ſow from ſeven to eight pecks of ſeed on an acre—freſh and new ſeed every
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:030307_0051_0FE5B0BD4AED12C8"/>year, and from a good diſtance, the crop will be the better. Pull it when the leaves are fallen from the ſtalk, and when they begin to have a bright yellow co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, and the bolls are juſt beginning to have a brown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh caſt. If you water rot it, pull it when the bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms are generally fallen. If you dew rot it, when it is done ſufficiently, the coat will ſeparate from the ſtalk, at the ſlender branching parts, near the top ends.</p>
            <p>FOALS, ſhould be fed when weaned, with ſweet hay, oats and wheat bran. For the firſt winter al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low one ſixteen buſhels of oats; afterwards he will do with good hay. A late foal ſhould not be wean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before March, and have oats all winter. Within one month after the foal is dropped, it receives its ſhape, &amp;c. which it will ever after retain—you may then ſee your future horſe in miniature.</p>
            <p>FOWL-MEADOW GRASS does beſt on low lands, ſwamps, &amp;c.—keeps green a long time—bears a great burden—is excellent fodder, eſpecially for horſes, and may be mowed, from laſt of July, to firſt of October.</p>
            <p>FODDERING ſhould not take place 'till really neceſſary; and then only in mornings.—The worſt fodder ſhould be given out in the coldeſt weather.— Never lay ſo much before your cattle as will ſerve to fill them—fodder twice in the morning and twice in the evening. The leavings of horned cattle may be laid before horſes, and the leavings of horſes, before thoſe who divide the hoof; they will eat after each other. If any thing be left in the mangers of the cattle, carry it out into the open air, and ſpread it on clean ſnow. Young and hardy ſtock will winter well on coarſe meadow hay and ſtraw. Every farm yard ſhould have a long ſhed, and a rack under it, in which to fodder in a clean and profitable manner—
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:030307_0052_0FE5B0BED5FF7C28"/>very neceſſary for ſheep.</p>
            <p>GOOSE more profitable than a dung-hill fowl. Pluck your gooſe but once in a year, and at moult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time, or when they ſhed their quills.</p>
            <p>GRAZEING. Kill graſs fed beeves by the firſt of November, for, after that the graſs ſoon loſes ſo much of its virtue, that it will not fatten cattle at all —they will fall away.—Vales for tillage, hill for paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>HEMP requires a rich and well prepared ſoil— bears drought well—plough deep in the fall—dung as for indian corn—ſow as early as the ſeaſon and ſoil will admit—ſow the laſt year's ſeed, three buſhels to an acre. On the laſt of July pull that which has the flowers on it, when growing yellow at the top, white at the root, and the leaves are withered. Put it into a pond, four or five days when it will be rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted enough: then ſpread and dry it in the ſun. Seed hemp is not ripe till five or ſix weeks after, when the ſeeds turn brown: and which muſt be combed out.</p>
            <p>This hemp will require almoſt three times as much watering as the firſt. It may be rotted and dreſſed like flax: when ten, or twelve feet long it may be cut in the middle to make it handy for dreſſing.— Stalks too thick for the break, may be pealed by hand. Hemp is a profitable crop; is liable to no diſeaſe, nor will any creature crop and eat it: and it will grow well in almoſt any northern climate.</p>
            <p>FARM. One hundred acres of land are enough for one—a tenth of that tillage land—much leſs will do near a market town—ſmall farms are beſt, when labor is dear—thoſe which afford a plenty of good ſweet graſs, beſt for a dairy.—Never overſtock your farm—this will prove a great loſs to you—better have fodder left in the ſpring, and lay over for another year—and if you feed cloſe, the ſoil will ſoon become bound.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="unknown:030307_0053_0FE5B0C0B3CB3B48"/>
HERDS-GRASS, as good and profitable as any, Grows well on any ſoil, except ſandy and gravelly, when mixed with clover, as that decreaſſes, this increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſo that the crop of graſs will hold out for ſeveral years—cut it juſt before it goes out of bloſſom, or a little ſooner.</p>
            <p>HORSE, a good one, high neck, full breaſt, and a lively eye—ſtrong back, ſtiff, dark, full buttocks, ribs reaching near to the hips, and rather large hoofs —ſmall horſe moſt profitable: but large ones beſt for the chaiſe and plough—horſes are great eaters— require the beſt of hay and paſtures—a ſmall farm can hardly keep one—if he labors all ſummer ſhould be fed with green graſs mowed, and brought in a baſket, as he wants it—not ſo much trouble as lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him one quarter of a mile to paſture—a ſmall ſpot of long and thick graſs, will feed him; for by the time the whole is mowed over, you may begin again. In this manner cows are fed all ſummer in ſome places; where the ſoil is rich—it ſaves all their dung, and they live well with very little paſture.— This is called SOILING of cattle—in this way, one acre will feed ſeveral cows.</p>
            <p>INDIAN-CORN improves by ſtanding in the field ſo long as there is any moiſture in the ſtalk, or even in the cob—ſhould be harveſted by the firſt of November. When it ripens late, and is uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly green, cut it up cloſe to the ground, and ſet it up in ſmall ſhooks in the field; and it will ripen well, and take no damage. In a dry ſeaſon hoe your corn in the morning and evening. Take your ſeed out of the middle of your faireſt corn—plant no corns with black eyes—put twenty loads of dung on one acre, if ſpread—eight or ten will do in the hole, and produce a tolerable crop.</p>

LAMBS, if they cannot come at the teat, cut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the wool and tags—if the ewe will not own him, ſhut them up together, two or three days, in a cloſe pen. They ſhould not be weaned till ſeven weeks old; and then have the beſt of paſture.</p>
            <p>LANDS worn out by tillage, may be recruited by ſeven or eight years paſturing, only ploughing and ſowing clover, to be fed, not mowed off. Or you may turn up the green ſward, dung it and plant pota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes the firſt year.—Indian-corn, well dunged the ſecond year—lay it down to clover the third year, for two years, plant potatoes the fourth year—flax &amp; corn the fifth year —and then clover. It is not judicious to take two crope of Indian-corn, following each other.</p>
            <p>MARES for breeding, ſhould be ſtrong, high ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, well ſhaped, and of a good color—not breed before they are ſeven years old—go to the horſe in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of June. When with foal, houſed early in the fall; fed well till they foal, and not uſed for two, or three months before that time. They go eleven months, and as many days over that time, as the mare is years old.</p>
            <p>MEADOWS muſt not be fed late in the fall nor early in the ſpring. Poor water graſs ſhould be cut rather before it is grown to its full length, it may be cut a ſecond time.</p>
            <p>MOWING late no advantage, as the days grow ſhorter, and heavies dews fall—but mow cloſe, or you will loſe more than your wages every day you mow. Comeings, as they are called, are a diſgrace and a loſs to the Farmer. Cut the thickeſt graſs firſt; the thinneſt next; and then that which is middling— mow early in the morning, and late in the evening.</p>
            <p>MOWING LAND when bound, if not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to plough it, may receive a ſevere harrowing. A top dreſſing of old cow dung in the fall, or of oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:030307_0055_0FE5B0C8925B1CA8"/>dung in the ſpring, buſhed over to break it ſmall, will increaſe your crop ſurpriſingly as it will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt double; and all mowing land ſhould be thus treated, once at leaſt in every two years. If you do not dreſs them, ſeed off the crop once in three years, never ſeed them in the ſpring, nor cloſe at any time. If your lands be rich the drought will have little ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect upon them, and you will often have two good crops in the year. It is not the quantity of land, but the care which is taken of it, that increaſes hay.</p>
            <p>MEASLES in ſwine, to cure. Take half a ſpoonfull of ſpirits of hartſhorn, two ounces of bole armoniac, mix it with meal and water, and give it in the morning, faſting or when he is hungry; and repeat it four or five days going.</p>
            <p>NURSERY ſhould not be placed on a ſoil quite ſo rich, as that on which the young trees are to be tranſplanted—ſhould not be on a ſpot where large trees have lately growed; nor on a ſoil very wet or very dry. To prepare the ſoil, plough, or dig deep, in the latter part of ſummer. Plant either ſeeds, or ſtones in the latter part of October, Apple ſeeds may be ſowed in the pomace. When two or three years old you may place them in the nurſery, in lines three feet apart, trenching in proportion to the length, &amp;c. of their roots; tap roots, and all ſmall fibrous ones to be trimmed off—take up the ſtock with as many roots as poſſible—let them be placed in the trenches 12 or 14 inches aſunder. Never cut the main branch for the top, ſide or lateral branches ſhould be pruned off, and in proportion to the roots. Let the ſtock ſtand in this poſition, until they are ſix or ſeven feet high— when they will be fit for tranſplanting into orchards, until which time, hoe, or dig among them every ſpring and fall—root out all graſs and weeds, keep off all ſuckers and buds.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="unknown:030307_0056_0FE5B0CA22206F58"/>
OATS cannot be ſowed too early—3 buſhels to one acre—the poorer the ſoil the more ſeed muſt be ſowed on it—plough them twice—once may do— mow them early, the ſtraw not wholly turned yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. Neither rake nor ſtir them in the middle of the day or when they are dry—morning and evening beſt to move them—are apt to ſhell out.</p>
            <p>ONIONS ſow on a moiſt, ſandy ſoil, manure with old rotten cow dung, aſhes, or which is better, with ſoot, ſow laſt week in April—bury the ſeed one inch deep—middle ſized beſt for uſe—hoe them three or four times—when all the greenneſs is gone out of the tops, take them up and lay them in the fun to harden, for eight or ten days—put them in a dry and cool cellar—they bear the cold well—a great ſpirit in them—ſear the ſmall fibrous roots, and they will not ſprout.</p>
            <p>PARSNIP ſow early in March, if poſſible, in a rich mellow ſoil—dig eighteen inches deep—ſet them ſix inches apart—a little fine manure will anſwer— they grow 'till the tops are dead, or killed by the froſt—Dig them in November—neither ſnag, nor cut their tops cloſe—no froſt hurts them when houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed —keep them cold and covered with dry ſand.</p>
            <p>PASTURES ſhould be divided into 4, 8, or 12 acre lots, bordered with trees, not fed 'till 20th of May—feed the drieſt firſt, and ſhut it up in 15 days —beat the dung in it; ſix weeks will recruit it. Every Farmer ſhould have four paſtures at leaſt, in the latter part of October the cattle may run through them all in common; keep up the fences all winter—land grows richer by being paſtured; theſe paſtures ſhould be mowed once in three or four years, and ſome mowing lot be fed, ſeeding paſtures in rotation makes one acre better than two not ſo fed.</p>
            <p>PLOUGHING ſhould never be done when the
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:030307_0057_0FE5B0CBB1B92FE0"/>ſoil is ſo wet that it will not crumble—except green ſward, nor when it is very dry—it is hard, and the furrows will not turn—In general Farmers do not half plough their ground; neither do they plough in the right ſeaſons—by ploughing only, you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore an old field, and bring it to any degree of rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Always plough in your corn when the dew is on. Plough new lands in the latter part of ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, that they may rot well. All tillage land ſhould be ploughed in the fall—indian hills ſplit and deep. All above the pan, will become dark earth, in a year or two—never plough an hill up and down, leſt it waſh and gully away. Ribbing hills, eight or ten feet apart, is beneficial—will catch the rain and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain moiſture.</p>
            <p>POTATOES. The beſt grow in a dry ſoil, but a wet one will yield the moſt. Plough deep, and the more pulverized the earth, the better the crop; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept green ſward, which produces at one plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the greateſt crop of any land. Poor land, well cultivated, will yield 100 buſhels per acre. Hogs dung, mixed with a great proportion of ſtraw, rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſh, &amp;c. excellent manure for them. As they will grow almoſt any where, they are apt to be neglected; but no crop will pay the Farmer better. Cut ſeed better than whole; a middling potatoe will give ſix pieces, with one, or two eyes in each piece: and any part, even the rind, and heart will produce, put three pieces in an hill, ſix inches apart, and cover them deep. The ſhooting part of a potatoe, like a tree; the butt end of it, the ſtump—therefore cut length ways as much as you can, in hoeing do not earth them up too much, and let the laſt heoing he when they are in bloſſom; when parboiled, very good for ſwine, not ſo good raw—they increaſe milk in cows. A gentleman in Nova-Scotia uſed to waſh,
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:030307_0058_0FE5B0D29C2C43D8"/>and cut them, and give them in plenty to his fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening cattle: he informed me, that a buſhed would make a pound of tallow in a creature fo fed.</p>
            <p>SOW. If ſhe will not call for the male, give her a little bit of rennet. Feed her for a few days before ſhe pigs, plentifully; it will prevent her devouring them. She ſhould pig in March or April if the pigs are to be reared.</p>
            <p>SEEDS not natural to the climate degenerate— ſhould be changed annually, if only from one field to another. A conſiderable diſtance better. Flax, and moſt early ſeeds, carried 100 miles north, do well—late ones carried as far ſouth, do well alſo. Corn, barley, oats and ſeeds of all kinds, ſhould be changed every year; it will pay the Farmer fourfold for all his trouble in doing it.</p>
            <p>SHEEP. Buy them, and indeed all cattle, from a ſoil poorer than your own. Buy large boned ones, with long, fine, greaſy wool. Dry land good to feed them on, and ſo are ſalt marſhes. They go with lamb 20 weeks. One male ſufficient for 20 ewes, or more. Propagate thoſe which have large bodies, with long, ſilky wool. Shady paſtures, and free from bruſh, beſt for them. The more a ſheep drinks the faſter ſhe fats. Once fat, kill them, never will be ſo fat again. Waſh them in a warm day, in the middle, or laſt of June. Let them run three or four days in the paſture, and ſweat in their wool, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ſhear them: and then avoid pricking and cutting them. If a cold rain falls ſoon after ſhear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, houſe them. Black wool is never ſo ſtrong, nor fine, as white.</p>
            <p>SALTHAY may be cut one day, cocked the next, and houſed the third—throw ſtraw between each layer, in the barn. A portion of it excellent for cattle in the winter.</p>

SPINDLEWORM on Indian corn, is killed by ſprinkling the corn with a week lye of wood aſhes.</p>
            <p>SWINE, profitable. Every family ſhould keep one, to take off the weeds of the garden, and refuſe of the kitchen. Carrots good for them—ſhould have a change of diet and be fed in a cleanly manner. Some Farmers throw their corn to them in the dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieſt of pens, where it is buried at once in filth, and almoſt entirely loſt. Nothing can be more ſlovenly. Keep them in a ſmall paſture, or orchard, well fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and watered; with a cloſe warm ſtye to retreat to. Keep them always in a middling good plight; yokes prejudicial to them; but no hog ſhould ever be ſeen without a ring in his noſe. Put them up to fatten in September, and kill them middle of Nov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ember or ſooner. He who fats a hog in winter muſt be a loſer—meal better for them than corn—green corn out of the field, excepted. Give them fair wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for drink—the waſh of the kitchen, worſe than nothing for fatting hogs. Let them have no more food at a time, than they will eat up clean. If mangy, pour oil on their backs. Give them litter in plenty, and keep their iſſues open, or they will not fatten. The Chineſe breed very good to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate.</p>
            <p>TURKEY. Plunge the chick into cold water, as ſoon as hatched, or the next day after, and force down one whole pepper corn, &amp; give it to its mother to be brooded, it will be as hardy as the chick of a hen. If they droop while young, view their rumps, and you will find two or three feathers, whoſe quill parts are filled with blood—draw them, and the chick will ſoon recover.</p>
            <p>TURNIP. Sow on a light, ſandy ſoil, not very rich. New cleared land proper. Sow middle of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when the ground is moiſt; not when it is dry.

Waſh it before ſowing, and ſow in the latter part of Auguſt, and never when the earth is very dry. Plough it in with a ſhallow furrow, and leave the land rough.
