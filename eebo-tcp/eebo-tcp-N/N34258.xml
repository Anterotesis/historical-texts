            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               </gap> under every appearance, is not only pleasing, but in many respects useful and necessary. The following account, as it is a discovery made within the limits of our own country, and confirmed by them who were eye-witnesses may with great propriety deserve our notice.—Two gentlemen of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted veracity, viz. Capt. JAMES BUCK<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND, and Mr. JOHN FIELDING, liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in some part of Virginia, agreed to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel into the western parts of this vast coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, to explore the regions which belong to these United States, which are yet unknown

to us. On the 19th of June, 1785, they took their departure. Each of them were armed with two pistols and a long sharp dagger. They were attended by two strong and hearty slaves, armed with muskets.— Both the gentlemen very well understood the rules of Trigonometry, on which are founded the principles of sailing and survey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And carrying with them a compass, they were able to keep their course directly, and pretty well able to determine the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance they travelled. The slaves carried as much provision as they could conveniently, with a considerable quantity of salt, for the sake of cooking venison and other food which they might kill on their way. They passed with much difficuly, the lofty Allegany Mountains. On these mountains they made several important discoveries of Gold and Silver mines, an account of which will be published soon. After leaving these grand and lofty mountains, they travelled 73 days without seeing the least appearance, or even tract of any human being. The country was diversified with hills, mountains, vallies and beautiful rivers. Trees of all kinds and sizes. The large trees grew very tall, and the ground was often covered with amazing thickets of small pine, hemlocks and ivies. This diversity rendered the country agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:044864_0004_101EFF93246A9220"/>
beyond description. They saw wild animals of almost every kind, many of which they killed, some for food and some for cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity, being such as they never saw nor heard of before. At length, having travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed several miles on rising ground, they came to the summit of an high mountain. Here they stopped, and it was the most beautiful prospect imaginable: on every side as far as they could possibly see, they beheld the green groves waving by the gentle gales of wind. Here they spent several hours in refreshing themselves, and viewing the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensive country on every side. They took notice that the ground appeared to be trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and frequente<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> as they supposed, by wild beasts. As they were setting out to go forward, they discovered a small foot path to lead down the mountain between two high ridges of rocks. They were surprised at this, and doubted whether it could be made by wild animals; but as there were no marks of feet, they were at a loss about it. They were fearful about entering, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it was directly in their way, lest they should fall among some dens of wild beasts, which might be too strong for them. After some deliberation, they considered that a <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>irit of cowardice did not become adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>rers. They reviewed their arms and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:044864_0005_101F170E30F7F708"/>
and resumed so much courage as they thought sufficient to encounter the most terrible beasts of the wilderness, and then proceeded down the mountain in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manner, viz. One slave first, then the two gentlemen, and the other slave behind. After they had proceeded about half a mile the path grew brighter; but as the ground was hard and dry, no appearance of feet could be discovered. This descent was truly venerable and august. On each side were the two ridges of rocks at the distance of four or five rods:—Each of them were co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with high trees, likewise small pines and ivies hung bending over the narrow valley in which the path was:—each side was covered incredibly thick with small shrubs:—the taller trees, covered with leaves and thick branches, bent over the valley so that they shut out the rays of the sun. In this situation the travellers not only admired the grandeur in which they were enclosed; but they were filled with anxieties concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the path which still increased:—in this condition they proceeded in a gradual des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent about two miles and an half in a west<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern direction, though in several places the grandeur of the valley was increased by small turnings and circular windings. Then they were surprised with an opening; the ridge
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:044864_0006_101F17282EF1A788"/>
of rocks on the right hand continued, but that on the left did not.</p>
            <p>A large extended level country now open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their view, and the sun being in the western hemisphere, a new day seemed to usher in upon them, which struck them with an agreeable surprise.—In this condition they stood gazing for a moment, then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected the path which had by this time become much beaten. About four rods from them they saw the path turn to the right hand towards the ridge o<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> rocks which was almost perpendicular. They then dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered a hole in the rock several feet square: they stood still for some time viewing it, as they supposed it was a den for wild beasts, when they were supprised with a shape com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out from the rock:—it appeared like a grave old man:—his head was bald, his beard was long and white which covered his breast:—his body was covered with furr and skins of beasts.—He seemed surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to see them, as they were also to see him. —At length, with a grave and solemn voice he spoke. <hi>Friends! Human Forms! From whence, or who are you? Are you Angels or Men?</hi> One answered we are men,—he then waved his hand in token of friendship, and pleasure semed to sit on his countenance:</p>
            <p>With joy, said he, I once more behold
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:044864_0007_101F17101C929728"/>
human shapes.—The travellers stood almost speechless for some time, and when he mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards them, they turned for fear, and made off from him:—at which the old man called with tears in his eyes;—whether do you flee—leave me not—I am an innocent Hermit, I cannot hurt you—I live in this Cave whose mouth you see: they then stood 'till he came and shook hands with them, and expressed such emotions of joy as are difficult to describe.—The Hermit then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted them to his Cave; they were some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what reluctant at first about entering it— but they were however prevailed upon so that they followed him into the Cave, the mouth of which was ornamented on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side with trees and thick ivies, which shaded it;—before it was the wide level country beforementioned, covered with beautiful trees, the inside contained several nice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments, all which seemed to be dug out of a solid marble rock; the walls on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side were adorned with many curious figures of sculpture;—the upper part of the Cave was an arch which gave a small light like a sort of wood we call light-wood or fox fire, which added lustre to the Cave. The Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit seemed overjoyed with his new guests, and their curiosity was much satisfied with him.—He seated them on several smooth
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:044864_0008_101F1729B0371038"/>
stones at the side of the Cave;—he then presented them with some bark, roots, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corns, and several kinds of fruit unknown to them.—They partook of his bounty, and were pleased with his simplicity both of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and diet. They also produced a piece of venison which they had; and desired the Hermit to partake; but he told them very mildly, that he chose not to eat any flesh, that his diet consisted only of such simple food as he had set before them.—After they had eaten, the Hermit said it is night, you will not leave me,—they answered that they were travellers and must depart early in the morning.—Having now became some ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, they asked him his place of nativ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity and how he came there;—the Hermit very freely began and related as follows. My story says he is mournful; but it may be worth your hearing. I was born in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don (as I have been very exact to keep my age) 227 years ago.—My father was a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanick, who placed his affections greatly on me; he put me under the care of a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate gentleman to be educated, where he kept me 'till about 19 years of age, about which time I formed a close connection with a Nobleman's daughter. We made the most solemn protestations to each other of mutual friendship:—When her parents be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came

            <p>I, like a disconsolate person as I was, rov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through different parts of the kingdom: At length I went on board a vessel bound to Italy. Soon after our departure, the mas<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and all the crew except two, were lost in a violent storm. We being unable to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage the vessel, let her drive. After several days we came to land, but whither we know not. The country was uninhabited, which pleased me the more, as solitude was what I sought. I left my companions and betook myself to the wilderness. I took from on board the vessel a gun and all the ammuniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I could find, which I found to be of great importance to me, as I had the good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to procure skins of animals which serv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to cloath me tolerably well. At last Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven brought me to this place where you found me.—Here I have lived alone in contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of the works of nature, and adoring him who preserves me. The reason of my long life and good constitution I cannot ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for, only by the blessing of Heaven, and living on such simple food as I set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you. Oft I ascend this winding vale,

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of the mountain. The beasts of the forest all play before me. Nothing offers violence to me, all the animals are friendly to me, and none durst enter my Cave. Thus the Hermit ended, after which Capt. Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land informed him of the present state of the nation, how some of them had left their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive country, and come to this, which is now called America. At which account the Hermit was not a little surprised.—The e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening being spent, the Hermit could not go to rest without paying divine service to his Creator and Preserver, he gave thanks that he once more had an interview with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man beings, asked for protection and blessings.</p>
            <p>The next day they did not depart as they had proposed, but being so much pleased, they tarried several days. At their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture they used their utmost endeavours to persuade the Hermit to come off with them; but he refused, and said he had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
