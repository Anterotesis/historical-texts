            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>IT is among the misfortunes that attend General Dumourier, to be abandoned by the world; to be the outcaſt of ſociety; to be compelled to fly from city to city to ſeek an aſylum from the rage and madneſs of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen who imagine they will ſerve the public cauſe and rid the world of a traitor if they can but plunge a dagger into his breaſt; and to avoid the wretch whoſe avarice would tempt him to gain the price offered for his blood by the Convention. Compelled to live among ſtrangers under the diſguiſe of an aſſumed name, and to ſubmit to the pain of liſtening to opinions on his conduct, equally ſevere and unjuſt, that are induſtriouſly circulated by the hired journaliſts of the different courts of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, who beſtow their praiſes only on the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful, and every where encountering emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grants, who deteſt him with little reaſon, and as much ferocity as the jacobins, this man, whom Miniſters and Courts received with flattering careſſes When he quitted the army, but afterwards calumniated and perſecuted, for having publiſhed memorials which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained his real and ſerious opinions, at length obeys the call of his duty, by giving to the world the Memoirs of his life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="vi" facs="unknown:026918_0004_0FD25FD36A47EDC8"/>
The moſt extravagant and contradictory tales reſpecting him have filled the journals of Europe, and portraits have been drawn of him ſo unlike each other, that not only his charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but his exiſtence is become an enigma.</p>
                  <p>The Courier of Europe repreſents him with the force of Hercules, the licentiouſneſs of Mark Anthony, the treachery of Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal, the cruelty of Sylla, and the military and political talents of Caeſar; they have alſo attributed to him, the poſſeſſion of immenſe riches in the Engliſh funds. On the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Journal of the Lower Rhine deſcribes him as poſſeſſing talents, but being defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient in judgment. This opinion, Dumou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier regards as true praiſe, for he was never deſirous of being thought ſubtile or practiſed in the art of changing his opinions according to his intereſts. He has always had fixed principles and a determined character. His mind was formed by the ſtudy of Plutarch; and he has mixed too little with men, to be known by any but a ſelect few. Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting during his travels and his wars, he has lived ſurrounded only by his books, and his choſen friends, of whom the greater part no longer exiſt. Far from eſteeming the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xim of the Epicureans, which recommends the concealment of our actions, his whole life ſhall be expoſed to the obſervation and judgment of his contemporaries. He has nothing to loſe by his conduct; already he is poor, calumniated, proſcribed, all that mankind regard as miſerable; but he has every thing to gain, ſince men of elevated
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:026918_0005_0FD25F92EAE73338"/>
and upright minds, who read theſe Memoirs, will become his friends. With ſuch men only he deſires to live, and to whatever na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they belong, he ſhall always regard them as his fellow citizens.</p>
                  <p>The celebrated Dictator Fabius Maximus, he who alone could check the victories of Hannibal, and whom Dumourier earneſtly endeavoured to imitate in his campaign a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the king of Pruſſia, made this obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to Paulus Emilius, when he went with Varro, to command the army, <hi>"Let him not fear who thirſts for glory; for, although we often find that true merit is eclipſed for a time, we have never known it to be entirely loſt; it burſts at laſt through the clouds which encircle it, and appears arrayed in its bright and genuine co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.</hi>"</p>
                  <p>Dumourier thought like Fabius, but their ſituations were widely different. Fabius re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided on his eſtate with his, family, expoſed indeed to the calumnies of a faction, but honoured in the Senate, and by all the ſages of Rome. They ſtill regarded his counſels and preſerved him in the command of the army, nor had ingratitude effaced the many ſervices he had hitherto rendered his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, or deſtroyed the expectation of his ſtill rendering them many more. Fabius was thus enabled to follow the bent of his mild and moderate diſpoſition; and wait, in tranquillity, the progreſs of truth and juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. Such are not the happy circumſtances of Dumourier; and however ſhort a time he may have to live, it will be too long if
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:026918_0006_0FD25FD4E9DE0098"/>
it be ſtained with the injuſtice of the public opinion. Not only therefore for himſelf, his contemporaries, and his country to whom he may one day be uſeful, but in juſtice to his friends, his relations, his advocates, he is obliged to repel the calumnies which follow him, and to diſſipate the cloud which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcures the truth. This he will do by an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and accurate detail of ſuch facts as are important, and of which he was a competent witneſs.</p>
                  <p>For theſe reaſons he is obliged to change the order of his Memoirs, and to ſubmit to the public opinion the third volume, which contains the circumſtances of the year 1793. Theſe are the more important as they will enable the reader to foreſee the iſſue of the ſtrange events that have lately happened in Europe, in ſtudying the nature of their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and cauſes. If General Dumourier have ſtated any of them erroneouſly, his contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poraries are competent to deteſt his injuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, but he has ſurely this great reaſon for ſpeaking the truth, that he may not increaſe the number of his enemies. He deſcribes the French as they really are, and not ſuch as Europe has hitherto regarded them, who ſeem to believe that the whole French na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are without religion, without honour, or humanity. The French are engaged in a bad cauſe. We are compelled to regard them with horror; but prudence will not permit us to deſpiſe them. They have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played a magnificent courage; and, had they followed the opinion of virtuous and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:026918_0007_0FD25F976ECD1440"/>
men, this period of their hiſtory would have been as honourable as it is now diſgraceful and wretched.</p>
                  <p>Unhappily, their licentious exceſſes have deſtroyed the liberties of Europe. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of their misfortunes, has induced every people to believe that they had better wear their chains in peace, than fall into an anarchy that can never end but in abſolute deſpotiſm.</p>
                  <p>There are two queſtions that naturally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent themſelves to which Dumourier's juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation ought to reply, by ſtating the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of his conduct, which appears to be in contradiction with his own opinions.</p>
                  <p>It is aſked, <hi>why did Dumourier, after the arreſt of Louis on the 10th of Auguſt, refuſe to obey the orders that he had received from another general, to make the ſoldiers renew their oath of fidelity to the king</hi>?</p>
                  <p>Dumourier had then under his command <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>0,000 men in the camp of Maulde near Tournay, and the Auſtrians who had a much larger army, were indefatigable in harraſſing his troops. Dillon had been ſent to remove the general in his command. The miniſters were then evidently inimical to the revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; and, as we ſhall ſee in the ſecond volume of theſe Memoirs, purſued a conduct that was the cauſe of the king's misfortunes. The circumſtances of the frightful ſcene of the 10th of Auguſt, were not accurately known in the camp. To engage the troops to renew their oath, according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of General Dillon, was to prejudge

                     </gap> dard of rebellion againſt the nation, and to engage the army in a diſpute reſpecting par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, at the very moment when we had a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign enemy to combat; and the inevitable conſequence would have been to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the unfortunate Louis to the daggers and vengeance of the populace.</p>
                  <p>Again it is demanded, <hi>how can Dumourier juſtify his conduct at the time when a Convention was appointed for the purpoſe of aboliſhing the monarchy and eſtabliſhing a republic, in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the authority of this Convention, giving his ſanction to the deſtruction of the monarchy, and to the aſſumed power of the republic.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was ſhortly after the general's refuſal to give the oath to the troops in the camp of Maulde, that Fayette deſerted from his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and Dumourier was ordered to take the command in his ſtead. The king of Pruſſia entered Champagne with a formidable body of troops; and terror and treaſon enſured his ſucceſs. Longwi and Verdun were taken. Dumourier, being in force in his camp at Grandpre, aſſembled his army at St. Mane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hould. The hiſtory of France does not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſo dangerous a criſis. The 20th of September, the day on which the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion declared France to be a republic, Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourier and Kellerman repulſed the Pruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians, who had attacked them at Valary. The two armies were in ſight of each other and every day threatened to come to an engagement; and this ſurely was not the moment to enter into quarrels reſpecting the

form of government! The enemy were to be driven from the territories of France. The country was to be ſaved. Beſides, the people were incenſed againſt the king, whom they regarded as a traitor. At ſuch a period to have maintained his prerogative, would have been the ſignal for his maſſacre. The people would have looked upon ſuch an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt as an act of treachery, which would have deprived Dumourier of the confidence of his countrymen, and thereby have left France an eaſy prey to the enemy.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as the Pruſſians had retreated, Dumourier began the campaign in the Low Countries, and it was not till he had gaine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

After that period, circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances aroſe ſo extremely contrary to all poſſible expectation, Dumourier's journey to Paris, and the horrible murder of Louis XVI. ſo clearly convinced Dumourier of the guilty aims of the Convention, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placability and power of the Jacobins, that the general reſolved at all hazards to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the cauſe of the country from that of the monſters by whom it was governed. His plan was bold. No other perſon in France had means in his power, for that purpoſe, ſo apparently well founded. But every cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance turned againſt him, and, above all, the inconſtancy of his army.</p>

The apparent contradiction between Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourier's political principles and his mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary conduct have drawn upon him the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt reproaches of many of the Emigrants, and of ſeveral perſons of good ſenſe, who could only judge from their miſtaken view of the facts. As miniſter of foreign affairs, Dumourier certainly has ſhewn a ſincere at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to the Conſtitution; of this his diſpatches, his diſcourſes to the Aſſembly, are an abundant proof. He has equally op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Republicans and Royaliſts. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured the diſmiſſion of three miniſters of the former party, without leaguing himſelf with the court faction, and in conſequence he was expoſed to the fury of the Jacobins, who loudly demanded his being ſent to the priſon of Orleans. The public opinion of Dumourier's principles at that period, was ſo decided, that the following couplet was placed at the bottom of his portrait.
<q>
                        <l>Inflexible ſoutien du trone, et de la loi,</l>
                        <l>Il fut ami du peuple, il fut ami du Roi <note place="bottom">Inflexible ſupporter of the throne and of the law, he was at once the friend of the people and of the king</note>.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Afterwards appointed to the command of the army, he had neither time nor inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to concern himſelf in the intrigues and crimes of Paris. He was ſolely employed in repelling the enemy.</p>
                  <p>He is reproached, however, with never having changed his party, till he was no longer victorious, but the reproach is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt;
<pb n="xiii" facs="unknown:026918_0011_0FD25F9CB09B6F88"/>
for, in the firſt place, he never chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his party, ſince, although he quitted the Republicans, with whom he had been long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted, yet he did not join the Royaliſts; and that no doubt might remain reſpecting his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, he inſtantly proclaimed his deſire of re-eſtabliſhing the conſtitution of 1789. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, his ſentiments were conſtantly in oppoſition to thoſe of the Convention, the Jacobins, and the Miniſter of War, during the time of his expedition into Belgia, from the month of November, as may be ſeen in his correſpondence with Pache, publiſhed in January 1793. In this ſame month of January, he ſent to the Convention four memorials, againſt the tyrannical decree of the 15th of December, and he neither pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented himſelf to the Convention, nor the ſociety of Jacobins; on the contrary, he gave in his reſignation at that period. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, compelled for his perſonal ſafety to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the army, he perſevered in oppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the tyranny and injuſtice of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention. It was on the 12th of March that he wrote the well-known letter to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, which was conſidered by the Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins as ſo great a crime. Hence, before he went to engage the Prince of Cobourg, and to decide the fate of France, and her ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies on the plains of Nerwinde, his quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with the Convention was open and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed. He was proſcribed. He was, therefore, compelled to overthrow the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, or periſh.</p>

The reproach that General Dumourier never quitted the Republican party till he was vanquiſhed, was expreſſed with the greateſt bitterneſs, in a letter written by the Elector of Cologne, to the General, which was publiſhed with a cruel oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which that prince might have foreborne againſt a man then unfortunate and a fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. But ſurely it is to be ſuppoſed, that this Prince will regret the injuſtice done to General Dumourier, when, by the reading of theſe Memoirs, he ſhall be convinced that it is an injuſtice. None of the wrongs the General has endured, has afflicted him ſo much as this, ſince the author of it is held in ſuch juſt eſtimation throughout Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</p>
                  <p>Every nation in Europe muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that its moſt important intereſts are involved in the cataſtrophe of the French Revolution. If the belligerent powers ſhould re-eſtabliſh the monarchy, the vengeance of the nobles, and conſequent proſcriptions will fall on the greater part of the people. But, as the people are fortunately the moſt numerous body, as they have enjoyed the bleſſings of Liberty, and felt the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of holding the ſovereign power in their hands, the triumph of the nobility and clergy, would be but momentary; it will endure no longer than while the foreign troops are enabled to ſupport them. Every day will be productive of freſh rebellions, and another Revolution ſtill more deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="xv" facs="unknown:026918_0013_0FD25F9E5017DF80"/>
and terrible than the preſent, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the people to the exerciſe of the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty. But if, by the imbecility of the allied powers, the National Convention and the Jacobins are enabled to maintain the republic, then will their ſyſtem of frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nization be exerciſed with irreſiſtible ſorce; and finally, not only the neighbouring na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but the moſt diſtant countries will imitate the rebellion of France, and all Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope be reduce to a ſtate of anarchy, while by a grand and rapid Revolution, the exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing governments of the world will be ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened to deſtruction. There is a juſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium, however, which the ſenſible part of the French nation eagerly deſire to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted, and which would inſure general tranquillity to Europe; it is that France ſhould become a limited monarchy.</p>
                  <p>It is to this end the ſovereigns of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope ought to direct their efforts; and it is by ſo doing only they can ſecure the ſafety of the monarch who ſhall mount the throne of France. It is the only bond of univerſal peace.</p>
                  <p>If it be true that the ancient monarchy cannot be reſtored in France, it is no leſs certain that the ſpecies of Democracy, which exiſts there at preſent, cannot be of long duration.</p>
                  <p>Abſtract notions have been too much conſulted in this important matter, which may eaſily be reduced to a few ſimple truths. There is no political conſtitution which will
<pb n="xvi" facs="unknown:026918_0014_0FD25FE031ABE588"/>
not render a people happy, if it be the choice of the people, and if the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be enabled to act without any other reſtraint than that of the law. The monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical form of government is excluſively ſuited to large and populous nations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch only are enabled to provide for the expence of monarchy. The republican form is better ſuited to ſmall and poor coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, becauſe it is adminiſtered with leſs expence. In the former, there is a unity of power, which coſtitutes the perfection of government; and it alſo includes ſecrecy and promptitude, without which great and complicated affairs cannot be ſucceſsfully conducted. Ariſtocracy is neceſſary in a Republic; drawing together the authorities that otherwiſe would be without union, and excluding the tyranny that reſults from the arbitrary will of a people governing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Pure democracy will always pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce an inconſiſtent and ineffectual govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe it neither admits of union of opinions, nor of prudence, promptitude, nor ſecrecy; and it includes in itſelf prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples that beget diſorders among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and are entirely ſubverſive of their happineſs.</p>
                  <p>All the Republics that we are acquainted with, ancient or modern, have been melio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by Ariſtocracy. We muſt not even except Athens, which was devoid of ſucceſs and ſplendor, excepting when its councils were directed by Ariſtides, Themiſtocles,
<pb n="xvii" facs="unknown:026918_0015_0FD25F9FA7DE2570"/>
Cymon, and Pericles; and was reduced to ſlavery, at firſt by Sparta, and afterwards by Philip of Macedon, when the demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy triumphed, and when celebrated men were no longer at the head of its affairs.</p>
                  <p>The civilization of our manners, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of our commerce, our wealth, our luxuries, in a word all the enjoyments on which are founded the ſplendor and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of our age, are oppoſed to the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of a Republic. If we will have a perfect equality among men for the baſis of our political union, we muſt go back to the ſimplicity of the firſt ages, caſt away our advantages, and return to a ſtate of nature. A government founded on equality can be nothing more than the contract of a ſavage people, who, for the firſt time, have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled in ſociety.</p>
                  <p>The French have erred ſtrangely in this reſpect. They compare themſelves to the firſt Romans; but Brutus, in freeing Rome from the Tarquins who were deteſtable ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, in aboliſhing royalty, was better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the intereſts of men, than to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh equality and democracy. He preſerved the royal authority while he divided it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Conſuls, to whom he left the Lictors, the Faſces, and the Ax, as well as all the real attributes of royalty. He new modelled the ſovereign power, by ordaining that the hands which held it ſhould be changed every year. Yet the Conſuls were taken from the Senate, that is to ſay, from
<pb n="xviii" facs="unknown:026918_0016_0FD25FE227BCB6D8"/>
the Ariſtocracy. Afterward, indeed, new changes took place in the government, when bold plebeians attacked the privileges of the ſenate by their decemvirs and tribunes. But the government remained five hundred years an ariſtocracy; and when the people had made innovations, if the ſenate had not conceived the ſublime policy of rendering the Roman people a nation of conquerors, its govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would have reſembled that which we have ſince ſeen in the Republic of Florence: Always feeble, always agitated by civil wars, and open to the invaſion of every ambitious neighbour, Rome would have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, or would have become, a dower, or a heritage like Florence; and ſcarcely would hiſtory have ſpoken of that city, which her ariſtocracy rendered the moſt celebrated of the whole world.</p>
                  <p>But even this ſpecies of republic which Brutus founded, and which may be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as a mixed government, extending only over a ſmall territory, it would have been impoſſible to have re-eſtabliſhed, after the death of Caeſar, or Tiberius, or Nero. The circumſtances of the Roman Empire, at that period, would have deſtroyed the Republican ſpirit in its birth. The bounds of the empire were too much enlarged; the Romans were too rich; luxury, arts, and all the enjoyments that ſpring from them, had ſpread their influence too much to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord with the auſterity of a Republic. And liberty does not neceſſarily demand a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican
<pb n="xix" facs="unknown:026918_0017_0FD25FA590AE8DB8"/>
government. England is a proof, that a people may be free under a monarch. Liberty conſiſts in being free from obedience to all laws but thoſe that the people them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have made. The law is the ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary in which the ſovereignty reſides; and kings or other magiſtrates to whom the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive power is delegated, being ſubject to the law, the people are as free as they can be conſiſtently with their happineſs. Such are the bounds of a true liberty, and all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond is anarchy.</p>
                  <p>Nothing can be better proved than that a republic cannot now be eſtabliſhed, without the deſtruction of thoſe very advantages which diſtinguiſh the age. We cannot ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the object, without confounding pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, and forcing the minds of men to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion by terror and crimes. To be a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public, we muſt firſt be in a ſtate of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archy; but does anarchy conduct to equality and liberty? No. It overthrows all eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed order; and, in the place of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary authority, ſubſtitutes that of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulace, which being directed by leſs reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able principles, neceſſarily exerciſes an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable ryranny: Of which France is an example. The palaces and rich property of the nobility and clergy cannot be equally divided; and they become the prey of thoſe miſcreants that are the moſt depraved and daring, and perhaps, one day we may ſee the Ex-capuchin Chabot, Lord of Chantilly; Bazire, Lord of Chambord, and Merlin,
<pb n="xx" facs="unknown:026918_0018_0FD25FE3762EED08"/>
Lord of Chanteloup; and filling the places of the great Conde, the Mareſchal de Saxe, and the Duke de Choiſeuil. Perhaps we ſhall ſee changes a thouſand times more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant and ridiculous. And what good will reſult to the people by theſe hideous changes? They will ſtill have maſters. But of what a new and contemptible race!</p>
                  <p>This diſaſtrous ſtate of things is at preſent confined to France, but its democratic or rather monſtrous Republic cannot exiſt but by the ſpreading of anarchy among all its neighbours. Thus her intereſt, and every part of her policy, (which ſhe is not even deſirous of concealing) conſiſts in preaching and propagating anarchy. As experience proves that it is eaſy to deceive and betray a people in preaching liberty to them, (ſince it is leſs difficult to create confuſion than to reſtore order), and as the poor are more numerous in every country than the rich and the noble, it is to be feared that, tempted by the example and ſupport of the licentious people of France, all nations will imitate her exceſſes, and turbulence and anarchy become univerſal.</p>
                  <p>This confuſion accompanied with all its miſeries is inevitable, if the foreign powers are unable to ſtop the progreſs of the French Revolution. The forces employed by the allies are ſo great that ſucceſs is infallible if they be directed by wiſdom and prudence. But if the allies abuſe their power and rob the unfortunate family, whoſe defenders they
<pb n="xxi" facs="unknown:026918_0019_0FD25FA730770F08"/>
avow themſelves to be, the exceſs of the French people will be juſtified, and the ſame dangers and misfortunes will again deſolate Europe.</p>
                  <p>General Dumourier has diſcuſſed this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject more fully in another work, which he has delivered to perſons who have promiſed to convey it to the Emperor, and he hopes for the ſake of mankind, that it will not be neglected or forgotten.</p>
                  <p>Although General Dumourier has aſſerted the neceſſity of founding every ſtable go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment on an ariſtocracy, it is not to be underſtood that he would grant all right and privilege to the nobles and nothing to the people. Nobility was in its original the reward of virtue; and the titles, honours, and feudal rights attached to it, are the legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate property of their deſcendants, and nothing could be more unjuſt than to deprive ſuch of the nobility as have not brone arms againſt France of any part of their hereditary rights. But nobles ſhould have no privileges in the eye of the law, either in engroſſing of places, or in exemption from duties. In a free government, all are equal in this reſpect, and a nobleman is a ſimple citizen. He has no juſt claim to the acquiſition of places but by his ſervices, his talents, and his virtues. He has the advantages of education, leiſure, and the example of his anceſtry. Of theſe it is his duty to avail himſelf; but theſe are his only juſt advantages; and in this ſyſtem is to be found the only true equality that has exiſted in any age, or among any people.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="xxii" facs="unknown:026918_0020_0FD25FE683B4F980"/>
It is not becauſe all the members of the Convention, and the generals of the armies of France have been raiſed from among the vulgar that the decrees of the former, or the military conduct of the latter, excite the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain and the indignation of Europe, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are abſurd, criminal, ignorant, and cruel.</p>
                  <p>Certainly a ſtate may exiſt without a king, a court, or a nobility; but it is not true that a great and powerful nation can exiſt without nobility; for nobility being the reward of virtue, becomes a motive not eaſily to be deſtroyed in the deſcendants of the virtuous man.</p>
                  <p>This applies only to nobility, as it exiſted in its origin, for that which is ſold by kings is a wretched abuſe, the offspring of the ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice of kings, and will ceaſe of itſelf as a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous vanity, when titles ſhall no longer be attended with pecuniary privileges, which the public opinion has forever abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in France, and which if an attempt be made to reſtore it by foreign powers will but ſerve to produce another Revolution.</p>
                  <p>The ariſtocracy that General Dumourier regards as neceſſary to all government is that of virtue and talent. To govern men, to fit in judgment upon crimes, or to decide on queſtions of property, to inſtruct men in the duties of religion, to conduct the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of a great empire in war, are employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that muſt be ſtudied as other employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are. The declaration of the Rights of Man, and the Conſtitution to which it
<pb n="xxiii" facs="unknown:026918_0021_0FD25FA8B1B82A28"/>
ſerved as a baſis, will inſtruct the future king of the French, in what manner it is his duty to ſelect thoſe who are to aid him in the government of the kingdom. The right of chooſing ſuch men is the nobleſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute of royalty. Let us examine that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime Conſtitution, and we will find that no condition can be found more happy for a wiſe and virtuous man than that of a king of France.</p>
                  <p>Frenchmen, liſten to the temperate and informed part of Europe, again adopt with ſincerity, that true code of philoſophy, and your monarch will be reſpected and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, your nobility will again become wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of their anceſtors, your clergy pious, worthy, and uſeful, and you will become the happieſt nation of the earth!</p>
                  <p>Such is the zealous wiſh of a man whom you would deſtroy, becauſe he ſaved your country, and has always ſpoken with ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; whom the emigrants load with calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, becauſe in quitting his country he would not turn his arms againſt her like themſelves; whom the miniſters of foreign courts declared to be a dangerous man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he aſſerts that the ſovereign power re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides in the people.

                  <head>BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE LIFE OF GENERAL DUMOURIER. EXTRACTED FROM A LETTER WRITTEN TO A FRIEND.</head>
                  <p>—AT preſent, my dear friend, let us quit theſe abſtract notions, too ſublime to be the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſubject of a letter, and let us enquire what is the reſult of ſuch principles. It is that we ought to do all the good we can in our ſtations: to be humane: but, above all, to be juſt. It is never our duty to enquire what the opinions of men reſpecting us will be, and our actions ought never to be influenced by an attention to the queſtion of what may be thought of them. It is in times of great public commotion, during the revolutions of empires, that this principle ought to be maintained with the greateſt firmneſs. It is then that the juſt man will call forth his talents to ſave his country, exert his genius to repreſent the dangers of exceſs, and his courage to ſtand between the nation and a great crime.</p>
                  <p>He will be hated and perſecuted by all parties, ſince he will not flatter the paſſions of faction; but he conſoles himſelf in recollecting that he performs his duty. Perſecutions appear but an incident that he was to expect; and he ſupports them with fortitude, becauſe he knows they are the effect of miſtake that cannot be laſting.</p>
                  <p>Hiſtory reſtores the virtuous man to his juſt rank among his fellow-citizens. My enemies cannot deny that I have acquired great military ſame; but, to obſcure it, they paint me as a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
<pb n="xxvi" facs="unknown:026918_0024_0FD25FE9EFBCC788"/>
immoral, unprincipled man. They would drive me from the theatre of Europe to make room for meaner actors. I am willing to remain a ſpectator of the ſcene, but I cannot conſent to deſcend from the ſtage with opprobrium. Theſe conſiderations have driven me to two deciſive meaſures. The firſt, to publiſh the facts that juſtify the latter period of my public life, which has been the moſt calumniated. The ſecond, to deliver myſelf up into the hands of the emperor, who, inſtigated and deceived by the groſs Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of my perſecutors, has given orders to have me arreſted. Prudence perhaps would dictate a different conduct on my part, but duty reſts on other calculations. Theſe are mine: that this valuntary ſurrender of myſelf into his power ought to convince the emperor of my innocence, and incline him to lay aſide his prejudices. He is repreſented as a juſt man; I believe him to be ſuch. He will value the confidence I place in his character, he will produce the accuſations they have urged againſt me, and I ſhall prove their falſehood. Theſe memoirs will have appeared, in the interval, to juſtify me to the world; and, having gained the confidence of a monarch even more than any other intereſted in the re-eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of peace and order, I may again render ſervices to humanity and my unhappy country. Should the emperor refuſe to hear my juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and conſign me to the oblivion of a priſon, I ſhall only have to ſuffer and to die. But this hiſtory of my life will vindicate my name. The conſequences of the treachery and injuſtice of my perſecutors will fall on themſelves; and the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror himſelf will regret me.</p>
                  <p>In the approaching month, I ſhall be fifty-five years of age. Shall I really ſuffer leſs, if, by ſhamefully concealing myſelf, I can eſcape a few days of reproach or impriſonment?</p>

I will now give you a ſhort hiſtory of my life, which may ſerve as a ſupplement to my memoirs, if I am not allowed time to finiſh them. I was born at Cambray in 1739, of parents not affluent, although noble. My father was a man of great virtue and underſtanding; he beſtowed on me a very careful and extenſive education; at eighteen years of age I became a ſoldier; and at two-and-twenty I was honoured with the croſs of St. Louis, and had received twenty-two wounds.</p>
                  <p>On peace being made in 1763, I began my tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, to ſtudy the languages and manners of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent nations. The Emigrants have ſaid, that at this time, I was employed as a ſpy by the French miniſtry. It is not improbable that the <hi>petit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maitres</hi> of Tarentum and Athens (if there were any ſuch men there) have ſaid as much of Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras and Plato.</p>
                  <p>In 1768, I was put upon the ſtaff belonging to the army in Corſica; and, having ſerved with reputation in the two campaigns of 1768 and 1769, I was raiſed to the rank of Colonel.</p>
                  <p>In 1770, the Duke de Choiſeuil appointed me miniſter to the confederates of Poland; and I commanded a body of men in that country during two campaigns, and conducted ſeveral very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant negotiations with various ſucceſs. As the meaſures of the confederates were ill concerted, their revolution was unfortunate, and ended in the partition of Poland.</p>
                  <p>In 1772, the Marquis of Monteynard, miniſter of war, employed me in correcting and reviſing the military code of laws; at the end of the ſame year, this miniſter by the expreſs order of Louis the XV. entruſted me with the management of a ſecret negotiation relative to the revolution in Sweden; but, having received my inſtructions on this affair immediately from the king himſelf, and unknown to the Duke D'Aiguillon, miniſter
<pb n="xxviii" facs="unknown:026918_0026_0FD25FEB9C49AB30"/>
of foreign affairs; I was arreſted at Hamburg in 1773, and conducted to the Baſtile by the orders of that miniſter. The irreſolute Louis XV. yielding to the importunities of Madame du Barry his miſtreſs, and the Duke Aiguillon, diſgraced the virtuous Monteynard, forebore to inform the Duke of the authority he had given me to nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate, and ſuffered me to bear the weight of a criminal proſecution, which the Duke D'Aiguillon ſuſpecting the truth, feared to carry to all its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity. I rejected offers of friendſhip and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection made me by this deſpotic miniſter whom I did not eſteem; and after lying ſix months in the Baſtile, I was baniſhed to the Caſtle of Caen for three months.</p>
                  <p>Louis XV. died ſoon after; and D'Aiguillon was diſgraced. I had no inclination to take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the expiration of the <hi>Lettre de Cachet,</hi> for the purpoſe of regaining my liberty; I was anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to be completely juſtified, and therefore peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Louis XVI. to remove me to the Baſtile and to order a reviſion of my trial. The king would not permit me to remain in priſon, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded M. du Muy, M. de Vergennes, and M. de Sartine to reviſe the trial, and thoſe three miniſters ſigned a declaration that I had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly proſecuted. Immediately after I was ſent to Liſle, in my rank of colonel, to make a report reſpecting the new military manoeuvres which the Baron de Pirſch had brought from Pruſſia. I had alſo a commiſſion to examine a plan for improving the navigation of the river Lys, and another plan of forming a harbour in the channe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> of 1775.</p>
                  <p>In 1776, I was joined in a commiſſion with the Chevalier D'Oiſy, captain of a man of war, and Colonel la Roziere, one of the ableſt engineers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Europe, to determine on a proper place in the channel for the conſtruction of a naval port. I paſſed the year 1777, in the country twenty leagues from Paris. It is the only period of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in my life. At the end of that year, I was invited to Paris, by M. de Montbarey, miniſter of war, on account of the rupture between England and her colonies, which I had long predicted.</p>
                  <p>In 1778, I procured the office of commandant of Cherbourg to be revived and given to me. Being perſuaded that Cherbourg was better calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated that any other place in the channel for a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional harbou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, and being aided by the zeal, acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and influence of the Duke d'Harcourt, governor of the province, I obtained a deciſion, in favour of Cherbourg, of a queſtion that had been agitated during an hundred years, concerning the preference to be given to Cherbourg or La Hogue, for the ſite of a naval port. From that time till 1789, I was occupied in ſuperintending the works of Cherbourg; and, during that period, I was but three times at Paris. When I firſt arrived at Cherbourg, it contained no more than ſeven thouſand three hundred inhabitants, and when I quitted that place it contained nearly twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand inhabitants.</p>
                  <p>The emigrants, not contented with ſaying I was a ſpy from the miniſtry while I was on my travels, have alſo reported that I was employed by the war office as one of the tools of its ſecret intrigues, although the time that I have paſſed at Paris, in the different journeys I made to that place during twelve years, did not altogether amount to ſix months, and although in theſe journeys I very rarely viſited Verſailles.</p>
                  <p>Let us review this hiſtory: twenty two wounds received in battle, ſix campaigns made in Germany, two in Corſica, and two in Poland, important truſts diſcharged, a city raiſed from obſcurity to a
<pb n="xxx" facs="unknown:026918_0028_0FD25FEE365DFBE8"/>
flouriſhing condition, a naval port eſtabliſhed, fortified, and rendered fit for the purpoſes of the navy, twenty years ſpent in travels, that had a knowledge of mankind for their object, and in fine the ſtudy of languages, of the military art, and of the policy of nations; ſuch are the events of which it is compoſed. It will be happy for France if ſhe produce many ſuch deſigning and ſelfiſh men. If thoſe who were called by their birth, their wealth, and their dignities to maintain the honour; and produce the happineſs of their country, had qualified themſelves with equal care, France would either have needed no revolution, or the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would have been more happy and honourable.</p>
                  <p>For my part, the revolution was not neceſſary to raiſe me to dignities. I ſhould ſoon have been lieutenant-general in the ordinary courſe of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion, and was on the point of receiving honours that men at that period ſought after. I poſſeſſed an income of 20,000 livres, which was equal to my wants and deſires. Yet I could not but ſee that France was diſgraced abroad, and ruined within. I foreſaw that ſhe haſtened to this latter period of her miſery; and have often warned thoſe of the miniſters, whom I eſteemed to be honeſt men, of the event.</p>
                  <p>When the revolution commenced, I deprived its character of much of its evil in the place where I commanded. At Cherbourg, the exceſſes of the populace were puniſhed by me with death; but the people could not accuſe me of being inimical to their liberty. Thoſe who were placed in like ſituations would have rendered an ineſtimable ſervice to their country, in exerting the ſame firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with the ſame diſcernment.</p>
                  <p>The military governments of towns in France being ſuppreſſed, I went to Paris, where, during two years, I ſtudied the influence and character of the revolution. The flight of the princes of Franco
<pb n="xxxi" facs="unknown:026918_0029_0FD25FB4B4D60428"/>
was an irreparable injury done to the cauſe of the king. I foreſaw that the exerciſe of the <hi>Veto</hi> would not produce the end that was propoſed by it, and would occaſion the ruin of the monarch's cauſe, and I oppoſed it by all the means that were in my power.</p>
                  <p>In 1791, I was appointed to the command of the country from Nantes to Bourdeaux. At that period a religious war raged in La Vendee, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple laid waſte the caſtles and lands of the nobility. I had the good fortune to calm the minds of the people, and to preſerve tranquillity in that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try till the month of February, 1792, when I was recalled to Paris, was raiſed to the rank of lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-general, and appointed miniſter of foreign affairs.</p>
                  <p>I am reproached with having cauſed the war by my counſels; but I ſhall prove that the war was already inevitable, when I began my adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that indeed it might be ſaid to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced. I acknowledge, however, that my opinion was decidedly for the declaration of war, as was alſo that of the king, who, not only approved of my memorial to the National Aſſembly on that ſubject, (which was three days in his hands) but made corrections in it, and himſelf compoſed the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe he delivered to the aſſembly on that occaſion.</p>
                  <p>At the end of three months, finding myſelf em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſed by the various factions, and being ſincerely deſirous to ſee the king's council poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing proper dignity, and his meaſures governed by conſtitutional principles, I changed the miniſtry, and obtained a promiſe that the king would ſanction two decrees which appeared expedient to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. Having done ſo, I would have retired from the adminiſtration. The king would not grant me his permiſſion; the miniſtry was again changed by his order and I took the war department. But,
<pb n="xxxii" facs="unknown:026918_0030_0FD25FEF4D38F6C8"/>
ſoon perceiving that the court had deceived me, I reſolved not to be the inſtrument of their intrigues. I predicted to the unhappy king and queen all the misfortunes in which they were involving themſelves, and I gave in my reſignation three days after being appointed miniſter of war.</p>
                  <p>I was not driven from the councils of the king as the emigrants have aſſerted, but reſigned in oppoſition to the entreaties of Louis. He was two days before he would accept of my reſignation, and he did not ſuffer me to depart without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the deepeſt regret.</p>
                  <p>After that period, I commanded the armies with the greateſt ſucceſs. If the French had diſplayed as much moderation and virtue as they have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed of ſucceſs, peace had been long ſince reſtored to Europe; Louis would have been on his throne; and the nation would not have been, as now, ſtained with crimes, and the ſlave of anarchy. France would have been happy and illuſtrious under her conſtitution and her king.</p>
                  <p>I have now, my worthy friend, given you a ſhort hiſtory of my life, and it will ſtand in the place of one more circumſtantial, if opportunity be not given me to prepare a fuller account for the public. My heart is unburthened in ſending you this letter. Here, I wait the orders of the emperor, and the deciſion of my fate, without inquietude. My mind, far from being weakened is fortified by diſaſters; and I ſhall be always myſelf.</p>

                     <p>IN the early periods of the Revolution we have ſeen the French combating for their indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with courage. But there was too much vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in their mode of acquiring liberty to afford any hope that they would enjoy either that or their ſubſequent ſucceſſes with moderation. Having been hitherto victorious, they had no doubt that they were now invincible. They no longer thought of maintaining the good-will of a people who had received them with open arms. They beheld no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but conqueſts before them; and, while they tyrannized over the minds of their newly adopted brethren by turbulent clubs they robbed them of
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:026918_0032_0FD25FF0A9E422E8"/>
their property and left them without any ſpecies of liberty either moral or phyſical.</p>
                     <p>Every perſon of character and political expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience had retired from the management of affairs, to eſcape the perſecutions of an <hi>Ochlocracy</hi> that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned under the ſanction of the dreadful ſociety of Jacobins. The King was in priſon. The worthy of every deſcription were perſecuted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the names of Feuillans, Moderes, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triguers. The conſtitution was deſtroyed. Paris was in the hands of the federates, invited there by the Girondine party, but who, on their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival at Paris, had been gained by the Jacobins. Theſe federates now threatened to bring to the ſcaffold Pethion, Briſſot, and all the leaders of the Girondine party. But their threats were loudeſt againſt General Dumourier, whom Marat, Rober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpierre, and the other heads of the Jacobins pointed Out as the inſtrument and protector of that party, then diſtinguiſhed by the name of <hi>the politicians</hi>

To this end his army was his only engine; and it will ſoon be ſeen how little there was to be relied on.</p>
                     <p>France at the period of which we are now ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, aſſumed an appearance of proſperity that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and elated the people; and more eſpecially, the predominant party. But ſhe had rendered herſelf odious to foreign nations; and was, in
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:026918_0033_0FD25FBC420B8B58"/>
truth, divided and weakened within herſelf. On the ſide of Italy, the French army was extended among the Alps by the acquiſition of Savoy; and was further aggrandized by the addition of the county of Nice. Theſe territories had incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated themſelves with the Republic, but violence alone was the author of the union.</p>
                     <p>Clubs compoſed by a few corrupt men, who could exiſt only by a change in the government, were eſtabliſhed in every city by the Jacobin ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers that were ſcattered throughout the different armies. Their violent reſolutions at once acquired the validity of law. Queſtions were not even put to the vote. Every thing was carried by menaces and force. And patriotic addreſſes arrived at Paris from the foot of the Alps, from the mountains of the principality of Baſle, from Mayence, Liege, and the cities of Belgium. The National Convention believed, or affected to believe, that the bleſſings of our condition were aſcertained by foreigners ranging themſelves under our colours.</p>
                     <p>Geneva became a club inſtead of a republic. Claviere gave a looſe to old reſentments that he harboured againſt his country; and being appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed miniſter of finance by the Girondine party, he ſacrificed General Monteſquieu, who, in diſcharge of his duty as general of the army in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of Geneva, had attempted to ſave that city and Switzerland from the baneful influence of the Jacobins.</p>
                     <p>The principality of Porentruy, deceived by Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet biſhop of Paris, and by his nephew Ringler, two deſpicable adventurers, had alſo incorporated itſelf with France, and had adopted its dangerous reveries.</p>
                     <p>Cuſtine was maſter of Worms, Spire, and Mayence; but he had neglected to enter Coblentz, and had evacuated Franckfort, after having excited the deteſtation of the inhabitants againſt the ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:026918_0034_0FD25FF229318070"/>
and turbulence of a people in whoſe hands the torch of philoſophy had lighted up the flames of diſcord.</p>
                     <p>Between Cuſtine's army and that commanded by Dumourier in the Netherlands, another had been placed under the orders of General Bournon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville. But this army had been nearly annihilated in a diſgraceful expedition undertaken by its gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral againſt Treves, after he had loſt the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of attacking that city with advantage. One third of his army being thus deſtroyed, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder retired for the purpoſes of recruiting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to cantonments in Lorraine. The Pruſſians and Auſtrians took poſſeſſion of the intervals left open by this retreat; and their poſition, connected with Coblentz, Treves, and Luxembourg, entirely cut off the communication between Cuſtine and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourier; ſo that there was no longer any concert in the efforts of the two armies. And indeed Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourier's plans had already been deranged by the ſtupid pride of Cuſtine, by the ignorance of the convention, and by the treachery of Pache, Meu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nier, and Haſſenfratz, who having the direction of the war department and reſolving to ruin Dumou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier, had diſorganized the armies and with-held their means of ſubſiſtence.

The latter was not more than 15,000 ſtrong. The two armies occupied Aix-la-Chapelle and the banks of the Meuſe. Clubs agitated all the cities of Belgium. The convention had ſent commiſſioners to execute the odious decree of the 15th of December, that ſequeſtered the public property of Belgium; and ſo had fruſtrated the hopes of uniting thoſe rich provinces to the French republic although that union was the very object of this oppreſſive decree. But the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:026918_0035_0FD25FBDAFF0C038"/>
were eager to ſeize on the wealth of Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gium previous to any union. Such was the plan of the financier Cambon; and he boaſted of the project.</p>
                     <p>The immoral and ferocious diſpoſitions of the ſix commiſſioners employed in this affair were well calculated to ruin the ſcheme. Danton was a man of great energy of character; but was without edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and equally deteſtable in mind as he was coarſe and diſguſtful in appearance. La Croix was an adventurer, a debauchee, and a braggart; and was deſtitute of all ſenſe and honour. Camus, the moſt rugged, haughty, aukward, and pedantic of the Janſeniſts. Trielhard, little differing from Camus. Merlin of Douay, a well-meaning man; but ſplenetic, and infected with extravagant and theoretic notions. And Goſſuin, a monſter of a brutal and ſordid ſpirit <note place="bottom">Theſe portraits ſeem to be drawn with too much ſeverity. If much may be ſaid againſt theſe deputies, it is alſo well known that they have rendered many ſervices to their country.

                     <p>To theſe commiſſioners were joined thirty-two others named by the executive council, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended by the club of Jacobins at Paris. The greater part of theſe aſſiſtants were miſcreants who came only to maſſacre and pillage throughout the rich provinces of Belgium. They over-ran the unfortunate country; and while, by the terror of
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:026918_0036_0FD25FF859006BD0"/>
ſabres and fuſees, they drove the inhabitants to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand their being incorporated with the French republic, theſe men plundered the churches and palaces, emptied the coffers and ſold the furniture of all who fell under their diſpleaſure, and whom they marked with the odious name of Ariſtocrats; and whom often conſiſting of fathers of families and old men, and women and children, they ſent as hoſtages into the fortified towns of France.</p>
                     <p>The north and weſt of France began to unfold the ſeeds of diſcontent againſt this bloody and horrible anarchy. The revolters of La Vendee were not however dangerous as yet; and there had been no difficulty in cruſhing them utterly, if any foreſight had exiſted in the National Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or in the Councils of the executive power. But what is to be expected from a government in which while the wiſe heſitated, mad men ſtep in and decide.</p>
                     <p>Two factions equally attrocious, the Mountain, and the Girondine party, divided the Convention.</p>
                     <p>The former, made up of the moſt furious Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins, neither palliated their wicked principles nor their crimes. They ſpoke of nothing but blood and death. And, being without capacity to govern, having neither knowledge nor digeſted plan, they would ſuffer no dominion whatever. Not even the principal men of the faction could boaſt of ruling it; and the liberty of the faction conſiſted in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archy.</p>
                     <p>The other faction, compoſed of metaphyſicians and intriguing ſtateſmen, had long abuſed the ſuperiority acquired hy their talents, and their more cultivated education. They had treated the Jacobins with diſdain. The executive council was their inſtrument. And they imagined they ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely held the reins of government. But the Convention had been diſguſted by their inſolence and pride; and it was known, that this faction
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:026918_0037_0FD25FBF534405A8"/>
were the enemies of royalty only becauſe they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired to fill its place. Hence the independent part of the aſſembly, thoſe men who execrated the atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities of the Jacobins, ſtood yet more in fear of the ambition of Condorcet, Briſſot, Pethion, Genſonne, Guadet, Vergniaux, &amp;c. And thus all other parties became united to humble the preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Girondiſts.</p>
                     <p>The meaſure of bringing the unhappy king to trial, reſulted from the hatred of the two factions. It ſerved them mutually for food; but the Giron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſts have too late diſcovered how fatal it has been to them. Louis, the victim of their ambition and of their cowardice dragged them down in his fall, and left the field open to the triumph of the Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobins.</p>
                     <p>The factions that ſplit the aſſembly, divided the departments alſo; each eſpouſing the paſſions of their deputies. Bourdeaux, Marſeilles, and Lyons, hated the Mountain; and were the firſt to begin an oppoſition, that has ſince degenerated into a civil war.</p>
                     <p>The Pyrennees and the inclemency of the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſtill ſecured the frontier provinces of Spain; and that kingdom, at its leiſure, collected the forces that were afterwards directed again Rouſſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon; while the Convention, occupied entirely by their own quarrels, and by the ſtate of Paris, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided none of the means of repelling the attack.</p>
                     <p>Paris, the moſt miſerable and moſt guilty city that has exiſted, thought herſelf the rival of Rome, becauſe in the ſpace of a few months, ſhe had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the ſcene of crimes, maſſacres, and cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrophes, that were the accumulation of ages in the capital of the Roman empire. Forty theatres, always crowded, amuſed her trifling, cowardly, and cruel inhabitants; while a ſmall band of vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains, no leſs ridiculous in their pretenſions, than barbarous in their deeds, ſupported by two or
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:026918_0038_0FD25FFA75047E98"/>
three thouſand dependants, the outcaſts of the provinces, and many of whom, indeed, were not Frenchmen, deſtroyed the memory of the maſſacres and horrors of each evening by thoſe of the ſucceeding morning. The frightful cavern of the Jacobins vomited forth every ill, and ſpread terror through every houſe. All men of property trembled, and citizens, who, in peaceful times would have been mild and virtuous, hardened their hearts againſt pity, and were ready to applaud guilt, leſt they ſhould become its victims. All who had the remains of virtue or ſhame were fled or were driven from the adminiſtration of the department, of the municipality, and of the ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. An inſallible ſign always precedes the fall of nations. Then good men hide themſelves; and the wicked and violent alone remain in the conduct of affairs. And in this criſis, it is not even in the power of ſupernatural aid to ſave the people from the effects of public phrenzy.</p>
                     <p>Such was the terrible ſituation of France in the beginning of the year 1793. Such is the gulph to which democracy leads, when the populace takes the place of the nation, and tyrannizes over it by the Oligarchy of a few depraved wretches ſelected from the refuſe of the people. At Rome a ſenate, during many ages, controuled popular vehemence; and directed it, not towards happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but to the aggrandiſement of the nation; for Rome turned her arms abroad, that ſhe might not deſtroy her own offspring. France has no ſuch counterpoiſe as that of the Senate of Rome; and the want of virtue in the governing party can bring nothing but diſgrace and misfortune on her head.</p>

                     <p>ALTHOUGH the political condition of France had even poſſeſſed more ſolidity, and had been regulated by a prudent aſſembly, although France had gained the hearts of the nations to which her arms had opened her the way inſtead of having diſguſted them by a tyranny more of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive than that of a formal deſpotiſm, it had been impoſſible that this new Republic ſhould ſupport herſelf againſt the intereſts of the whole of Europe, unleſs ſhe had eſtabliſhed a military ſyſtem capable of making head againſt a univerſal attack upon her territory by ſea and land. The National Convention, never miſtruſting themſelves on any ſubject, becauſe they were ignorant of the political combinations of things, iſſued a decree on the 19th of November, 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>92, againſt every deſpot in the univerſe, and invited the people every where, to throw off their yoke; promiſing them protection and fraternity on condition of their adopting the French Syſtem. But they ought to have humbled the Empire, Pruſſia, Spain, and Ruſſia, before they made ſo proud a declaration. A juſt aſſembly, an aſſembly regarding the rights of man united in ſociety, (for man in ſavage ſtate has no rights, and a ſtate of nature confounds all rights) would have perceived ſuch a decree to have been unjuſt. The maxim of <hi>compelling men to come in</hi> is not more philoſophical in a ſocial view, than it is in theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy. The Jacobin preacher is not leſs unjuſt, than the preacher of the church of Rome; and it is unbecoming of liberty to be propagated, like the alcoran, by the ſword.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="42" facs="unknown:026918_0040_0FD25FFC5F004780"/>
But in taking the violent ſtep of the 19th of November, it will at leaſt be ſuppoſed, that the Convention, deſiring to range all men on the ſide of liberty, had taken due precautions that the decree ſhould be ſomething more than a vain and dangerous boaſt, and conſequently that they had placed their military eſtabliſhment on the ſtrongeſt footing. General Dumourier, on becoming mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the war department (which ſituation he held but three days, being appointed on the 13th and quitting it on the l6th of June, 1792) read a bold memorial to the National Aſſembly, proving clearly, that they thought not of the army, and that far from placing it in a ſtate to ſupport the war, they were trifling with the public liberty and ſafety. This memorial was forgotten. The cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign was begun. The General's ſucceſs which ought to have gained him the confidence of hi fellow-citizens, if no further yet as far as reſpected the military department, ſerved merely to throw ſuſpicion on every advice he gave them. They not only altered his plan of the campaign, but they were deſirous of retarding his too rapid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs. The Girondine party frankly told him, they ſhould be extremely ſorry to ſee him force the enemy too promptly to demand peace, ſince they feared the conſequence of the return of the army before they ſhould have finiſhed the conſtitution.</p>
                     <p>The Jacobins, who ſuppoſed the General to be connected with the Girondine party, accuſed him of ambition. Their contemptible journals, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that of Marat, affected to make him at one time dictator, at another Duke of Brabant, and at another head of the Orleans faction, and under this laſt fiction, deſcribed him as intending to place the eldeſt ſon of the infamous and odious Philip, on the throne. Nothing could be more contradictory than theſe calumnies; for if Dumourier deſired to be dictator, he ſurely was not the ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of Orleans; if his aim was to be Duke of Brabant, he had then an intereſt foreign to the party in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues of his country. But the abſurdeſt accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were ſufficient in France to tarniſh inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence. It has however ſeen that calumny was too feeble to ſtop the progreſs of a victorious general; and machinations of a more effective nature were employed, and which ended in the deſtruction of the miliary reſources.</p>
                     <p>Servan, having diſcovered the difficulties of the war department, feigned ſickneſs; and while he declared the inſufficiency of his ſtrength for the fatigues of his ſituation, he appointed himſelf ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the army of the Pyrennecs. Servan was lieutenant colonel in the preceding month of May. His health unequal to the duties of the cabinet, was robuſt enough to ſupport the fatigues of the field. Yet the Revolution, it ſeems, was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to reform the improper diſtribution and abuſe of employments!</p>
                     <p>Roland, miniſter of the interior department, was the moſt intriguing and leaſt capable of the Girondine party. He had a friend, named Pache; a man of talents and great zeal, who had formerly been ſecretary to the Mareſchal de Caſtries and had educated his ſon. Roland imagined he could make himſelf maſter of the war department, in procuring it for Pache. We ſhall afterwards ſee how far the reſult was favourable to the deſigns of Roland.</p>
                     <p>Pache now became miniſter of war, choſe the following men, or was obliged to appoint them, to fill the principal departments of his office; Meuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nier, an academician and a man of ſenſe, but of as depraved a mind as could be found in France; another academician, named Vandermonde; a Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobin who had rendered himſelf ridiculous by the affected vulgarity of his manners, and dangerous by his intrigues, and who had aſſumed the name of
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:026918_0042_0FD25FFD6878EE70"/>
Haſſenfratz to conceal the name of le Lievre, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which he would have been recognized to his diſgrace; and Audouin who was Vicar of St. Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtache and ſon-in-law of Pache.</p>
                     <p>Theſe new miniſters threw every thing into confuſion in the different departments of the war office, during the moſt important and hazardous campaign. The few perſons of experience that remained were diſcharged and their ſituations filled, not merely by Jacobins, but by ſuch of them as had diſtinguiſhed themſelves in the maſſacres of the firſt ſix days of September. The adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions eſtabliſhed for the ſupply of arms, cloathing, proviſions, and for regulating the hoſpitals, were aboliſhed. The old and experienced commiſſaries and contractors were either diſmiſſed, or calumni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, or dragged to the bar of juſtice; or thrown into-priſon, and rendered infamous without being heard. As theſe imprudent and unjuſt meaſures equally affected all the armies, although particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly aimed at that of Dumourier, the complaints of the generals were univerſal. Commiſſioners from the Convention were ſent to examine into the truth of the complaints. Their reports were alarming. But the committee of military affairs, who in no caſe could have any other effect than to embarraſs the meaſures of the war department however wiſely concerted, was now made the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of juſtifying the falſe ſtatements of Pache in direct oppoſition to thoſe of the generals and commiſſioners. The Convention paſſed to the order of the day; and Pache eſcaped with having been ſimply ordered to the bar, and with the reproaches which the generals continued to lay upon him.</p>
                     <p>The commiſſioners Camus, Goſſoin, Danton, and la Croix, were themſelves witneſſes in the month of December, of the diſtreſſed condition of the army in the camp of Liege; and rendered an
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:026918_0043_0FD25FC82C84F130"/>
account of it in their reports to the Convention. but without applying any effective remedy to the evil. The army was compoſed of forty-eight bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talions; the completeſt of which were from three hundred and fifty, to four hundred men, and many of them were not more than two hundred: the whole amounting to between fourteen and fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen thouſand foot. The cavalry were about three thouſand two hundred. Moſt of the foldiers were without ſhoes, and encamped in the mud, their feet being protected by nothing but hay twiſted together. The reſt of their cloathing correſponded with this deplorable appearance. Clothes had been diſtributed to ſome, but thoſe, to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of fifteen hundred, deſerted and returned to their reſpective homes. The ſick filled the hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals, where they were in want of every thing. To ſuch a ſtate was the victorious army of Jemappe reduced after the conqueſt of Belgia.</p>
                     <p>This army had been obliged to ſtop ſhort on the banks of the Meuſe for want of proviſions; and, if its diſtreſs had been known to general Clair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fait, he might have engaged it with great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, for the carriages of the artillery were almoſt entirely deſtroyed, and in the preceding month of December ſix thouſand artillery horſes had died at Tongres and at Liege for want of forage. The foot had but ten thouſand fuſees in a condition for ſervice. The cavalry were in want of boots, ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, cloaks, carbines, piſtols and ſabres. The army was without money; and often the ſtaff offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers raiſed contributions among themſelves to make out the ſoldiers ſubſiſtence-money for the day.</p>
                     <p>General Dumourier could have ſupplied all theſe wants in Brabant, Liege, and Holland; and had even entered into the neceſſary contracts and made reports reſpecting them; but every plan was rejected and all his arrangements deſtroyed. The
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:026918_0044_0FD25FFF366F8C00"/>
commiſſary Ronſin, had orders to condemn, embarraſs and retard every meaſure. His hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity was open; he paid no regard to the opinion of the general: for he was certain of the ſupport of the military committee, of the financier Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon, of Pache and his dependants, together with the ſecret protection of the commiſſioners of the Convention, who appeared to blame theſe diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, but ſuffered them to remain without a check, and in the account they rendered in the month of January execuſed Ronſin although they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged him to be unfit for his ſituation.</p>
                     <p>Manufactures were eſtabliſhed at Paris for every thing wanted in the armies. Cloth was convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Liege to Paris to make clothing for the troops. Leather was bought at Liege, at Dinans, and all along the banks of the Meuſe, to make ſhoes at Paris, which were ſent to the army at nine livres each pair, altho' at Liege ſhoes coſt no more than four livres, or four livres ten ſous per pair. Cloaks that could be manufactured at Antwerp for nineteen or twenty-one livres each, coſt fifty livres each at Paris; and cloaks were ſent from Paris to the army. The corn of the Netherlands was ſent to Nantz, from Nantz to Paris, was ground in the mills of Mont Martre, near Paris, and ſent back to the Netherlands.</p>
                     <p>The greateſt evil that reſulted from theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, was their influence on the conduct of the ſoldiery. We have already taken a review of the character of theſe troops, and have ſeen how diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult it was for General Dumourier to avail himſelf of their courage. It may even be ſaid, that he had accompliſhed what ſeemed to be impoſſible; and that in beating the Pruſſians and Auſtrians, he had obtained a victory more tedious and difficult over his licentious ſoldiers, having introduced diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline and love of order into an army, one fourth
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:026918_0045_0FD25FC9AEF919C8"/>
part of which was compoſed of troops of the line, infected by the ſpirit of the times, and the other three parts of volunteers, each having an opinion of his own, and each proud of his victories, and rendered ſuſceptible of more miſchief than good, by his notions of equality.</p>
                     <p>In the beginning of the campaign of 1792, the battalions were in want of officers. The ſuperior officers were ill choſen, and were without influence. The ſoldiers themſelves choſe their captains, lieutenants, and ſubaltern officers, and hence theſe officers were ſubject to the caprice of men, who acknowledged no ſuperior. A ſingle Jacobin was ſufficient to ruin a battalion by his licentious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes; and it was only by culpable condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that an officer could preſerve his rank, or obtain promotion.</p>
                     <p>The city of Liege was the tomb of Frenchmen. They died there of hunger and every ſpecies of diſtreſs. And this city, where the army knew nothing but wants, was more ſatal to it than Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pua, with its enjoyments, had been to the Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians.</p>
                     <p>The people of Liege had carried the Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary ſpirit to an exceſs, proportioned to the exceſs of their ſufferings when they were betrayed and ſubdued by the Pruſſians. They had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore withdrawn their confidence from the leaders of the Revolution, who laboured to ſecure liberty on the foundations of wiſe principles. Fabry and Cheſtrel, who were very honeſt men, and wiſhed only for the welfare of their country, had entirely loſt their influence. The populace of Outremeuſe, perhaps the moſt dangerous in Europe after thoſe of London and Paris, had made themſelves maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, not of the government, for there was none, but of the public force. Thoſe unhappy men thought only of vengeance and puniſhment. They conducted the French <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

houſes of their particular enemies, whom they treated as Ariſtocrats; that is to ſay, they pillaged and murdered them. This cruel inteſtine war, in which each French ſoldier took an active part either for or againſt his hoſt, deſtroyed the little diſcipline and good conduct which had hitherto exiſted in the French army in the midſt of miſery, want, and complicated diſtreſſes. But it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to puniſh, for it was impoſſible to diſcover the guilty. The people of Liege caſt the fault upon the French; and the French recriminated upon the people of Liege. The General would have eſtabliſhed the puniſhment of death for ſuch crimes. It had even been demanded of him by his army in a moment of enthuſiaſm. But the Commiſſioners, while they ſeemed to approve of this ſeverity, ſecretly and effectually oppoſed it. Since that time, we have ſeen that one of the cauſes of the execution of the unfortunate Cuſtine, was the having eſtabliſhed the puniſhment of death in his army.</p>
                     <p>Dumourier's army occupied can<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>onments from Aix-la-Chapelle to Liege, in which cities were all the officers who could not procure quarters with their battalions. So that the ſoldiers were almoſt left without commanders. Want had carried marauding to its utmoſt pitch. The ſoldiers rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in bands from village to village; and the pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants took their revenge in killing ſuch as, at any time, they found ſingle.</p>
                     <p>General Dumourier, prevented by theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances from puſhing on to Cologne, and forcing Clairfait to repaſs the Rhine, reſolved at leaſt to ſecure the Meuſe. He therefore ordered the army of the Ardennes, conſiſting of 15000 men, and commanded by General Valence, to join him; and placed them on his right, in the countries of Stavelo, Malmedy, Spa, Verviers, and Huy. A body of 18000 men under the command of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:026918_0047_0FD25FCB292AE508"/>
d'Harville, occupied the Meuſe from Givet to Namur; having his out-poſts at Ciney, Marche, and Rochefort. The army under General Miranda occupied the left from Tongres to Ruremonde. It conſiſted of 18000 men. New battalions, lately arrived from France, formed the garriſon of the Netherlands. And this line along the Meuſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted to from 65,000 to 70,000 men; and would have been ſufficient to have ſeized upon the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try between the Meuſe and the Rhine, and to have occupied the banks of that laſt river from Burick to Cologne, if it had been poſſible, firſt, to take Maeſtricht, which General Dumourier was not permitted to do, although he had propoſed it in the beginning of December, and had it then in his power; ſecondly, to place a garriſon in Juliers, which was alſo forbidden him becauſe it was deemed neceſſary to keep terms with the Elector Palatine, left he ſhould deliver the paſſage of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heim to the Imperial army, by which means they would have cut off the army of Cuſtine from Alſace; and, laſtly, if the army of Belgia had been provided with proviſions, arms, cloathing and money, ſo that it might have marched in the month of December, and have forced the Imperialiſts to repaſs the Rhine.</p>
                     <p>General Dumourier was perſuaded of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility of his preſerving his poſition on the Meuſe, while he ſhould neither be in poſſeſſion of Guelders, Venloo, Maeſtricht, nor Juliers, He wrote to the Convention and the Miniſter of the War Department to that effect. The reaſons of his opinion will be found in his correſpondence with Pache, printed in January, 1793. It was to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the cloſe of the preceding November that his quarrel commenced, with that Miniſter, with the Jacobins who ſupported him, and with the Convention who had not diſcernment to foreſee the effects of his criminal conduct. In December
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:026918_0048_0FD260075D46CBF8"/>
began the trial of the unfortunate Monarch, whole mild character conducted him to the ſcaffold. From that inſtant, the general ſoreſaw the crimes and misfortunes that have ſince ſprung from the chaos in France. He attempted to ſound the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of his army reſpecting the King, but his Staff-officers whom he employed in the taſk effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing, and thenceforward the general was proſcribed. Not one ſoldier, not one officer would conſider the caſe of the king. Every one diſcovered the ſame apathy; and this cold diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition in the army on that point, haſtened the General's deſign of viſiting Paris.</p>

                     <p>GENERAL Dumourier was thus a prey to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious chagrins in the palace of the Prince Biſhop of Leige; and, if it can be a conſolation to that Prelate, he may read with pleaſure that after the moſt ſplendid victories, this general was more unfortunate than himſelf. He had been harraſſed by the calumnies of the Jacobins from the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that he had ſaved France by driving a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable foe out of her territory. The conqueſt of Belgium had increaſed the <hi>column of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> to expreſs himſelf in the words he uſed to the National Convention after the battle of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mappe. He almoſt reproached himſelf with having loſt the opportunity of quitting the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand that was offered him on his return from Champagne, by the ingratitude of his fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citizens. He had cauſed the war to be declared,

in his former ſituation as miniſter of ſoreign af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; he had afterward conducted it with glory as a general; he had nothing wherewith to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach himſelf on theſe accounts; but he ſaw the ſucceſſes of the war mouldering away, and he could not but be penetrated with grief, ſince the important ſhare he had taken in the public con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns during nine months, had identified his fate with that of his country.</p>
                     <p>All his letters and memorials were either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected or misinterpreted; and his counſels ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Cambon declared, nothing could be more dangerous to a republic than a victorious general. It was laid down as an axiom in the tribune of the National Convention, that ingratitude was a neceſſary virtue in Republicans. The Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with-held the recompences due to the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes of Champagne and Belgium, becauſe the General had demanded them. By a decree, they authorized the miniſter of war to annul the nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of officers made by the Generals. The corps were left deſtitute of officers. New and ignorant men came from France, to gather the fruits of the army's toils. The General com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of theſe things to the National Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and declared, if they would not do him right reſpecting them, both as to the wants of his army and the other evils which were the cauſe of its deſtruction and diſorganization, he ſhould be compelled to give in his reſignation.</p>
                     <p>He demanded as an indiſpenſible ſtep, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of the impolitic and unjuſt decree of the 15th of December, that had driven the Belgians to deſpair. Notwithſtanding the remonſtrances of the General, it had been reſolved in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention that the decree ſhould take place on the firſt of January. Cambon had obtained this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion; the four Commiſſioners Camus, Goſſuin, Danton, and La Croix, ſupported him; and the
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:026918_0050_0FD260096A432B08"/>
two latter boaſted that they had done ſo, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge themſelves for an inſult they had received at Ath, where they had been refuſed a lodging. The General's honour was concerned in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting the execution of the tyrannical decree, becauſe when he entered the Netherlands on the third of November he had publiſhed, with the fanction of the National Convention, a procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation declaring to the Belgians, that the French entered their country as friends and brethren; that they came to give them entire liberty; and that the people ſhould be left to chuſe their own conſtitution and mode of government, without interference from the French. The decree not only deſtroyed the force of this proclamation, but alſo robbed the unhappy Belgians of all remains of liberty. The Commiſſioners ſequeſtered the public property and that of the clergy; and this nation no longer poſſeſſed any public revenue, nor the authorities neceſſary to preſerve even the form of government.</p>
                     <p>Cambon expected to find money for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences of the war, in this plunder of a country that was the friend of France, and that had not been conquered, but had voluntarily aſſociated itſelf with the Republic. This criminal and fordid conduct produced no benefit to France; on the contrary, it deprived her of 40,000 men, that the Belgians were willing to furniſh, and fifty millions of livres that they would have poured into the French treaſury, to contribute to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of their liberty; and was followed by the loſs of thoſe fine Provinces, and excited a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtation of the National Convention and their Commiſſioners, that will be eternal.</p>
                     <p>By an article of the decree the generals were charged with its execution, and were required to place the ſeals on the public property. General Dumourier rejected this diſhonourable employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:026918_0051_0FD2604E69B4F4C8"/>
and the commiſſioners gave the charge to Ronſin, who employed as his inſtruments, ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers and clerks of office, all Jacobins, who ſtole half the wealth they were ordered to ſecure in the name of the nation.</p>
                     <p>The general, being unable to prevent theſe baſe actions, reſolved, at leaſt, to mark his diſapproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them as much as he could, to the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians, by being abſent, if that were poſſible, while they ſhould be tranſacting. On theſe, and all the other ſubjects of his vexation, he explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his views ſo clearly to the commiſſioners, and General Valence ſupported his reaſonings with ſuch force, that in a conference held at Leige be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the commiſſioners, the generals, and the adminiſtrators that were entruſted with providing ſubſiſtence for the army, it being clearly ſhewn to theſe adminiſtrators that they could not furniſh him proviſions even to remain at Leige, much leſs to march forward, it was decided that Camus, the Preſident of the commiſſion, ſhould return to Paris, attended by General Thouvenot, the firſt to make a ſuitable report to the National Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the ſecond to lay before the military committee an account of the wants of the army, and to obtain the neceſſary arrangements, and alſo ſolid and ample contracts for eſtabliſhing maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines on the Meuſe, and more than all the reſt, to obtain a revocation of the decree of the 15th of December, which added the whole Belgic na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the number of our enemies. General Thouvenot took with him alſo written obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of generals on the plan of the campaign, as laid down by the miniſter of war, and was to bring back with him a deciſion on that point.— The journey, however, was altogether unſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, notwithſtanding the talents of General Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venot, becauſe Camus, opiniated, deceitful and vulgar, and not contented without engroſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:026918_0052_0FD2600AF06D1070"/>
all the honour of the embaſſy, aſſumed the ſole right of ſpeaking, ſupported the decree, and yielded to the will of others reſpecting the article of the committee of contracts. Thus, inſtead of removing the evils complained of, he only increaſed the difficulty of the general's ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</p>
                     <p>Meanwhile General Dumourier ſhut himſelf up in the palace of Liege, and was employed in ſolliciting leave to return to Paris, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting on his miſery. He continued to declare in his letters and memorials that it was impoſſible for him any longer to hold the command if the Convention did not aboliſh the committee of contracts, which was no better than a den of knaves, and had cancelled his bargains of every kind with the Belgians; and if they did not change the miniſter for the war department, who had nearly ruined the armies, and if they ſhould continue to treat as conquered countries the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces that ſhould be allied to France.</p>
                     <p>Such were the oſtenſible motives on which the general demanded leave to go to Paris. He had another, however, much more eſſential; but which he concealed with the utmoſt care. It was to endeavour to ſave the unfortunate Louis the XVIth, by repreſenting to the governing party the danger to which the nation was expoſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out; and the neceſſity of forming a ſolid plan for the campaign, which it would be neceſſary to commence at a very early period. He hoped the weight of this conſideration, aided by other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, he meant to urge on the different ſactions in the convention, would ſecure a ſuſpenſion of the abominable trial.</p>
                     <p>General Dumourier was in this embarraſſed ſituation at Leige, and his mind agitated in the manner we have ſeen, at the very moment when the Jacobins were contriving, to bring him to
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:026918_0053_0FD2604FF79825B0"/>
trial; and when they pretended that he paſſed his time ſurrounded by courtezans and actreſſes. The miniſtry indeed had ſent him a detachment from the opera; but theſe returned to Paris after a ſtay of no more than twenty-four hours. This expedition, and that of a troop of comedians from the theatre of Montanſier, coſt the nation more than 100,000 livres, the government pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to inculcate French revolutionary prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to the Belgians, by exhibiting democratic pieces in their theatres. The general diſdained to be the protector of ſuch ſollies. All that he ſaw of theſe deputies from the opera was at his table, having invited them to dinner. And certainty they conducted themſelves with much decency and good ſenſe; and diſcovered much more ſagacity than the miniſters that had ſent them.</p>
                     <p>The general found it extremely difficult to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his leave of abſence. Pache and the Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobins feared his preſence at Paris. And hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in vain urged the ſtate of his health and his need of repoſe, he was at length compelled to engage the commiſſioners to demand the leave of abſence directly in their own name, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare ſolemnly his determination to reſign in caſe of refuſal.</p>
                     <p>In the midſt of the vices that infected the army, there remained a ſentiment of juſtice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the ſoldiers which ſecured their attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to a general with whom they had always been victorious, and to whom they could no way attribute their preſent diſtreſs. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners therefore declared in their letters that the army would certainly diſband themſelves ſhould the general reſign. The leave of abſence arrived; and the General prepared inſtantly to depart, although La Croix propoſed to make a tour with him to Aix-la-Chapelle, in the hope
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:026918_0054_0FD2600C9EDB17F8"/>
of detaining him ſtill longer in that country. But Dumourier had ſecretly determined never more to reſume the command; and was not willing by viſiting the quarters, to make a tacit engagement with the ſoldiers for his return.</p>
                     <p>He arrived at Bruſſels; the command of which he had given to General Moreton. This man, who died in good time at Douay, had played a very curious part at Paris in the Revolution. He was an Ariſtocrat, taking that word in its moſt odious acceptation. He had been colonel of the regiment of La Fere, and he had been broken under the old government for the vileſt acts of military deſpotiſm. Reſentment threw him into the hands of the Republican party; and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence in the councils of the Palais Royal had made him one of the chief actors in the Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Become ſecretary of the Jacobins he plotted to procure a reviſion of his former ſentence; but the ſentence remained in its original ſtate. He was afterwards appointed colonel in the army of the north, and as he was well acquainted with all the parts of the diſcipline of the infantry, and had conſiderable ability, General Dumou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier appointed him chief of the ſtaff to the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of the North. When Dumourier took upon him the command in Champagne, Moreton, who could not penetrate the veil that covered that affair, although perfectly brave, miſconducted himſelf at the breaking up of the camp of Maulde; and was in danger of being maſſacred by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Valenciennes. General Dumourier's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the army of the north, then become the army of Belgium, replaced Moreton at the head of his ſtaff. But as Thouvenot poſſeſſed qualities for the ſituation which Moreton wanted, Dumou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier made the latter lieutenant-general by ſeniority (for ſix months was ſufficient to advance men to the higheſt rank by ſeniority in this revolutionary
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:026918_0055_0FD2605168B96A40"/>
army) and gave him the command at Bruſſels and in Brabant, in order to make General Thouvenot head of the ſtaff. Moreton then threw off all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint toward General Dumourier, and entirely gained by the Jacobins, to whom he already owed many obligations, he oppoſed the ſentiments and judgment of his General in every poſſible way. He adopted the decree of the 15th or December; and became hateful to the people of Brabant. General Dumourier found him ſurrounded by the Jacobin populace. He had raiſed a corps that aſſumed the name of the Sans Culottes. Theſe came to make an harangue to the General; and uſed the phraſes <hi>thou</hi> and <hi>citizen.</hi> Dumourier was offended with this groſſneſs; and plainly told them that being chiefly French ſoldiers, they ought not to addreſs him in ſuch familiar phraſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch expreſſed an equality inconſiſtent with the diſcipline of an army; that they ought to call him <hi>General</hi> or <hi>Citizen-general,</hi> but never <hi>citizen,</hi> without ſuch like addition. He ordered their ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes to be brought to him, and told them, that on his return from Paris, he would decide reſpecting them: for this mob demanded pay; and were really paid, though unknown to the General, with the conſent of the commiſſioners, as a recompenſe for their ſervices, or rather for the atrocious vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations they had committed.</p>
                     <p>General Dumourier had before this, ſent a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation from Liege, to engage the Belgians ſpeedily to hold their primary aſſemblies, and forthwith to chuſe a conſtituent aſſembly; becauſe in the decree of the 15th of December it was ſaid, that the ſequeſtration of the public property ſhould ceaſe when the people of Belgia ſhould have choſen their repreſentatives. The commiſſioners ſaw clearly enough that the appointment of an aſſembly would reſtore the Belgians to their liberty, and would deprive the commiſſioners of the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:026918_0056_0FD2600F05636500"/>
of the public revenue, and eſpecially of the plundering of the churches. They therefore delayed the publiſhing of the General's proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and afterwards its execution, and prevented the holding of the primary aſſemblies at Aloſt, the place Dumourier had appointed, with a view to counteract the influence of the populace of Bruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels. The General had been warned by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Louis the XVI. who might have avoided the influence of Paris, by aſſembling the ſtates-general at Tours, Orleans, Blois, of Bourges. But ſeeing, now, that the only means of ſnatching Belgium from the tyranny of the French Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had failed, he continued his journey without delay to Paris.</p>

                     <p>GENERAL Dumourier arrived in Paris on the firſt of January. Having reflected that, on his viſit to that place after the expulſion of the Pruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians from Champagne, Marat and the other Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobin journaliſts had reproached him with ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf at the theatre, and with ſeeking popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity, he reſolved to avoid all places of public reſort, to live as privately as poſſible, and to ſee only his particular friends, or ſuch perſons as might be uſeful to him in the objects of his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>
                     <p>He was five days without leaving his apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, during which he compoſed four memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials: the firſt on the neceſſity of recalling the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:026918_0057_0FD2605313CD9098"/>
of the 15th of December, which had been confirmed and even aggravated by two decrees paſſed on the 28th and 31ſt of the ſame month; the ſecond, reſpecting the ill effects of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of contracts, and the neceſſity of replacing on the old footing the ſupplying of the army with proviſions, forage, horſes, clothing, &amp;c. by the appointment of intelligent contractors; and the third and fourth on military affairs and the plans of the enſuing campaign. He concluded each of theſe memorials by a new declaration of his reſolution to reſign if the National Convention ſhould neglect any of theſe objects. He accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied them by a letter to the Preſident, requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to engage the Convention to form a new committee for the purpoſe of treating with the Generals, both as to the wants of the armies and future military operations. On the 7th of Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, he ſent the memorials and his letter to the preſident, whoſe name was Treilhard, who had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been an advocate, and who ſhortly after this was joined with Merlin of Douay, another advocate, to the four former commiſſioners of Belgia. The preſident neglecting to communicate the papers to the Convention, General Dumourier wrote him another letter, very ſhort and peremptory.</p>
                     <p>On the 11th of January, a ſummary account of the affair was given to the convention. The letter was read. The memorials were ſuppreſſed there, and ſent to a committee of twenty-one members recently eſtabliſhed under the name of the committee of general ſafety. The moſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular members of the other committees had been ſelected for this committee, They opened their ſittings on the 13th, and the General was invited to aſſiſt. The memorials were read. Ignorant and frivolous diſputes ſucceeded. All ſpoke to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. And, after ſitting three hours, they broke up without making the leaſt progreſs. A further
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:026918_0058_0FD26011A9CD6A80"/>
memorial, more detailed on certain points, was demanded of the General. As to the plan of the campaign, the members unanimouſly agreed ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly to decline the conſideration of it, alleging that it belonged properly to the executive coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. The General attended a ſecond ſitting of the committee, held on the evening of the 15th with a memorial containing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> minute ſtatement of the required information. There were not more than half of the members preſent. They dropped in one after another; and, running ſlightly through the memorial, which was very long and intricate, no more was ſaid of the matter.</p>
                     <p>General Valence arrived previous to this ſittings he was admitted, and read a memorial reſpecting the recruiting and new modelling of the army. He propoſed that the infantry ſhould be divided into brigades, by incorporating two battalions of the National guards with each battalion of the line. This project, adopted by the Convention in the midſt of the enſuing campaign, completed the ruin of the French army, by rendering it a body of mere volunteers without reſtraint or diſcipline. The attention of the committee, whoſe triſting and inquiſitive diſpoſition was equalled only by their ignorance and indifference to the public welfare, was caught by this novelty, although it ought never to have been diſcuſſed but in a time of peace, or at leaſt not till the concluſion of the campaign and the committee entirely threw aſide the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant objects cotained in the General's memoirs.</p>
                     <p>General Biron, having quitted the army of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſace to take upon him the command of that in the country of Nice, aſſiſted alſo at the third ſitting; and read a very preſſing memorial reſpecting the new contractors and the committee of contracts. The miniſter of war being ordered to attend, and not being able to anſwer the accuſations of the three Generals, was very groſſly treated by the
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:026918_0059_0FD2605475E8E358"/>
committee, charmed with finding an opportunity of humbling a miniſter. They had, however, a juſt occaſion in the preſent inſtance, for the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter had no other defence to offer than the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting of ſtatements taxed with being falſe. And the whole affair was referred to the military com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, the leaſt reſpectable of all the committees of the Convention.</p>
                     <p>General Dumourier afterwards attended a fourth ſitting. There were but five members preſent. They diſcuſſed nothing. And, when they ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, they told him they would ſend for him when they ſhould have occaſion to conſult him again. Immediately the General retired to a ſmall country houſe at Clichy, from whence he came every day to Paris in the proſecution of his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt object, that of ſaving the king. He was never again called to attend the committee of general ſafety. All the important affairs of France were ſuſpended during that moment for the purfuit of a meaſure that involved the ruin of the nation. The Convention were occupied by nothing but the trial of the king; which was proſecuted with the greateſt bitterneſs and moſt indecent ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity.</p>
                     <p>It was from the ſate of his memorials that Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Dumourier expected the ſalvation or the ruin of his country. Had they been adopted, he deſigned to have preſented himſelf to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, to have appeared in public, and openly to have canvaſſed for the unfortunate monarch. He might then have promiſed himſelf an impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant influence. He would have been ſurrounded by a number of officers and ſoldiers of his army who were on leave of abſence at Paris. And, by adding other means to theſe, he would have commanded a party ſufficiently ſtrong to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act the Jacobins, and their ſupport, the federates. This reſource was loſt; and, far from being abi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

to ſave the king, General Dumourier, deſtitute of power and influence, and conſidered as a man dangerous to the republic, becauſe he diſapproved of the crimes that were committing, feared only to injure Louis XVI. to precipitate the horrible ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtrophe, which thenceſorward appeared inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and which has coſt the General nothing but anguiſh.</p>
                     <p>A contemptible man, a man without knowledge and capacity, General La Bourdonnaye, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal enemy of General Dumourier, in revenge for having loſt the command of the army of the north in the preceding year, in conſequence of complaints made againſt him by General Dumou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier, pnbliſhed throughout Paris that the General had no other object in coming there than to ſave <hi>the moſt honeſt man in the kingdom.</hi> It was an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation that indeed General Dumourier had very juſtly given to the king in a letter written in 1791; and which had been printed, with the other papers found in the iron cheſt, that Roland had lately delivered up to the Convention.</p>
                     <p>The ſame report was ſpread by the Jacobins, eſpecially by Marat and his too active faction. It was ſaid that the General held conſultations with Roland and the Girondiſts every evening. And theſe laſt, offended that he was as unwilling to Viſit them in private, as the Jacobins, ſpread the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour that he ſecretly ſaw <hi>Philip Egalite</hi>; that man unworthy of bearing the name of Duke of Orleans.</p>

He avowedly ſhunned the houſes of Monge, miniſter of the marine; Roland, miniſter of the home department; Claviere, miniſter of the finances; and above all, that of Pache, miniſter of the war department.</p>

The war-office was become the filthieſt place imaginable, where 400 clerks, and numbers of women, affected to carry ſlovenlineſs of dreſs and coarſeneſs of manners into a ſyſtem: Nothing was forwarded in the office, and nothing but rapacity was to be ſeen on all hands. Several of the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains employed in this department, having Haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenhatz and Meuſnier at their head, worked day and night to collect falſe depoſitions, and to forge papers, to ſubſtantiate the accuſation that Haſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fratz had made at the Jacobin ſociety againſt the General, charging him with having embezzled twelve hundred thouſand livres in his contracts in Belgium. They excited the hatred of the federates againſt the General; and often paſſing by groupes of theſe, he has heard them propoſe in a loud voice to place his head on the top of a pike. One day in particular, he thought himſelf happy in eſcaping through a narrow paſſage from a gang of thoſe federates in the ſtreet of Montmartre, being warned againſt them by a tradeſman who knew him, he having formerly lived two years in the ſame ſtreet. In the general meetings of the ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and in the coffee-houſes, men were paid to declaim againſt him; and it was more than once in contemplation to ſeize upon his perſon.</p>
                     <p>The frightful Santerre, commander of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional guards of Paris, profeſſed a great attachment to General Dumourier; and frequently preſſed him to dine with his brother-in-law. His deſign was to entice him to dine with Marat. The Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral always declined the invitation, but on the politeſt pretences; obliged, in order to eſcape aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſination, to behave with ſeeming reſpect to this execrable man.</p>
                     <p>A circumſtance that happened at this time, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the ſituation of the General more critical, although he had no concern in it. Colonel Weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terman had caned Marat on the Pont-neuf, for
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:026918_0062_0FD260162DC07E70"/>
having in his journal accuſed the Colonel of being the creature of General Dumourier, and the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal inſtrument of his rob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Dumourier every day received intimations of Marat's deſigns againſt him, both from particular friends and by anonymous letters. And the General, for the firſt time in his life, adopted the precaution of carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing piſtols in his pocket.</p>
                     <p>Du Bois de Crance, the moſt cowardly and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous of the Jacobins, being one day at table with the General, ſhewed a diſpoſition to offend him, imagining that the General, would be terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by his great bulk and the ferocity of his air. General Dumourier laid hold of him, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ſilence upon him very effectually. Du Bois de Crance, in revenge, repeated every day in the Convention that Dumourier deſpiſed its members, painting it as an aſſembly conſiſting of four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred fools headed by three hundred robbers. Thus a violent ſtorm gathered round the General; and his enemies waited only for his reſignation to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and try him.

                     <head type="sub">Trial of the King.</head>
                     <p>IT was in the ſame temper that this horde of cannibals puſhed on the trial of the King with the bittereſt fury and the moſt horrible joy. The trial is in the hands of all tne nations of Europe. The proofs, documents, and pleadings are publiſhed, and will remain the diſhonour of the French na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all poſterity. Never was crime committed with ſuch cowardice, ſuch cold bloodedneſs, and ſuch deliberation of mind. More than an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty members of the pretended tribunal, had printed and publiſhed their opinion even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had been made acquainted with the facts and papers, on which it ought to have been found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. They ought therefore to have abſtained from giving their vote, or their vote ought to have been rejected; but the unfortunate Louis XVI. had none of the privileges of an accuſed man on his trial. It is aſtoniſhing that the three hundred and ten members, who had the courage to vote for preſerving the king's life in ſpite of the dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers at their throats, had not reſolutely inſiſted that each of the judges who had given his opinion publicly in writing, ſhould be incapacitated from voting. But thoſe friends of humanity will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don this reflection in an hiſtorian, who, far from deſigning to caſt a reproach upon them, wiſhes to have the power of raiſing a column to their names, as deſerving of remeinbrance, as were the names of the heroes at Marathon. In the unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thieſt
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:026918_0064_0FD26017AE4EFEE8"/>
aſſembly in the world, were found three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ten men, who acted with conſcience and courage in the midſt of general depravity and cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardice, and to whom the royal family of France has an eternal obligation. Juſt and humane citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, receive the homage of a ſoldier, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges more courage in your conduct than he has ſhewn, or than he has ſeen, in all his battles where he commanded with ſuch ſucceſs and glory!</p>
                     <p>This homage is pure and diſintereſted. He who pays it expects nothing from kings, and is the friend of liberty; and, having ſerved his country honeſtly has renounced her, whether ſhe again be brought under the terrible yoke of deſpotiſm, or, by the ignorance and falſe policy of the combined powers, ſhe ſhall remain a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public under the iron ſyſtem of the Jacobins: For he no longer has any hope of ſeeing France governed by a conſtitutional king, ſubject to the law, and the ſupport of the law. Your virtue ſhall be more reſpected in after times, inaſmuch as it ſhall appear in the ſame page with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the Girondiſts, whoſe intrigues, as far at leaſt as they are known to General Dumourier, ſhall be delivered over, one by one, to hiſtory whoſe province it is to puniſh crimes.</p>
                     <p>It has often been demanded if it were the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the Girondine party to ſave the king. The queſtion is difficult to anſwer; and it does not ſeem that we can diſcover the truth, but in diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing two periods of very different characters in the exiſtence of this faction, and conſequently in its ambitious members, that varied with the change of circumſtances.</p>
                     <p>It is certain that this faction, after having long ſwayed the Convention and the miniſtry, elated by the exceſs of their influence, openly aſpired to the eſtabliſhing of a Republic, as the means of perpetuating their power. They had ſubdued the
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:026918_0065_0FD2605D900322E8"/>
feuillans, the moderate party, and the royaliſts. They had enliſted moſt of the daily journals on their ſide. The Paris Journal, the Chronicle, the Monitor, the Patriot, the Thermometer, the Journals of Gorſas and of Carra, in a word, all that were eſteemed, and in great circulation, were compoſed, corrected, and edited by the members of this faction. The beſt orators of the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Gaudet, Vergneaux, La Source, Briſſot, Genſonne, and Condorcet, gave reputation and currency to the opinions of the faction. They had ſeized upon the direction of the principal committees. Sieyes and Condorcet were at the head of the committee of the conſtitution. Briſſot and Genſonne governed the diplomatic com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee aſſociated with that of general ſafety. The committee of finances was entirely at the devotion of Cambon, whom the Girondine party at that time believed to be their partizan. And they ruled Paris during all the mayoralty of Pethion.</p>
                     <p>This faction may be called the Jeſuits of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution. They acted on the ſame political ſyſtem; they poſſeſſed at firſt the ſame unlimited power; blinded, afterwards, in a like manner, by pride, they committed the ſame faults, and underwent the ſame fate. During their reign they contemned and inſulted the royal family. Pethion, in the ſame carriage with the King and Queen, on their return from Varennes, took every occaſion to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that he no longer deſigned to ſupport the monarchy. The unfortunate Queen related the fact to General Dumourier; and Pethion after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards acknowledged it, on his naming it to him.</p>
                     <p>But in the month of November 1792, circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances were entirely changed. The popularity of <hi>King Pethion,</hi> for ſo he was called in Paris, had ſunk under the aſcendancy of the Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins, and the Marſeillois, whom the Jacobins had gained by patriotic orgies. A weak but honeſt
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:026918_0066_0FD26019462E4E50"/>
man, named Chambon, had ſucceeded Pethion in the mayoralty. He was deſpiſed, and without power. The Jacobins tyrannized over the ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and the commune of Paris aſſumed an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority independent of the Convention and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſuperior to it.</p>
                     <p>Barbaroux, deputy from Marſeilles, one of the Girondine party, relying on his influence in that city, undertook to bring a new body of men from Marſeilles; and, mean while, the party employed Roland, the miniſter of the interior, to invite the deparments to find Federates to relieve Paris and the Convention from the tyranny of the former body of Marſeillois. Nothing could be more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent than this meaſure. It could not fail to produce a civil war, unleſs the new Federates, ſhould ſtrengthen them againſt their antagoniſts: gained like the former by the Jacobins, which happened in the ſequel.</p>
                     <p>The intrigues of the Girondiſts were unmaſked with great capacity, by Danton, La Croix, Rober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpierre, and Marat. Impartial men in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, ſaw the dangerous ambition of the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rondine faction. It was then that the party ought to have adopted a deciſive conduct in defending the innocence of the king, and oppoſing the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death; and then, had they fallen, they would, at leaſt, have fallen with honour. But it it is moſt probable that, on the contrary, their efforts would have been ſucceſsful, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments would have joined them to ſave the king and the country, and that the Jacobins would have been cruſhed. But the Girondine party poſſeſſed not the courage their ſituation demanded. They contented themſelves with propoſing an inade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate appeal to the people on the fate of Louis XVI. And this was conſidered as holding out another ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of civil war.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="69" facs="unknown:026918_0067_0FD2605F35630DA0"/>
The Girondiſts were terrified, and yielded to the torrent; but they did not ſave themſelves by their cowardice in voting with the Jacobins againſt the unfortunate monarch, who thus fell the victim of the united villainy of implacable monſters, and ignorant intriguers. Pethion had the baſe cruelty, in a moment, while pity yet heſitated to condemn the king, to recall the remembrance of the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence that was aſcribed to him on the unhappy days of the 9th and 10th of Auguſt. Having thus incenſed his hearers by an unworthy charge, he concluded by voting for death. The veiled opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Condorcet, amounted to the ſame ſentence. The conduct of this artful ſchoolman abounding in ſubtlety, and deſtitute of feeling, has been equally atrocious in every ſtage of the Revolution.</p>
                     <p>Briſſot, Gaudet, Genſonne, and Vergniaux, were even eager to vote contrary to their known ſentiments.</p>
                     <p>The accuſation againſt Louis XVI. contained no article ſufficienty weighty to ſanction the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The cataſtrophe of the 10th of Auguſt, was no crime to be imputed to the king. Carra had the impudence to publiſh in his journal, and declare in the Convention, that the event of that day had been prepared by a committee of five per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, among whom were Pethion, Roberſpierre, and he, Carra; that the committee met in a ſmall public houſe in the Fauxbough St. Antoine; that the ſcheme of obliging the king to arm and oppoſe the people, had failed twice, and had even been on the point of ſailing on the 10th of Auguſt. Hence it is clear, had this paper of Carra, been produced on the trial, it had juſtified the king, by proving the neceſſity of his taking up arms in his own defence. But neither juſtice nor policy, nor good ſenſe, were concerned in his trial.</p>
                     <p>

Providence ſeems to have deſtined the arrival of this period, ſo diſgraceful to France, and ſo deciſive of her fate. All things conſpired againſt the unfortunate and innocent victim. Even the Emigrants, in the zeal of a miſtaken attachment, adopted meaſures that were fatal to him. Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trand, ex-miniſter of the marine, a reſugee in England, imagined he could ſave the king by ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Convention authentic papers, proving that the leaders of both parties had negociated with the king in ſecret. Danton and La Croix, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, were ſo directly implicated in the papers, that their credit had been utterly ruined, if Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, maſter of the <hi>mountain,</hi> that is to ſay the Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobin party, and La Croix, who influenced the <hi>Plain,</hi> that is to ſay, the independent part of the aſſembly, had not united their efforts to bury the memory of thoſe papers with the ill-fated king. The zeal of Bertrand, inſtead of ſaving Louis, haſtened his death. The murder was committed. On the guilty evening all the theatres were full. Unhappy Frenchmen! When you ſhall read this chapter, bathed with the tears of him who offers the picture of the greateſt of your crimes to your view, you ſhall tremble for yourſelves, and you ſhall acknowledge the terrible vengeance that awaits you to be juſt.</p>

                     <head type="sub">Fruitleſs attempts of General Dumourier in behalf of the king.</head>
                     <p>AMONG the abſurd and unjuſt accuſations of the Emigrants againſt General Dumourier, that which has obtained moſt credit with ignorant and ſuperficial men is, that he did not avail him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of the aſcendancy which his victories gave him over his army, to lead it to Paris, and libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the king. But it is to be conſidered, firſt, that his influence with his army was always very precarious, and events afterwards proved that it was not to be relied on; ſecondly, that this army was more than a hundred leagues from Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, was in want of every neceſſary for a march, not being able even to quit the country of Leige, without great hazard of loſing its artillery for the want of horſes; that this ſtep would have aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned that country to the Auſtrians, who alſo would have followed him; and that it would have been a degree of treachery to the honour and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of the French nation, which would have coſt the General and all his principal officers their heads before they could even have entered France; thirdly, that this army had for ſome time been in an abſolute incapacity of proceeding even to the Rhine, which was only twenty leagues diſtant, and conſequently could not accompliſh the longer march to Paris.</p>
                     <p>General Dumourier, however, did entertain the project of conducting, not the whole of his army to Paris, but a choſen detachment of troops of the line. But the example of Fayette, taught
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:026918_0070_0FD2601FEBB54CF0"/>
him to regard this meaſure as a perilous extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; and ſome legal form and pretence was wanting to give it colour, and to preſerve to him the confidence of his ſoldiers in the execution of it. He had declared, and written and repeated oſten to the leaders of the Girondme party, and eſpecially to Barrere, who has ſince occaſioned ſuch miſchief by his verſatility, that, if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention were overawed, they had to write but four lines in the form of a decree, and he would forthwith march 20,000 men to their aſſiſtance. Whether it were the effect of timidity, or a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in their own means and intrigues, the members that were ſtill conſidered as the moſt reſpectable in the aſſembly were unwilling to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy this reſource. Indeed their views, ſuch as they have ſince been diſcovered to be, would na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally prevent them from placing much confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the General, whom they knew to be perfectly attached to the conſtitution and to the re-eſtabliſhment of order. Seeing no hope of ſuch a decree as the General had pointed out, and governed by the motives that have been amply detailed in the foregoing chapters, he departed ſingly for Paris; but he had ſent before him, on leave of abſence, many of the officers command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing corps, and other officers, and ſoldiers, both of the line and national guards, and among them ſome Pariſians, all of whom had promiſed him their ſervices in behalf of the king. It is to be obſerved alſo that at the time of his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, although the trial of Louis XVI. was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, it could not be foreſeen, eſpecially by one at the diſtance of an hundred leagues, that the iſſue would have been ſo ſpeedy and fatal. The General well knew that the criminal ferocity of the Jacobins would incite them to preſs forward this hateful and bloody cataſtrophe by every means within their reach: but he thought that
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:026918_0071_0FD26066A7158DE0"/>
the Girondiſts, not for honeſt reaſons, but for political reaſons and for their own ſafety, would ſpin out this affair, and ſo give him time to take meaſures for the reſcue of the king. It was not till his arrival at Paris that he knew the true ſtate of things, and ſaw how inadequate his reſources were to the magnitude of the talk.</p>
                     <p>General Dumourier had been on terms of friendſhip with Genſonne, a deputy of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment of Gironde, and had found an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of pardoning ſome hoſtile meaſures of that deputy toward him the preceding year, when Dumourier quitted the miniſtry. He had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in Genſonne great capacity and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and a humane diſpoſition; and he willingly renewed his connexions with him. General Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourier opened his mind to him relative to the king. He expreſſed his horror at the crime that was about to ſtain the nation; he made him ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that ſuch a deteſtable triumph given to the Jacobins would end in the ruin of all the honeſt part of the nation, and would render the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archy that afflicted France incurable; that ſuch of the nations of Europe as had regarded with indifference and perhaps with pleaſure our inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior ſtruggles, our war with Auſtria and Pruſſia, and perhaps were not unwilling to ſee our ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes againſt thoſe two powers, could not but be ſhocked at the barbarity of murdering Louis XVI. and would be thenceforward engaged in honour to join the enemies of France, till we ſhould have every power in Europe againſt us without one ally. Theſe reflections ſeemed to make great impreſſion on Genſonne; but to whatever cauſe it was owing, he undertook no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and even avoided the General, who had afterward little opportunity of ſeeing him.</p>
                     <p>Dumourier converſed with ſeveral other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties of the ſame party, as well as with many
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:026918_0072_0FD260216E918240"/>
of the independent party in the Convention, to whom he repreſented that, the nation being now a republic, Louis was to be tre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ed ſimply as an individual; that it was indecent impolitic, and unreaſonable to waſte time, that ought to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in preparations againſt the dangers of the enſuing campaign and in reinforcing the armies, in the proſecution of the trial of a ſingle man, whoſe fate was of no importance to the nation; and that it would be wiſe at leaſt to ſuſpend this uſeleſs meaſure till after the war. The more reaſonable of them acknowledged the trial to be an unjuſt and unwiſe proceeding, but ſaid, that the members of the <hi>Mountain</hi> had taken their meaſures, and, ſhould the trial now be abandoned by the Convention, the Jacobins would excite an inſurrection, fall upon the temple, and maſſacre the whole of the priſoners. The General then told them that he could not think they were ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently authorized by their conſtituents to try the king; that, ſince they made an affair of conſequence of the trial, it appeared to him it would be neceſſary to their own ſecurity to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand inſtructions in preciſe terms on the point from the departments, leaſt one day they ſhould be reproached for the deed by the nation, and leaſt they ſhould one day become perſonally reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponſible for the irregularity and violence of the act. They anſwered to this, that the imprudent propoſal of appealing to the people made by the Girondine party had deprived them of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource the General now propoſed; ſince it was feared the convoking of the primary aſſemblies for ſuch inſtructions would be the ſignal of a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil war.</p>
                     <p>It then occurred to the General to ſuggeſt an idea that ſeemed to have great weight with theſe deputies, although in the end it failed of effect like all the reſt, becauſe every man ſeeing a
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:026918_0073_0FD26068B3C43280"/>
poignard at his breaſt, choſe rather to be a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer than a victim. The idea was, that a long war had exiſted between the nation and the king, that the day of the 10th of Auguſt had decided the fate of both, that the king had fallen into their hands, and could no longer be conſidered as any thing but a priſoner of war, yet without criminality, becauſe both parties had in like manner had recourſe to arms; that a foreign war raged againſt the nation, and that they ought to deem themſelves fortunate in having a precious hoſtage in this priſoner, who might ſerve them in a caſe of extremity. The General added, that ſhould they perſiſt in thinking the king guilty, they ought to form a tribunal authorized to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect facts, to examine and confront the witneſſes, and to prepare the way for a final deciſion, with a deliberation due to the ſubject; that this act of juſtice would ſatisfy the bittereſt enemies of roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, would give the people time to reflect, and to the Convention an opportunity to finiſh the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, which was the grand object of their miſſion; and when the primary aſſemblies ſhould be convoked for the acceptance of the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, all the proceedings of the tribunal might be laid before them, and they be called upon to decide the fate of the king.</p>
                     <p>Having ſpread this opinion in converſation and even in writing, the General ſaw Pethion, with whom till this period he had been on terms of friendſhip, and repreſented to him that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came him perſonally to intereſt himſelf in behalf of Louis XVI. ſince otherwiſe, a malignity of mind would be imputed to him that certainly was not in his character. Pethion appeared to be moved by the General's reaſoning; and declared that perſonally he <hi>loved</hi> the king, and that he would exert his utmoſt influence to ſave him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="76" facs="unknown:026918_0074_0FD26027F39C0940"/>
General Dumourier then addreſſed himſelf to Roberſpierre, by the medium of one of his friends. He repreſented that it was entirely in Roberſpierre's power to ſave Louis XVI. that the magnanimity of the action would immortalize his name, and that in conſequence of it the generals of the army would look up to him as the firſt man in the ſtate, and that the dictatorſhip would be the reward of his virtue; but that otherwiſe he would fall into the ſame contempt and execration as Marat, with whoſe name that of Roberſpierre would thenceforth be conſtantly aſſociated. This idea the General knew to be peculiarly odious to Roberſpierre.</p>
                     <p>General Dumourier knew that the Jacobins deſpiſed the Convention and hated the Giron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine party. He inſinuated to them by ſecret agents, that if they wiſhed to become maſters of France and Europe, and to riſe on the ruins of the National Convention, they had only to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their will that the trial of Louis ſhould be ſuſpended, and that a more important object, the ſtate of the war, ſhould be taken into conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>
                     <p>Drouet, poſt-maſter of St. Menehould, who had arreſted the king at Varennes, was a deputy of the Convention and a Jacobin. The brother of Drouet, a very honeſt and faithful man, was in the General's ſervice, and was greatly attached to him. Dumourier gave this man inſtructions to prepare his brother's mind for the impreſſions he wiſhed it to receive, and afterwards to bring him to Clichy. The General painted to Drouet the crime he and his aſſociates were committing againſt the king, with ſuch energy, that Drouet, ſtruck with horror, promiſed to move for the ſuſpenſion of the trial both in the Convention and in the club of the Jacobins. Had there been
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:026918_0075_0FD2606A2C91F920"/>
one member ſufficiently reſolute to make the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, the king had been ſaved. No one had the courage. Drouet fell ſick and was not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent when the ſentence was paſſed.</p>
                     <p>Each day the General viſited various parts of Paris, went into the ſhops and houſes of indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals, and took occaſion always to turn the converſation to the king's trial. He obſerved how ſtrange a circumſtance it ſeemed that the Convention ſhould ſuddenly become a tribunal; that if Louis were ſtill king, the nation ought to decide by whom and with what forms he ſhould be judged; that if he were no longer king, it was unfit that time ſo precious to the nation, ſhould be loſt in enquiring into the guilt of an individual. And to theſe conſiderations he added reflections on the mild virtues and misfortunes of Louis XVI. Sometimes he was liſtened to with eagerneſs and pity; but frequently, he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted to forbear ſpeaking of ſo <hi>dangerous</hi> a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pic; and ſometimes condemned for introducing it. At times, he expoſed himſelf to ſerious dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, by expreſſing his ſurprize, that in a great city like Paris, there ſhould not be five or ſix thouſand men with courage ſufficient to riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt two or three thouſand villains, who calling themſelves Federates, held the city in abſolute ſubjection. A well informed tradeſman, caſting down his eyes and bluſhing with ſhame, made this anſwer one day to the general: <hi>Citizen, I ſee what you would have us to do. But we are cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards and the king will be ſacrificed. What <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Thoſe ſoldiers of his army that he met with from time to time, ſeemed to be devoted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling, and to be wholly inſected with the phrenzy of the Federates; and ſome even join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the party of his enemies, filling the different clubs and meetings of the ſections with abſurd accuſations againſt him.</p>
                     <p>From all theſe attempts to ſerve the king, which the general renewed every day in various forms and diſguiſes, and with much riſk to his own perſon, he reaped nothing but the dreadful certainty of the king's ruin. Paris ſeemed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different on the ſubject. During the twenty days previous to the death of the king, that he ſtudied the temper of that city, he perceived not the ſmalleſt commiſeration, neither among indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals nor in the public, in behalf of the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Louis. Nor indeed any abſtinence from their amuſements in the frivolous and ſavage Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſians.</p>

                     <p>ALTHOUGH General Dumourier's conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was robuſt, his health yielded for a while to the acute vexations of his mind. On the 18th of January, he fell ſick and was confined at his houſe at Clichy, till the 22d. He now reſolved to quit Paris in a few days; and never to enter it more till he ſhould come to diſperſe that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy

aſſembly, who were baſe and wicked enough, wantonly, precipitately, and without proof, to condemn to death an innocent king, who had ever loved his people, whoſe faults were not his own, who had baniſhed the torture from criminal trials, who readily adopted every pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal for the public benefit, and had himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited the nation to remedy all abuſes and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for its happineſs. Kings are ſubject in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to many of the cauſes by which Louis XVI. was reduced to this unhappy condition; they are beſieged and betrayed; they are kept in ignorance and ſee nothing as it really exiſts; nor have they power to quit the circle in which they are placed, in ſearch of the virtuous man whoſe pure dignity ſhuns the corruption and inſolence of courts.— But it muſt have been the completeſt diſorder that could hurry a whole nation to the murder of their king, after having often bleſſed and adored him; and having compared him to Louis XII. Henry IV. and all the beſt and moſt beloved of their monarchs. The club of Jacobins con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted the French to this pitch of folly and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs.</p>
                     <p>The 21ſt January, the day of the death of Louis XVI. is the true epoch of the ruin of the Republic, of the reſtoration of the monarchy, and it may be feared of the triumph of deſpotiſm. The French nation began the career of liberty gloriouſly. Their firſt exceſſes were pardonable, as they reſulted from the obſtinacy of the abuſes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> was neceſſary to deſtroy. A noble conſtitution, although in ſome degree it was imperfect, ſeemed to ſecure the happineſs of France. General Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourier's journeys into England, Germany, Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerland, and Italy, at that period, convinced him of the general approbation it obtained. But the king, ſeduced by his perfidious counſellors, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to eſcape from his people, after having
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:026918_0078_0FD2602B2B51D800"/>
ſworn to maintain the conſtitution. He was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered and taken. The National Aſſembly of France acted as became a great nation. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored the king to his rights; and from that inſtant the king ceaſed to be dangerous to the liberties of the people. He was governed faithfully by the principles of the conſtitution. They were engraven on his heart. And if his miniſters or his courtiers ſtill ſought to violate the law, the conſtitution had provided a remedy for the evil. The agents of the executive power were reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible with their lives for miſconduct in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but an abſolute inviolability was attached to the perſon of the king. The third legiſlature of France however, tended viſibly to Republic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aniſm; they were bent on the overthrow of the conſtitution. It was neceſſary to raiſe new accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations againſt the king for his deſtruction; and to this object the Girondine faction proceeded with the moſt refined perfidy, while the Jacobins openly acted in the ſame cauſe with a wild and brutal inſolence. Carra and the journaliſts of the Jacobins have placed this ſubject in the cleareſt light, in tracing the intrigues which engendered the cataſtrophe of the 10th of Auguſt.</p>
                     <p>The affair of the 21ſt of June, was a prelude to that cataſtrophe, although directly it produced nothing more than a diſguſting inſult to the nation and the conſtitution, in the unfortunate perſon of the king. The ferocious Santerre was heard to ſay on that day, <hi>We have failed now, but we will return again.</hi> The National Convention neither puniſhed nor reſented the inſult. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the two factions, which notwithſtanding their mutual hatred had many wicked objects in common, were preparing for the execution of a greater plot; and had aſſembled the Marſellois and Bretons from the extremities of the kingdom, to inſure ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="81" facs="unknown:026918_0079_0FD260722B9DD520"/>
Theſe were the true cauſes of the bloody and deciſive 10th of Auguſt. The miniſters and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, it is true, took meaſures, on their part, againſt the aſſembly, and the Jacobins; ſuppoſing however, that they were culpable, the law was armed againſt them, but ought to have had no ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration on the king, who was both innocent and inviolable, and who was to be conſidered merely as the occaſion and not as the author of the ſteps taken in his name. The nation was convinced of this truth; and if Louis had been firm he had not fallen. His aſſaſſins baſely puniſhed the mildneſs of his character with death; and the mildneſs of his character ſhould have pleaded for mercy.</p>
                     <p>But this good and weak monarch found in his religious principles, a ſtrength that bore him he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roically through his martyrdom. The particulars of his death are preſerved, and are ineſtimable aids in the ſtudy of the human heart. They add new aggravations to the crimes of the Pariſians. An innumerable crowd attended the execution. Barbarous joy, or an unfeeling curioſity, were the only impreſſions that appeared in the guilty ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators. No one had the courage to ſhed a tear; and it will ſcarcely be believed, that the domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics of the good king preſſed neareſt to the ſcaffold, and were the moſt implacable of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
                     <p>On arriving at Paris, on the 22d, General Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourier went to the houſe of Garat, miniſter of juſtice, who ſeemed to be extremely affected by the death of the king, but more eſpecially by the duty that had been impoſed on him, and the other miniſters, of reading the ſentence to the king. The unfortunate Louis during the ſolemn office, remained ſtanding, and aſſumed a tranquil and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtic countenance, without offering remonſtrance or complaint. He ſaid only, that it was not juſt to charge him with treaſon, ſince his intentions
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:026918_0080_0FD2602CBB426CE8"/>
had always been pure, and ſince he had conſtantly deſired the welfare of his fellow-citizens. After requeſting a little time to prepare for his death, he diſmiſſed the miniſters with an air of dignity and gentleneſs, the remembrance of which affected Garat very much in ſpeaking of it. General Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourier, Cabanis the friend and phyſician of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabeau, and the miniſter, were mutually affected. They read over the will of this unfortunate prince. It had been written with his own hand, in ſome places there were eraſures, but the writing was clear, and without any marks of being written with agitation. It contained four pages written on letter paper. The firſt was conſecrated to reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and the homage was juſt; ſince, in that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, he found courage, ſupport and conſolation. The three other pages exhibited an example of magnanimity, reaſon, and philoſophy. This will, ſince publiſhed to the world, is one of the nobleſt writings that the mind ever produced under ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing circumſtances. The monſters of the National Convention have ſaid, that this writing juſtified the king's ſentence; becauſe, having no object in common with the world, on the point of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming the victim of the ingratitude of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, he had employed in two or three places the language of royalty, and diſdained to flatter their prejudices.</p>
                     <p>During the exiſtence of a monarchy of fourteen hundred years the French have aſſaſſinated many of their kings. But the deed was always the crime of an individual; the rage of the nation againſt, the perpetrator was extreme; and the villain was puniſhed with the moſt horrible tortures. It was reſerved to an enlightened and philoſophical age to produce a like crime, committed in the name of the whole French nation, approved by the majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and regarded as an act of Heroiſm.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="83" facs="unknown:026918_0081_0FD22EE393108228"/>
Is the continuance and proſperity of a republic, founded on ſuch guilt, ſoberly to be expected?— certainly not. The monſters have killed Louis XVI. but they have reſtored royalty. This incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate and changeable nation, always running to the extremes of paſſion, will herſelf maſſacre her iniquitous judges and her furious Jacobins, and run to adore new kings. The efforts for a reaſonable liberty that have been made during three years by true Patriots will be loſt; and France will preſent the picture of a monarchy crowded with diſgraces and crimes, diſmembered and ruined, in which a rigid deſpotiſm muſt long combat a deſtructive anarchy before the reign of the laws can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored: and then it ſhall not be the laws of the people. The whole of this generation, even thoſe that are but newly born, ſhall endure the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the atrocious crimes of four years: crimes that poſterity will ſcarcely be perſuaded to credit.</p>

                     <p>HAVING particularly traced the tranſactions that moſt affected General Dumourier in a cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrophe that he could neither prevent nor fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee, it will be neceſſary to purſue the account of his other occupations in Paris during this unhappy month of January. An eſſential object of his journey was to obtain the ſuppreſſion of the decree of the 15th of December, or at leaſt a tacit agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Convention, that it ſhould not be put in execution in Brabant. He demonſtrated to
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:026918_0082_0FD2603393571490"/>
the Convention that the people of Brabant were wholly alienated from the French; than an open rebellion was to be feared if the decree ſhould be executed; that on the appearance of the Auſtrians in force the French would have an additional ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in the Belgians, who might eaſily attack their weakened garriſons, cut off their proviſions and render their retreat impoſſible. The Convention were too preſumptuous, and too much taken up with the king's trial to attend to theſe remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances.</p>
                     <p>One individual of the Convention controlled the department of the finances with the moſt abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute ſway. This was Cambon a man of a moſt ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular mind; ignorant and deſtitute of ſound principles, yet ſcheming and unrelenting in his projects. D'Eſpagnac had been arreſted on the 22d of November, along with Malus, for fulfilling an engagement that they had made with Servan reſpecting carriages for the army, and which was very important to the nation. He was ſtill a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner at Paris; but at liberty to go about with a guard. He poſſeſſed a mind abounding in reſour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. He had gained the confidence of Cambon on all the ſubjects of finance, and offered to procure the General a conference with this dictator of the national treaſury; the General conſented and they went to breakfaſt with Cambon. This man boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of having obtained and ſupported the decree of the 15th of December. His reaſons for the project he ſaid were that the treaſury was empty; that France had ſix hundred thouſand troops on foot, and paid two hundred million of livres per month for the expences of the war. The General obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that ſix hundred thouſand men ought not to coſt two hundred millions per month, and that the armies of France did not amount to more than three hundred thouſand effective men. Cambon anſwered, that the national guards of all the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:026918_0083_0FD26075968B83D0"/>
cities received the ſame pay as the army, as well as part of the national guards of Paris; he declared he ſaw no other reſource, than the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the decree, for carrying on the war; that ſpecie already coſt the nation fifty per cent, and that ſoon it would not be procured even at cent per cent.; that he had but one remedy againſt this evil, which was to ſeize on all the ſpecie in Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia, and the ſilver in the churches and banks. He acknowledged this to be unjuſt, but he thought it unavoidable; he ſaid, that when the Belgians ſhould be ruined and reduced to the ſame diſtreſs as the French, they would neceſſarily unite their fate with that of France, as the people of Liege had done, who threw themſelves into our arms, being poor and involved in debt. He added, that then France would admit the Belgians as members of the Republic, and with the ſame po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy they might hope to proceed conquering peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple after people; that the decree of the 15th of December was well calculated for this purpoſe, becauſe it tended to diſorganize the neighbouring ſtates, that being the moſt fortunate thing that could be done for France.</p>
                     <p>The General objected that, beſide the barbarity of the project, it was impracticable; that we were now in the middle of the month of January; that our armies were weakened; that no one thought of the means of recruiting them; nor of the plan of the enſuing campaign, although on the eve of being opened; that the people of Belgium were entirely averſe to the diſorganizing prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of our Revolution; that we had neither time before us to remove what he (Cambon) call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their prejudices, nor to cruſh them; that in the beginning of the approaching March, the enemy would attack the French poſts upon the Meuſe, which were too diſtant from each other, and not ſufficiently ſtrong; that, maſters of the
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:026918_0084_0FD260443A5048A0"/>
paſſage of Maeſtricht, they would penetrate the centre of the French line; that the Belgians, finding a power to protect them, would take up arms every where at once, and would put to the ſword the garriſons in the interior part of Belgium, compoſed of ſeeble battalions of new levies; that, occupying the poſts behind the French, they would not only cut of the proviſions of the army, but its retreat; that in this ſituation the army could not gain France, but would be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely ruined, and thus all would be loſt to the Republic. General Dumourier repreſented, more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, that theſe odious robberies would not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce as much to France as would a juſt conduct toward the Belgians; that it would be more pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to borrow part of the treaſures of the clergy, and ſo to intereſt them in our ſucceſs, than to ſeize upon the whole by violence; that, as to ſpecie, there would be no neceſſity for ſending any from France into Belgium, where it was in abundance; that the true means of putting it in circulation, and at length to replace it by aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nats, was to engage the rich merchants of Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp, Bruſſels, and Ghent, in the furniſhing of proviſions, clothing, and all the neceſſaries for the war; that, in this way, the ſupply of every thing would be ſecured, and the expences re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to one half; that the contractors would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive aſſignats in payment, and would be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by their own intereſt to give them curren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. The General obſerved that the Convention, by annulling the decree of the 15th of December, would effectually free the Belgians, whom they had reduced to a ſlavery more revolting than their former ſervitude; that in this caſe the Belgians would form a free conſtitution, raiſe troops, and join our arms; that this fraternity of arms and mutual ſervices would induce them, more effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually than any other means, to demand at leaſt a
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:026918_0085_0FD260786A1CEDF8"/>
permanent alliance with the Republic, if not an entire union.</p>
                     <p>Cambon ſeemed inclined to yield, eſpecially when the general promiſed him that, ſhould theſe juſt, moderate and wiſe means be adopted, he would not only forbear longer to demand any thing for his army, which the reſources of Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gium could provide for in abundance, but that he would procure the French treaſury ſeveral mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions by way of loan. He well knew that the Belgians, to withdraw themſelves from their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ruinous ſlavery, would fulfil the promiſes which he now made in their name.</p>
                     <p>After this firſt conference, Cambon went to the Convention, and, in the heat of the debate, ſaid in the tribune, that if the decree of the 15th of December was not executed, it would be becauſe Dumourier had oppoſed it by the prerogative of his <hi>Veto.</hi> Notwithſtanding this dark treachery, in which, to render General Dumourier odious, Cambon aſſimilated him with the king, whoſe trial was then proſecuting with bitterneſs, the General conſented to have another interview with him, and even invited him to dinner, together with a deputy named Ducos.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond conference, which laſted more than ſix hours, was not carried on with much tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. General Dumourier having ſaid that if Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon was reſolved upon oppreſſing the Belgians, he might ſeek another General, ſince Dumourier never would conſent to become an <hi>Altila</hi> to a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who had received the French as friends and brethren; Cambon took an opportunity to tell the Convention that nothing could be more indecent than to hear a General threatening to reſign in conſequence of every decree that was paſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his opinion; that the Republic muſt not reſt upon one man, and that they ought either to impoſe ſilence on the General, or to puniſh him.
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:026918_0086_0FD26035DA6B8CC0"/>
In this fruitleſs manner terminated the General's conferences with Cambon, whom he expreſſly warned againſt the events that have ſince hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened.</p>
                     <p>It was not without reaſon, Cambon had ſaid, that he was devoid of reſources for the war. In January, there was no more in the national trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury than an hundred and ninety-two millions of livres in aſſignats, and from fifteen to twenty mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of livres in ſpecie. Theſe ſums were not ſufficient for the army till the month of April, and the whole preſumed value of the lands of the clergy was already conſumed by the emiſſion of aſſignats on that fund.</p>
                     <p>Dumourier acquired this knowledge in the ſecond ſitting of the committee of general ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. As it was then reſolved to augment the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to three hundred and ſeventy thouſand men, he repreſented to the committee, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree for that purpoſe would be uſeleſs, as was the caſe with others of the ſame kind the preceding year, if the miniſter of war did not at the ſame time preſent a ſtatement of the ſums neceſſary for each particular article belonging to the augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſuch as clothing, arms, horſes, &amp;c. and if the Convention did not place theſe ſums at the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate diſpoſition of the miniſter of war. Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon, who aſſiſted at the ſitting, acknowledged the truth of the General's obſervation, but ſtated the poverty of the treaſury, and ſaid he knew not on what fund to iſſue new aſſignats, ſince the only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource that remained was the national foreſts, and the eſtates of the emigrants. Inſtantly, the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent part of the committee cried out, they had nothing to do but to ſell thoſe eſtates forthwith. Diſputes ſucceeding, the General requeſted leave to give his opinion.</p>
                     <p>He deſired the committee to conſider that the lands of the clergy had ſold exceedingly ill; that
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:026918_0087_0FD2607A8B7712E8"/>
a part ſtill remained unſold, the general appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion being ſuch that there were no buyers; that, if under theſe circumſtances, they ſhould order the ſale of the eſtates of the emigrants, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued at more than twelve hundred millions of livres, this great addition to the lands on ſale would ſtill further diminiſh the value of the whole, and complete the ruin of the nation; that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit of aſſignats recently iſſued would be ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by this fatal operation; ſince the public, judging by the price of the lands, would doubt the ſufficiency of the funds on which the aſſignats were grounded; for, ſuppoſing they ſhould hazard the emiſſion of twelve hundred millions on the eſtates of the emigrants, as ſome members had propoſed, either they would not find purchaſers, or the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce of the ſale would not amount to the third of the enormous ſum; that then the ſtate would loſe the other two thirds of that ſum, and Would be me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naced with inevitable bankruptcy.</p>
                     <p>As to the national foreſts, he repreſented that wood was already very ſearce in France, and, if they alienated theſe foreſts, the purchaſers would cut down the whole; that, beſides the enormous conſumption of wood for articles of every kind, France had not a ſufficient quantity of coal for fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and that, independent of this inconvenience, which France would ſeel for more than a century, this reſource would not produce, at the utmoſt, more than two or three hundred millions of livres, although it ſtood valued at eight hundred mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions.</p>
                     <p>The weight of theſe conſiderations was acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, and it was agreed to leave theſe two ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects untouched; and thus, General Dumourier ſaved the eſtates of the emigrants for that time: but, neither this ſervice, nor many others General Dumourier has rendered the emigrants, could ever obtain him juſtice or candour on their part.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="90" facs="unknown:026918_0088_0FD2603728552260"/>
The committee reſolved upon propoſing to the Convention the iſſuing of ſix hundred millions of livres in aſſignats, on the groſs fund of all the national lands, without appropriating any ſpecific part for the ſecurity.</p>
                     <p>This mode of iſſuing paper on vague funds is a dangerous practice in finance, and it was this kind of abuſe of confidence which ruined <hi>Law</hi>'s ſyſtem in 1720. However, the committee had as yet kept it within bounds. It has ſince been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to twelve hundred millions of livres. This is a ſmooth deſcent that leads to bankruptcy; but bankruptcy is the laſt reſource of Cambon. He has himſelf ſaid that it is inevitable. As to the Convention they are not employed in conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſo profound. They have no object but to exiſt from day to day, without the trouble of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring what will be the reſult. In ſuch hands is the richeſt kingdom in the univerſe.</p>

Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourier told the King, that he imagined it would be uſeful to the King's perſonal intereſt, but eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially to the public concerns, for the new mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, named by him on the recommendation of the people, and who were members of the Jacobin ſociety, to preſent themſelves to the ſociety, leſt they ſhould now be ſuſpected of joining the ariſtocracy; and he propoſed to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the ſitting of that evening himſelf. The King perceived the importance of the meaſure, and approved of Dumourier's deſign. Some days previous to that, the factions had adopted the <hi>red cap</hi> for the emblem of liberty. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourier, and the Girondine party, who had hitherto profeſſed to be the friends of order, and who, indeed, cannot be reproached with having flattered the Jacobins at any period, convinced Pethion, then mayor of Paris, then beloved by the Jacobins, then all-powerful, that this badge aſſumed by the people, might be productive of the greateſt diſorders, if not of the horrors at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the conteſt of the white and red roſes in England, and that of the times of the hoods in King John's reign at Paris. Pethion, at that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, poſſeſſed an abſolute aſcendency over Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſpierre and the Jacobins; and promiſed that he would write a note to them on the ſubject, and that the red cap ſhould be ſuppreſſed. The day on which Pethion was to write was the ſame that Dumourier had choſen for paying his reſpects to the Jacobins. The letter was indeed written, but had not arrived when Dumourier entered the hall of the aſſembly. All the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:026918_0090_0FD26038D95BF180"/>
had red caps on their heads, and a cap was offered to Dumourier as he was mounting the tribune. He was compelled to put it on, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudently to ſubject himſelf to very great riſks.— Dumourier ſaid little in the tribune. Having aſſured them that, when war ſhould be declared, he would quit his pen to ſerve them with his ſword, he left the hall. He was ſcarcely gone, when Pethion's letter was announced and read, and produced the deſired effect, in baniſhing the caps from the aſſembly; ſo that half an hour would have ſaved the miniſter this diſgrace. The public, miſled by falſe royaliſts, that is to ſay, by the anti-conſtitutional party, have misjudged this fact, which was but a mere accident.</p>
                     <p>At the time of Dumourier's quitting the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, the Jacobins were become his bittereſt enemies. The General's ſucceſs in Champagne, had reſtored him a little to their favour, in ſpite of Marat's accuſations; and he appeared at the club, for a quarter of an hour, on his being at Paris, in October 1792. But he never held any correſpondence with the ſociety, nor with any one of its members.</p>
                     <p>Haſſenfratz, Andouin, and the other clerks of the war-office, were never abſent from the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Jacobins. They multiplied accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt the General; and often demanded that he ſhould be compelled to appear at the bar to anſwer their charges. But in the midſt of theſe intrigues, the Jacobins were deſirous of attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the General to their party. The majority uſually oppoſed his enemies; and, when Haſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fratz produced his grand accuſation reſpecting the embezzlement of two hundred thouſand livres, together with the papers to ſubſtantiate the charge, the ſociety ſilenced him, and paſſed to the order of the day.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="93" facs="unknown:026918_0091_0FD260822F5802A8"/>
The Jacobins even employed ſeveral of their emiſſaries, to induce the General to attend their ſittings. Anacharſis Clootz, uſed various arts to that end; but the General always excuſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, on the ground that he could not appear at the ſociety till he had offered his homage to the Convention. Doctor Seyffer made attempts of the ſame nature; as well as Proli, an adventurer of Bruſſels, who was deſirous of procuring at leaſt an interview between the General and one Desfieux, a celebrated Jacobin, and one of the moſt active itinerants of the ſect, who, arriving at Bourdeaux, found means of diſgracing the members of the Girondine party, and of exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the populace againſt the honeſt part of that great city. Jean-Bon St. Andre, who was a member of the Convention, and an enthuſiaſtic Jacobin, notwithſtanding he had the reputation of being an honeſt man, having conceived a great eſteem for Dumourier, although he had no perſonal acquaintance with the General, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely anxious to bring about this interview, and requeſted that he might be preſent. The General was not ſatisfied that the adventurer Proli, whom he deſpiſed, ſhould be the medium of this negociation; however, for many impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant reaſons, he, at length, conſented to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview.</p>
                     <p>On the day appointed, the General was indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; but as he would not, by a violation of his word, ſeem to be wanting in reſpect to Desfieux and St. Andre, to both of whom he was a ſtranger, he made another appointment to meet them at the houſe of Bonne-Carrere, who was the intimate friend of theſe two perſons.</p>
                     <p>The interview took place at the houſe of Bonne-Carrere. Desfieux appeared to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral to be a man of mean capacity, and of a violent diſpoſition. Jean-Bon St. Andre ſeemed
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:026918_0092_0FD2603F2DB30920"/>
better informed, and more moderate. No ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement could be made reſpecting the mode of the General's preſenting himſelf to the Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin ſociety; nor on the conduct the ſociety would obſerve towards him, governed as it was by Marat. Dumourier, therefore, declined enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into any engagement to preſent himſelf to the ſociety; nor did he make any declaration of a contrary intention.</p>
                     <p>As to the trial of the King, which the General feared to touch upon, excepting very ſlightly, leſt he ſhould injure the cauſe by ſeeming to be intereſted in it, he ſaw that Desfieux and Jean-Bonne St. Andre, were governed by ſavage rage againſt the King, which vented itſelf in the vileſt and moſt unjuſt terms; and he perceived clearly, that he had nothing to hope on that point from theſe men.</p>
                     <p>They vehemently ſupported Pache and his aſſociates, and Desfieux, who called himſelf the organ of the Jacobins, requeſted Dumourier to withdraw his accuſations againſt the miniſter of war, whom the Jacobins, he ſaid, were deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to preſerve in his place; and invited the General to join their faction in diſgracing Le Brun, Garat, Claviere, and above all, Roland; which miniſters they conſidered as the agents of the Girondine party.</p>
                     <p>The General now reſolved to break off theſe negociations entirely; and informed Bonne-Carrere of his determination. But he felt the danger to which he ſhould expoſe himſelf in taking this ſtep; and eſpecially in purſuing the plan he had laid down, and which he had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced to the convention, of reſigning the command. He well knew, that thenceforth he muſt either join, the Jacobins, and become the accomplice of their crimes, or deprived of the command, his only ſhield againſt his enemies,
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:026918_0093_0FD26083D112E150"/>
he ſhould be purſued on the unjuſt accuſations of Haſſenfratz, and delivered over to the execrable Revolutionary Tribunal, that has ſince murdered Cuſtine on the ſlighteſt pretences.</p>
                     <p>Dumourier therefore made up his mind upon the courſe he ſhould purſue; and which he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward adapted to the political circumſtances that will be related in the following chapters. Loſing all hope of ſaving the king, he now thought only of the means of avenging his death, of ſaving his unfortunate queen and her ſon, and, by the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of a limited monarchy, of putting an end to the frightful diſorders that were compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the diſgrace and ruin of France.</p>

                     <p>IT was with the ſix miniſters exerciſing the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutive power in France, that General Dumou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier tranſacted the chief part of his buſineſs dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the twenty-ſix days that he paſſed at Paris. And here it will be neceſſary to obſerve that, in a writing he publiſhed after that period, by an error in the preſs, twenty-ſix hours were put for twenty-ſix days. In conſequence of which error, a criticiſm appeared in one of the Engliſh papers, in which the general was ſeriouſly reproached with aſſerting he had performed, in twenty-ſix hours, the buſineſs of twenty-ſix days.</p>
                     <p>The miniſters were Roland, to whom we will give a chapter apart. He was hated by the other

five, who concealed all they could from him. They were themſelves divided into two very oppoſite parties. One was compoſed of Le Brun, miniſter of foreign affairs, whom Dumourier had made firſt clerk, and who was very fit for that ſituation, being induſtrious and well informed; but he had neither ſufficient dignity nor energy of mind to act for himſelf, and was rendered deceitful by his timidity of character, even to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his benofactor, although he ſtill regarded him as neceſſary to his ſupport. He had diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from his office Marat and Noel, two men neither deficient in talents nor honeily; had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed no perſon to ſuperintend the buſineſs of the office, and to diſtribute the work to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſuperior clerks; and he had taken for his principal ſecretary a man of the name of Iſabeau, whoſe reputation was none of the faireſt. Occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied, like miniſters of former times, by intrigues for the preſervation of his place, he was more influenced by the Jacobins than became a man, to whom Briſſot, Condorcet, and the other heads of the Girondine party dictated the policy of his foreign negociations.</p>
                     <p>Of the faction of Le Brun was Garat, miniſter of juſtice, a man of an able and upright mind, and to whom no reproach could be made except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that, by an adulation unworthy of himſelf, he had endeavoured to apologize for the well known murders of the firſt days of September. Grou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velle, although only ſecretary of the council, may be conſidered as having all the influence of a miniſter, ſince he aſſumed much authority and gave his opinion, and decided on every thing.— He was a man of letters, overbearing, and open in his avowal of bold and extravagant notions of liberty.</p>
                     <p>On the other ſide was Pache, miniſter of war, a man of ſenſe, and poſſibly an honeſt man, but
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:026918_0095_0FD260419A7D6710"/>
ignorant and blindly devoted to the Jacobin party. He had a wife and daughter, equally ugly and ill tempered, who frequented the clubs and even the haunts of the Marſeillois, to demand the king's death. The war-office was become a club, breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing but blood and carnage. The clerks always wore the red cap at their deſks, and uſed the phraſes <hi>thou</hi> and <hi>thee</hi> to every one, even to the miniſter, who himſelf affected a ſlovenly dreſs, and courted the Pariſian populace, by aſſuming their manners.</p>
                     <p>The ſame diſguſting ſcene preſented itſelf in the office of the marine department, from which all the clerks of character and experience were driven, to make way for ignorant and furious Jacobins, who, notwithſtanding the filthineſs of their appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, have acquired immenſe fortunes.</p>
                     <p>The war-office and that of the marine depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, united in preſenting an addreſs to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Convention, ſigned alſo, as it was ſaid, by the two miniſters, demanding that the king ſhould be put to death. Monge, the miniſter of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, was an academician, had been an excellent lecturer in hydrography, and ſeemed a man of ſimple manners, but was a little ungracious in his behaviour. He was entirely devoted to Pache; and, in concert with him, ſupported the Jacobin faction in the council.</p>
                     <p>Claviere, miniſter of the finances, although he was connected with and ſupported by the Giron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſts, and was the relation of Briſſot, frequently joined the other faction, from a love of contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and becauſe it was the moſt active and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful. Like the reſt, he thought of nothing but of preſerving his place, which Cambon, and the committee of finance were endeavouring to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs.</p>
                     <p>Such was the executive council of France, in the moſt critical period of her exiſtence. An ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious

and ſad reflection naturally preſents itſelf; the French Revolution, under the pretence of equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing all men, has debaſed all men. Moſt of the Jacobins, belonged to the loweſt claſs of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and, unable to find among themſelves perſons equal to the firſt ſtations, they lowered the nature of thoſe ſtations to their own level. Hence, there is neither dignity, nor character, in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: nor reſpectability, nor a ſenſe of duty in the people; and the populace, unlike the Athenian democracy, are drunken and ſavage ſlaves, uſurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the place of the Spartans. The ancient go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was deſtroyed to remedy the abuſe of diſtributing places among the nobles, without any regard to their moral capacities. Yet, inſtead of the Revolution replacing them by men of talents, it has filled their ſeats with artful and impudent plebeians.</p>
                     <p>France cannot eſcape her entire ruin, But in freeing herſelf from the ſubaltern tyrants that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade every department. Unhappily, ſhe no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er has the means in her own hands, ſince theſe tyrants are maſters of the money, arms, power, and authority of the nation. But the ignorance and barbarous rage of this horde is deſtructive of itſelf; and foreign arms will reſtore the ancient deſpotiſm, inſtead of forming that juſt equilibrium between the talents of men and the employments of the ſtate that conſtitutes the perfection of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. This ſtate of things however, cannot remain long; becauſe the love of liberty is too deeply rooted in France to be ever again wholly deſtroyed; and the reſtoration of deſpotiſm will beget another revolution, the moment that foreign troops ſhall be withdrawn from the country, and ſhall leave the nobles of France, ſcattered over that vaſt kingdom, to the vengeance of the people, called down on their heads by the abuſe of their ſhort lived triumph.</p>

The council did not interfere in the fate of the king. Le Brun and Garat, ſeemed to apprehend the conſequences of the trial; but they feared to employ the means, or to indulge in the idea, of putting a ſtop to it, or of ſuſpending it; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined themſelves to a declaration, that it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate for France that ſuch a trial had commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. Roland was the moſt terrified of all the miniſters at this trial; becauſe, in reflecting on the imprudence, and on the injuſtice of his former complaints againſt the King, no doubt he felt that he was the principal cauſe of the king's danger. He relented and was ſilent. It belonged to the malignant mind of Claviere, to rejoice at the trial; and beſides, he had always diſcovered a perſonal hatred againſt Louis XV<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> As to Pache and Monge, they canvaſſed openly for the king's death. And Grouvelle declared, that it was neceſſary to the honour of the Republic, that he ſhould die.</p>
                     <p>The open and bitter quarrels that exiſted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the miniſter of war and the generals, on the complaints made by the latter respecting the armies, and the providing of neceſſaries for the troops, could never bring the council to take any ſtep in its collective capacity relative to thoſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. Exery one of the members reſerved an excluſive authority in his own department; and Pache laid before the council, as well as before the committee of war, ſtatements which were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together falſe, and which were uniformly oppoſed by new complaints from the Generals, and by the reports of the Commiſſioners of the Convention with the armies. The council heard all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports and complaints, but they ſtill upheld the committee of contracts, which was ſecretly influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced by Claviere, the friend of Bidermann, who was at the head of the committee; and the affairs of the armies were conducted as before. No pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſſion was made either for the clothing ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>once,

At that time the Jacobins had reſolved to place one of their faction at the head of the municipality, and had promiſed to make Pache mayor of Paris; he, therefore, gave himſelf little uneaſineſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the future embarraſſments of the war department; which Haſſenfratz and Meuſnier were to quit along with him.</p>
                     <p>The more we reflect on the conduct of the Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobins, the more are we loſt in conjecture reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the ſpirit by which they were guided. It is certain, that they have been continually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious to diſorganize France, and to render uſeleſs the immenſe reſources ſhe poſſeſſed for the defence of her liberty; they have ruined the fleets and armies; they have impriſoned or driven out of the kingdom, the ableſt officers; they have laviſhed the treaſures of the nation in wild and ineffectual expences; they have deſtroyed the commercial and political connections of France with other nations; and have ſet every nation at defiance; and it cannot be doubted, that the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety has been influenced by Engliſh, Italians, Flemings and Germans, pretending to be furious Jacobins, and who were known to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The decree of the 15th of December, far from being diſapproved of by the Council, was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by every one of the members, Le Brun had been ſecretary to the people of Liege, during this revolution, to which he had given his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port by a periodical work, entitled, "The Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of Europe." This paper was not ill written; and it was in conſequence of ſeeing it, that Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourier
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:026918_0099_0FD2614DD4965708"/>
had placed him at the department of fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign affairs. Le Brun was of opinion, as well as moſt of the other revolutioniſts of France, that a revolution could not be ſucceſsful without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing attended by a complete diſorganization; ſo that he could not fail to approve of a decree, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to diſorganize a people, who had the misfortune to call upon us for aid. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Dumourier, which inclined him to reſpect the liberty, property, and opinions of others, could not be very acceptable to Le Brun. But Le Brun was ſilent on the ſubject to Dumou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier, although he, in concert with Marat, Chepy, and his other emiſſaries, had eſtabliſhed a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive engine in Belgium, under the name of the Revolutionary Committee. The General complained to the miniſter of the language and conduct of Chepy, deſiring he might be recalled, as being dangerous to the affairs of France in Belgium. Le Brun, however, not only counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced Chepy, but gave him new inſtructions that greatly extended his power.</p>
                     <p>In the ſame manner while the General was ſoliciting the revocation of the decree of the 15th of December, the council appointed, on the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation of the Jacobins, thirty-two com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners of the Executive Power, to whoſe ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation was annexed the ſalary of 10,000 livres, beſides the expences of their journey, and the profits of their robberies. Theſe commiſſioners were furniſhed with ridiculous inſtructions, in which the council feigned to confine their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority within narrow bounds; but the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners paid no regard to their inſtructions, having themſelves given an arbitrary latitude to their power. Theſe miſcreants inflicted the greateſt wrongs on the Belgians, and cauſed among that people an utter abhorrence of the French name.</p>

It was now the 15th of January, and the council knew not how many troops France really had on foot, nor how many enemies ſhe would have to contend with, in the campaign. The General ſlated to the Council that, although all Europe ſhould declare againſt France, ſhe having no civil war, (for the revolt in La Vendee had not yet broken out) might defend her frontiers with three hundred and ſeventy thouſand men (the ſixth part, of them being cavalry) excluſive of the garriſons and troops of the fleet, by ſtanding on the defenſive on the ſouth and on the banks of the Rhine, and confining their offenſive opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the frontiers extending from the Mozelle to Dunkirk. The General propoſed to diſtribute the troops in the following manner: 80,000 men to compoſe the army of Belgium; 40,000 men that of the Ardennes; a corps of 20,000 to be poſted on the Mozelle, to keep open the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication between the armies of the Ardennes and that of the Rhine; 50,000 to compoſe the army of the Rhine; a reſerve of 20,000 men to be placed at Chalons or Soiſſons; a corps of 15,000 at Lyons, to watch Switzerland and Pied<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

All theſe armies might mutually aſſiſt each other; and, as the whole of France was armed, even ſhould the enemy penetrate any part, it was not to be doubted they would be repulſed or overwhelmed.</p>
                     <p>General Dumourier alſo propoſed that Cuſtine's army, which had already evacuated Franckfort, ſhould fall back upon Landan, leaving a garriſon

in Mayence ſufficient to compel the king of Pruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia to loſe three or four months before that place, which would afford time to put the fortified towns of Alſace, Lorraine, and the Ardennes, into a proper ſtate of defence, and to make the enemy on that ſide <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The General further propoſed that the greateſt efforts ſhould be made to puſh the campaign on with vigour on the ſide of Belgium, becauſe that being a flat country without fortified places, or even without any of thoſe naturally ſtrong ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of country which ſtand in the place of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes, the fate of the war in theſe provinces muſt be decided by battles. On this ſcheme, if the French ſhould be victorious, the greater part of the French army might paſs the Rhine: and if unſucceſsful, might retire behind the fortreſſes of Flanders and Artois; however the whole cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign might paſs without the French lines being broke in upon in this quarter.</p>
                     <p>Inſtead of this plan, which Dumourier laid before the Committee of General Safety, as well as the Executive Council, La Clos, who had juſt been appointed to the command in India, propoſed that they ſhould inſtantly ſend him out with fifteen veſſels and 15,000 men, which meaſure neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily involved a war with England and Holland, although it had then been very eaſy and was very neceſſary to the fafety of France to have avoided that war.</p>
                     <p>The object of this expedition of La Clos was to make himſelf maſter of the Cape of Good Hope and the iſland of Ceylon; and afterwards, to join Tippoo Saib and to attack Bengal.</p>
                     <p>Kellermann, on paying his reſpects to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Convention, on his departure to take the command of the army of Dauphine, which amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to nearly twenty thouſand men (excluſive of the army of the country of Nice, under General

Biron, from ten to twelve thouſand men) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived orders from the Preſident to go and conquer Rome; and the General gravely an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that he took his leave to go to Rome. This army had alſo been weakened by draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between ſeven and eight thouſand men from it, for the fleet that lay at Toulon, deſtined to conquer Sardinia. This expedition was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in the moſt ſtormy part of the year, in a narrow ſea, abounding with rocks and iſlands; and part of the fleet was loſt, and the expedition failed.</p>
                     <p>The army of the Pyrennees conſiſted only of an extenſive eſtabliſhment of ſtaff officers, without troops. Yet the Convention had reſolved upon conquering Spain, and had deſtined 40,000 men, that were not raiſed, and General Servan, for the purpoſe. There were 110 troops on the coaſt of the weſt and north; excepting ſome weak gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons at Belle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſle, and at two or three other places on that coaſt. There was no army of reſerve. Fifty thouſand men were wanting to complete the army of Belgium and that of the Ardennes; the army of Alſace did not amount to 20,00 men, excluſive of 22,000 ſhut up in Mayence; and the army of the Mozelle did not amount to 12,000 men.</p>
                     <p>In order therefore to put the plan of General Dumourier in execution, there were wanting more than 150,000 men; together with the proviſions, arms, and clothing, for this large body of troops. Above all, France was in want of cavalry. The armies of Belgium and of the Ardennes required a body of 20,000 cavalry; and the two armies had not 6,000; and they were in want of 15,000 ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery horſes.</p>
                     <p>The General's plan was adopted; the 370,000 men were decreed to be raiſed; and a few altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made in the diſtribution of the troops; but
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:026918_0103_0FD2608BC3D10918"/>
this was all that over was done towards the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the plan. However, the General ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained an order a few days before his departure for 15,000 men of the new-raiſed battalions to march from the third line in Pieardy, Flanders, and Artois, where they were altogether uſeleſs, into mariti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>nders.</p>
                     <p>Independent of the Executive Council, from which (as Le Brun and Garat ſuſpected) a great many projects were concealed, eſpecially thoſe reſpecting foreign politics, there were two pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate committees held at the houſe of General Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourier, which ſeemed to diſpoſe of the fate of the empire; and which in fact produced nothing. They were compoſed of the two miniſters Le Brun and Garat, and thoſe members of the Girondine party, Condorcet, Pethion, Genſonne and Briſſot. It is probable that the only object of the party, in eſtabliſhing theſe committees, was that their exiſtence ſhould be known to Paris, in order to beget an opinion that the General was entirely devoted to them; and thereby to ſtrengthen the party, by the acquiſition of his friends. Le Brun even ſeemed unwilling that the negociations then carrying on with England and Holland ſhould be at all enquired into by the committees; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted the General to forbear touching on the ſubject; and it was never introduced.</p>
                     <p>Briſſot boaſted of his plans for the conqueſt of Spain and Italy; but the General eaſily detected the folly of his calculations.</p>
                     <p>The ſituation of the Republic with Switzerland, was an intereſting ſubject. The malignity of Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viere, had been lately gratified, in compelling General Monteſquieu to become an exile to eſcape the fangs of his perſecutor the vile Du Bois de Crance; and, in diſorganizing Geneva, his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive country. Briſſot and his adherents maintained, that it was neceſſary to compel the Swiſs Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:026918_0104_0FD260C19632F7D8"/>
to abandon, their neutrality; or, in caſe of refuſal to attack them; and it is probable that in this they were acted upon by the agents of the combined powers, to whom it was very important that Switzerland ſhould join the confederacy. The General proved by arguments, drawn from the relative ſituations of France, Switzerland, and the Combined Powers, to which these meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſicians were ſtrangers, that it was prudent to conciliate the good diſpoſitions of the Helvetic body towards France; yet, at the ſame time to maintain an army of 15,000 men to cover Lyons, and to be ready on any emergency on that ſide.</p>
                     <p>Dumourier was the more deſirous of preſerving this neutrality, becauſe it was during his admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, that the event of the diſarming the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Erneſt happened at Aix. At that period, he made every compenſation he could to that brave regiment, for the injuſtice of his countrymen; he preſented the red ribband to the two principal of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, and provided for the ſafety of their retreat with their men to the frontiers.</p>
                     <p>General Dumourier always exerted every means in his power to preſerve peace with Switzerland; a meaſure that was ſo juſt, and ſo neceſſary to the welfare of the two nations. But he muſt own, that his efforts have leſs contributed to that difficult taſk, than the prudent and firm conduct of Colonel de Weiſs, a member of the ſovereign council of Berne, and a writer diſtinguiſhed by works which diſplay extenſive knowledge, energy of mind, and goodneſs of heart. This officer, without poſſeſſing any oſtenſible diplomatic cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, was reſpected by the miniſtry, was liſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to in the committees, and had even acquired an influence in the convention. Tranquil when ſurrounded by danger, and uncorrupted in the midſt of crimes, he had the courage to ſay to one of the leaders of ſaction, <hi>I know that you can cauſe me

Various ſecret preparations were already making for an attack upon Switzerland, in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of an ill digeſted plan of Robert, Claviere, and other Swiſs emigrants. The attack was to be made on three points at once. A column, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of part of the army of the Upper Rhine, and augmented by new levies, was to take Baſle by ſurprize, or aſſault, and keep the Auſtrians in check. Another column, drawn from the army of the Alps, was to blockade Geneva, where the French had numerous partizans, and to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate by Verſoix into the Pays de Vaud. The third diviſion, compoſed of choſen troops, was to march ſuddenly by the Paſs of Porentru, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready occupied by the French, against Berne, whoſe treaſury, granaries, and arſenal, excited
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:026918_0106_0FD260C64C738FA0"/>
the cupidity of the projectors of this plan. Berne had been already ſecretly reconnoitred; and, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be nearly ſurrounded by a rapid and deep river, it was expected that the place would be carried, by pouring in bombs and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The projectors of the plan alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected a powerful diverſion to be made in their behalf, by the diſcontented party, (whoſe num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers were greatly exaggerated) of the Lower Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lais, Neuf-Chatel, Pays de Vaud, Soleure, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne, and Fribourg, This laſt city was deſtined to be an object of ſignal vengeance, on account of ſome offence ſhe had committed reſpecting the aſſignats. The popular governments were to be informed that theſe hoſtilities would not affect them, and that France would continue to preſerve peace with them.

                     <head type="sub">The Retreat of Roland from the Adminiſtration.</head>
                     <p>AT the time of the king's death, Roland, who had long ſtrove to maintain his ſituation in the miniſtry, againſt the will of the Jacobins, as well as againſt the real inclinations of his own party, ſent a letter to his colleagues announcing his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation. The miniſters never appeared more chearful than on the day they received this letter, and the council appeared more like a ſchool re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved from the reſtraints of a troubleſome pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, than a grave meeting of Stateſmen. Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land's reſignation, made part of a compromiſe between the Jacobin and Gironde parties, in which it was agreed, that both Roland and Pache ſhould quit the miniſtry. But the conſequences were very different to thoſe two miniſters, the latter of them acquiring a ſituation of more real importance than any in the miniſtry; while the former remained more than ever expoſed to the infults and perſecutions of the Jacobins.</p>
                     <p>This ſacrifice made of Roland by his party, is another inſtance of the cowardice of that faction, which ought never to have abandoned a man, of
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:026918_0108_0FD260CA92B79870"/>
whoſe ſervices they had availed themſelves, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reſpect to his peace or ſafety. In truth, the whole conduct of Roland, in his public cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, was a miſtaken policy, which expoſed himſelf and his party to Continual danger. Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land did not poſſeſs much ſtrength of mind, but had acquired extenſive information on the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent branches of trade and manufactures; and, if it had been expedient to divide the duties of the adminſtration of the home department, which was too extenſive and too complicated for a mind of ſuch little energy, it is probable, he would have made an excellent miniſter of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial concerns. He was upright in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, and was poſſeſſed of a mild and philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropic diſpoſition; but the deſire of appearing a rigid moraliſt induced him to aſſume a ſeverity of character unnatural to him. He hoped to reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Cato the Cenſor, and had adopted his turn of converſation, at once cold and repulſive, but without the genius and boldneſs of that celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted man. In his dreſs he was nice and ſingular, following the faſhions of former times; but this was at leaſt leſs diſpleaſing than the ſlovenly affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Jacobins. His deportment was grave, and not unbecoming the dignity of his ſtation. He was indefatigable in the application of his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents. But he loved too much to gratify the will of the people, and was too ready to believe that the higher orders were oppreſſive and unjuſt; and this diſpoſition, that becomes dangerous when it is too generally indulged, conducted him habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally into precipitate and imprudent meaſures.— He was candid in his examination of the ſubjects belonging to the other departments of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſuch as thoſe relating to the armies, the marine, and foreign negociations; and ſuppported, with great ſincerity, all propoſitions that came before the council of a juſt and reaſonable na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:026918_0109_0FD2608FB98AD9A8"/>
Perceiving the equivocal conduct of the other miniſters, miſtruſting their, talents and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps their good faith, he would no longer admit of any reſponſibility of the council in a collective capacity: and his pertinacity in reſuſing to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for any meaſures but thoſe that were the conſequence of his direct orders begat a greater hatred of him than ever among his colleagues.</p>
                     <p>The temper and qualities of Roland would have ſitted him well enough for the miniſtry had the republic been ſettled on its foundations, and if the times had been more free from the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of party rage, for he was a rigid republican. This diſpoſition was the cauſe of his ill conduct to Louis the XVI. and of the imprudent ſtep of delivering into the hands of the Convention the fatal cheſt containing the monarch's <hi>paſſive</hi> 
                        <note place="bottom">
                           <hi>Paſſive</hi>! Such is the word in the original, and it is print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Italics. Dumourier ſeems to have thought that Louis XVI. was innocent, becauſe he had not courage or capacity to <hi>contrive</hi> the means of injuring the nation. Suppoſing he is not miſtaken in that concluſion, he ſeems to have forgotten, that he was conceding one of the great points, inſiſted upon by the friends of Democracy, that it is in vain to have an innocent king, if his miniſters, miſtreſſes, wives, or favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, be not innocent alſo; as it would be in vain that theſe latter ſhould be innocent, if the king be avaricious, deceitful, or tyrannical.</note> cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence, in which thoſe baſe men found pretexts for the martyrdom of that unfortunate prince.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps it was prejudicial to the intereſts of Roland that he was governed by his wife, who was a woman of fine talents, and whom he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be the critic, that gave a poliſh to his numerous works; but certainly it was among his misfortunes to be ſurrounded by ignorant and deſigning journaliſts, who compoſed, under his directions, thoſe verboſe harangues that covered the walls and public buildings of Paris; for the

                        </gap>gine of faction againſt him and his party.</p>
                     <p>Among the women who have riſen to celebrity during the French revolution, no one has acted a more conſpicuous or noble part than that of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame Roland. She was between thirty and forty years of age, had a lively and healthy counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and a moſt intereſting figure; ſhe dreſſed with great taſte; converſed with ability; although perhaps with too much wit and reſinement; ſhe was innocently gay, and had placed herſelf at the head of a party conſiſting of metaphyſicians, ſcholars, members of the Convention, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters. Every day theſe partizans of Madame Roland paid their reſpects to her, and on the Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day of every week they dined at her houſe, where the conduct and politics of ſtateſmen took their character from Madame Roland's opinions.— None of the wives of the other miniſters were admitted to theſe meetings.</p>
                     <p>It would be unjuſt not to notice the ſpirit with which Madame Roland conducted herſelf under an inſult of the Jacobins, at a time when her huſband's name had already fallen into great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit. Interrogated at the bar of the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>reſpecting the injurious accuiations of an unprincipled man named Viard, ſhe ſaid, <hi>I am the wife of citizen Roland; I bear the name of a virtuous man, to whom I am proud to be allied.</hi>— Certainly it required all the malignity of the Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobins to perſecute ſuch a woman.</p>
                     <p>Although Madame Roland poſſeſſed much good ſenſe, ſhe permitted it to be ſeen that ſhe governed her huſband, and thereby did a diſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to his reputation, for which ſhe could not compenſate by the value of her councils. It was Madame Roland that ſelected Pache and Lanthe mas to aid her huſband in his adminiſtration; and the former of them ſo entirely gained the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:026918_0111_0FD260912B2FC558"/>
of Roland, that he was appointed miniſter of war through Roland's intereſt. Pache was no ſooner the colleague of Roland, than he became his enemy, and ſought by every means to ruin him, and for that purpoſe he did not heſitate to become the partiſan of the moſt intemperate men among the Jacobins. The conteſt between thoſe two miniſters was open, and their hoſtile attacks were without meaſure or decency. They both deſcended from their ſituations, but with Pache it was only to riſe to higher power. Roland was to be ſubjected to new and more bitter misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.</p>
                     <p>Other women have alſo diſtinguiſhed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves during the revolution, but without the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity that has been preſerved by Madame Roland; excepting, indeed, it be Madame Necker, who, in many reſpects, may be conſidered as the rival of Madame Roland's fame, and whoſe age and experience, if it rendered her leſs agreeable to the thoughtleſs, gave her the advantage as the counſellor of her huſband. Mademoiſelle La Brouſſet, Madame de Stael, Condorcet, Paſtoret, Coigny and Theroigne, were either artful females, like thoſe who haunted the courts of former times, or differed in nothing from the vulgar and furious women of the Fauxbourgs of Paris.</p>
                     <p>One unfortunate woman, Elizabeth Corday, has conſigned her name to hiſtory, by an act, which happily for humanity will find few imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators, although it delivered the earth from a monſter.</p>
                     <p>The executive council ſeemed to have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone no change by the retreat of Roland from the miniſtry. During a conſiderable period be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his reſignation, he had been entirely occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied in brooding over his vexations, the attacks of his enemies, and the means of his defence. Every ſatire of the Jacobins that was directed
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:026918_0112_0FD260CFA79262E8"/>
againſt him, begat in his apprehenſion the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of juſtifying himſelf to the Convention; and the members of the Convention, who, perhaps, were more irritated by the auſterity of Roland's virtue, than by the petulance of his ſpirit, ſaw nothing in thoſe homilies but an inſupportable pride. His own party, no longer deriving repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation from his name, had, in truth, renounced him; and had very ignorantly reſolved to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice him. Roland flattered himſelf that his reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation would not be accepted, and he remained in the houſe appropriated to the miniſter of the Home Department, till he was no longer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to doubt of his fate. During the latter part of his adminiſtration, he ſeldom ſlept in this houſe; as the Jacobins, to terrify him, frequently ſent bands of the foederates to make excurſions during the night round the houſe. In this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner were the repreſentatives of the executive power treated in France. Le Brun and Claviere have been ſince accuſed and impriſoned; and Garat was accuſed and arreſted after having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned. So ferocious has been the character of this revolution that, of the men who have had an eminent part in it, ſuch only have been out of the reach of a violent death as have fled and are in exile.</p>

She had diſplayed a ſuperiority over thoſe powers during the preceding campaign, which would have been entirely deciſive, if, according to the plan of General Dumourier; Cuſtine, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of paſſing the Rhine to levy an inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able contribution on Frankfort, and for which France paid ſo dearly, had made himſelf maſter of Coblentz, where there was no garriſon; and if the wants of the army had been ſupplied, ſo that the army of Belgium might have taken up its winter quarters along the banks of the Rhine, from Cleves to Cologne; that of the Ardennes, from Cologne to Andernach; that of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zelle, from Andernach to Mayence, including Coblentz; and that of Alſace, from Mayence to Landau, including Spires. This poſition would have compelled the county of Luxembourg to have ſurrendered, by cutting off its ſupplies of proviſions. The armies would have had behind them a country on which, whether it were neuter or an enemy, they might long have ſubſiſted; and, by opening the campaign early in the ſpring, might have paſſed the Rhine without difficulty, and have penetrated into the center of Germany, where the French would have been received with open arms, if they had poſſeſſed the prudence to have forborne from exciting terror in the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:026918_0114_0FD260D10CB8DDD0"/>
by unjuſt decrees and by the ſending of ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacious commiſſioners to commit violence, inſults and robberies.</p>
                     <p>This great plan was neglected; yet France might have ſuſtained herſelf with reputation and effect againſt her enemies who were in truth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready overcome, if her conduct and not drawn new enemies upon her.</p>
                     <p>Means exiſted, at this period, for preſerving Spain in her neutrality; and by employing them the nation would have ſpared herſelf the guilt of a great crime. The king of Spain engaged with the Convention to remain neuter, on condition that the life of the unfortunate Louis XVI. ſhould be ſpared. This ſtep does honour to the Spaniſh monarch: and it is difficult to imagine why the French princes did not follow ſo bright an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The implacable, ignorant Convention re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the terms of the Spaniſh monarch with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, and thereby committed a new crime againſt the nation, by creating her a new enemy, without conſulting her on the neceſſity or prudence of their conduct.</p>
                     <p>The courts of London and the Hague, had for ſome time betrayed a hatred to the French revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and the death of Louis XVI. could not but increaſe that hatred. But, in England, no part of the nation was willing to enter into a war againſt France, excepting the king, who conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his differences with the French as a perſonal quarrel. And in Holland, every party dreaded to be drawn into a war. It was therefore poſſible for France to preſerve peace with thoſe two coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; and, till that period, ſhe had wiſely culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated the good will of Holland, from whence ſhe drew ſpecie and proviſions; and it was eaſy to have continued that ſyſtem.</p>
                     <p>In the latter end of the month of November, General Dumourier propoſed to the executive
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:026918_0115_0FD260971C6F4C00"/>
council, the taking of Maeſtricht, without which he could neither defend the Meuſe nor the country of Leige. He thought it reaſonable, after many examples in former wars, to take and hold this place, engaging by a duly authoriſed manifeſto, to reſtore it at the end of the war. At that period his army was victorious and full of ardour. He had, after the taking of the citadel of Antwerp, aſſembled the whole of his heavy artillery at Tongres and Leige, in order not to expoſe the horſes belonging to the artillery to die for want of ſorage, (as the Jacobins have ſtupidly aſſerted) but to make himſelf maſter of Maeſtricht. That place was not as yet paliſadoed, nor provided with a garriſon, nor with any thing neceſſary to ſuſtain a ſiege. Venloo was in the ſame condition. Cauſes of complaint were not wanting to give a colour to the enterprize; and to throw the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of being the aggreſſors upon the Dutch, if they ſhould reſent his conduct, for they had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready frequently violated the neutrality, and had recently prohibited on pain of death, all exporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of proviſions to France, while proviſions in immenſe quantities were drawn from Holland, to eſtabliſh magazines, on the Lower Rhine, for the Imperialiſts and Pruſſians. The executive coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil rejected the general's propoſitions, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly commanded him to preſerve the ſtricteſt neutrality toward Holland, which injunction the general was punctual in obſerving. They then ſent him an order to undertake the ſiege of Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>embourg during the winter; but, the general ſhewing the abſurdity of the plan, it was not put in execution.</p>
                     <p>As the executive council had thus neglected the opportunity of ſeizing upon Maeſtricht, which may be regarded as the key of the Netherlands on the ſide of the Meuſe, the general was of opinion that it would no longer be prudent to commit any
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:026918_0116_0FD260D35CAE6070"/>
hoſtility on the part of France againſt Holland, being convinced that a war with England muſt be the conſequence of ſuch hoſtility; and his advice was thenceforward to preſerve a neutrality with both England and Holland, with the utmoſt ſolicitude.</p>
                     <p>The friendſhip of Holland was indiſpenſibly neceſſary to enable France to hold Belgium, for if the Dutch delivered the paſſages of Maeſtritcht and Venloo to the Auſtrians, the Meuſe would be no longer tenable, and the French would be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to abandon the countries of Leige, Guel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre, Limbourg, Brabant, and Namur, and retreat behind the Scheld: contracting their lines within the country lying between the citadel of Antwerp and Valenciennes. And in the caſe of the Engliſh and Dutch aſſembling an army in Dutch Flanders, the French would be further forced to abandon th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Scheld, and retire behind the river Lys, and under the fortified places of French Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Artois.</p>
                     <p>At this time there were at Paris many Dutch refugees victims of the Dutch revolution, and of the faithleſs and feeble conduct of the miniſter Brienne. Many among them were reſpectable and opulent men, who aſſured the French miniſtry that their party in Holland was much more conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable than that of the Stadtholder, which indeed was true. Theſe repreſentations were diſregarded till the month of January, when Le Brun after giving them an hearing, reſerred them to General Dumourier for his opinion reſpecting their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources, and eſpecially reſpecting a plan of inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Zealand which the Dutch patriots repreſented as eaſy to be undertaken, and certain of ſucceſs. After a deliberate examination the general judged the plan to be impracticable, but wrote to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter that he ſhould poſtpone giving a definite an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

more particularly to examine the ſeveral parts of the project; and it was reſolved that the Dutch refugees ſhould proceed to Antwerp with their revolutionary committee; and orders were given to the Dutch legion, conſiſting nearly of 10,000 men, to garriſon Antwerp, and to be ready to form the advanced guard of the French army, in caſe of a war with Holland.</p>
                     <p>An agent of Le Brun was appointed to attend the Dutch revolutionary committee; but no poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive engagement with them was entered into, and all that related to them was rendered dependent on the iſſue of a negociation which was then on the point of commencing.</p>
                     <p>At the time that Dumourier had been miniſter for foreign affairs he had ſent to the Hague, as miniſter plenipotentiary, Emanuel de Maulde, a colonel in the French army, who had conducted himſelf with great prudence and ability, had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured arms and horſes for France, and had ſo well reconciled his attention to the intereſts of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fugees with the reſpect due to the government of the country, as to acquire the confidence and eſteem of the two factions that divided Holland. This conduct, which was conformable to his in ſtructions, was too moderate to be agreeable to the temper of the preſent times; and de Maulde had moreover the misfortune to be noble. Le Brun in particular conceived an averſion to him. The military committee diſapproved of his ſending fuſees to Dunkirk. His meaſures were oppoſed on every ſide, and his intentions calumniated. He was recalled; and in his room was appointed Noel, whom the general had made principal clerk in the office for foreign affairs. Noel, although an extremely honeſt man, arriving with prejudices againſt de Maulde and plans much leſs moderate than thoſe on which Maulde had acted, was very ill
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:026918_0118_0FD260D747F31090"/>
received; and, attributing his reception to de Maulde, became his enemy and accuſer.</p>
                     <p>De Maulde, on his arrival at Paris, called upon the general; and told him that, if France deſired to preſerve a neutrality with Holland and Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, nothing was more eaſy; that, although the miniſters of the two courts would neither acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the National Convention, nor treat with Le Brun, yet the grand penſioner of Holland, Van Spiegel, and the Engliſh Ambaſſador, Lord Auck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, had charged him to declare that they would willingly treat with General Dumourier.</p>
                     <p>At the ſame time, Benoit, who had been agent of the French miniſtry at London, and had juſt arrived from that place, informed Le Brun on the part of Talleyrand, late Biſhop of Autun, De Talon, and other French emigrants, who had po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical connections with the Britiſh miniſtry, that Pitt and the council of St. James's had nothing more at heart than to treat for the preſervation of the neutrality, provided that General Dumourier ſhould be charged with the negociation, and ſhould proceed to England for the purpose of ſettling its terms, which he might eaſily accompliſh before the opening of the campaign.</p>
                     <p>This overture of the Engliſh miniſtry was, at firſt, communicated to no other perſon of the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive council than Garat and Le Brun. Garat, who was poſſeſſed of a found judgment, zealouſly embraced the offer, and proposed to ſend the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral as ambaſſador extraordinary <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o England, without, however ſuperſeding Chauvelin, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions to demand a deciſive anſwer reſpecting war or peace. The king's trial was not yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, but the cruel cataſtrophe was ſufficiently foreſeen; this circumſtance ſuggeſted new conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations to Garat, who feared that the Engliſh court might be treacherous enough to detain Dumou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier in England, and thereby deprive France of
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:026918_0119_0FD2609BA98EDAE0"/>
her beſt general. Dumourier was compelled to diſſemble that he alſo ſaw the probability of that event, and that it was the only thing he deſired. In order that he might eſcape from the hands of the miſereants who governed his country, he appeared to ſubſcribe to the prudence of Garat's precaution. It was however, determined that the affair ſhould be laid before the council, and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition be made by Garat to ſend General Dumou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier as Ambaſſador extraordinary to London, in conſequence of the overtures made by the miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of England and Holland; to give the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral inſtructions to conduct the negociation with ſuitable dignity and promptitude, and whatever might be the iſſue, to return inſtantly to put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at the head of the armies. It was reſolved to demand from the Engliſh miniſtry every poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſecurity for the perſon of General Dumourier, and for the full liberty of returning at his pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>When the propoſition was laid before the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, Clavier<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, Pache and Monge oppoſed it in the moſt decided manner, undoubtedly incited by jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy and love of oppoſition, for they well knew the diſtreſs of their reſpective departments and their incapability of ſupporting a war that would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo general.</p>
                     <p>Dumourier was extremely afflicted with the fate of a meaſure which ſeemed to have promiſed his deliverance, as well as an important occaſion of ſerving his country; but he was not diſcouraged. He was of the opinion of Garat and Le Brun that the deſign ſhould not be diſcuſſed any more in the council, but proſecuted ſecretly till it ſhould be in a ſtate to inſure ſucceſs. It was agreed that de Maulde ſhould depart inſtantly for the Hague, under the pretence of his private concerns; that Noel ſhould be recalled and placed elſewhere; that the General ſhould charge de Maulde with a letter for Lord Auckland, informing him that the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:026918_0120_0FD260D99B693640"/>
would he at Antwerp on the 1ſt of February to viſit his troops in their winter quarters, and that having learnt from de Maulde, his friend, that Lord Auckland had ſpoken of him with eſteem and confidence, it would be a circumſtance of great pleaſure to him if an opportunity ſhould offer of meeting that nobleman on the frontiers, and that perhaps this interview might be beneficial to the intereſts of the two nations, and the cauſe of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity. It was alſo determined that, ſhould Lord Auckland receive this invitation with the good will that was to be expected, the General ſhould give him a meeting, and might even if it was found neceſſary paſs into England.</p>
                     <p>It was further decided, that Maret, who had already been ſeveral times in England, ſhould be ſent to London, to learn from Mr. Pitt, if he really deſired to treat perſonally with General Dumou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier. Chauvelin, miniſter plenipotentiary of France to the court of London, did not at all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord with Talleyrand, who had been ſent with him as an advertiſer in his negociation, and had not at all ſucceeded in the object of his embaſſy, which he was ambitious of conducting without the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of his colleague. Many indeed were the obſtacles Chauvelin had to encounter; he had againſt him the prejudices of the Engliſh nation; the king of England, the moſt— — <note place="bottom">Deſpotique</note>. in Europe, and the moſt enraged againſt the French Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the French emigrants; the perſons who had been given him as advertiſers and aſſiſtants; the National Convention of France; and his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experience. It was thought neceſſary if Dumou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier's journey ſhould take place to ſacrifice Chau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velin, or rather to give him ſome other embaſſy; for Dumourior, who had been the intimate friend of his father, and had given him the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:026918_0121_0FD2609D2F8DCC30"/>
to England, inſiſted that he ſhould be ſent to Venice or Florence, that he might continue his diplomatic career with ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>It appears to be but juſt to ſay a word here of the diſpoſition that Dumourier has always diſplayed in his public character.</p>
                     <p>Whether it were the effect of good nature, or of a ſenſe of juſtice, he has been anxious not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice the intereſts of any other perſon in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic employment, and has obliged and ſerved great numbers; and of courſe it is not greatly ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, that he has met with much ingratitude.</p>
                     <p>Chauvelin, as it has been ſaid, was to be recalled, and Maret was to be appointed to his ſituation, on the general's departure from London; ſo that Maret was extremely intereſted in the ſucceſs of the negociation, and had ſtrong motives for ſmoothing the difficulties that might be in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral's way, and thereby to render his ſtay at the court of London as ſhort as poſſible.</p>

cataſtrophe would yield to the great object of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving peace, and they were not deceived.</p>
                     <p>Maret's departure was unwiſely poſtponed, (tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place only on the ſame day that General Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourier left Paris) under pretence of firſt ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mr. Pitt reſpecting the General's journey to England, by the means of one of his friends, who had already been employed in the ſame capacity on a former occaſion by Maret. But the General had reaſon to believe that Le Brun, offended that the Court of St. James's would neither treat with him as miniſter of foreign affairs, nor with the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was not ſorry to undermine this negociation by giving ſcope to the raſh ignorance of Briſſot, and the folly of the diplomatic committee, who ſeeming to think that France had not enemies enough to contend with, ſtudied to increaſe the number, by inſulting every nation.</p>
                     <p>Maret's miſſion was altogether unſucceſsful. Chauvelin had never been acknowledged in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land as miniſter of the Republic, the Court of St. James having conſidered his miſſion at an end on the abolition of Royalty in France, and having permitted his ſtay in London merely as an indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence granted to an individual. And when the news of the cruel death of Louis XVI. arrived in England, Chauvelin was ordered to quit London in four and twenty hours, and the kingdom in eight days. It was under theſe circumſtances that Maret arrived in England, and received an order from the council inſtantly to quit the kingdom.</p>
                     <p>But this reception of Maret by the Court of St. James's, did not put a ſtop to the negociation in Holland. General Dumourier departed from Paris, on the 26th of January, with a mind filled with apprehenſions; he had not been able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the commiſſion of an unprovoked, fruitleſs, diſgraceful, and fatal crime; he had not ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in procuring a revocation of the decree of the
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:026918_0123_0FD2609EB0379CD8"/>
15th December, nor in obtaining an exception in behalf of Belgium, and thereby to preſerve the French army in caſe of retreat; nor in eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an effective adminiſtration for the ſupply of arms, ſubſiſtence, &amp;c. for the army; nor in his attempts to procure the neceſſary repairs of the fortified places, reinforcements of the armies, horſes for the cavalry, or any of that multitude of objects, the ſupply of which was neceſſary to the opening of the campaign; nor (which in every caſe was the greateſt of his afflictions) to ſave an innocent king, whoſe goodneſs was perſonally known to him. He was about to reſume the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of a diſorganiſed army, abandoning itſelf to robberies, and every ſpecies of exceſs, ill arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in want of cloathing, and diſperſed in the impoveriſhed villages along the Meuſe, and the Roer. New troops were daily arriving from Germany to augment the army of General Clair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fait, who with great capacity had made a ſtand, and maintained himſelf between the Herffle and the Roer with a comparatively ſmall number of troops, in want of every thing, and terrified at the rapacity with which the conqueſt of Belgium had been accompliſhed: That general having counteracted all the ill effects of their long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat.</p>
                     <p>The Prince of Cobourg, celebrated for his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious campaign againſt the Turks, was about to take the command of this army. In the caſe of Dumourier waiting till the Prince of Cobourg ſhould attack him, he was well aſſured that he could not reſiſt that General in front, and, at the ſame time, the Prince of Hohenloe, who would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack him on his right flank by Namur, the citadel of which was then repairing very ſlowly by the French; and if the Engliſh and Dutch ſhould have time to aſſemble an army on his left flank, on the ſide of Antwerp and Dutch Flanders, even the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:026918_0124_0FD260DC7217C2D0"/>
of Dumourier would no longer be ſecure, having to march through fifty leagues of ſlat coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, with a diſorderly army, purſued and almoſt ſurrounded by three armies more conſiderable than his own and continually aſſailed by the Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants and the inhabitants or the cities, whom, the exceſſes committed by order of the Convention, had driven to deſperation. Deneral Dumourier, therefore had no other hope of diminiſhing his perplexities, but the negociation committed to the care of de Maulde. In truth, his confidence in that was conſiderable, ſince Holland had the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt dread of a rupture with France, being quite unprepared for it, and having the greateſt intereſt in the preſervation of the neutrality.</p>
                     <p>We are about to give an account of the further circumſtances of this negociation, which was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off in the beginning of February, by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe and haughty impetuoſity of the National Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention. The abrupt declaration of war, made by that Aſſembly againſt England and Holland, gave France an air of perſidy, reſpecting that negocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with which the Engliſh have reproached them with ſome appearance of reaſon; but the ſame charge may be retorted on the Engliſh, and it is probable that Pitt had no other deſign than to amuſe General Dumourier, to gain time to make the neceſſary preparatives for war; and the treaty entered into by the Court of St. James's with the court of Turin, at that very period, confums the opinion. So much truth is there in the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that hiſtory is but a picture of the errors and crimes of government.</p>

                     <p>Lord Auckland diſpatched three packet boats, immediately ſucceeding each other, to his court, and dc Maulde ſent his ſecretary to Antwerp, where the General had arrived on the 2d of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary, after having viſited the poſts from Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirk to Antwerp.</p>
                     <p>Throughout Picardy, Artois, and maritime Flanders, Dumourier found the people overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with terror and grief, at the tragical death of Louis XVI. The very name of Jacobin, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, excited equal fear and horror. In all the cities, however, there were numerous emiſſaries of the Jacobins, who ſtirred up the populace againſt the moderate and wiſe part of the citizens, and collected accuſations, little regarding whether true or falſe, againſt the different adminiſtrators of the departments.</p>
                     <p>At St. Omers and Dunkirk, there was not the leaſt appearance of preparations being made for the

war, and there were ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

                        </gap>ely any troops to be ſeen, for the miniſter of war had weakened maritime Flanders to furniſh the augmentation of 10,000 foot and 1500 cavalry, for the army in Auſtrian Flanders, in conſequence of the General's having demanded that reinforcement. The miniſter of war even drew new battalions afterwards from this country, which was part of the actual feat of the war, to form a body of 12,000 men near Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg, from whence the General had obſerved a diverſion might be made into England, in caſe war with that power could not be avoided.</p>
                     <p>Nieuport and Oſtend, were in the ſame condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as St. Omers and Dunkirk, not having a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle battery mounted, to prevent any veſſels of war entering thoſe ports. There were not even can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non for the purpoſe; nor could any be obtained, without taking them from Dunkirk, which had not ſufficient for its own fortifications.</p>
                     <p>Dumourier ſtruck with the diſorder that perva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the whole country, and ſeeing that his embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſments every moment increaſed, was greatly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with the firſt ſucceſs of de Maulde's nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation. He inſtantly diſpatched a courier to Le Brun, with the original anſwer of Lord Auckland, which ſtated that the Britiſh miniſter and the grand Penſionary of Holland, had agreed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed together to the frontiers to confer with the General; that Lord Auckland had ſent ſeveral dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches to his court, to obtain its ſanction, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions relative to the conference; that he ſhould ſoon receive an anſwer, and that his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were not to gain time, nor to retard the General's preparations for the campaign.</p>
                     <p>The diſpatches of de Maulde, which accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied thoſe of Lord Auckland, gave an account of the circumſtances of his interview with the Britiſh miniſter, and the grand Penſionary of Holland. Thoſe miniſters, as de Maulde was prepared to
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:026918_0127_0FD260A1D85BCB48"/>
find, expreſſed the utter abhorrence of the atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious barbarity recently committed at Paris; but as de Maulde gave them poſitive aſſurances that the General partook of their ſentiments on that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and was filled with the profoundeſt indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt the authors of the crime, that horrible affair did not retard the negociation; and it was ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled without any difficulty, that as ſoon as Lord Auckland ſhould have received the inſtructions of his court, the conference ſhould take place at the Moor Dyke, on board a yatch belonging to the Prince of Orange, which would be prepared to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the General. De Maulde concluded by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring his perſuaſion, that the conference would be attended with the greateſt ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>The General entertained the ſame hopes, and had preſcribed to himſelf the plan he thought it his duty to follow. He reſolved not to betray the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of his unhappy country; on the contrary, it was his intention to diminiſh the number of her enemies, in ſettling the neutrality of England and Holland on a ſure baſis; but, after he ſhould have rendered this laſt of his ſervices to France, he reſolved to free himſelf from the imputation of partaking in the crime of his countrymen, and no longer to fight for abſurd tyrants whom he was anxious to puniſh, inſtead of aiding in the ſupport of their hideous tyranny. He did not deſign therefore to return to Antwerp but to retire to the Hague, and from thence to publiſh a memorial in juſtification of his conduct.</p>
                     <p>He unfolded a part of theſe deſigns in a letter to de Maulde, which was communicated to the two miniſters. They requeſted leave to take a copy of it, but de Maulde declined granting that permiſſion, being unauthoriſed by his friend; but at the ſame time he delivered Lord Auckland a letter from the General, informing that miniſter that he ſhould
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:026918_0128_0FD260DF63EF0538"/>
receive with great pleaſure news of the ſanction of the Britiſh court to theſe meaſures.</p>
                     <p>At the moment when the negociation was in this promiſing ſtate, while the General conſoled himſelf with the hope of being freed from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable yoke of combating for tyrants, under the certainty of becoming one day the victim of their ingratitude and cruelty, whatever might be his ſucceſs; while he thus flattered himſelf, on the 7th of February he learnt by the public papers that the National Convention had declared war againſt Holland and England, on a report made by Briſſot in the name of the diplomatic commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee This news reduced him to deſpair, for it was altogether unexpected. He had quitted Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris on the 26th of January; had arrived at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twerp, only on the 2d of February; Le Brun, then, had not waited to receive his firſt diſpatches, nor intelligence reſpecting de Maulde's negocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It ſeems that Le Brun had precipitated the report of the affront offered to the Republic in the perſon of Chauvelin, by order of the king of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, to excite the anger of the thoughtleſs Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, and thereby raiſe an inſurmountable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle to the meaſures he had concerted with the General.</p>
                     <p>As to Briſſot, he had, as was uſual with him availed himſelf of this opportunity of inſulting both kings and people, in which he was zealouſly ſeconded by Barrere and the Jacobins. Thus the two factions united in taking a moſt diſaſtrous ſtep without diſcuſſion and without conſideration.</p>
                     <p>The war was declared, but Le Brun ſent no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence to General Dumourier, on whom the burthen fell with the greateſt weight, and little en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry was made in the council, whether he was at all in a condition to ſupport himſelf againſt theſe new enemies.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="131" facs="unknown:026918_0129_0FD260A326F54C10"/>
On the day that General Dumourier, heard of the declaration of war againſt England and Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, de Maulde arrived at Antwerp from the Hague, with a ſecond letter from Lord Auckland, congratulating him on having received an autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from his court to enter on the conference, which was fixed to commence on the 10th, at the Moor Dyke. The General inſtantly diſpatched a courier informing Lord Auckland of the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of war; and obſerving, that although he muſt admit the declaration of war to have been a little abrupt, he muſt obſerve it had been occaſioned by the conduct of the Engliſh Miniſtry; firſt, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining two French veſſels laden with corn, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the remonſtrances of the French miniſtry to the contrary; ſecondly, in contemptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ordering the French Ambaſſador to quit the kingdom, while a negociation was pending be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two nations; and thirdly, in cauſing Lord Auckland to publiſh, on the 2d of February, an addreſs to the States General, which was an inſult to the French nation, and equivalent to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of war.</p>
                     <p>The General had alſo cauſes of complaint againſt the Grand Penſionary Van Spiegle. He had in vain demanded of him the liberation of Colonel Micoud, a French officer, who, after gaining a conſiderable law-ſuit againſt a merchant in Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, had been thrown into priſon, through the credit of the merchant, on a vague accuſation of having ſpoken too freely of the government. He had driven a troop of French comedians from Amſterdam without even granting them time to collect the ſums due to them; he had permitted Noel the French miniſter at the Hague, and Thainville, his ſecretary, to be inſulted by the emigrants, and had afterwards abruptly ordered them to quit the country; he had allowed the emigrants to appear in military uniforms at the
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:026918_0130_0FD260E0DF9B00E0"/>
Hague; and finally had ſuffered the greateſt enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be expreſſed againſt France with impunity.</p>
                     <p>It is certain that the conduct of the courts of St. James's and the Hague was inexcuſable, ſince in the midſt of a negociation entered into (in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of overtures from themſelves) with Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Dumourier, whom they had demanded to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct the negociation, they had provoked the anger of the National Convention, whom they knew to be haughty and impatient, and incapable of a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate conduct. It is but juſt therefore to reproach them as well as the French with the evils reſulting from this war, which is to be conſidered as only in its beginning, and which will be the ſource of other equally deſtructive wars.</p>
                     <p>It may be ſaid, that providence has united all the people of Europe to inflict a puniſhment on the enormous crimes committed by the French nation; and perhaps to puniſh their own errors by the calamities they will have to endure in this long, afflicting and bloody conteſt. The Atheiſts of the National Convention, and these are the moſt ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and wicked of the members, becauſe it is not through the influence of philoſophy that they have become Atheiſts, but through the influence of their crimes, have conſidered what the General has ſaid to them reſpecting Providence in his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the 12th of March, as an unmeaning rhapſody; to ſuch men he has to anſwer, that Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence leaves us free to make a virtuous or vicious choice, but that from the firſt choice neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults the character of our actions, good or bad; that which is juſt is alone true; that which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt is the effect of error in the mind; that this is above all true with reſpect to governments; and that juſtice conducts nations to happineſs, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice to miſery: that when a nation is univerſally infected with a licentious ſpirit, as is the caſe with France, all her motives and actions tend to her
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:026918_0131_0FD260A9A1312970"/>
ruin; hence the ſame phrenzy which induced France to commit the fruitleſs crime of murdering Louis XVI. and of treating his family as a herd of ſlaves, dictated the decree of the 15th of Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, which is equally devoid of juſtice and policy, which has loſt the nation the good-will of every people who were attached to her, has infuſed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions into her councils, familiariſed her with ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations, robberies, and maſſacres, has begotten her filthineſs and groſſneſs of manners; her wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs in creating of enemies, and indifference to the means of reſiſting them; and in fine her anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy and total want of order, which has already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon her the firſt puniſhments of that long ſeries that awaits her. For from the moment that France became a Republic, ſhe degenerated into the moſt unfortunate country that the annals of the world have produced.</p>
                     <p>We will conclude this book with a melancholy reflection on the condition to which France has reduced herſelf by her errors; ſhe had been preſented with a conſtitution formed in a ſhort and difficult period by her firſt legiſlature, which was not indeed perfect but highly valuable, and which every people of Europe admired and envied. The two factions that exiſted in France, in combating each other, nevertheleſs were of one mind to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy this conſtitution. The court hoped to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover its former power and numerous means of gratifications; and the Jacobins entirely to beat down royalty, which they hated, but which was ſo neceſſary to the happineſs of Frenchmen; and while the conſtitution was a theme of praiſe with all reaſonable men in other parts of Europe, the French blamed, ſpurned and rejected it. But the merits of the conſtitution were unknown to the people of France, for they never permitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to judge of it but through the medium of their furious paſſions.</p>

                     <head type="sub">Plan of the Campaign.</head>
                     <p>WE are now entering upon the hiſtory of a campaign more rapid, more varied, and perhaps more important, in its events, than any of former or later times. The nature of the campaign was not foreſeen till the firſt week of February; the plan was conceived and arranged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the 7th and the 22d of that month; and the cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign finiſhed on the 5th of the following April.</p>
                     <p>The hiſtory of this ſhort period, offers, to the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of the military man, Cities taken in defiance of of immenſe innundations, a great battle, a variety of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, and a retreat which excited the aſtoniſhment of the generals of the enemy, aad from which they could not withhold their praiſe: It exhibits an example of the two ſpecies of war, the offenſive, and defenſive: And it may be ſaid to have involved conſequences that will decide the fate of France, and perhaps that of Europe.</p>
                     <p>Nor is this hiſtory leſs intereſting to the philoſopher, whom it will confirm in the opinion, that the deſtiny of empires is often dependent on circumſtances that are apparently inconſiderable; and that the character and fortune of one man may decide the fate of a nation. In the preceding year, General Dumourier had preſerved
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:026918_0136_0FD260E85706CE50"/>
the independence of France, by his ſucceſs in the plains of Champagne, and rendered her name illuſtrious in thoſe of Belgium: for, at that period, the greatneſs of the danger which threatened France united all minds under his ſtandard, and compelled the nation to diſplay her energy under the direction of his counſels. In the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod we are now conſidering, the ſituation and character of the French people were changed. The nation or rather thoſe who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>overned and miſled the nation, intox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icated with ſucceſs, and blinded by their crimes, no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger liſtened to the general, who would now have ſaved his countrymen, both from a foreign yoke, and from the tyranny of their own miſtaken paſſions.</p>
                     <p>He was not ſeconded in his efforts. He was not obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. He was oppoſed, and betrayed; and his cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign was unfortunate, notwithſtanding his exertions to turn the fortune of war in his favour. On the point of conquering Holland, the conqueſt was ſnatched from his hands. He formed a ſecond plan, and victory was torn from him by his own troops. In the midſt of a retreat, that was as ſucceſsfully conducted as it was bloody and deſtructive, he projected another deſign, which preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his army, and arreſted the ruin of Belgium, which, otherwiſe, would have been complete. But this deſign fell ſhort of its greateſt object, the deliverance of France: and, in that, it was defeated by the fierce pride of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, and by the fickleneſs of his troops; and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Dumourier was compelled to quit his army, and to ſeek a retreat among ſtrangers, who could not forbear to eſteem him.</p>
                     <p>Thenceforth, the French were no longer the ſame people. In the ſoldiery, ſavage rage ſucceeded valour; there was neither talent in the plan of the war, nor conduct in its execution; the French ſlew and were ſlain, without remorſe, or conſideration. It was not war that they carried on; and the carnage would already have been terminated, if the force that oppoſed them were that of a ſingle people, or were not rendered inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual by the claſhing of various intereſts and counſels.</p>
                     <p>The ſituation of General Dumourier was embarraſſing, when he knew that England and Holland were on the point of adding their forces to thoſe of the other enemies of France. If the perſons who were at the head of affairs, had been well informed and prudent men, he direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly would have adviſed them to evacuate the Netherlands
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:026918_0137_0FD260B13098CFA8"/>
which could no longer be preſerved; and to poſt the troops behind the fortified places of the north, holding for a while the banks of the Scheld, and the citadel of Namur. But this reaſonable propoſition would have been regarded as proceeding from cowardice or treachery; and would have brought the general to the ſcaffold. Or, if it had been accepted, it would have delivered the General into the hands of tyrants whom it was his object to cruſh for the ſafety and happineſs of his country. Entering France with an enemy in purſuit of him, and with the appearance of a ſlight, he would have inſtantly loſt his military reputation, which was only to be preſerved by ſingle ſucceſſes; and his fate would have been at the diſpoſal of the Jacobins of Paris, whom this retreat would have reinforced with the whole amount of his army. He could not therefore extricate himſelf from this deſperate ſituation, but by the hardieſt and moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſive means. His military fame and the celerity of his movements, could alone open him the way to the ſupply of all that was wanting to his army. Clothing, accou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trements, horſes, arms, proviſions, money, all were to be found in Holland; and there, he was compelled to ſeek them. He conceived the deſign of conquering Holland by a daring blow; and we will now rapidly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view his plan, and his reſources.</p>
                     <p>The Dutch refugees had formed a ſmall revolutionary committee at Antwerp, where was alſo the Dutch legion. The committee poſſeſſed more zeal than ability; and, although they expended conſiderable ſums of money in maintaining a ſecret correſpondence with the different Provinces of the Dutch Republic, the information which the general received through their means was extremely deficient, eſpecially reſpecting the military ſtate of that country. All that could be relied on with certainty was, that the party of the patriots was very conſiderable: particularly at Amſterdam, Haerlem, Do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t, and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Zealand. The general pretended to reaſſume the conſideration of the plan, which the committee had laid before him at Paris, of making an irruption into Zealand. He affected to examine it minutely in preſence of the committee, and feigned to give it his approbation; in order to cover a plan more bold in appearance, but in truth more certain of ſucceſs, becauſe it appeared to be more impracticable. He did not diſcloſe that deſign to any other perſons than to Mr. Koch and Mr. De Niſs,
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:026918_0138_0FD260EA38677FB8"/>
whom he thought deſerving of his entire confidence; and whoſe zeal, probity, ſtrength of mind, and love of their country, entitled them to be the deliverers of their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low citizens.</p>
                     <p>The plan for the invaſion of Zealand, was as follows: The refugees had learnt that the Stadtholder had formed the deſign of fortifying the Iſland of Walcheren, as a place of retreat for the States General and the members of the government, in caſe the French ſhould enter the country, and ſhould be joined by the people, whom the government miſtruſted. The Dutch Committee propoſed that a coſiderable body of men ſhould depart from Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp, and proceed, with as great ſecrecy and diſpatch as poſſible, by Sand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>liet to the iſland of South Beveland, and from thence to the iſland of Walcheren, and, ſeizing upon Middleburg and Fluſhing, ſhould make themſelves maſters of that latter iſland. The garriſons of thoſe two towns, it is true, did not amount to more than twelve or fifteen hundred men, and were raw and undiſciplined troops. But if the inhabitants had not joined their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verers, the French ſoldiers would infallibly have been cut off. There was nothing to prevent the iſland receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuccours to double the amount of the French detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; there were already ſeveral Engliſh frigates at Fluſhing; and the Dutch had a ſquadron of armed veſſels in the Scheld, lying under the fortreſs of Batz, a league below Lillo, which would entirely have cut off the retreat of the detachment to the main land.</p>
                     <p>No ſucceſs could be expected in this expedition, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch promptitude and exactneſs in the execution, as the general could not expect either from his own troops, or thoſe of the Dutch patriots. He had not a ſingle general officer under his command to whom he could confide ſo dangerous an enterprize. He could not aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the command of the main army, to undertake the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition himſelf. Had he yielded to the opinion of the Dutch patriots, he would certainly have been led into an unſucceſsful enterprize; and this unfortunate check in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But if, by the chance that belongs to military move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, this expedition had been ſucceſsful, however bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:026918_0139_0FD260B235C83428"/>
it might have been, it would have produced no real benefit to the general. On the contrary, it would have deprived him of five or ſix thouſand of his troops, who, would have been ſeparated from him by an arm of the ſea, and all the places of Dutch Flanders: leaving him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a force ſufficient to undertake any thing further.</p>
                     <p>The better to conceal his real deſigns, however, he profeſſed to adopt that plan of attacking Holland, and he made ſome dipoſitions as if he was about to undertake it ſeriouſly. He had, at Antwerp, ſome ſmall veſſels under the command of Captain Moultſon, an American officer in the French ſervice, who had aſſiſted in the tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the citadel of Antwerp. This ſmall ſquadron conſiſted of the Ariel of 24 guns, a brig of 14 guns, and three gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boats. He ordered theſe veſſels to be fitted out, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to fort Lillo, and there to caſt anchor. He directed a furnace to be conſtructed on each of the gun-boats, for the purpoſe of heating balls. He commanded the ſort of Lillo, and that of Liefkenſhoeck, and the citadel of Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp, to be furniſhed with proviſions, and put in a ſtate to ſuſtain a ſiege. He aſſembled, at Antwerp, all the Dutch veſſels that on the declaration of war had been detained in the canals of the Scheldt, and ordered them to be prepared to ſerve as fire-ſhips.</p>
                     <p>He wiſhed it to be believed that his object was to burn the Dutch veſſels lying at anchor under the fort of Batz; and to ſeize upon that fort, which mounted forty guns. The Dutch veſſels retired to Ramekens. In ſhort, every thing ſeemed to indicate, during ſeveral days, that the general's movements were directed againſt Zealand; and he gave the enemy reaſon to imagine that the campaign would open by the invaſion of that country. Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while, the general's thoughts were wholly occupied with his own plan; which was extremely ſimple, although, had it never been attempted it muſt have appeared wholly impracticable. This plan was, to make his way with a body of troops to the Moordyke, deceiving and evading the garriſons of Breda, and Gertruydenburg, on his right; Bergen-up-Zoom, Steenburg, Klundert, and Williamſtadt, on his left: and, paſſing the arm of the ſea which runs between the Moor-dyke and Dort, and which is about two leagues in breadth, to land at Dort: where being arrived he ſhould be in the heart of Holland, and would have no obſtacles to encounter in marching by
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:026918_0140_0FD260EBF930DA98"/>
Rotterdam, Delft, the Hague, Leyden and Haerlem, to Amſterdam. By this plan, he would take all the ſtrong places of Holland in the rear. Meanwhile, General Miranda, with a detachment of the grand army, was to bombard Maeſtricht, and Venloo; and, as ſoon as he ſhould know that General Dumourier had reached Dort, he was to leave General Valence to continue the ſiege of Maeſtricht, and to march with 25,000 men againſt Nimeguen, where General Dumourier was to join him by the route of Utrecht.</p>
                     <p>This plan, executed with rapidity, would have had little ſerious dfficulty to encouter, ſince the Stadtholder neither had an army aſſembled, nor had adopted any ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled plan of defence; and ſince, of all the enterprizes that might be undertaken by Dumourier, this was the leaſt to be expected: for it ſeemed to be no better than an attempt to march an army <hi>through the eye of a needle</hi> 
                        <note place="bottom">Theſe are the words of Dumourier</note>.</p>
                     <p>Dmourier's next deſign was, as ſoon as he ſhould be maſter of Holland, to ſend the battalions of national guards back into Belgium; to aſſemble an army entirely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of troops of the line, and commanded by generals of whoſe fidelity he was aſſured, and to compel the States General of the United Provinces, to order a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render of all their towns: to make no changes in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but ſuch as ſhould be indiſpenſibly neceſſary; to diſſolve the Dutch Revolutionary Committee, to the members of which he had already ſignified that in caſe of ſucceſs, they might be ſeverally appointed to the public ſituations of their reſpective Provinces, ſuppoſing them to poſſeſs the confidence of their fellow citizens; to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Dutch Republic from the tyranny of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners of the national convention, and from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of Jacobiniſm; to fit out a fleet with all poſſible expedition at Rotterdam, in Zealand, and in the Texel, in order to ſeize upon the Dutch ſettlements in India, and to ſecure the poſſeſſion of them by ſtrong garriſons; to offer a perfect neutrality to the Engliſh; to ſtation, in the conntry of Zutphen and Dutch Guelders, an army of obſervation conſiſting of 30,000 men; to furniſh money and arms for the raiſing a body of 30,000 men, in the countries of Antwerp, the two Flanders, and Campine, on whoſe attachment he could rely; to permit the French

Dumou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier further deſigned to offer a ſuſpenſion of arms to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts; and in caſe of its being rejected, to raiſe an army of 150,000 men in order to drive them beyond the Rhine; but if it were accepted he hoped to gain time and means to execute the reſt of his plan, which was, either to form a Republic of the eighteen Provinces of the Netherlands, if that ſhould be agreeable to the people, or to make an offenſive and defenſive alliance between the Republic of the Seven United Provinces and that of Belgium, and to raiſe an army of 80,000 men in the two countries for their joint defence, till the concluſion of the war; to invite France to enter into an alliance with the two Republics, and to put an end to her anarchy by re-adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the conſtitution of 1789; and in caſe of France refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to accede to this propoſal, to march to Paris with an army compoſed of the French troops of the line, and a body of 40,000 Dutch and Belgians, in order to diſſolve the National Convention, and annihilate the power of the Jacobins.</p>
                     <p>Such were the outlines of General Dumourier's plan, which was communicated only to four perſons. It will appear viſionary to the reader; but being founded on the circumſtances of the times, and on well combined calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, it could not have failed of ſucceſs, if the moſt diſaſtrous events, entirely unconnected with the conduct and arrangements of General Dumourier, had not broken all his meaſures, and forced him to ſacrifice all his hopes to the immediate ſafety of the grand army, on the point of being entirely deſtroyed, by the miſmanagement of the officers who commanded under him.</p>

                     <p>GENERAL DUMOURIER, having taken his reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, may be ſtill ſaid to have had all his means to create. At Antwerp, there were two battalions of national gendarmerie, conſiſting of 350 men each, who were dangerous only to their officers and the peaceable inhabitants of the city, being the moſt deteſtable and undiſciplined ſoldiers that ever entered the field of battle. Theſe ferocious Janiſſaries received each 40 ſols per day in ſpecie without deduction; appointed their own officers; and comitted every kind of crime. The general, after paſſing them in review, declared in the ſtrongeſt terms, that, ſhould they continue to commit the exceſſes of which they were accuſed, or to be guilty of any diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of orders, he would inſtantly ſend them back to France. This body of gendarmerie was compoſed of the ancient French guards. There were alſo, at Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp, one hundred and fifty dragoons of the 20th regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; three battalions of national guards; and about two thouſand of the Dutch legion, two hundred of which were horſe. Twelve battalions of national guards, newly raiſed, and having neither fuſees, accoutrements, nor ſhoes, were quartered in the cities and villages of Weſt Flanders; and had no idea that they ſhould be obliged to take the field till the month of May.</p>
                     <p>Cannon, mortars, magazines, money, commiſſaries, together with their aſſiſtants, were altogether wanting. But there was not a moment to be loſt. The raſhneſs of the national convention, in declaring war againſt Holland, had warned the Dutch to prepare for their defence; and, unleſs the general had attacked them with the utmoſt celerity, the enterprize would have become uterly chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical. And, indeed, had the Dutch prepared for their defence with as great activity as the general <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He joined Dumourier at the camp of Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre; and had been of great ſervice to him, in the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent attacks of the Pruſſians, particularly in the retreat of the 15th of September. But he had a haughtineſs of diſpoſition, and a bluntneſs of manner, which begat him many enemies; and he was unfit to command the French, whoſe confidence it is impoſſible to gain but by good humour and a conduct expreſſive of reſpect for them.</p>
                     <p>Dumourier had procured him the appointment of lieutenant-general, in the month of November 1792; had conferred upon him the command of the army of the North, and had promiſed to obtain him the rank of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, on the firſt opportunity. Miranda was afterward offended that Valence, an older lieutenant-general than himſelf, (having commanded with great reputation gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Kellermann's advanced guard, and ſeveral detached corps, during the campaign of 1792) ſhould have been raiſed to the rank of general on the recommendation of Dumourier. He never forgave this preference; but his reſentment, unfortunately for France, did not diſplay itſelf till the day of the battle of Nerwinde. At the time we now ſpeak of, he ſtill appeared full of attachment to Dumourier. And that general had written to him from Paris to make preparations for the opening of the cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign, very early in the ſpring, by the ſiege of Maeſtricht, in caſe a rupture ſhould prove to be unavoidable with England and Holland.</p>
                     <p>Dumourier's own army was then under the command of general Lanoue, who was a very brave and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

General Dumourier thought it prudent not to point out the poſition that might be proper for this army of obſervation; and he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges that, in this, he committed a great error.</p>
                     <p>In the remaining part of General Dumourier's inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to Miranda, he confidentially unfolded his plan for attacking Holland. He deſired him not to open the ſiege regularly before Maeſtricht, being too early in the ſeaſon for ſuch an undertaking, but to endeavour to carry the place by a vigorous aſſault with bombs and red hot balls, in the ſame manner as the Duke of Saxe-Teſchen had attempted to carry Liſle; and, when General Dumourier ſhould have informed him that he had reached Dort by the Moor Dyke, to leave General Valence before Maeſtricht, and to proceed by forced marches to Nime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guen, paſſing by the frontier of the Dutchy of Cleves, in order to intercept the Pruſſians, if they ſhould attempt to reach Hollands before him: and to this latter purpoſe, Dumourier deſired him to ſend General Champmorin (a moſt able engineer) againſt Venloo, while Miranda ſhould beſiege Maeſtricht, and by that means to make himſelf maſter of the lower part of the Meuſe as far as Genep.</p>
                     <p>General Dumourier confined the number of men that Miranda ſhould employ in this expedition to 25,000 or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>0,000, at the utmoſt, that he might not too much weaken the poſts on the Meuſe, He recommended the greateſt diſpatch in the preparations, ſo that Maeſtricht might be inveſted by the 12th or 15th of that month; and he appointed lieutenant-general Bouchet, an experienced engineer, to aſſiſt Miranda in the ſiege.</p>
                     <p>Dumourier wrote nearly in the ſame terms to Lanoue and Thouvenot; enjoining them to inform the troops, that he ſhould review them, after having viſited the
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:026918_0145_0FD260BB367D3030"/>
quarters on the lower Meuſe. He wrote to lieutenant-general Moreton, who commanded in Bruſſels, that he was ſetting off immediately for that city. And to General d'Harville, ordering him to aſſemble his troops at Namur on the 20th of February, as he deſigned to review his diviſion on the 22d of that month. Thus, in miſleading ſuch of his generals as were not to be employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the expedition he effectually deceived the enemy, who were utterly at a loſs to conjecture in what point he would begin the campaign.</p>

Dumourier had been uſed to call him his Ajax and his ſon. In truth he had commenced his career with great ſpirit, and had evinced a ſincere attachment to the general. Dumourier now informed him merely, that it was his deſign to attack Holland, without entering into any detail of his plan, leſt he ſhould be betrayed by the indiſcretion or the diſhoneſty of the clerks of the war office.</p>
                     <p>Pache, a little while before his quitting the miniſtry, had ordered the demolition of the ſmall part of the fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of Mons and Tournay which then remained. Theſe imprudent orders had diſguſted the inhabitants of thoſe two cities. General Dumourier ſuſpended the execution of the order; and, he not only deſired the new miniſter of war to revoke it, but ſtrongly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to him to repair the fortifications of thoſe two places, with the utmoſt diſpach. He alſo counſelled him to fortify with equal ſpeed the ſtrong place of the caſtle of Huy; to make ditches round Malines, which might eaſily be put in a ſtate of defence by inundations; to erect ſtrong batteries at Oſtend, Nieuport, and Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirk, in order to ſtrengthen our frontiers on that ſide, in the probable caſe of our being obliged to evacuate Belgium. General Dumourier further adviſed Burnon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville to complete the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Such were the counſels reſpecting fortifying that fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier which were given by General Dumourier, although he is a cuſed of having betrayed his country. General Dumourier faithfully ſerved his country till the moment that he quitted her; and he will again ſerve her; with the ſame zeal and fidelity, if he ſhould ever ſee her governed by a king, under the ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a conſtitution. Had his counſels been followed, the combined armies would have been detained longer on the exterior frontier, by that line of poſts and would not, have penetrated ſo eaſily into France.</p>
                     <p>General Dumourier alſo requeſted Bournonville to ſend him reinforcements of men, and to order General D'Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con to join him, with ſome able engineers, having to make a campaign that would abound in ſieges. Bournon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville acceded to all Dumourier's requeſts, as far as was in his power, with promptitude; and General D'Arcon arrived at the army immediately afterward.</p>
                     <p>This general, although one of the beſt engineers and one of the worthieſt men in France, had been accuſed of ariſtocracy by the well known Prince of Heſſe, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible Jacobin; and had been deprived of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; but General Dumourier, who had been long ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his merit, reſtored him to the ſervice of his country, and found him worthy of the truſt repoſed in him.</p>
                     <p>General de Flers commanded at Bruges. He was a brave man; but was opinionated, and did not poſſeſs much capacity. Having received a wound with a muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket ball in the camp of Maulde, Dumourier made him major-general; and afterwards ſent him to Bruges, to take upon him the command in Weſt Flanders, and had given him orders to receive the reinforcement of 10,000 men, which Pache had marched into that country on the General's requeſt.</p>
                     <p>When Dumourier arrived at Bruges, de Flers laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him a plan which he had formed for ſurpriſing the city of Sluys. The general pretended to adopt the plan; and ſent de Flers to Bournonville, with a requeſt to give de Flers a body of 5 or 6000 men and ſmall train of artillery, to enable him to menace Dutch Flanders. The request was complied with, ſpeedily and compleatly.</p>
                     <p>The general had no deſign that de Flers ſhould attack the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="153" facs="unknown:026918_0147_0FD261258C444DF8"/>
his orders, to be ready to replace, on the ſide of Antwerp and Breda, the forces that the general ſhould march into Holland. And he knew that the aſſembling this ſmall army in the neighbourhood of Bruges would ſtill aid in deceiving the Dutch reſpecting the general's deſigns, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially as de Flers was himſelf deceived, and made ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous preparations for his expedition.</p>
                     <p>General Dumourier had left all the officers of his ſtaff at Liege, together with his aids de camp, and was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by his faithful Baptiſte. He had alſo left his equipage with the grand army, to favour the opinion that he deſigned to return; and had only ordered a few horſes to attend him at Antwerp, under pretence of viſiting the cantonments on the Meuſe. To form his ſtaff therefore, he ſent for four of his officers, at the head of whom he placed Colonel Thouvenot, brother to the general of the ſame name. This officer, who, under every circumſtance, has been the zealous friend of General Dumourier, abounded in courage, information, and reſources of mind. He was in an an eminent degree important to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral during the campaign in Holland; and when they quitted the army together rendered the general every ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in his power.</p>
                     <p>The preſence of General Thouvenot was neceſſary to the grand army. He was the only officer that perfectly underſtood the details of duty in winter quarters; and was the only one that had influence enough to heal the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent quarrels that happened among the generals. It was known that he poſſeſſed the entire confidence of Dumou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier, and alſo that his merit entitled him to that confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; and although he was not the better beloved on that account, it obtained him a greater degree of reſpect; and, it being known that he was perfectly acquainted with the general's intentions, his opinion was received with the ſame deference that was paid to the general's orders.</p>
                     <p>There was no other commiſſary with the army, than Petit-Jean, to provide magazines and every thing neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the ſiege of Maeſtricht, and for the cantonments between the Meuſe and the Roer, and the different quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in Belgium. It ſeemed imprudent to take him a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from theſe multiplied concerns, before the arrival of Malus, who was ſtill detained at Paris, although a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe had been made to the general that he ſhould be ſent to the army.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="154" facs="unknown:026918_0148_0FD260F2ADBB5A08"/>
Notwithſtanding theſe reaſons, Dumourier ordered General Thouvenot and Petit-Jean to attend him at Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp; and, in two days, he ſettled with them all the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary engagements to enable his troops to take the field for the expedition.</p>
                     <p>Dumourier at the ſame time ſent to Liege for General La Fayette, and Lieutenant-Colonel La Martiniere, to form his train of artillery, which indeed was very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable. Theſe two officers ſerved him with a zeal and knowledge deſerving of the higheſt eulogiums.</p>
                     <p>On the departure of Thouvenot and Petit Jean, Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Dumourier gave them inſtructions for a new levy of twenty-five battalions of Belgians, conſiſting of, 800 men each, and he charged the generals and other officers commanding in the different provinces with the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe order, and appointed Thouvenot inſpector general and Petit Jean commiſſary general; in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a decree of the National Convention, which pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced thoſe troops on the footing of French ſoldiers. Till that period, the Belgic Provinces had made levies of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, regiments, and corps at their pleaſure. Theſe troops were filled with a diſproportionate number of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, and were paid on the credit of the Belgic military committee, the members of which were very ignorant and diſhoneſt, and were governed by General Roziere, who had formerly been an officer in the ſervice of France, and was neither a man of honour nor talents.</p>
                     <p>General Valence, on his route from Paris, paſſed thro Antwerp to take Dumourier's orders, Dumourier com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated his entire plan to Valence; and informed him that he was to cover the ſiege of Maeſtricht, with the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my under his command, till Miranda ſhould depart for Nimeguen, afterward to continue the ſiege, if the town ſhould not be then taken. He recommended to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral to viſit all the winter quarters of the army, to chooſe a proper poſition for the covering army, to watch the motions of the enemy, and to hold himſelf ready to engage them if they ſhould endeavour to relieve Mae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricht, which was reaſonably to be expected. Above all things, he recommended to him to act with promptneſs and vigour; to concert meaſures ſincerely and cordia, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> General Miranda; and to conſult General Thouvenot, whoſe knowledge could not fail to be of infinite ſervice to him. At the ſame time he ſent orders to Lanoue to obey General Valence.</p>

The expedition however was attended with prodigious incidental expences.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding the rapacity and unjuſt conduct of the French in Belgium, the whole of that nation rendered juſtice to the conduct of General Dumourier. In no city of Europe are there a greater number of wealthy inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants than at Antwerp. After the commerce of that city had fallen into decay, the inhabitants had ſubſtituted the moſt rigid oeconomy in the place of that reſource. Their expences were uſually confined within the bounds of a part of their revenues, ſo that their fortunes could not but accumulate greatly. General Dumourier aſſembled the magiſtrates and principal citizens, and opened a loan of 1,200,000 ſlorins. A merchant named Verbrouck was charged with the receipt of the money, and the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Petit-Jean with the ſuperintendance of its expendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The loan produced 200,000 florins, which in the end was an i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>eſtimable reſource. It ſerved to cloath and arm the legion of the North, the huſſars of the Republic, and ſeveral other French and Belgic corps. General Dumourier, who never had leiſure even to examine the accounts of the expenditure, and who was in Holland while it was received and expended, has been calumnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on this ground alſo. He was charged in the Jacobin Society, and afterward in the Convention, with having ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated this ſum to his own uſe. But he whoſe mind is occupied with great and intereſting concerns, is not liable to be greatly tempted by the love of wealth.</p>

That declaration, it is true, in a war of ordinary circumſtances had been very unjuſt and unwiſe, although we have been accuſtomed to ſee hoſtilities between the moſt civilized nations preceded by mutual abuſe and accuſations. But it would be a wrong
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:026918_0150_0FD260F65F106098"/>
done to General Dumourier, to impute to his moral cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, actions that were impoſed upon him by his public ſituation.—He was called upon to give encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to a very conſiderable party in the Dutch nation, who were diſpirited by former misfortunes; and to terrify the partizans of the Stadtholder.—It became him, in the ſtation he filled, to ſeparate the people of Holland from the cauſe of the Stadtholder, ſince the Dutch nation, had it been left to her to determine, would have avoided the war, dreading it as altogether contrary to her intereſts. Dumourier's declaration reſulted from theſe circumſtances; and beſide, it was neceſſary to ſcreen the general from the cenſure and reſentment of the National Convention, till he ſhould be able to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate with ſucceſs into Holland.</p>
                     <p>The preparations of which we have ſpoken were made, and the army aſſembled with every neceſſary, in ten days; and the advanced guard entered Holland, on the 17th of February. The moſt important difficulty was, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal the inconſiderable amount of this ſmall army. And, in that, the general ſucceeded ſo perfectly, that the troops themſelves were perſuaded that they were not leſs thay 30,000 ſtrong; while the Dutch imagined they had to contend with an immenſe army; in which opinion, they were confirmed by the inhabitants of Antwerp, who extremely exaggerated the number of troops, which paſſed through that city.</p>

                     <p>THE greater part of the army entered the Dutch territories on the 17th of February, and were ſtationed in cantonments, cloſely connected with each other, and extending from Bergen-op-Zoom, to within a league of Breda. The artillery was not yet ready; and the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, having various orders to give relative to his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, to the army of the Meuſe, and the affairs of Belgium, was detained at Antwerp till the 22d, when he departed with the artillery and the remainder of the troops.</p>
                     <p>The army was compoſed of twenty-one battalions, beſide the cavalry and light troops. Theſe twenty-one battalions, if complete, would have amounted to near 14,000 men; but there were not above 10,000 under arms. Of theſe, there were only two battalions that were troops of the line, the 20th regiment formerly the regiment of Conti, which had never ſeen any ſervice, and the National gendarmerie.</p>
                     <p>Three battalions of the volunteers had ſerved in the preceding campaign in Flanders. The reſt were new levies, the greater part of whom were boys of thirteen and ſixteen years of age. There were but eight batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:026918_0152_0FD260FA5A583F58"/>
that had cannon. The cavalry amounted to a 1000 men, conſiſting of a 100 excellent troopers of the 20th regiment; 50 of the 6th regiment; the 8th regiment of huſſars, amounting to nearly 300 men, who were new levies, and were ill armed and ill mounted; a hundred Belgic huſſars, that were very good ſoldiers; eighty Dutch dragoons; and 300 horſe of the legion of the North, commanded by Colonel Weſtermann. Theſe laſt were new levies, and altogether undiſciplined. The light troops were, three Dutch battalions making about 1500 men, and who conducted themſelves with great bravery during the expedition; a corps of 1000 Belgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, raiſed at Bruges and Ghent, of which 200 were light-horſe diſmounted; and the infantry of the legion of the North, to the number of 1200, who were by no means good ſoldiers, and were very much given to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauding. This army, which amounted to 18,000 men, muſtered no more than 13,700 men fit for ſervice. The artillery conſiſted of four 12 pounders, eight 8 pounders, four mortars of 10 inches, twenty hand-grenades, and four howitzers.</p>
                     <p>General Dumourier divided this little army into four diviſions. The advanced guard, commanded by Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Berneron, was compoſed of two battalions of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal guards, two battalions of Dutch refugees, the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gic corps, a party of the legion of the North, the fifty dragoons of the 6th regiment, the eighty Dutch dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons, and the cavalry of the legion of the North. The right diviſion conſiſted of nine battalions of National guards, and the two battalions of Gendarmerie, (which could not be reckoned as making more than one batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion), with the half of the French huſſars, and was commanded by General d'Arcon, aſſiſted by Colonel Weſtermann. The left diviſion, commanded by Colonel Le Clerc, colonel of the regiment of Bouillon, was compoſed of nine battalions, (one of which conſiſted of troops of the line,) and the remainder of the 8th regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of huſſars.</p>
                     <p>It is to be obſerved that this regiment of huſſars re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained behind for want of horſes and arms, and afterward joined the army of Breda, in a ſtate almoſt unfit for ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; and the general was obliged to break the colonel named Dumont, who had been a taylor of Liſle, (a drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, ignorant, and diſhoneſt man, but a vehement Jacobin) and to give the regiment to lieutenant-colonel Morgan, one of the general's aids-du-camp.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="159" facs="unknown:026918_0153_0FD2612F5B7C50E0"/>
The rear-guard of the army was compoſed of a batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of National guards; a Dutch battalion; two hundred Belgians; a hundred troopers of the 20th regiment; and a hundred of the Belgic huſſars; and was commanded by Colonel Tilly, an aid-du-camp of the general. A part of the artillery was attached to each of theſe diviſions.</p>
                     <p>With this ſmall army the general undertook the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of Holland. But he had a powerful party in the country, who expected him with impatience, and were ready to declare themſelves on his penetrating into the country. He had neither time, on account of the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary rapidity of his movements, nor means, for want of good officers in the different corps, to form and diſcipline theſe troops. But they were ardent, courageous, and impatient for action; and the enterprize they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking had a boldneſs in it, that extremely well ſuited the genius of the nation. The general informed this little army of the rigour of the climate into which they were going; the number of ſtrong places, ſurrounded by inundations, to be taken; and the canals and arms of the ſea to be croſſed. But while he told them of theſe obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, he declared to them that, being once arrived in Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, they would be joined by numerous friends, and would find proviſions, money and every thing they want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in abundance.</p>
                     <p>The French ſoldier poſſeſſes great ſenſibility and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; and is not to be conducted with ſucceſs by the ordinary means of military men. If his general have the good ſenſe to unfold to him the obſtacles of an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, he thinks no longer of any thing but conquering them, and actually makes the enterprize an affair of pleaſure. But if the danger be concealed from him, he is confounded in diſcovering it; and if he be once diſpirited, or rather diſguſted with being led blindly to a deſperate taſk, he gives way to miſtruſt, and it becomes impoſſible to rally him; or afterwards to controul him <note place="bottom">This is a divine pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Damourier had cauſed General Berneron to march forward, on the 16th, with the advanced guard; promiſing that he ſhould be ſupported ſhortly by the reſt of the army. In written inſtructions which he delivered to General Berneron, he ordered him inſtantly to ſend a detachment conſiſting of 800 infantry and 100 cavalry, commanded by lieutenant-colonel Daendels, a Dutch refugee, to the</p>

Moor Dyke, in order to ſeize upon all the veſſels he ſhould find there, or at Swaluve, or Roowaert: to poſt the remainder of his diviſion along the little river of Merck, from Oudenboſch and Sevenbergen to Breda: and to throw a bridge over the river Merck, in order to ſecure a communication with lieutenant-colonel Daendels, and to be able to ſupport him againſt any ſorties that might be made by the neighbouring garriſons.</p>
                     <p>In Bergen-up-Zoom, Gertruydenberg, and Breda, there were three regiments of dragoons, amounting to more than all the cavalry of General Dumourier, and a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient number of infantry to act with them. It is certain that if theſe had been aſſembled together, and had been joined by the cavalry of Bois-le-Duc, and Heuſden, they would have been ſufficiently ſtrong to have compelled the advanced guard to retire, and thereby to have ruined the expedition. But Dumourier knew that there was not any one of the Dutch generals charged with the defence of the country, or who had authority to draw all the cavalry together; and he was certain that the officers who commanded in the different towns, having no plan of general defence, would attend only to the danger which threatened them reſpectively, and would not hazard any part of their garriſons, againſt an army, which each of them believed to be very ſtrong, and which appeared, by the extent of its cantonments to menace ſeveral cities at once. Beſide, that the commanding officers of the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons were ſufficiently embarraſſed in preparing means for their defence; not having expected ſo ſudden an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack, and in this early part of the ſeaſon.</p>
                     <p>On the 22d, the general arrived at his firſt poſt; and was aſtoniſhed and afflicted to find that his orders had not been executed. No part of the advanced guard had yet paſſed the Merck; by which neglect, time was given to the Dutch to withdraw all their veſſels from the Moor Dyke to the ſide of Dort, and place them under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of three guardſhips, which were on that ſtation. This firſt error rendered the general's paſſage to Dort ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely difficult, and almoſt impracticable, unleſs he could obtain other boats in the place of theſe he had expected to ſeize.</p>
                     <p>He inſtantly commanded Berneron and Daendels to puſh forward; and General d'Arcon to inveſt Breda with the right diviſion; and Colonel le Clerc cloſely to block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ade Bergen-op-Zoom, and Steenberg, with the leſt. The
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:026918_0155_0FD261302A319320"/>
officers who commanded in thoſe two laſt places abandoned all their out poſts. Colonel le Clerk made himſelf maſter of the ſmall ſort of Blaw-ſluys, at a little diſtance from Steenberg, which place he ſummoned to ſurrender. The garriſon of Bergen-op-Zoom, made two or three incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable fallies; which produced no other effect than the deſertion of ſome of their men, who entered into the Dutch legion.</p>
                     <p>General Dumourier proceeded, with his rear guard, between the two diviſions of his army, to Sevenbergen; ſending his advanced guard forward to Klundert and Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamſtadt, with orders to beſiege thoſe two places. And he commanded Lieutenant-Colonel Daendels to poſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at Nordſchantz, in order to cut off the communication between Williamſtadt and Klundert. This officer ſeized three veſſels at Nordſchantz.</p>
                     <p>The general appointed Meſſrs. Koch and De Niſs to be colonels. The former of them, who was an eloquent ſpeaker, and a man of enterpriſing character, was ordered to aſſiſt Daendels; and the latter, a man of information and temperate courage, accompanied the general.</p>
                     <p>Dumourier did not conceal from himſelf the difficulty of paſſing to Dort, by the Moor Dyke. The following was the plan firſt projected for that purpoſe. Koch and Daen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, according to the inſtructions given to Berneron, were to proceed by the 17th to the Moor Dyke with 900 men, ſupported by the whole of the advanced guard, poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Merck. They were to collect all the veſſels they could find on that ſide; and, on the 21ſt or 22d at furtheſt, embarking all the men they could croud into theſe veſſels, were to paſs to Dort, which they had reaſon to hope would join them; and, aided by the inhabitants, were to diſarm the garriſon, conſiſting of 250 men, unleſs they ſhould be willing to incorporate themſelves with the army. There were more than a hundred veſſels lying at Dort. Theſe they were to conduct to the Moor Dyke; and, arming three or ſour with the largeſt cannon, were to ſend them forward to drive off the three ſmall guard ſhips. Indeed it was propoſed to make themſelves maſters of theſe veſſels by boarding them, they being both ill-armed and ill manned.</p>
                     <p>The plan thus far accompliſhed, the main body of the army was to proceed to Sevenbergen, Oudenboſch, Moor Dyke and Swaluve; and, from thence, to paſs to Dort, in one or two diviſions; their embarkation being protected
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:026918_0156_0FD260FD62CD58F8"/>
by the rear guard, who were to deſtroy the bridge that ſhould be thrown over the Merck, and to prevent the garriſons, that might attempt to harraſs the army, from paſſing the river. The army being once arrived at Dort there was no longer any obſtacle to be feared.</p>
                     <p>On the evening in which General Dumourier quitted Antwerp, he met, at a little village on his route, the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron de Stael, who formerly had been Ambaſſador from Sweden to France, and was now going to Paris. The Baron ſupped with Dumourier, and informed him that every part of Germany and Holland through which he had paſſed was friendly to the General's enterpriſe; and that at Utrecht he was impatiently expected. He alſo confirmed the intelligence, which the General had already received, that the party of the Stadtholder were in the greateſt conſternation. Without endeavouring to diſcover the object of the Baron's journey, the General counſelled him to wait the iſſue of the preſent expedition before he ſhould explain himſelf confidentially to the French Miniſtry, that he might not too haſtily pledge his court to any certain line of conduct, or expoſe his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures to be afterwards diſowned; and he adviſed him by all means to be ſilent, at Paris, on any ſubject but ſuch as he was willing ſhould be known to the whole world. This Miniſter aſſured the General that he was going to Paris on his private concerns. Dumourier before his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from Antwerp, had given the ſame counſel to a perſonage from Poland, of very high rank and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; who, being on his route, had paid a viſit to the General at his quarters. Indeed, the General's maxim uniformly was to take every opportunity of preventing foreign courts from pledging themſelves to a miniſtry, the ſlave of an aſſembly of 700 men, without prudence, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience or honor.</p>
                     <p>Dumourier's original plan was totally deranged by the negligence of the officers, to whom he had entruſted the advanced guard, and the execution of his firſt operations. But he did not abandon his hopes of ſucceſs. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed new means. In the canals between Oudenboſch and Sevenbergen, he found 23 veſſels from 20 to 70 tons. He ordered one of his Commiſſaries, named Bourſier, an indefatigable and intelligent man, to make them fit to carry 1200 men; and to mount four of them with cannon, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

that are to be found in that part, and aſſigned them very conſiderable pay, on the funds already raiſed by the Dutch Committee, on the credit of the property of the Prince of Orange and his known partizans.</p>
                     <p>From the moment that Dumourier entered Holland, the army no longer coſt the French treaſury any thing more than the daily pay. The inhabitants of their own accord, furniſhed proviſions and forage, as well as money to forward the expedition. Never was an army received with ſuch cordiality; nor ever did ſoldiers leſs merit ſuch reception; the Gendarmerie and light troops indulging themſelves in rapine and every ſpecies of oppreſſion. But from the diſgrace of this conduct, the troops of the line, and national guards, are to be wholly exempted; ſince, on all occaſions, theſe conducted themſelves with urbanity and juſtice.</p>
                     <p>As it demanded time to prepare the veſſels, the general made another important change in his firſt plan. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that, he meant to deceive and evade the ſtrong places; and, ſtealing as is were, between them, to embark directly at the Moor Dyke. After that he would have had time to harraſs thoſe places; and relying on the weakneſs of the garriſons, and inexperience of the commanding officers, he calculated on making himſelf maſter of at leaſt one of them, which event would give great relief to his army, and furniſh him with artillery and ammunition, in both of which he was extremely ill provided.</p>
                     <p>He reſolved to undertake no one ſiege in form.—To preſs a regular ſiege forward with vigour, he muſt have aſſembled his little army in one point, and thereby have given the enemy an opportunity of knowing its weakneſs; and, being no longer maſter of the country, it would have been eaſy for the garriſons that were not attacked to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover from their ſurpriſe, aſſemble troops to cut off his communication with Antwerp, drive away his workmen, and deſtroy his little fleet, without which he had nothing to hope. Wherefore, while Colonel Le Clerc continued to blockade Bergen-op-Zoom and Steenberg, he ordered General d'Arcon to attack Breda, and his advanced guard at the ſame time to fall upon Klundert.</p>
                     <p>Breda is a town celebrated for its ſtrength. It was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with two hundred pieces of cannon, was well pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſadoed, and protected by an inundation. Twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred infantry, and a regiment of dragoons, garriſoned the place; but the Governor, the Count de By land, was a

The Dutch towns are moſt of them well protected by inundations, and abound with ſtrong exterior works; but are greatly deficient in caſemates, and the inhabitants are greatly diſaffected to the government.</p>
                     <p>General d'Arcon, without opening any trenches, erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed two batteries of four mortars and four howitzers, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely near the town, on the ſide of the village of Hage. The enemy anſwered by a very briſk fire, during three days; on the fourth, General d'Arcon had no more than ſixty bombs left, and muſt have been under the neceſſity of raiſing the ſiege after throwing them into the place. At this moment, Colonel Philip de Vaux, an Aid-de-Camp of General Dumourier, entered the place to ſummon it fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This ſiege did not coſt more than twenty men on each ſide. The French carried their temerity ſo far as to dance the <hi>Carmagnole</hi> on the glacis, on the ſide which was not inundated. Thirty dragoons of the regiment of By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land ſallied out upon theſe men, killed ſome and returned with ſix priſoners, having loſt two or three men and ſome of their horſes.</p>
                     <p>The beſieging army amounted to no more than five thouſand men; and, of theſe, twelve hundred were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to ſeize upon ſorts on the ſluices, on the ſide of Hueſden.</p>
                     <p>Klundert was taken in two days after the ſurrender of Breda. The works of this ſmall ſort were extremely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, and the place was protected by inundations that entirely ſurrounded it. It was defended with great vigour, but with little judgment, by a lieutenant colonel in the
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:026918_0159_0FD2613342A74A70"/>
Dutch ſervice, who was a Weſtphalian. He had no more than a hundred and fifty men in the place. General Berneion had erected a battery of four cannon and a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſmall mortars cloſe behind the dyke, at a hundred and fifty toiſes from the place; ſo that the houſes of that ſmal1 city were almoſt entirely deſtroyed. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding officer, after keeping up an almoſt inceſſant fire during ſeveral days with little effect, and having no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er any ſhelter for his troops, reſolved to ſpike his cannon, and to endeavour to retreat with the remainder of his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon to Williamſtadt. He was intercepted by a detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Dutch refugees, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Hartmann, whom he ſhot dead, receiving at the ſame time a ball which killed him on the ſpot, and his men were made priſoners. The French carried the body of this officer to Klundert, after having taken the keys of the town which were found in his pocket.</p>
                     <p>In this place were found fifty-three pieces of cannon, ſome mortars, a great quantity of bombs and ſhot, and about eighty thouſand weight of powder.</p>

                     <p>Dumourier alſo ordered General d'Arcon to commence the ſiege of Gertruydenberg. This ſmall town was ill defended on the ſide of Ramſdoneck, having in that quarter only a ſlight palliſadoe along the river, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing commanded by neighbouring heights. But on the left ſide of the Donge, it was protected by an extenſive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation, and by two lines of extremely ſtrong outworks, which could not have been carried in three weeks, had they been ably and vigorouſly defended. The garriſon was compoſed of the regiment of Hertzel, amounting to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween eight or nine hundred men, and of a fine regiment of dragoons belonging to the Stadtholder's guard. The go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, named Bedault, a major general in the ſervice, was an old man of eighty. General d'Arcon began the attack with cannon, and mortars that he brought from Breda. All the outworks were carried, or abandoned by the enemy on the ſecond day. D'Arcon erected batteries on ſome of them; and after a few ſhot were exchanged, Colonel de Vaux entered the place, the capitulation was ſettled, the honours of war were granted, and General Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourier,
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:026918_0160_0FD261002D04C3D8"/>
who had arrived meanwhile, dined with the old General Bedault, who acknowledged to him that he had ſurrendered becauſe he had been diſappointed in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of receiving veſſels from Dort to Gorcum, to enable him to evacuate the place. A few bombs had fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len on the city and one on the general's houſe.</p>
                     <p>During dinner, a meſſenger came to inform the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor that the terms of capitulation had been violated by a lieutenant-colonel of the National guards, who, being drunk, inſolently inſiſted on entering the city in ſpite of the centinels; and had attempted to diſcharge a piſtol at the lieutenant-colonel of the regiment of Hirtzel. General Dumourier ordered the drunkard to be brought into the room, tore the epaulet from his ſhoulder, and reduced him to the ranks, to the great aſtoniſhment of the officers of the garriſon. who interceded for his pardon.</p>
                     <p>General Dumourier converſed much with this garriſon, which conſiſted of exceeding fine troops. He has fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſince thought of an expreſſion of the lieutenant colonel of the regiment of Hirtzel, who walking with him on the ramparts, ſaid <hi>Hodie mihi, cras tibi.</hi> The honeſt Swiſs ſpoke prophetically.</p>
                     <p>This new conqueſt gave us a hundred and fifty <hi>bonches a feu,</hi> two hundred thouſand weight of powder, a quantity of bombs and ball, twenty-five hundred new fuſees, and what was moſt eſſential an excellent port, and more than thirty veſſels of various ſizes. We had alſo taken five veſſels at Breda.</p>
                     <p>This was in the beginning of March. While theſe ſieges were carrying forward, the general paſſed the greater part of the time at the Moor Dyke, whence, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the centre of his operations, he directed the ſieges on his right and left, and ſuperintended the fitting out of his ſquadron. His commiſſary Bourſier having, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible exertions, found means to arm twenty-three veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and to victual them for twelve hundred men, the general ſent them down the canal of Sevenbergen to Roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waert, which is a ſmall creek, lying a quarter of a league weſt of the Moor Dyke.</p>
                     <p>On the day the general eſtabliſhed his quarters in this village with an hundred Dutch chaſſeurs and fifty dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons, he was cannonaded the whole day, by three guard ſhips. Having poſted his chaſſeurs along the Dyke, by which two men were killed on board the veſſels, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled them to abandon their ſituation. A few hours af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:026918_0161_0FD26134C0C835E8"/>
he ordered twelve twenty-four pounders from Breda, together with ammunition, and conſtructed ſeveral batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, one of which was at Roowaert, to protect the ſailing of his ſquadron, and the reſt at the Moor Dyke to cover his embarkment. He was there perſuaded that his cannon would carry more than half way over the canal; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the enemy's armed ſhips did not again approach the ſide occupied by the French.</p>
                     <p>He cauſed huts covered with ſtraw to be raiſed along the ſands from Roowaert to Swaluve. There the ſoldiers amuſed themſelves and were extremely happy, but impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient to croſs to Dort. Dumourier jeſtingly told them that they reſembled beavers; and he named this aquatic can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonment, the camp of Beavers. Proviſions were in plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; the water was not bad; and brandy was diſtributed to the troops every morning. The general gave his troops an example of firmneſs; and was lodged and lived like the reſt.</p>
                     <p>In this expedition, the general chalked himſelf out a ſyſtem for carrying on war in countries overflowed by water. It would not be impoſſible, by means of dykes, to march over any part of Holland, to conduct artillery, and eſtabliſh batteries at pleaſure: excepting in the caſe of being oppoſed by gun-boats, when it would be neceſſary to have an adequate force of the ſame nature.</p>
                     <p>General Dumourier had, among his battalions of volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers, ſeveral men from Gaſcony, Brittany, Normandy, and Dunkirk. Of theſe men he formed a body of from four to five hundred ſailors, giving th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>m twenty ſols per day in addition to their pay. The general's ſquadron at Roowaert was deſigned to carry his advanced guard, and he appointed an Engliſh naval officer, and a lieutenant of the Dutch navy to command it; with the aſſiſtance of ſome pilots belonging to the country. But the neceſſary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays had given time to the Dutch to augment conſiderably their ſquadron in the <hi>Biſbos,</hi> which is the ſmall ſea of the Moor Dyke. That ſquadron conſiſted already of twelve armed ſhips, one of which carried twenty. guns; and theſe veſſels were diſpoſed of with great judgment for oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the general's paſſage, and acting in concert. But Dumourier calculated, in caſe the wind ſhould be ſettled, that not more then half the ſquadron could engage him, as thoſe which ſhould be to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <pb n="168" facs="unknown:026918_0162_0FD26102EFBFC528"/>
The Dutch had alſo erected batteries at Stry, and all along the coaſt of the iſland of Dort; which it was ſaid was reinforced by 1200 of the Engliſh guards, who had landed ſince the declaration of war at Helvoet Sluys. The general however was convinced that the enemy had no certain intelligence of his plan, becauſe the Prince of Orange was making his greateſt preparations for defence at Gorcum, and had aſſembled an army there to oppoſe his march: this army was yet inconſiderable; the rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcements of the Engliſh and emigrants augmenting it to no more than 4000 men.</p>
                     <p>Dumourier, ſtill to deceive the enemy reſpecting his real deſign, continued the blockade of Bergen-op-Zoom and Steenberg. General de Flers was returned from Paris, and had obtained the reinforcement that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, which arrived with great diſpatch. Dumourier ordered him to occupy the cantonments of Colonel Le Clerc at Roſendael, and round Bergen-op-Zoom with 6000 men, which orders were rapidly executed. He or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the left diviſion to approach Oudenboſch, and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernbergen. He ſent the national gendarmerie, with ſome cavalry, from his right, to ſhew themſelves on the ſide of Heuſden. A lieutenant-colonel of the gendarmerie ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned that place; and, ridiculouſly enough, addreſſed the governor by the phraſe of citizen governor, inſtead of the uſual appellation.</p>
                     <p>General Berneron continued the ſiege of Williamſtadt; but with very ill ſucceſs. He had commenced his attack at too great a diſtance; and conſumed a great quantity of ammunition, without making any progreſs. There was but one front of this town which was open to attack, and that was extremely narrow: and the Dutch had thrown re-inforcements into the town by ſea. Dumourier ſent to the aſſiſtance of General Berneron, Dubois de Crance, (an engineer of great merit, and very different in charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from his unworthy brother, the member of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional convention) and another engineer named Mareſcot. Theſe two valuable officers reſolved to draw nearer the town; and while they were erecting a battery at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of 200 toiſes from the place, they were abandoned by their ſoldiers, and were ſlain in a ſortie, that the enemy made on the workmen. General Berneron, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, continued the ſiege obſtinately, which was not raiſed till after the departure of General Dumourier for the grand army.</p>

The general having found a conſiderable quantity of ſhipping at Gertruydenberg, he reſolved to uſe them in facilitating his paſſage to Dort. He had a ſufficient num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of veſſels at Roowaert for his advanced guard. Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Breda, Klundert, and Gertruydenberg, and leaving the corps under General de Flers to continue the block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ade of Steenberg and Bergen-op-Zoom, he had ſecured his rear guard from being harraſſed. He therefore cauſed his rear guard to advance to Swaluve, at which place there were veſſels for its embarkation; and he reſolved to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark his right diviſion in the veſſels of Gertruydenberg.</p>
                     <p>The paſſage from Gertruydenberg to the iſland of Dort is ſomewhat longer than that from the Moor Dyke. To the right, and even in front of this port, the <hi>Biſhos</hi> is filled with ſand banks, and numerous ſmall iſlands detached from the main land of Gorcum; moſt of which are cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with trees and underwood. The armed ſhips of the enemy drew too much water to approach theſe iſlands. There were however, three barks each carrying four cannon, and thirty men, ſtationed at different points to guard the paſſage. Beyond theſe ſmall iſlands many of which are covered by the tide at high water, was ſituated an iſland much more elevated above the water than the reſt, on which was a ſmall farm belonging to an inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant of Gertruydenberg. This iſland, which the enemy's largeſt veſſels could not approach within ſeven or eight hundred toiſes, was ſeparated from the iſland of Dort only by a ſpace of ſix hundred toiſes, which was guarded by a battery mounting ſix cannon, ſtanding on a low and mud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſoil on the iſland of Dort, and by a frigate of fourteen guns, ſtationed under the battery.</p>
                     <p>The general reſolved to land two battalions, with ſix four and twenty pounders in this iſland; and to erect a battery to drive off the frigate, whoſe guns appeared to be ſmall. Having done this, he deſigned to embark with his right diviſion in the ſmaller veſſels belonging to Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truydenberg and to paſs over in the ſame route.</p>
                     <p>As he might be compelled to engage one of the veſſels of four guns, in his paſſage to the iſland, he deſigned to fill ſeveral large ſhallops with choſen men on board that veſſel, and ordered two veſſels each carrying two cannon to be ready to precede him, giving the command of one to an Engliſh naval officer named White, and of the other to Lieutenant Colonel La Rue, an aid-de-camp of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, who had been in the ſea-ſervice. Every preparation
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:026918_0164_0FD26104AA78F490"/>
was made with ſuch celerity that it was the general's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to have attempted the paſſage on the night of the 8th or 10th. But events of a very different nature were ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving, and the rapidity of his firſt ſucceſs was followed by a ſtill more rapid ſucceſſion of evils which decided the fate of the war.</p>
                     <p>Dumourier in the midſt of his plans, and notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſucceſſes, had for ſome days been a prey to the greateſt uneaſineſs. The ſiege of Maeſtricht had been commenced on the 20th of February; but although Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Miranda had ſet fire to ſeveral quarters of the city, it was defended it with extreme obſtinacy, by reinforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the emigrants, who aſſembled there in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, headed by M.d'Autichamp, a lieutenant-general in the army of the Prince of Conde, and an excellent officer; to whom it is ſaid the Dutch owe the ſafety of the city of Maeſtricht.</p>
                     <p>General Champmorin had, without any oppoſition made himſelf maſter of the fort of Stevenſwaert, on the Meuſe; and alſo of fort St. Michael, which commands the entrance, the left ſide of that river, of the bridge of Venloo. But he had not been able to take poſſeſſion of Venloo, the Pruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians having already entered it.</p>
                     <p>General Valence, although he poſſeſſed military talents, had not acquired ſufficient authority over the troops effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually to compenſate for the abſence of Dumourier. He remained at Leige; and had neither raiſed the winter quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the troops, nor drawn them cloſer together. And great miſunderſtandings exiſted among the generals.</p>
                     <p>General Stengel occupied the quarters round Aix-la-Chapelle. He was an officer well verſed in the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and duties of light troops, and was excellently cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to command an advanced guard.</p>
                     <p>General Dampierre commanded in Aix-la-Chapelle, where he was entirely taken up with his pleaſures, and the means of gratifying his rapacity. He was a man of a fierce, and ambitious ſpirit, raſh in the extreme, but was without talent, and was even timid at times through his exceſſive ignorance. He hated his ſuperiors; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinated with the Jacobins of Paris, for the fabrication of calumnies, by which he aimed at the command of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
                     <p>The Prince of Coburg, who had arrived at Cologne, was acquainted with the miſunderſtandings of the generals, and the injudicious, and ſeeble diſpoſition of the troops.
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:026918_0165_0FD26137A6B18480"/>
Aſſembling his army he marched to Aldenhoven, where he penetrated into the French quarters without obſtacle. The French inſtantly abandoned all their poſts, without making the leaſt ſtand againſt the enemy; and fell back upon Liege in the greateſt confuſion. General le Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neur, who commanded the attack of Maeſtricht on the ſide of Wyck, had the good fortune to have ſufficient time to paſs the Meuſe with his cannon. The Imperialiſts entered Maſtricht. Miranda, notwithſtanding ought to have continued the bombardment from the left ſide of the liver; and, collecting his army between Tongres and Maeſtricht, which was a tolerable poſition, he might then have prevented the further progreſs of the Prince of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg.</p>
                     <p>Theſe were the orders given to Miranda by General Dumourier, on his receiving news of the diſaſter. This was alſo the advice of General Valence. That General a few days after ſaved a column conſiſting of twenty-ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven battalions on their retreat from Liege, by making a vigorous charge on the enemy, at the head of his cavalry on the plains of Tongres: and Lieutenant-General La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noue diſplayed the greateſt bravery, in his retreat from Aix-la-Chapelle.</p>
                     <p>But Miranda was diſconcerted, and loſt all preſence of mind. On his own authority, he ordered the troops to abandon the Meuſe. The Imperialiſts followed up their victory, paſſed the Meuſe, entered Liege, and took poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the French magazines, which were conſiderable, eſpecially in the article of cloathing. So great was the conſternation in the French army, that, excepting the heavy artillery which was carried off to Louvain, and from thence to Tournay, every thing was abandoned, including even the baggage of the troops.</p>
                     <p>The two generals, Miranda and Valence, aſſembled their forces in the camp of Louvain. Champorin, who could no longer maintain his poſition on the left ſide of the Meuſe, evacuated Stevenſwaert, and Fort St. Michael, (in which places he ought to have left garriſons) and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to Dieſt. General la Marliere, who was at Rure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monde, fell back to the ſame place. This retreat left the Pruſſians maſters of the Lower Meuſe. They had it in their power inſtantly to have croſſed the country of Campine; and, by the route of Antwerp or Bois-le-Duc, might have fallen on the rear of the French army in Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:026918_0166_0FD26108D3501F50"/>
Prince Frederick of Brunſwick loſt this important opportunity; and General Dumourier, availing himſelf of the neglect, afterward placed his army in ſecurity.</p>
                     <p>The troops under Miranda and Valence, were utterly diſcouraged. They openly blamed and menaced their general officers, more eſpecially Miranda, who was in conſiderable danger of his life. At length however Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Valence, aided by the prudence of General Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venot, reſtored ſome degree of order in the army. But the deſertion of the army was enormous. More than 10,000 men abſolutely returned to France. The army loudly demanded the preſence of General Dumourier. The commiſſioners of the Convention diſpatched courier after courier, urging his departure for Louvain. The general conſtantly anſwered them, that they might main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the army in its preſent poſition; and that ſtill there was nothing to be feared if they gave him time to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh his preſent object. This was true. General Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and General Thouvenot were of the ſame opinion. But Miranda now betrayed terror altogether proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate to the raſhneſs which had hitherto governed him, which juſtified the diſpatches of General Valence, who from the firſt predicted this check, while Miranda's let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters uniformly aſſerted, that the army of the Imperialiſts was not to be feared. And certainly his opinions would have been juſt, if the French had taken a judicious poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with an equal force, which they might and ought to have done. It was to be preſumed that the Prince of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg would not have choſen to hazard a battle; or, if he had, the French had no reaſon to fear the iſſue.</p>
                     <p>The commiſſioners of the Convention hurried precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tately to Paris. They made a report ſo alarming, and painted the conſternation of the ſoldiers in ſuch ſtrong co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, that it was univerſally acknowledged that General Dumourier could alone ſtop the progreſs of the diſaſter, and ſave the army. He was commanded in the moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute terms, to abandon the expedition of Holland, and inſtantly to put himſelf at the head of the grand army. He received the orders on the evening of the 8th of March, and departed on the 9th, in a ſtate bordering no deſpair.</p>
                     <p>Dumourier gave the command of his army to General de Flers. He knew the capacity of this general to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adequate to the taſk; but he had not another general officer he could put in his place. General d'Arcon was extremly afflicted with the go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>, and could not keep the
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:026918_0167_0FD2613D8FECBC88"/>
field, and had even refuſed the rank of lieutenant-gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, which Dumourier would have obtained for him, sa a reward for the taking of Breda. He retired to Antwerp. Lieutenant General Maraſſe, an old ſoldier, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded at Anwerp, could not on account of his great age, be entruſted in an active ſituation, although he was a man of courage and experience. And it was Dumou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier's deſign to ſend General Miranda into Holland, on his arrival at the grand army.</p>
                     <p>Dumourier left Colonel Thouvenot, who was the ſoul of his little army, with General de Flers. He gave the colonel a copy of the inſtructions he had delivered to Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral de Flers, whom he recommended to undertake no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize without the concurrence of Colonel Thouvenot. He ordered him inſtantly to attempt the paſſage of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truydenberg; and, in caſe of ſucceſs, to forward diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches to Dumourier, and to remain at Dort till he ſhould receive his further inſtructions.</p>
                     <p>But the departure of General Dumourier, utterly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirited this army. Thoſe who had been moſt forward, impatient, and daring, on every occaſion, now coſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the undertaking to be impracticable. In truth, it became ſuch ſhortly afterward. The Dutch ſquadron be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reinforced, and the Pruſſians being on their march by Bois-le-duc, de Flers, in purſuance of his inſtructions in the caſe of the paſſage to Dort not taking place, threw himſelf into Breda, with ſix battalions and two hundred horſe, Colonel Tilly into Gertruydenberg, with three battalions, and fifty horſe, The remainder of the army returned ſafely to Antwerp, owing to the good conduct of Colonel de Vaux, and Colonel Thouvenot. Thoſe officers withdrew from the batteries of the Moor Dyke, with the greateſt prudence, and conſtancy; and although the army was thrown into diſorder, they effected the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat without loſs. The fortifications of Klundert were blown up by Thouvenot, who had not time to put that ſmall ſort in a ſtate of defence.</p>
                     <p>And thus terminated Dumourier's enterprize againſt Holland. An enterprize, projected and begun in ten days, which did not burthen France with the additional charge of one ſol, and which probably had ſucceeded but for the unfortunate retreat of Aix-la-Chapelle.</p>
                     <p>Two ſtrong places were acquired in this expedition, by which the progreſs of the enemy might have been arreſted; and which might ſerve as magazines, and a place of arms,
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:026918_0168_0FD2610B1025F8E0"/>
if the deſign of entering Holland had been reſumed. In a word, France reaped no diſgrace in this quarter. But now Dumourier's projects were once more changed; and he was again compelled to form new plans, as well reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the interior ſituatian of France, as with reſpect to her enemies.</p>

                     <p>NOTWITHSTANDING the importance of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns which had occupied General Dumourier's mind, ſince his departure from Paris, he had not overlooked, nor failed to lament as much as the Belgians themſelves, the deteſtable tyranny exerciſed over them by the National Convention, and by the agents of the Executive Power. The inſolence of theſe latter, the Satellites of a varice and oppreſſion, was not exceeded even by their atrocious vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainies. —Their conduct was a tiſſue of ridiculous circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. Moſt of them aſſumed the military honors, and never walked the ſtreets without a guard. They ſet all rules at defiance; and, finding that they were not ſufficiently numerous to ſpread their extortions through the whole extent of thoſe rich provinces, they augmented their means by iſſuing commiſſions to other perſons like themſelves.</p>
                     <p>In paſſing through Bruges the General was invited to a ball. One of theſe gentlemen, who was dancing, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſted the General on his entering the room; and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing himſelf as a Commiſſioner of the Executive Pow er, he acquainted the General that he was on his road to Oftend and Nieuport, to put thoſe places in a proper ſtate of defence. The General ſternly commanded him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine himſelfe to the functions of his office; to execute thoſe with modeſty, and thenceforward, to forbear intruding
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:026918_0169_0FD2613FC075C470"/>
himſelf into military concerns.</p>
                     <p>Another of theſe perſonages, named, as I think, Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taud, who was ſtationed at Ruremonde, as a talk-maſter to General la Marliere, wrote a long letter to Dumourier, <hi>Thouing</hi> and <hi>Theeing</hi> him throughout, and commanding him to abandon every other enterprize, in order to march to the aſſiſtance of Ruremonde. The General ſent this letter to Le Brun, contenting himſelf with adding by way of poſtſcript, <hi>This letter ought to be dated,</hi> CHAREN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON.</p>
                     <p>A third, named Cochelet, who reſided at Liege, having received notice of the declaration of war decreed on the firſt of February, ordered a detachment of troops to attend him, and, marching on the Dutch territory before Maeſtricht, proclaimed the war, tore up the poſts on which were the arms of the States General, and took poſſeſſion of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven United Provinces, in the name of the French Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic.</p>
                     <p>This impertinent parade ſerved as a warning to the Governor of Maeſtricht to withdraw his cavalry cantoned round the city, (together with a conſiderable quantity of forage) which General Miaczynſky was on the point of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing. General Miranda naturally condemned this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, becauſe he was not yet prepared to act againſt Maeſtricht. Cochelet ſent the General a written order to take Maeſtricht before the 20th of February, on pain of being denounced as a traitor; and he ſent a copy of the letter to the National Convention, who applauded his Roman firmneſs. Cochelet, however, was recalled; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, intoxicated with the honors of his proconſulſhip, he had treated contemptuouſly the authority of the deputies of the Convention.</p>
                     <p>When General Dumourier arrived at Antwerp on the ſecond of February, he found that city humiliated and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified by the preſence of one of theſe ſubaltern tyrants, whoſe name he has forgotten, and whom he cauſed to be recalled. Every city in Belgium was governed by one or more of theſe execrable Proconſuls. They enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on their office by ſequeſtering the ſilver of the churches, the revenues of the clergy, and the eſtates of the nobility. They then pillaged, or ſold to their accomplices at an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively inferior price, the furniture of the nobles and elergy. They ſuppreſſed the national impoſts to flatter the people, degraded the magiſtrates from their ſeats, erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:026918_0170_0FD2610C2BF52898"/>
clubs, and exerciſed an arbitrary authority, by the ald of the military, who blindly obeyed them.</p>
                     <p>Throughout the provinces of Belgium this wild tyranny was become inſupportable. Dumourier had made reiter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated complaints of this tyranny to the Convention, as well as to the Commiſſioners of the Convention, Camus, Treil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hard, Merlin and Goſſuin, whom he met at Ghent; but theſe latter either were not willing, or had not authority to redreſs the evil. He repreſented to them, that on the Prince of Coburg's appearing in force on the frontier, a general inſurrection of the Belgians was to be expected, that our weakened garriſons would be maſſacred, and our crimes puniſhed by the hands of thoſe we had oppreſſed; and that this war was, in a manifold degree, more dangerous than the war with the Imperialiſts.</p>
                     <p>The route of the troops at Aix-la Chapelle, their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate flight to Louvain, their conſuſion, terror, and deſertion, greatly increaſed the danger, which Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourier had foreſeen, of a general inſurrection in Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gium.</p>
                     <p>The danger was aggravated by the conduct of the Commiſſioners of the Convention. They called on the provinces to expreſs their reſolution of being united to France. The people were aſſembled in the churches without any order or decency. A French Commiſſioner, ſupported by the commanding officer of the place, by ſoldiers, and by French and Belgic Clubiſts, read the act of union, which ſeldom was underſtood by any perſon preſent, any more than the harangue made on the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; the act was notwithſtanding ſigned by the audience, generally with trembling hands; reports of the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were printed, and ſent to the Convention, who forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with created another department.</p>
                     <p>Theſe fraternal proceedings were often effected by vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence. At Bruſſels and at Mons, muſkets and ſabres were employed in the aſſembly, and ſeveral perſons were wounded. Proteſts were formally made againſt the union. Partial inſurrections took place at Wawres, Hall, Braine, and Soignies. The moſt dangerous was at Grammont. Ten thouſand peaſants aſſembled in arms, and had poſſeſſed themſelves of ſeveral cannon. They impriſoned the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, and drove back detachments of the garriſon of Ghent. Theſe tumults increaſed hourly. The French ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, ſcarcely in force to reſiſt the Imperialiſts, could not

ſpare troops ſo put an end to theſe cruel conteſts, which were ſpreading over the whole of Belgium; and it had been eaſy for a few Fleniſh officers belonging to the Imperial army, with ſome choſen ſoldiers, to have inſinuated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the French quarters, by means of their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the language, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o have given a regular form to this inteſtine war.</p>
                     <p>Dumourier hated the injuſtice of the National Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, and reſiſted every attempt to make him the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of its tyranny and the ſcourge of Belgium. A two-fold intereſt therefore directed his conduct at preſent. His objects were to deliver this unhapy country, and to ſave his army. As to his ſucceſs in the former, he invokes the teſtimony of the Belgians, from whom he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the moſt honourable marks of eſteem and gratitude, in travelling through that country, when he no longer poſſeſſed the influence of ſtation.</p>
                     <p>Arriving at Antwerp on the 11th, he found that city in the greateſt confuſion and alarm. A Commiſſioner of the Executive Power, named Chauſſart, who modeſtly ſurnamed himſelf Publicola, had recently removed the magiſtrates, and had iſſued orders to arreſt them and the other principal citizens, to the number of ſixty-ſeven. General Maraſſe eluded the execution of this order, with which he was charged by <hi>Publicola</hi>; but the biſhop of Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp and the other proſcribed perſons were either fled or had concealed themſelves. Dumourier ſent a written or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to Chauſſart and his colleagues, to quit Antwerp, and to go to Bruſſels inſtantly, declaring, in caſe of diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that he would give orders to General Maraſſe to take them there by force. Chauſſart came to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral with much dignity, or inſolence, and complained of this order, ſaying, that it ſeemed to be dictated by a Vizir. The General anſwered with good humour, <hi>I am certainly as much of a Vizir, as you are of Publicola.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>General Dumourier compelled Chauſſant to quit the town immediately. He reinſtated the magiſtrates, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored the peace of that important city. He iſſued an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, prohibiting the Jacobin club in any degree to interfere in public affairs. He commanded General Maraſſe to wall up the door of the hall where the club aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, to impriſon every member that diſobeyed this ordinance, to print the order in both languages, and to poſt it up and publiſh it throughout the city.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="178" facs="unknown:026918_0172_0FD2610DCAFD89A0"/>
Dumourier afterwards departed for Bruſſels. Having received complaints from that city of the attrocious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of General Moreton, he had a few days previous to his departure removed him from the command; which he had conferred on Lieutenant-General Duval. Moreton at firſt refuſed to obey the General; but in conſequence of an order from the miniſter at war, he took upon him the command at Douay, where he had an opportunity of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing his former ſyſtem of conduct till his death.</p>
                     <p>General Duval was an extremely good officer, and it was the ill ſtate of his health alone which prevented his being with the army. He had ſerved the preceding year with great reputation and ſucceſs. His judgment was clear, he abounded in the qualities that beget eſteem, and was perfectly calcutated to heal the wounds inflicted by Moreton's tyranny.</p>
                     <p>Duval gave the general a more particular account, than he had hitherto received, of the diſorder and conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation that reigned among the troops aſſembled at Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vain, from which place Duval had recently arrived. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the tents had been loſt in the retreat. There was not left a ſufficient number to encamp half the army; yet it was impoſſible to reſtore any degree of courage to the troops, or to make any movement with ſafety, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out encamping them for a while.

All the twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>four pounders, the ſixteen pounders, the mortars, and pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toons, were already at Tournay, on their route to France; fortunately, however, the heavy artillery, and the how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itzers, were ſtill at Anderletcht. Theſe latter the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ordered to join the army at Louvain; and thoſe at Tournay not to proceed on their route to France.</p>
                     <p>Bruſſels was filled with officers and ſoldiers of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, who were on their return to France. The general ſent them back to the camp at Louvain; and diſpatched orders to Tournay and Mons, and the cities in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment of the north, to arreſt and ſend back to the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my all the fugitives returning into France.</p>
                     <p>Dumourier ordered General Stengel, who had retired to Namur, and two ſquadrons of huſſars, to join the army.

                     <p>But an object even more important to General Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourier, than theſe concerns, was to calm the minds of the Belgians and to reſtore public confidence throughout the country, by putting a final period to the ſyſtem under which they had ſuffered. He was not ignorant that in this attempt he ſhould excite the Jacobins, and the conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to proceed to extremity with him. The time, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, for conciliatory meaſures, as well as for deliberation, was entirely paſſed: ſo great were the evils to be reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died,
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:026918_0174_0FD2610F654A2480"/>
ſo enormous the wrongs that had been done to the Belgians, and ſo immediately was the danger of vengeance being taken by that people.</p>
                     <p>A few days before Dumourier arrived at Bruſſels, Chepy had urged General Duval to order ſeveral executions. He threatened to fire Bruſſels, or to put it to the ſword. He had arreſted ſeveral of the wea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>hieſt citizens, and ſent them to be confined in the fortreſſes of the department of the north. General Dumourier now arreſted him, and ſent him under a guard, to Paris.</p>
                     <p>The legion of <hi>Sans-Culottes,</hi> raiſed by General More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and compoſed of the loweſt of the populace, held the city in awe, and daily committed unheard of cruelties and extortions. A Frenchman, a man of abandoned charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, named Eſtienne, commanded it, with the title of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. Dumourier threw him into priſon, and publiſhed an ordinance, breaking this corps, and forbidding all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to diſtinguiſh themſelves by the name of <hi>Sans-culottes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He aſſembled the magiſtrates of the city. He beſought them before all the people, not to attribute to the French nation, crimes committed only by individuals. He ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly promiſed to puniſh the guilty, and to reſtore to their families, peaceable citizens, who had been torn from them, under the pretence of ſerving as hoſtages to France. The repreſentatives of the people ſhed tears of gratitude, and cauſed accounts of theſe intereſting proceedings to be publiſhed.</p>
                     <p>General Dumourier iſſued a proclamation to authoriſe the citizens to deliver complaints to the magiſtrates, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting vexations committed by the French, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powering the magiſtrates to verify and give a legal form to theſe complaints. By another proclamation, he prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited the clubs from interfering in public affairs, and by another, he commanded all the ſacred vaſes, to be reſtored to the churches, enjoining the magiſtrates and military officers to aid in reſtoring them.</p>
                     <p>Theſe proclamations were printed in both languages, and ſent into every part of Belgium. Their effect was immediate. The inhabitants of Grammont wrote to the general, that they laid down their arms. Peace was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored between the French and the Belgians. Theſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy people forgot the evils they had ſuffered, and again embraced the French as their brethren and defenders. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is but juſt to ſay, the garriſons had always conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves in a manner no ways diſcreditable, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:026918_0175_0FD26143CB4BF7C0"/>
in the great cities; and, had it not been for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of the 15th of December, and the conduct of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents of the executive power, the French character would have been eſteemed and beloved in that country.</p>
                     <p>On the 12th of March, Dumourier wrote a letter to the National Convention, which appeared ſo deplorably true in its contents, that the Preſident and committee to which it was referred, did not dare to read it in the Tribune. A copy of the letter ſtole abroad, and was printed at Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp. In it the general frankly ſtated to the convention, the meaſures he had been compelled to purſue in order to ſave Belgium and the French army. He referred the Convention, for minute information on each point, to the miniſter, to whom he ſent copies of the proclamations, and an account of his proceedings, demanding of him, that he ſhould produce the whole to the convention, without reſerve or diſguiſe.</p>
                     <p>He ſent for the commiſſary Petit-Jean, and, aſſembling all the adminiſtrators of proviſions, &amp;c. he informed them, that he was on the eve of making a great movement, with the army, and in a few days would engage the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; and he made ſuch arrangements with them as were neceſſary to his purpoſe. He almoſt immediately procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red proviſions for fifteen days, and prepared his travelling hoſpital to attend the army.</p>
                     <p>The pay-maſter of the army had retired to Liſle, with two millions of Livres in ſpecie, and the general wrote to the commandant of Liſle, to ſend him back to the army with a ſtrong eſcort.</p>
                     <p>General Dumourier harranged the garriſon at Bruſſels, with ſuch effect, that the different corps demanded leave to follow him againſt the enemy. He departed on the eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the 12th of March, for Louvain.</p>
                     <p>Before we enter on the hiſtory of the military opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that follow, and that we may not be obliged to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt them, it wiil be neceſſary to ſpeak here of the viſit which the general received at Louvain from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners of the National Convention. When the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſter beſel the army, Camus, Treilhard, Merlin, and Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuin, retired to the frontiers of France, while La Croix and Danton, went to Paris. When the former knew of the general's arrival from Holland, they proceeded to Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vain to meet him, having miſſed him at Bruſſels.</p>
                     <p>Camus, and Treilhard complained of the general's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations, eſpecially that which ordered the ſilver to be
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:026918_0176_0FD26110A9164B98"/>
reſtored to the churches. They told the general that he ought not to have acted with ſuch precipitation, but have waited their arrival, and that it was beyond the bounds of his authority to interfere with the adminiſtration of the civil government. The general anſwered that the firſt of all duties was that of attending to the public ſafety; that the convention might be deceived, as indeed they had been, by their emiſſaries; that the whole weight of the war, the honour of the nation, and the preſervation of the army, reſted upon him; that for theſe he was reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, not only to his ſuperiors, but to poſterity; that he had undertaken no meaſure inconſiderately, but after the matureſt deliberation; that, had they been preſent, he ſhould not have conſulted them, although he ſhould have endeavoured to have won them to act with him, in putting an end to the crimes, which had long oppreſſed the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians and diſhonoured France; and, had they oppoſed his intentions, he would notwithſtanding have iſſued the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>He appealed particularly to Camus, who was religious, and ſuperſtitious, on the proclamation that reſpected the churches. He expreſſed his ſurpriſe, that a man, who proſeſſed a zeal for religion, ſhould be the advocate of a ſacrilege committed on a people, whom the French con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as allies and friends.</hi> Go to the church of St. Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dule, <hi>Dumourier ſaid to him,</hi> ſee the hoſt trodden under foot, and waſtea on the pavement; the altars broken: and paintings, the maſter pieces of art, torn into ſhreds; and juſtify theſe profanations, or rather own the neceſſity of puniſhing the agents of your criminal orders. If the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention applaud theſe crimes, if ſhe have no feeling of their enormity, ſhe is to be pitied; and, ſtill more, my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy country. Know, that if my country cannot be ſaved without the commiſſion of crimes, I will not commit them. But here the crimes of France are ready to turn upon her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and I ſerve her in endeavouring to deſtroy them.</p>
                     <p>Camus obſerved the great difficulty there would be in reſtoring the veſſels to the churches, ſince they had been broken, to be heaped in Coffers. <hi>No matter,</hi> the general ſaid; <hi>ſince the metal remains, it will not coſt us much to have them remade.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Camus and Treilhard perſiſted in ſaying that the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral had failed in reſpect and obedience due to the Convention. Merlin and Goſſuin, more reaſonable, acknowleged that the general's conduct had been juſt,
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:026918_0177_0FD26146AE208478"/>
and a violent altercation aroſe between the two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Camus ſaid, that it was a duty he muſt not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline, to report the general's conduct, to the convention. The general exhorted him to do ſo, and ſaid that he had already, himſelf rendered an account of his conduct. The general produced his letter of the 12th, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a new ſubject of contention.</p>
                     <p>It was during this interview that Camus, the moſt iraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible of men, ſaid with an air, partly ſmiling, and partly ſerious, <hi>General you are accuſed of deſigning to become</hi> Caeſar: <hi>and I deſign to become</hi> Brutus. The general anſwered, <hi>Dear Camus, neither am I</hi> Caeſar, <hi>or you</hi> Brutus, <hi>and your threat is the beſt aſſurance I have of immortality.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe commiſſioners, after three or four hours conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation with the general, departed the ſame night for Bruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels. Camus was faithful to his promiſe. He drew up his report to the Convention, with all the bitterneſs of a perfidious and malignant mind; and, thenceforth, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the decided enemy of Dumourier.</p>
                     <p>The general, on his part, returned to the conſideration of the means left him to repair the faults of his officers, and to reſtore vigour to an army that no longer poſſeſſed the ſpirit which conducted them in the former campaign.</p>

                     <p>THE troops appeared to reſume all their courage at the ſight of their general. Joy and confidence ſhone in the eyes of the ſoldiers. They embraced the general. They called him their father. They diſcovered ſhame and ſorrow for their diſgrace, and loudly demanded to be led againſt the enemy.</p>
                     <p>Dumourier reproached them with their want of diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, but above all with their miſtruſt of generals, who, till this fatal diſaſter, had conducted them to victory, and who were his ſcholars and companions. He repreſented to them, that their impatience, their want of ſubordination,
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:026918_0178_0FD2611252CB4F50"/>
and the fatal conſequences of theſe in their retreat, had wreſted the conqueſt of Holland from his hands, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps had determined the fate of the campaign. They appeared extremely affected by their diſgrace, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to repair their faults, on condition that he would not abandon them, but would inſtantly lead them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover their honour.</p>
                     <p>This diſpoſition greatly aided the general in reſtoring order to the army. But he was greatly aſſiſted by Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Thouvenot, who, with every other military talent, had that alſo of conciliating the minds of the ſoldiery, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing order into all the parts of a great army. With great pleaſure, Dumourier renders this teſtimony of the merit of his friend, who may one day become one of the beſt generals in France, if he ſhould return to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of his country, and prejudice do not prevent his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to the command.</p>
                     <p>The army amounted to near forty thouſand infantry, and near five thouſand horſe; and this was excluſive of the garriſons of Belgium; of a diviſion of 5000 men (800 of whom were horſe) under the orders of General la Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liere; the diviſion of Namur, under General d'Harville, conſiſting of 12,000 infantry, and 1500 cavalry; and of the corps of the army employed in the expedition againſt Holland, which amounted to 18,000 foot, and 2,000 horſe, after the junction of General de Flers.</p>
                     <p>The infantry, conſiſting of ſixty-two battalions, were formed into four diviſions. The right was formed by General Valence; the centre by the Duke de Chartres, who at that period, was named Egalite; and the left by General Miranda. Each of theſe diviſions conſiſted of eighteen battalions, and amounted to ſeven thouſand men. The reſerve conſiſting of eight battalions of grenadiers, commanded by General Chancel, was placed under the orders of the Duke de Chartres.</p>
                     <p>Miranda had under his orders General Miaczinſky, who commanded the left flank of the army, conſiſting of two thouſand infantry, and one thouſand horſe; and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Champmorin, who commanded a body of four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand foot and one thouſand horſe. General Valence had under his orders General Dampierre, who commanded the right flank, conſiſting of an equal force with that of General Miaczinſky; and Generel Neuilly, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a body of three thouſand foot and one thouſand horſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="185" facs="unknown:026918_0179_0FD261452CB6FDB0"/>
The advanced guard was compoſed of ſix thouſand men, fifteen hundred of which were horſe, commanded by General la Marche. He was an old officer, who had ſeen a great deal of ſervice, and had been an excellent colonel of Huſſars. He was forward to undertake an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, but eaſily diſcouraged. He was aſſiſted by two excellent officers, although they were very young, who counſelled him with great ſucceſs, when he would ſuffer himſelf to be counſelled. Theſe were Colonel Montjoye, who was adjutant-general, and Lieutenant-Colonel Barois, who commanded the horſe artillery. But the ill-health of this old general, and ſtill more his want of capacity, rendered him very dangerous.</p>
                     <p>The rapidity with which in this war, officers roſe to the higheſt rank in the army, inverted the order of every thing. The corps and regiments loſt officers that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them with effect, and the army acquired inexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced generals. Yet the army was really in want of generals. At this period it had no more than five lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant-generals, and twelve major-generals, ſix of which commanded detached corps: ſo that there were but ſix re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining to command in the line.</p>
                     <p>When general Dumourier arrived at Louvain, on the morning of the 13th, he found that the three diviſions of his infantry were encamped on the heights behind Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vain, having the canal of Malines in front. The reſerve, with a ſmall body of horſe, was at the diſtance of two leagues, beyond Bauterſem; and the advanced guard at more than two leagues beyond the reſerve, at Cumptich, having a ſmall force of four hundred men in Tirlemont.</p>
                     <p>The enemy advanced and occupied all the villages between Tirlemont and Tongres. The deſign of the enemy was to turn our right on the 16th; and if that had been executed on the 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>th or 14th, the advanced guard would have fallen back on the reſerve, and the reſerve on the main body, and the whole army would have been defeated and diſperſed, having no known point at which to rally.</p>
                     <p>On the 14th Dumourier viſited his advanced guard; and he inſtantly ordered ſeveral movements, by which the poſition of his army was much more firm and ſecure. He placed General Dampierre, with the troops under his command, at Hougaerde to the right of Cumptich, and ordered General Neuilly to advance from Judoigne to
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:026918_0180_0FD26114669F7F38"/>
Lummen, in order to ſtrengthen this right wing of the army, and to extend the line beyond that of the enemy.</p>
                     <p>He commanded General Miaczinſky to take a poſition to the left, between Dieſt and Tirlemont, on the ſide of Halen, and having the river Gette in front of him. He ordered General Champmorin to occupy Dieſt, with his diviſion. This general, having informed him that Dieſt was a ſmall city with walls, which might be made a ſtrong poſt, Dumourier ordered him to add as much as poſſible to its ſtrength, and to leave in it two battalions and fifty horſe, when he ſhould receive orders to march forward with his troops.</p>
                     <p>He commanded General la Marliere to leave a ſmall body of troops at Aerſchette, in order to keep open the communication with Dieſt; and to proceed with the reſt of his troops to Liers to overawe the country of Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine, to check the Pruſſian column who might advance in that quarter, and to cover the retreat of the army of Holland, whom Dumourier concluded had abandoned the project of paſſing to Dort, and which indeed was the caſe.</p>
                     <p>He ſent orders to General de Flers to throw himſelf with all poſſible diſpatch into Breda; to ſend Colonel Tilly to Gertruydenberg, with the garriſons named in the orders, and to ſend back the remainder of that army to the lines of Antwerp, to be placed under the orders of General Maraſſe. Dumourier ordered Colonel Weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termann to take poſt at Turnhout, with the gendarmerie and the legion of the north, in order to protect this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, to check the enemy in that quarter, and to keep open the communication with General la Marliere, and by his diviſion, with the grand army.</p>
                     <p>On the morning of the 15th of March, the advanced guard of the enemy attacked Tirlemont, and the 400 men who were poſted there fell back, without engaging but with a loſs, having ſuffered themſelves to be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed. General Dampierre, accuſtomed to retreats, took upon him, on hearing the firing at a diſtance, to abandon his poſt of Hougaerde, where he guarded one of the paſſages of the Gette, and fell back upon Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vain, at the ſame time ordering General Neuilly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire on his ſide to Judoigne. Dumourier had not time to examine whether it were fear or treachery which cauſed this dangerous movement on his right. Had it been known to the enemy, the French army might have been
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:026918_0181_0FD26148F6280F38"/>
overthrown, Dumourier contented himſelf with repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this fault, which was ſo much the more weighty, as it accuſtomed the troops to give way on the firſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of danger; and on the ſame night he cauſed theſe two diviſions to return to their former poſts.</p>
                     <p>It was very ſingular, that on the left General Miac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zinſky committed the ſame fault, and withdrew into the wood near Louvain, and was not to be found for two days. But the poſition he had quitted was occupied by the body of troops under General Champmorin, whom the General ordered on the 15th to proceed with the greateſt diſpatch to occupy the heights of Oplinter, on the left of Tirlemont. Champmorin took that poſition on the evening of the 16th.</p>
                     <p>Fortunately the enemy, who had fixed the 16th for their march, diſcovered nothing of the retrograde move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the 15th, and were not prepared to profit by them. On the ſame day, the General advanced with the whole of his army beyond Bauterſem and near to Cump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tich, to prepare for his revenge on the following day, and not to leave the enemy the advantage they had gained. It was abſolutely neceſſary for him to take Tirlemont; ſince, otherwiſe, he muſt have fallen back, and again have ſubjected his troops to be diſcouraged and terrified.</p>
                     <p>The Imperialiſts, with a conſiderable advanced guard, occupied Tirlemont, and the ſpace lying between the two Gettes, from the cauſeway of St. Tron, to the ground oppoſite the poſt of Hougaerde.</p>
                     <p>On the morning of the 16th, the General made a vigorous attack upon the Imperialiſts. As the heights of Oplinter commanded the high road of St. Tron, when the General had made himſelf maſter of Tirle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, (which he gained after ſome reſiſtance) the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts finding their right flanked by the troops under Miranda on the heights of Oplinter, made a precipitate march, to paſs a ſmall arm of the Gette, to retire to the heights of Neerlanden, Nerwinde, Middlewinde and, Oberwinde.</p>
                     <p>Between the two Gettes, at a league and a half on the right beyond Tirlemont, was a village named Gotz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enhoven, which commanded the whole plain. It ſtood on a ſmall hill; having hedges along the front, and ditches filled with water on the right and in the rear.</p>
                     <p>The Imperialiſts did not appear to perceive the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of this poſt, till Dumourier had ſent General la

                        </gap>on of the two villages of Meer and Hatten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dover and Dumourier cauſed theſe to be attacked by his column as quickly as they could form after filing thro' Tirlemont. The Imperialiſts committed a great error in not occupying Gotzenhoven in ſufficient force, as that poſt might have defended, or might have laid in aſhes, the two villages of Meer and Hattendover. The Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialiſts collected a ſtrong body of infantry and horſe, to endeavour to diſlodge the French from Gotzenhoven. — They performed prodigies of valour in this attack, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though without ſucceſs. The cuiraſſiers charged the French infantry with the greateſt intrepidity, even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the very hedges of the village, and their loſs was very great. The attack was recommenced ſeveral times. The enemy attempted in vain to turn Gotzenhoven on the right, for General Neuilly, having paſſed the greater Gette at Dummen, had opportunely arrived in this quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, with his diviſion to take the poſition of Neerhelyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen. The engagement did not finiſh till four o'clock in the afternoon, when the Imperialiſts were in full retreat. It laſted at leaſt eight hours between the advanced guards of the Imperialiſts and the French, which were nearly of equal force, and were both of them ſupported by the main bodies of their reſpective armies. The loſs of the Imperialiſts was much greater than that of the French. The advantage remained with the latter, but they were on the point of loſing their general at the attack of Gotz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enhoven.</p>
                     <p>This engagement, which coſt the Imperialiſts mere than 1200 men, entirely reſtored the courage of the French troops. Dumourier formed his army into two diviſions, extending from Gotzenhoven to the high road, among the villages, which had been the field of battle. — General Neuilly, ſtationed near Neerhelyſſen ſupported the right. General Dampierre, having arrived on the evening of the engagement, was poſted at Eſemael, in front of the centre. General Miaczinſky arriving with his cavalry (his infantry conſiſting of eight battalions being left near Louvain, was poſted at the bridge of the leſſer Gette, oppoſite to Orſmael. A part of the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of General Miranda remained behind the great Gette, to the left of Tirlemont, extending to Oplinter; at which laſt place General Champmorin arrived with his troops during the night.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="189" facs="unknown:026918_0183_0FD22EE5E3EBE088"/>
After this firſt ſucceſs, Dumourier ſaw that it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to take a deciſive ſtep. Troops were continually on their march to reinforce the Imperialiſts, and the French army had very inconſiderable or no reinforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to expect. The Imperial cavalry was double the number of that of the French, and in every reſpect greatly ſuperior. It was impoſſible for the French to contend with a diſciplined army, for the poſſeſſion of the Netherlands, foot by foot; being in want of generals, incapable of executing prompt marches of bold impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant manoeuvres, in face of a numerous and experienced cavalry, and having behind them no ſtrong and fortified places.</p>
                     <p>There was, however, a neceſſity for ſtopping the progreſs of the enemy, which could not be done without hazarding a battle. Under theſe circumſtances ſound and true prudence called on Dumourier to riſk every thing, before the Prince of Cobourg ſhould have received the remainder of the reinforcements for which he waited to begin the campaign. The two armies were of equal force. That which ſhould attack would have the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in ſpirit and confidence, which always belong to the party beginning the attack. This advantage had, during fifteen days, been in the hands of the Prince of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg; but General Dumourier had regained it by the iſſue of the engagement of Tirlemont.</p>
                     <p>If General Dumourier ſhould have the good fortune to gain a deciſive battle and ſuch he reſolved this to be, his ſituation would be entirely changed: for firſt, it would reſtore him in the opinion of his army to his former ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority, and would intimidate the enemy; ſecondly, it would have ſecured the Belgians in his intereſt, and would have greatly forwarded the levies of twenty-five battalions which the nation had undertaken, and ſo would have ſtrengthened his army by the acquiſition of twenty thouſand infantry, at the leaſt; thirdly, he would have regained the ground loſt on the ſide of Liege, for the Auſtrians would not have been able to have held that city, nor even Aix-la-chapelle and would have been compelled to have intrenched themſelves under the protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Maeſtricht; and laſtly, it would have compelled the Prince of Cobourg to have repaſſed the Meuſe, and would have ſo greatly weakened his army, as to prevent his retaking the field before the month of May.</p>

General Valence would have been maſter of the country, and would have held the Prince of Cobourg in check, Miranda would have been poſted with an army at Antwerp, and General Dumourier ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing with 30,000 men, againſt Bois-le-duc, would have reſumed his project againſt Holland, and would at once have forced the paſſages of the Moor Dyke, and Gorcuin. But if he could not have penetrated into Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, he might at leaſt have made himſelf maſter of Dutch Flanders, by which means he would have cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his left, and would have procured arms, clothing, money, and proviſions.</p>
                     <p>In that caſe, he would have been independent of the National Convention, and probably might have been able to give it law, for the repoſe of his unhappy country, for the avenging of Lewis XVI. and for the re-eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Conſtitutional Monarchy.</p>
                     <p>On the contrary, ſhould the general be defeated, he deſigned, in the firſt place, to take a poſition behind the canal of Louvain, in order for a while to cover Bruſſels, and to reinforce his army; ſecondly, to maintain the poſition of Namur, raiſing the corps of General d'Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville to the amount of 25,000 men, and to place the diviſion of General Neuilly at Judoigne, to coves Dumourier's retreat by the foreſt of Soignies, for the purpoſe of ſupporting Bruſſels; thirdly, to aſſemble a body of 25,000 men near Antwerp, and, ſtill holding Breda and Ge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="191" facs="unknown:026918_0185_0FD261529A7DFF68"/>
would otherwiſe cauſe the entire ruin of France, and that on the army alone reſted the hopes and ſate of the Country. When the minds of the troops ſhould have been ſufficiently prepared, his next deſign was to rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the army with battalions of Belgians, who held the Convention and Jacobins in abhorrence, to declare open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in favour of a limited Monarchy, to lay hold of hoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges for the ſecurity of the priſoners in the Temple, and to march to Paris.</p>
                     <p>Theſe were General Dumourier's objects previous to the battle of Nerwinde, and it will be ſeen how urgent his motives were for riſking a deciſive battle, and for uſing every effort to gain the victory. He never had the baſeneſs to wiſh to be beaten. He earneſtly ſtrove to maſter events. Although he held the Tyrants of France in deteſtation, although he viewed with horror the cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that diſhonored France, he was not the leſs ſolicitous to maintain the honor of his country, and to prove him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf worthy of her confidence. In every caſe, and in every moment till the laſt, the end of his meaſures was to prevent a foe from giving law to France, and to ſave his country from inſult or injury, and it is this which has drawn upon him the ill founded reproach, from miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>informed perſons, and in particular from the Elector of Cologne, of having changed his party only when he was vanquiſhed.</p>
                     <p>Had he not previous to the loſs of the battle of Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winde openly declared his hoſtility to the Jacobins by his proclamations at Antwerp and Bruſſels? Had he not impriſoned or driven out of the country the rapacious agents of the Convention? Had he not written his letter of the 12th of March? Had he not compelled the ſilver of the churches to be reſtored? Had not his correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with Pache, Bournonville and Le Brun, (which was printed and which appeared alſo in the Monitors of March and April) declared the firmeſt truths and the freeſt opinions, reſpecting the authors of the miſeries of France. If in thoſe he did not ſpeak of the royal family, it was that he feared his mention of them would become a ſignal for their death.</p>
                     <p>He who reads theſe Memoirs, and calls to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance the circumſtances and the public documents of thoſe times, will ſee that the opinions of General Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourier have been conſiſtent. He has been the zealous defender of his country. Her enemies have been his

enemies, but the war he has made upon them has been open and generous; for his love of his country was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fanatical, unjuſt, nor ſavage. The Emigrants, by whom he is deteſted as greatly as by the Jacobins, have, on all occaſions, found him humane and liberal. In a war, differing from all others in character, a war of opinion, in which inſtability of principles and conduct might find excuſe, he has no ſhifting of opinion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to reproach himſelf, no perfidy, no cruelty, no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence in ſucceſs, nor weakneſs in misfortune and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace. In a word, moved only by humanity, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored the Netherlands to the Emperor, as was acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by the Archduke Charles, by the Emperor's Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and Generals, by his army, and by the people of the country. Nor did he make conditions or reſerves for himſelf. He did not demand an aſylum in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's dominions. He demanded nothing of the Prince of Cobourg but his marching to Paris, with the object, and in the hope, of delivering his country.</p>

                     <p>THE Prince of Cobourg advanced between Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gres, St. Tron, and Landen; and the two armies were in ſight of each other. General Dumourier paſſed the day of the 17th in reconnoi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ring the poſition of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, in forming his troops in order of battle, and in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring his plan of attack. He had, in his front, the Leſſer Gette, which riſes in the townſhip of Jaudrain, and runs almoſt parallel with the greater Gette, into
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:026918_0187_0FD2615430497728"/>
which it falls below Leaw. This river ran between the two armies. Both ſides of the river were extremely hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and the ground, on the ſide occupied by the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialiſts, formed an amphitheatre riſing from the river to the more elevated ſituations of Landen and St. Tron.</p>
                     <p>Dumourier judged that the poſition of the Prince of Cobourg was by much the ſtrongeſt on the ſide of Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gres and St. Tron; becauſe of the neceſſaty of his draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his proviſions from Maeſtricht and Liege; and that conſequently his left, which was conſiderably extended on the ſide of Landen, muſt be more weak, and more liable to be turned, or broken.</p>
                     <p>Dumourier knew alſo, that the Prince of Cobourg had neglected to occupy the little city of Leaw, which was a very important poſt, and which might either ſerve as a centre to the motions of the army making the attack, or a point of reſiſtance for the army that ſhould be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked.</p>
                     <p>In the front of that part of the enemy's line, which extended from Landen towards Leaw, were the three villages of Oberwinde, Middlewinde, and Nerwinde.— Near Middlewinde was an eminence, called the Tomb of Middlewinde, which commanded the three villages, and a valley which ſeparates them from the city of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. He, therefore, who ſhould occupy this place, muſt be maſter of all the plain, and muſt neceſſarily, in caſe of an attack, repulſe his enemy.</p>
                     <p>On theſe facts, Dumourier laid down his plan for the battle, which was as follows: The firſt column, form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the right flank of the army, compoſed of the advanced guard, under General la Marche, proceeding by the bridge of Neerhellyſlen, was to enter the plain between Landen and Oberwinde; and to extend itſelf beyond the left of the enemy, in order to harraſs that flank. The ſecond column, compoſed of the infantry of the army of the Ardennes, commanded by Lieutenant-general le Veneur, and ſupported by a ſtrong body of cavalry, entering the plain by the ſame bridge, was to gain the Tomb of Middlewinde by a rapid movement, and to attack the village of Oberwinde, which could not withſtand a diſcharge of 12 pounders that were to be planted on the Tomb. And while this attack ſhould take place, the third column under the command of General Neuilly, entering the plain alſo by the ſame bridg, waes to fall on the right of the village of Nerwinde.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="194" facs="unknown:026918_0188_0FD2611EEBA63D78"/>
Theſe three columns formed the right wing of the army, commanded by General Valence, who, in caſe of ſucceſs, wheeling to the left, and driving the left wing of the enemy before him, was to continue his march in order of battle, leaving Landen behind him, and having his front facing St. Tron.</p>
                     <p>The centre, commanded by the Duke de Chartres, was compoſed of two columns. The firſt, (which was the fourth column in the order of attack) commanded by lieutenant-general Dietman, paſſing the river by the bridge of Laer, and rapidly croſſing the village of the ſame name, which was only occupied by a few indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent troops belonging to the Imperialiſts, was to preſs forward, and fall directly upon the front of the village of Nerwinde. The fifth column, commanded by Gen. Dampierre, was to paſs by the bridge of Eſemael, and to attack the left of Nerwinde. Theſe two columns were afterward to follow the right wing, forming a dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonal line with the point of their departure.</p>
                     <p>The left wing, under the command of General Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randa, was compoſed of three columns. The firſt (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſixth in the order of attack) under General Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aczinſky, paſſing the river at Over-helpen, was to charge ſtraight forward proceeding toward Neerlanden, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing careful never to preſs beyond the head of the fifth column. The ſeventh column, under General Rualt, was to paſs the river at the bridge of Orſmael, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the enemy by the high road of St. Tron. The eighth column, under Gen. Champmorin, was to paſs the river below Neerlinter, at the bridge of Bingen, and to throw itſelf into the Leaw, which it was to occupy till the end of the battle.</p>
                     <p>In caſe of complete ſucceſs, the army at the end of the action would be ranged in order of battle, with the left wing at Leaw, and the right at St. Tron, and having its front toward Tongres: which was the only point by which the Imperialiſts could retreat. And batteries were erected on the banks of the Gette, within reach of the bridges, to protect the retreat of the columns, in caſe of their being repulſed.</p>
                     <p>On the morning of the 18th of March, between ſeven and eight o'clock, the ſeveral columns began to move in the ſame inſtant, in great order, and paſſed the river without obſtacle. General la Marche committed the firſt error of that day. He entered the plain of Landen ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:026918_0189_0FD26155AFD12A48"/>
to his inſtructions, but finding no enemy there, he made a movement: to the left, to fall upon the village of Oberwinde, and thence was thrown into confuſion by the ſecond column. Although the troops of the ſecond column were retarded in their march by their artillery, yet they attacked the village of Oberwinde, and the Tomb of Midldewinde, with ſuch vigour, that by ten o'clock they had carried thoſe paſts.—But General le Veneur did not take ſufficient precautions to ſtrengthen himſelf in the latter poſt.—It was ſoon after re-taken by the Auſtrians, and the poſſeſſion it diſputed the whole day. General Neuilly briſkly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered Nerwinde with the third column, and drove out the Imperialiſts; but, almoſt immediately abandoning the village, he advanced into the plain toward the ſecond column. General Neuilly aſſerted, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived an order to that effect from General Valence, who on his ſide declared, it was a miſunderſtanding of Gen. Neuilly.</p>
                     <p>In a ſhort time, the Imperialiſts re-entered Nerwinde; from which they were again driven, by the fourth and fifth columns, under the command of the Duke de Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres. In this attack General Desforets, an excellent of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, received a wound in the head with a muſquet-ball. This part of the army fell into confuſion. The infantry crowded in too great numbers into the village, and were in ſuch complete diſorder, that on the appearance of a ſecond attack from the enemy they abandoned the place.</p>
                     <p>General Dumourier arriving in this moment, cauſed the village to be once more attacked. It was again car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried; but the troops preſently quitted the village again, and all the efforts of Gen. Dumourier prevailed no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to rally them at a hundred paces from Nerwinde, which was filled with the dead and wounded of the two parties. But the Imperialiſts did not re-enter the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage until the evening.</p>
                     <p>It was during the diſorder in this quarter, that the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial cavalry ruſhing into the plain between Nerwinde, and Middlewinde, charged the French cavalry; at the head of which was General Valence, who fought with great intrepidity, was wounded, and obliged to retire from the field of battle to Tirlemont. The Imperial horſe were, however, repulſed with great ſlaughter.</p>
                     <p>While the horſe were thus engaged, another body of cavalry entered the plain on the left of Nerwinde, and
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:026918_0190_0FD2612090CD7F98"/>
threw themſelves with great fury upon the infantry of the fourth column. General Thouvenot, who was at the head of that column, opened his ranks to the Imperial horſe, and immediately cauſed the regiment of Deux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponts to make ſo timely and well-directed a diſcharge of grape-ſhot and muſquetry upon that body of horſe, that almoſt the whole of it was deſtroyed.</p>
                     <p>From that inſtant, the fate of the battle ſeemed deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in favour of the French, on their right and in the centre. The troops were again in perfect order, were full of confidence and courage, and paſſed the night on the field of battle, preparing to complete their victory the following: morning. The Imperialiſts have acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that they were on the point of retreating, and that orders had been actually given to their baggage to retire to Tongres.</p>
                     <p>But it was quite otherwiſe with the French troops on the left. The ſixth and ſeventh columns had attacked the enemy with great vigour; but, when they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready maſters of Orſmael, a panic ſeized upon the batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of Volunteers, and they fled, leaving the troops of the line expoſed. The Imperialiſts, ſeeing the diſorder, charged the two columns with their horſe, which put it entirely to the rout. Guiſcard, Major-general of the artillery, was killed, as well as great numbers of the Aids-de-camp and officers of the ſtaff; and General Ruault and General Ihler were wounded.</p>
                     <p>Still, however, great opportunity remained of reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fortune of the day in that quarter. It was not more than two o'clock in the afternoon, when the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns fled. They repaſſed the bridge of Orſmael, and were not purſued further by the Imperialiſts. At that moment, General Miranda was informed, that the eight battalions of Miaczinſky's corps were arrived at Tirle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Theſe troops were quite freſh, and General Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randa might have reinforced himſelf, by placing them on the heights of Wommerſem, on the ſide of the Gette next Tirlemont. But General Miranda, either being diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed, or, which is more probable, ſeeing the ſucceſs of the right wing, commanded by his rival General Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, he yielded to his reſentment, and reſolving to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice him, ordered his troops to retrea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>; and retired be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind Tirlemont, at more than two leagues diſtance from the field of battle. Whatever be the caſe, his conduct was perfidious in ſending no advice of his retreat to Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:026918_0191_0FD26157488DA2E0"/>
Dumourier, which expoſed the right and centre of the army to the whole weight of the enemy. But the enemy did not avail themſelves of this cowardly retreat; either to cut off the left wing, which they might have compleatly done by continuing the purſuit to Tirlemont, or to renew the attack upon the centre and the right, whoſe flank was entirely expoſed to them.</p>
                     <p>General Champmorin, who had made himſelf maſter of Leaw, and had remained in that poſition, till he ſaw the retreat of General Miranda, did not abandon it till late in the day, when he repaſſed the river by the bridge of Bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen, which he cut down after him, and returned to his former poſition of Oplinter. And, perhaps, it was owing to the poſſeſſion of this poſt at Leaw, that the Imperialiſts did not purſue their advantage againſt the left wing of the French, on the retreat of Miranda; ſince, in that caſe, General Champmorin might have taken their right in flank.</p>
                     <p>General Dumourier paſſed the whole time of action in regarding the movements of his centre and right wing, in re-eſtabliſhing order in the different parts that gave way, and enſuring ſucceſs in that quarter, which was the more eſſential, as it was charged with the whole weight of the manoeuvres. At two in the afternoon, he obſerved that the firing on his left, which till then had been very briſk, had ceaſed; but he attributed this ſilence to ſucceſs.— The nature of the ground prevented his ſeeing the ſixth and ſeventh columns; and, during the firing of theſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns, he could perceive they were advancing forward. He had, therefore, reaſon to ſuppoſe that, the enemy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing driven in that quarter, had halted, that they might not over-run the head of the columns on their right. But no circumſtances could lead him to conjecture the incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble retreat of General Miranda: and he was, perhaps, happy in being ignorant of it, while he was repairing the diſorders of his right and centre.</p>
                     <p>Towards the cloſe of the day, he obſerved, that ſeveral columns of the Imperialiſts moved from their right to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforce their left, which led him to ſuſpect the truth; but, it was as yet only ſuſpicion, having received no meſſage from General Miranda. In this ſituation, he paſſed the greater part of the evening before the village of Nerwinde. At length, his ſuſpicions, which he had communicated to no other perſon than General Thouvenot, were ſucceeded
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:026918_0192_0FD26121E79529D8"/>
by the livelieſt inquietude. He departed for his left, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by General Thouvenot, two aids-de-camp, and two domeſtics. Arriving at the village of Laer, at ten at night, he was utterly aſtoniſhed to find that it had been abanded by order of General Dampierre, who after conducting himſelf with great valour during the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, had in the cloſe of the evening without orders re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed the Gette with his diviſion, and retired to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer poſition at the village of Eſemael.</p>
                     <p>General Dumourier, continuing his route, arrived near the bridge of Orſmael, which he ſuppoſed to be occupied by Miranda's troops, but found it was in the poſſeſſion of the Auſtrian Hulans, by whom he was on the point of being taken. He turned back; and proceeded, by the high road of Tongres, and Tirlemont: aſtoniſhed with the ſilence and ſolitude that reigned around him, till he arrived within half a league of that city. He then learnt from three or four battalions, that were ſcattered in diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, without cavalry, along the ſide of the high road, the diſaſter and diſgrace of his left wing.</p>
                     <p>In Tirlemont, he found General Miranda writing to his friends with great compoſure. General Valence had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready uſed every effort to induce Miranda to return to the attack, aſſuring him that the French were victorious on their right, and in the centre; and that, by his return, ſucceſs would be altogether inſured. General Dumourier commanded him, in very ſevere terms, to aſſemble his troops immediately, even during the night, and to poſt them on the heights of Wommerſem, on the high road, and on the bridge of Orſmael, as well as that of Neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>helpen, for the purpoſe of, at leaſt, ſecuring the paſſage of the Gette, and the retreat of the right and centre, now in the midſt of the enemy's army, with a river behind them.</p>
                     <p>Such was the ſate of the battle of Nerwinde; which had been entirely ſucceſsful on the part of the French, if Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Miranda, inſtead of retreating, on perceiving the firſt diſorder in his two columns, had lined the Gette with his troops, and had maintained the two bridges of Orſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael and Neerhelpen. This retreat was the more unſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, as the two columns loſt above two thouſand men, white the reſt of the army did not loſe more than ſix hundred men. The French had about three thouſand killed or taken, and more than a thouſand wounded, and loſt great part of their cannon.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="199" facs="unknown:026918_0193_0FD26158DAFBFD50"/>
In this engagement faults were committed on both ſides. The French did not attack the town of Middlewinde, which was the deciſive point of the action, with ſufficient vigour, and afterward abandoned that poſt without any vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible neceſſity. General Neuilly, after the firſt ſucceſs, put every thing to hazard, by abandoning the village of Nerwinde, on an uncertain order. Miranda, having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready made himſelf maſter of the village of Orſmael, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the fate of the day, by yielding to the terror of his troops, and commanding a retreat that became an abſolute flight.</p>
                     <p>The Imperialiſts committed ſeveral errors: in not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting the paſſage of the Gette; in not falling upon the three columns of the right, both in front and in flank, while they were marching forward to the attack, and were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the fire of the villages of Laer, of Nerwinde, Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlewinde, and Oberwinde; in abandoning the elevated and advantageous poſt of the tomb of Middlewinde, and in not erecting a battery on it previous to the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; in neglecting to occupy Leaw, on their right; and, finally, in not having availed themſelves of Miran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da's retreat, either in falling upon his troops, or attacking the left flank of the columns belonging to the centre of the French army, that were in the heat of the action be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Nerwinde, by the whole of their right wing which no longer had an enemy in front of theirs.</p>

                     <p>GENERAL DUMOURIER now ſaw the neceſſity of ſecuring his retreat. The poſt of Leaw, on which the poſſeſſion of the field of battle depended, was abandoned by his troops; and, in the diſmay which had ſeized upon the other two columns of his left wing, the moſt he could hope was to lead them back to the banks of the Leſſer Gette; to induce them to paſs the river, and to return to the field of battle, was impoſſible. Theſe two columns had loſt part of their cannon in the flight; the Generals, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:026918_0194_0FD261239FFF2980"/>
officers of theſe troops, were in no condition to undergo a freſh combat; and, independent of the real loſs of theſe columns by the ſword of the enemy, more than 6000 men had deſerted, and were on the road to Bruſſels and France.</p>
                     <p>Dumourier paſſed the remainder of the night in giving orders for the retreat of his centre, and right wing, which was then commanded by the Duke de Chartres, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted himſelf with coolneſs, courage, and judgment.</p>
                     <p>The Imperialiſts had in truth gained a great victory, but they were not certain of their ſituation. They had been ſo diſconcerted with the important advantages gained by the right and centre of the French army, that they made no attempt to purſue their advantage over the left. They ſaw the French ſtill in order of battle and ready to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence the action, and they really imagined that the leſt wing of the French was about to return to its former po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. Hence they threw no more obſtacles on the French in their retreat, than the day before on their advancing to the attack.</p>
                     <p>This retreat was effected in open day-light, the columns repaſſing the river in the order in which they advanced, and altogether with the ſame ſteadineſs. Dumourier ſent General Thouvenot to the right, to receive the columns, and place them in the order of battle from Gotzhenhoven to Hackendower, while he took upon himſelf to aſſemble the columns of the left wing, and to poſt them on the heights of Wommerſem, and at the bridge of Orſmael. The enemy's troops were already maſter of this bridge; and Dumourier, to prevent their advancing further on the cauſeway, ſent orders to General Dampierre, poſted at Eſemael, to make a movement to the left with half of his diviſion, for the purpoſe of flanking the cauſeway, and to maintain that poſition till the centre ſhould have repaſſed the river, and then to retreat ſlowly to the new poſition that the troops were taking, with their right at Gotzenhoven, their left at Hackendower, and having the Leſſer Gette in their front.</p>
                     <p>This order, completely executed by General Dampierre, preſerved the army from deſtruction; for the two columns that had fled had acquired ſuch apathy from the ſhame of the preceding day, and were ſo ſcattered, that it was ten in the morning before Dumourier could form them, ſo as to march with good order to take poſt at Hackendower, on the right and left of the high road.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="201" facs="unknown:026918_0195_0FD2615B0873E508"/>
The first column of the Imperial army had paſſed the bridge of Orſmael, and had already formed with its artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery in the heights of Wommerſem. But Dumourier could never prevail on his troops to attack that poſt, which commanded the ground on which they had formed, altho they were extremely harraſſed by the artillery on thoſe heights, and ſuſtained this inceſſant firing with unſhaken conſtancy.</p>
                     <p>On this occaſion Dumourier had nearly fallen. His horſe was killed under him by a cannon ball. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs with which he recovered from this ſituation was the means of preventing new diſorder, and probably a ſecond flight which this circumſtance was on the point of occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioning.</p>
                     <p>The troops, which in the action of the preceding day, had fled with ſuch precipitation, now endured the terrible diſcharge of the Imperialiſts, with great intrepidity. But in this conduct General Dumourier perceived nothing more than a blind obſtinacy, altogether deſtitute of the daring courage that he wiſhed to excite in them. He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted them to charge with bayonets the enemy on the heights of Wommerſem, and ſeveral times he put himſelf at their head, without being able to make them advance; too happy, indeed in ſeeing them continue firm in their poſition, which was imminently more dangerous than a vigorous attack on thoſe troops, who being ſeparated from the reſt of the Imperial army, and having the river in their rear, might have been totally overthrown.</p>
                     <p>The left wing of the Imperialiſts betrayed the ſame diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, occaſioned by the ſame cauſe, as that of the French. Theſe troops ſuffered the right and centre of the French to repaſs the river without moleſtation, and even to range themſelves in order of battle in the poſition of Gotzenhoven, before they could reſolve to paſs the river in order to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack them. Thus, the whole day paſſed on both ſides in manocuvring, with the exception of ſome canonnading and diſcharge of muſquets, The two armies reſted on their arms, in order of battle, the whole night, very near to each other.</p>
                     <p>This cool and ſteady retreat was the more admired by the Imperialiſts, becauſe the troops did not fall back more than three quarters of a league, and ſeemed only to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning in great order to the ground they occupied before the battle. During the evening of the 10th, however, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Dumourier perceived by the epathy which pervaded his troops, that, ſhould he make a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

There has been no period when the French ſoldiery could be conducted ſucceſsfully without great regard being paid to their temper and their feelings; and the importance of this circumſtance in conducting them to battle, has been eminently heightened by the revolution, which, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing entirely deſtroyed military diſcipline, has increaſed the force of the intractable and capricious ſpirit belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the national character. The active and impetuous diſpoſition of the French is calculated to carry them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to coqueſt, and not to preſerve conqueſts. A de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive and methodical war does not diminiſh their bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, but it wearies and contradicts their impatient ſpirit, When once wearies and diſpirited, the French troops be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no longer reſtrained by the ſeverity of military laws, abandon their leaders and their colours, and deſert with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt thought of the conſequences.</p>
                     <p>The troops of the line, ſtill influenced by a remnant of their former military ſpirit, an attachment to their colours, and the fear of diſgrace, continued firm, and were yet to be relied on by the General; but the national-guards, compoſing three-fourths of the army, declaring loudly that it was fruitleſs to laviſh their lives in Belgium, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nd that they ought to return and defend their own frontiers, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted by whole companies and battalions. To have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to retain them by force would have been ineffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, as well as dangerous.</p>
                     <p>No courſe was now left to Dumourier but to retreat with the troops, in good order, for the purpoſe of concealing their defections, and to prevent their being maſſacred by the Imperialiſts and the peaſants of the country. In this ſad condition the General was conſtrained to paſs the Greater Getto during the night, and to retire to the heights of Cumptich, behind Tirlemont. All his movements for this purpoſe, being performed with a preciſion that ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly could have been expected from more diſciplined, and even victorious troops, were attended with the greateſt ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. The Imperialiſts, deceived by the fires that were carefully kept up, and reſtrained by the vigour of the rear guard, did not put themſelves in motion till the 20th, when they reconnoitred Tirlemont, from which the French had had time to withdraw their magazines. However, General Miaczinſky, who was charged with the evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that city, loſt one of his cannon by the precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his retreat.</p>

                     <p>DUMOURIER's poſition at Cumptich had the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of being conſiderably elevated above the Gette. In this camp his front faced Tirlemont; his left was ſecured by the river Welpe, which turning ſhort ran upon his rear, by Bauterſem and Wertryk; his right, poſted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind Hougaerde, was not ſo well defended. The Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, however, could not maintain himſelf long in this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, nor was it any protection to Louvain if the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialiſts ſhould paſs by Dieſt; nor to Bruſſels if they ſhould turn by Judoigne. He therefore availed himſelf of the 20th of March, while the enemy were before Tirlemont, to paſs the Welpe, and encamp near Bauterſem, having his right at Op and Neerwelpe, and his left on the heights and in the woods in front of Zuellenberg.</p>
                     <p>He ſent General Neuilly, with his diviſion increaſed to 6000 men, toward Judoigne, with orders to prevent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachments of the Imperialiſts from penetrating on that ſide, to watch their motions, and, if they ſhould appear with a force greatly ſuperior, to fall back to Bruſſels by the foreſt of Soignies. Dumourier gave General Neuilly inſtructions reſpecting the means of defending this foreſt, and wrote to General Duval, to reinforce Neuilly with as many men as he could ſpare from the garriſon of Bruſſels, and the new levies which might arrive there. He alſo ordered General Duval to arreſt the deſerters and ſend them back to his army.</p>
                     <p>He commanded General d'Harville to place a garriſon of 2,500 men in the citadel of Namur, and to hold himſelf in readineſs to march with the remainder of his troops, either toward Bruſſels, or in ſuch other direction as ſhould be neceſſary by the motions of General Beaulieu, who was advancing with 8000 or 10,000 men by the route of Huy</p>

Dumourier threw into Dieſt a garriſon, which appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him to be ſufficient; General Champmorin having inaccurately reported this place to be ſtronger than in fact it was. He poſted General Miaczinſky at the abbey of Gemps, in communication with Dieſt.

He recommended to General Ruault to hold the poſt of Riers as long as it was poſſible, and to fall back within the lines of Antwerp, if the Pruſſians and Dutch ſhould advance upon him in too great force.</p>
                     <p>On ths ſame day, on the 20th of March, a detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the enemy without cannon, and inferior in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to the garriſon of Dieſt, appearing before that place, the garriſon fled in a cowardly manner as far as Malines. But the advanced guard of the Imperialiſts making an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack upon the villages of Op and Neerwelpe was repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
                     <p>While Dumourier was engaged in repulſing this attack, the commiſſioners of the Convention, La Croix and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, arrived in his camp, but he ſent them to Louvain, where he followed them on the evening of that day. They appeared extremely affected with the recent defeat of the army, but in a ſtill greater degree with the deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the troops; having met at Bruſſels and in various parts of their route, entire corps returning to France. But, whatever was their concern on theſe ſubjects, their minds were much more engaged, as they ſaid, in the execution of the commiſſion with which they were charged: to prevail on the general to retract his letter of the 12th of March; which, by its too great frankneſs, had ſtirred up the bittereſt reſentment of the convention againſt him.</p>
                     <p>Dumourier anſwered that he had expreſſed no more in his letter than his real ſentiments; that the diſaſters to whichthey were witneſs were the neceſſary conſequence of the evils of which he had complained; that he ſought only to remedy thoſe evils by putting an end to the tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and injuſtice exerciſed in Belgium; that the neceſſity which they muſt perceive of his retiring from a country in which he had no means of defence ought to convince them of the prudent tenor of his proclamations, againſt which, the convention were prejudiced, only becauſe they were miſinformed and betrayed; that thoſe proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

had induced the peaſants of Belgium to lay down their arms, and had reſtored a degree of confidence between the French and Belgians, and were, herefore, the means of ſaving the troops, who diſorganized, beaten, diſguſted and diſpirited, were altogether incapable of defending themſelves againſt the Imperialiſts, more numerous than themſelves and fluſhed with victory, and at the ſame time againſt the people of the country, ſhould the reſentment of the latter be again excited.</p>
                     <p>The commiſſioners were conſtrained to acknowledge the juſtice of theſe repreſentations; but ſtill continued to inſiſt on the general's retracting his letter. The gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, after reviewing before them all the ſubjects of his complaints, and ſetting forth in the ſtrongeſt manner, the misfortunes that were on the eve of reſulting from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe and unjuſt conduct of the convention, made a poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive declaration to the commiſſioners that he would in no part retract his letter, ſince the loſs or the gain of a battle could not effect any change in his principles, opinions or character. The Commiſſioners conducted this conference with much addreſs and energy, and endeavoured to win Dumourier by the moſt flattering conſiderations. At length, after a very long conteſt, the general conſented to write a few lines to the preſident of the convention, in which he requeſted, <hi>that the convention would poſtpone their judgement on his letter of the 12th of March, till he ſhould have an opportunity of ſending them an explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the reaſons of that letter.</hi> The two deputies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted with this unimportant declaration.</p>
                     <p>On the 21, the general being informed of the loſs of Dieſt, reſolved to take a poſition nearer Louvain, leſt the enemy, paſſing the canal; ſhould cut off his communication with Malines, or fall upon Louvain itſelf. He poſted the diviſion of General Champmorin on the heights of Pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenberg, flanking his leſt by that of Miaczinſky, poſted at St. Peterſroede: General La Marche with the advanced guard on the heights of Corbec, ſkirting tHe high road: eighteen battalions of the army of the Ardennes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by General Le Veneur, on the heights, and in the woods of Mezendael: and the diviſion of General Dampierre at Florival, in communication with General Neuilly's diviſion, which ſell back toward Tombeck, at the entrance of the foreſt of Soignies.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="206" facs="unknown:026918_0199_0FD2615CF75FB090"/>
During theſe movements, the troops were harraſſed by the Imperialiſts, who cannonaded them the whole day. On the morning of the 22d, the enemy made a general attack on the poſts of Pellenberg, Corbec and the woods of Mazendael. Blierbeck was between the enemy and General Le Veneur, and he had thought proper to occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py it. A column of Hungarian grenadiers made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves maſters of this village but were driven out with great ſlaughter, and with the loſs of two pieces of cannon, by the regiment of Auvergne, commanded by Colonel Dumas. The attack on the advanced guard was leſs vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous, but that on the poſt of Pellenberg was extremely bloody, General Champmorin defending himſelf with equal courage and ability. He received a ſtrong rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement during the attack, and the enemy were unable to make any impreſſion on his lines. This action was extremely hot, and laſted the whole day. The Auſtrian columns ſuffered great loſs, and were compelled to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire.</p>
                     <p>On the evening preceding this brilliant action, General Dumourier had occaſion to ſend Colonel Montjoye to the head-quarters of the Prince of Cobourg, to treat reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the wounded and the priſoners. He then ſaw Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel Mack, an officer of uncommon merit, who obſerved to Colonel Montjoye, that it might be equally advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to both pairties to agree to a ſuſpenſion of arms. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourier, who had deeply conſidered the dangerous ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his army, ſent Montjoye again to Colonel Mack on the 22d, to demand if he would come to Lovain, and make the ſame propoſition to Dumourier. Colonel Mack came in the evening. The following articles were ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bally agreed to; Firſt, that the Imperialiſts ſhould not again attack the French army in great force, nor Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Dumourier again offer battle to the Imperialiſts. Secondly, that on the faith of this tacit armiſtice, the French ſhould retire to Bruſſels ſlowly and in good order, without any oppoſition from the enemy. And laſtly that Dumourier and Colonel Mack ſhould have another inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view after the evacuation of Bruſſels, in order to ſettle fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther articles that might then be mutually deemed ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</p>
                     <p>This ſtipulation, the firſt that was entered into between the two generals, became hourly of more importance to Dumourier. His army was greatly diminiſhed, eſpecially in officers. He had ſcarcely ammunition for a battle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and unfortunately, he was well perſuaded that, in caſe of a ſerious attack, he ſhould be abandoned by his army.</p>
                     <p>He had ſufficient proof of this on the following day. The Imperialiſts thought themſelves ſo little bound by the articles agreed to by Colonel Mack, that General Clairfait (who was ignorant of theſe articles) fell upon the advanced guard and the troops poſted at Pellenberg. The action became general along the whole front of the army. Champmorin defended himſelf with the ſame obſtinacy as before; but toward the cloſe of the action, when the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial infantry were actually retiring, and there was no longer any enemy before the army, excepting ſome light troops, old General La Marche became ſuddenly terrified; and, notwithſtanding the intreaties of Montjoye, De Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rois, and other officers of diſtinction, he retired in great confuſion, firſt to the abbey of Dupar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, and afterwards to the other ſide of the river Dyle, behind Louvain.</p>
                     <p>The Imperialiſts, who acknowledged a loſs of 700 men, (that is to ſay 2000 in both actions) were ſo much diſcouraged that they took no advantage of this cowardly retreat, which left a very dangerous interval between Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Le Veneur and General Champmorin.</p>
                     <p>General Le Veneur had fought with great vigour du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the whole of the action, but, ſeeing himſelf aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned by La Marche, he alſo paſſed the Dyle, without waiting for any orders, and poſted himſelf between Coor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beeck and Heverle.</p>
                     <p>After the defection of theſe two diviſions, Dumourier was compelled to order General Champmorin to abandon Pellenberg, and to retreat alſo behind Louvain, paſſing through the city, and by the abbey of Vlierbecke.</p>
                     <p>General Miaczinſky retired by a bridge on the high roa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> of Dieſt, being protected by a battery of cannon placed on the heights above.</p>
                     <p>Dumourier availed himſelf of theſe two days, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move his wounded, and the flour for his army, in boats, to Malines. Other articles belonging to the troops were thrown into the river; but the confuſion attending the evacuation of Louvain, and the avarice of individuals, cauſed a great quantity of theſe articles to fall into the hands of the enemy, who entered Louvain that very evening, as the general retired with the garriſon, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of five battalions, which formed his rear guard.— The Imperialiſts alſo took ſome boats laden with wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:026918_0201_0FD2615E67B20C60"/>
which the eſcort abandoned on ſight of a few huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars. Theſe wounded ſoldiers were treated with great humanity, notwithſtanding the atrocious calumnies of the Jacobins, ſpread with a deſign of irritating the French troops, and of inſtigating them to make war without quarter, and with greater barbarity.</p>
                     <p>The diſgraceful retreat of the French from Louvain, is among the inſtances that prove how delicate and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous is the ſituation of the generals commanding the French armies. Having determined on their plan of attack or defence, and having given orders for its exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, they will be continually ſubject to defeat and ruin, if they have not other plans in reſerve to ſtand in the place of orders ill executed or diſobeyed: they can have no reliance on the generals under their command, who are frequently the firſt to give the example of diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and ſometimes of cowardice: they can never depend for a moment on the real ſtrength or poſition of the corps that are not in their ſight, ſince officers, as well as men, deſert or change their poſition at pleaſure: they have no means of remedying theſe ills, ſince they dare not puniſh, being certain of making moſt dangerous ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of thoſe whoſe faults they do but reprove: they are ever in danger of wanting even food for their troops, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ancient ſyſtem of providing neceſſaries for the army has been changed, to ſerve the purpoſes of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and ſelfiſh men: and, they will ſeldom dare to haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard the great movements that decide the fate of war, with ſoldiers, who, though preſumptuouſly brave, are deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of good officers, are ill armed, inexperienced, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily diſcouraged, mutinous, fond of reaſoning, and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether let looſe from military law.</p>
                     <p>But, if a General be notwithſtanding ſucceſsful, the calumnies of the Journals and Clubs await him, and he is ſure of being accuſed before the ſuſpicious, blind, and imprudent Convention. If he be unfortunate, the whole weight of reſponſibility is thrown upon him, and he is branded with the name of coward or traitor.</p>
                     <p>Such is the ſituation in which the Republic of France places her generals in a war, on which depends, not only the political exiſtence of the nation, but the indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual liberty of every citizen. Dumourier has been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed by Dampierre, who had the good fortune to be killed in battle; Dampierre by Cuſtine, who periſhed on a ſcaffold; the latter by Houchard, who was diſgraced

                     <p>THE diſorder accompanying the retreat from Louvain utterly checked the energy the army had diſplayed in the two preceding combats. Happily, night concealed this univerſal defection of the troops from the enemy, who, notwithſtanding the verbal ſtipulations agreed to by Col. Mack, would probably have ſeized upon this opportunity to deſtroy or entirely diſperſe the French army.</p>
                     <p>Dumourier with great difficulty prevailed on the troops to halt on the heights of Coztenbergue, half way on the road to Bruſſels. And this new calamity induced him to make an entire change in the diſpoſition of the ſeveral corps under his command. He ſent an order to General Duval to prepare for the evacuation of Bruſſels. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved old General la Marche from the command of the
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:026918_0204_0FD2619DCE652670"/>
advanced guard, which he gave to General Vouille. He formed this advanced guard, which was now become the rear-guard, of a ſtrong body of the artillery, of all the cavalry of the army, and of twenty-five battalions, almoſt the whole of which were troops of the line. He himſelf took poſt in this rear guard, which amounted to near 15,000 men, and which indeed might be ſaid to be his army. The other part of the troops marched under the protection of this choſen body, which behaved in a manner worthy the importance of its ſtation.</p>
                     <p>Dumourier eſtabliſhed his camp under the walls of Bruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, by the ſide of the little river of Woluwe, having his right at San-peters-waluwe, and his left at Vilverde.— Having taken the precaution of tranſporting his park of artillery to Anderlecht, he ſent it off on the 23d to Tournay, by the road of Enghien and Ath, keeping only the cannon neceſſary for his rear guard.</p>
                     <p>The Prince of Cobourg, who was ignorant of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable condition of the French troops, no doubt deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf happy in the ſuſpenſion of arms, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured him poſſeſſion of the Netherlands, without further combat. But reſiſtance on the part of Dumourier could only have tended to lay waſte the country, without ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling him to keep his footing in it. —Since the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror Joſeph demoliſhed the ſtrong places of thoſe Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they are deſtitute of any point that can reſiſt an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading army; a battle gained gives the conqueror fifty leagues of country, or perhaps drives the vanquiſhed to the extreme frontier.</p>
                     <p>The engagements entered into by Colonel Mack were faithfully obſerved by the Prince of Cobourg, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained three days at Louvain, ſending only ſmall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachments to hang upon Dumourier's rear guard. The General was therefore at liberty to provide for the ſafety of Bruſſels, and of the other great cities through which the French army were compelled to paſs on their retreat. Juſtice and humanity demanded that the Belgians ſhould not be pillaged, and it was eſſential to avoid every means of irritating them. They had pardoned the exceſſes committed by the French, and had rendered them new ſervices, and it was a duty to avoid opening the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent wounds of the country, ſince in that caſe deſpair would have again driven them to arms, and the French, ſurrounded by the Auſtrians and Belgians, had been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely ſaCrificed.</p>

On the 25th, the army paſſed through Bruſſels, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the greateſt order and good conduct, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to Hall, from whence the General deſigned they ſhould march in two columns to the frontiers of France. No pillage was committed by the troops, nor were any inſults offered, or reproaches made on either part. The inhabitants of Bruſſels did not forget this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice rendered them by General Dumourier. They have expreſſed their remembrance of it by marks of public eſteem <note place="bottom">Dumourier will ever be loved and reſpected by the Belgians.

Dumourier reflects on the juſtice they have done him with pleaſure, and he would not have been proſcribed, and a fugitive, had he every where found equal juſtice.</p>
                     <p>The General's object now was to provide for the ſafety of the different detached forces, and to concert ſuch movements as that their retreat might keep pace with his.</p>
                     <p>While General Beaulieu was penetrating with ſeven or eight thouſand men by Huy, the Prince of Hohenloe was advancing by the province of Luxemburg againſt Namur, which was occupied by 15,000 men, under the command of General d'Harville. But this diviſion had been formed at the expence of the garriſons of Givet and Maubeuge; and the Prince of Hohenloe, turning by one of theſe places, might make himſelf maſter of it, and penetrate into France.</p>
                     <p>Dumourier commanded General d'Harville to leave 2,500 men with proviſions and ammunition in the citadel of Namur; and, dividing the remainder of his troops in two columns, to ſend one to Givet under the command of Lieutenant-general Bouchet, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire with the other toward Maubeuge; halting firſt at Charleroy, and afterward poſting himſelf on the heights of Niny above Mons. In this poſition General d'Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville would cover Maubeuge, la Queſnoy, Conde and Valenciennes; and, as he would then be reinforced at Mons with the diviſion of General Neuilly, conſiſting of 6000 men, his diviſion would be augmented to 12,000 men, beſide the reinforcements daily arriving.</p>
                     <p>In anſwer to theſe inſtructions, General d'Harville in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Dumourier, that he had neither proviſions, ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:026918_0206_0FD261A25B0DD7A0"/>
nor money ſufficient to provide for the citadel of Namur ſcarcely for fifteen days order; that he muſt either abandon the citadel or defend it with the whole of his diviſion; and demanded of General Dumourier de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate orders in what manner to conduct himſelf. With theſe diſpatches from General d'Harville, came alſo letters to the ſame effect from General Bouchot, and documents from the Commiſſary Barneville that juſtfied his ſtatements.</p>
                     <p>Dumourier had no need to deliberate upon the orders it was neceſſary to give General d'Harville. To leave this diviſion at Namur, was to riſk the loſs of Givet or Maubeuge, both in want of troops, and had either of them fallen into the hands of the enemy, the diviſion of Namur would have been eaſily ſurrounded; and to leave 2,500 men in the citadel, without money and ammunition, was in effect to deliver them to the Auſtrians. He therefore ordered General d'Harville entirely to evacuate Namur, and retire in good order to Givet and Maubeuge.</p>
                     <p>Dumourier conſidered the ſix battalions poſted in Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, and the three in Gertruydenberg, as loſt, yet their having proviſions for four or five months, and great ſtore of ammunition, would, he knew, enable them a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable time to ſtop the progreſs of the Pruſſians and Dutch. In order to keep open a communication with this divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his army, Dumourier ſaw it was neceſſary to ſecure the citadel of Antwerp, and commanded General Berne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron to poſt himſelf in that citadel with 2000 men, and ſix months ſtore of proviſions.</p>
                     <p>Dumourier appointed Lieutenant-general Omoran to the command at Dunkirk, and along the ſea-coaſt of the department of the North; and ordered him to repair the lines and ſorts of the intrenched camp between Dunkirk and Bergues; to form an intrenched camp on Mount Caſſel; to go in perſon to Courtray to take upon him the command of the army of Holland, and to poſt it in the camp of Haerlebecke, having the Scheldt in front.</p>
                     <p>He ſent orders to General Maraſſe and General Ruault, to make their retreat, paſſing the Scheldt by the extremity of Flanders through Ghent, to the camp of Courtray, or Haerlebecke, while the garriſon of Malines ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to the ſame place by Dendermonde along the Scheldt; being careful not to precipitate their retreat, and to cut down the bridges after them.</p>
                     <p>General Dumourier's deſign was, if he could have held the citadels of Namur and Antwerp, to have formed a
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:026918_0207_0FD261656ED866B0"/>
ſtrong line, without the territory of France, running from the right to the left by Namur, Mons, Tournay, Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray, Antwerp, Breda, and Gertruydenberg. In this ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation, if the ſuſpenſion of arms ſhould have continued, he hoped to have greater influence on the re-eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of order in France. In the caſe of the ſuſpenſion of arms being broken, the Imperialiſts finding themſelves in the centre of a ſemicircle, would be compelled to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence their attack at the two extremities to proceed with ſafety, which would turn the campaign into a war of ſieges on their part, carried on at the expence of their own ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory. Thus Dumourier would have gained time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>organiſe and reinforce his army: which, having the ſtrong places of France behind it, might have been reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to its former confidence.</p>
                     <p>On this ſuppoſition Dumourier would have occupied the city of Tournay, and the camp of Antoing; from which place if the enemy had been greatly ſuperior, he could have retired to a very ſtrong poſition in his former camp of Maulde.</p>
                     <p>In purſuit of this plan (which had undergone no other change, than that of the evacuation of the citadel of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur) he marched on the 26th to Enghien, and on the 27th to Ath, while the diviſion of General Neuilly marched to Mons by Hall and Braine.</p>
                     <p>At Ath, he received orders from the Convention to arreſt the colonel of the 73<hi rend="sup">d</hi> regiment of infantry, (who had abandoned the army without orders, taking with him his two battalions, and returned to France,) and alſo Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Miranda. Dumourier executed the order that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected General Miranda with regret, ſince he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, that this rigorous meaſure was leſs an act of juſtice than the effect of the hatred of the Jacobins againſt Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thion and the Girondiſts, who were the friends and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors of Miranda. This General found means to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape the danger in accuſing Dumourier, after his quitting the army; an event which was extremely favourable to Miranda.</p>
                     <p>On the ſame day Colonel Mack arrived at Ath; a verbal agreement was again entered into between that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer and Dumourier; but this was in much more formal terms than the former. The colonel began by expreſſing the acknowledgments of the Imperialiſts, for the peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble manner in which the retreat of the French troops was conducted, in conſequence of the prudence of General
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:026918_0208_0FD261A3C0ABE000"/>
Dumourier's orders; by which means the country was ſpared the moſt frightful diſaſters. On the other hand, he noticed the moderation ſhewn by the Imperial general, who, while he forbore to harraſs the French <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>It was agreed upon by Dumourier, and Colonel Mack, that the French army ſhould remain ſome time longer in the poſition of Mons, Tournay, and Courtray, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing harraſſed by the Imperial army; that General Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourier, who did not conceal from Colonel Mack his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of marching againſt Paris, ſhould, when their deſigns were ripe for execution, regulate the motions of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts, who ſhould only act as auxiliaries in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their plan; that, in the caſe of Dumourier's ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no need of aſſiſtance, which was to be greatly deſired by both parties, the Imperialiſts ſhould not advance far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the frontier of France, and that the total evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of Belgium ſhould be the price of this condeſcention; but if Dumourier could not effect the re-eſtabliſhment of a limited monarchy, (not a counter-revolution,) he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſhould indicate the number and the kind of troops which the Imperialiſts ſhould furniſh, to aid in the project, and ſhould be entirely under Dumourier's direction.</p>
                     <p>Dumourier made Colonel Mack acquainted with his deſign of marching the following day to Tournay, with the march of General Neuilly to Mons, and of the army of Holland to Courtray.</p>
                     <p>It was finally decided that in order to combine the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the Imperial troops under the Prince of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg, and thoſe under the Prince of Hohenloe, at the time when Dumourier ſhould march to Paris, Conde ſhould be put into the hands of the Auſtrians, as a pledge; that the Auſtrians ſhould garriſon the town, but without any pretenſions to the ſovereignty, and on the condition that it ſhould be reſtored to France, at the concluſion of the war, and after an indemnity ſhould have been ſettled by the two parties; but that all the other towns belonging to France, ſhould, in the caſe of the conſtitutional party needing the aſſiſtance of the Imperialiſts, receive garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, one half of which ſhould be French troops, and the other half Imperialiſts, under the orders of the French.

                     <head type="sub">Camp of Tournay.</head>
                     <p>ON the 28th, Dumourier marched to Tournay, and took the poſition of Antoing, having his advanced guard in Tournay, and the flanking corps of the left, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by General Miackzinſky, on Mount Trinity. He ſent General le Veneur with the army of the Ardennes, to occupy the camp of Maulde.</p>
                     <p>In this was Madame de Sillery, with Mademoiſelle d'Orleans, whom the general had never till then ſeen.— Theſe ladies had taken up their reſidence at Tournay, on the advice which Dumourier had before this given to Lieutenant-General Omoran, who then commanded in the Tournaiſis; becauſe Mademoiſelle d'Orleans, who was no more than fifteen years of age, was proſcribed in France by the decree againſt the Emigrants. This young Princeſs (who as well as her brothers, the Duke de Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres, and the Duke Montpenſier, is perfectly well bred, and well informed) is an example of virtue, reſignation and conſtancy.</p>
                     <p>The Duke de Chartres, who had ſerved the preceding campaign with diſtinguiſhed valour, and a pure and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſted patriotiſm, and who had recently diſplayed a degree of courage, and civiſm, reflecting honour on the French name, was included in the decree of baniſhment, rendered againſt the houſe of Bourbon and would have been ſubject to the crueleſt voxations the moment that he ſhould enter France.</p>
                     <p>Dumourier, during the two days that he paſſed at Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay, teſtified by every circumſtance in his power the live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concern that he took in the fate of this unfortunate and amiable princeſs. As both ſhe and Madame de Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery were greatly in dread of falling into the hands of the Imperialiſts, becauſe of the influence which they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the emigrants to poſſeſs with Emperor, Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourier on his departure from Tournay, cauſed them to be conducted to St. Amand. When the general's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, far from ſerving, might have been fatal to thoſe
<pb n="2l6" facs="unknown:026918_0210_0FD261A5286C4828"/>
ladies, they accepted of an aſylum in Mons, offered them by the Imperia1 generals. If the virtues of Mademoiſelle d'Orleans do not find their recompenſe, at leaſt, may ſhe find protection from the hands of a beneficent Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
                     <p>While Dumourier remained in the camp of Tournay, he received intelligence, that General Neuilly's diviſion, on ariving at Mons, inſtead of encamping on the heights of Nimy, had pillaged the magazines, and afterward fled in total diſorder (without however, being attacked by the enemy,) to Conde and Valenciennes. The Cavalry on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remained with General Neuilly, and Dumourier com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to retreat with thoſe to Conde, ſpreading over as much ground on his march as he could between Binche, Roeux, Soignes, and Leuſe; carrying off with him the forage, horſes, and carriages, and cutting down the bridges behind him.</p>
                     <p>The evacuation of Mons rendered Dumourier's ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at Tournay very dangerous, his right being altogether unprotected; but, independent of the ſuſpenſion of arms, his knowledge of the country made him ſecure of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, which he was unwilling to undertake, till he ſhould have known what movement was made by his left. He, therefore only took the precaution of commanding Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral d'Harville to confine himſelf within the camp of Maubeuge and Givet, in order to prevent the enemy from penetrating on the French territory, on that ſide.</p>
                     <p>On the 29th of March, three deputies from the Jacobins arrived at Tournay. They introduced themſelves to the General by ſaying, that they bore a commiſſion from Le Brun; and, preſenting a letter from that miniſter, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in vague and uncertain terms; they declared they had communications to make to him reſpecting the affairs of Belgium. Theſe three men were Proly, a contempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible adventurer, born at Bruſſels; Desjardines, a writer of little note, who had formerly been driven from Bruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels; and Pereira, a Portugueſe Jew. The firſt of theſe we have ſeen was already known to the general; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond called himſelf a man of letters, and the third was a furious Jacobin. They were offended that the general refuſed to enter on the ſubject of their embaſſy, before Mademoiſelle d'Orleans, to whoſe apartments they had expreſsly come to utter a Philippic againſt the general. He made an appointment to meet them at his own quarters.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="217" facs="unknown:026918_0211_0FD261697AEFD460"/>The converſation that took place between Dumourier and theſe men, is pretty nearly ſuch as they have report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to be. They agreed with him in his opinion of the imbecility of the convention, and on the neceſſity of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſing that aſſembly, and eſtabliſhing ſome other legis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature. After that, they ſounded the general reſpecting the perſons who ſhould ſucceed the convention in their authority; and one of them ventured to ſay, that the Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins had their preſident, regiſters, tribunes, orators, as well as the habit of diſcuſſing or determining great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns; and that therefore, there was no need to look fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Dumourier, in his uſual ſincere and deciſive man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, utterly rejected this idea; grounding his objection on the immorality, raſhneſs, cruelty, and inconguous qualities of that ſociety; to which all the misfortunes of France he declared were to be attributed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Proly ſaid,</hi> how then will you be able to replace the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent repreſentatives of the people, and at the ſame time avoid the delays and other defects of the mode of election by primary aſſemblies? <hi>The general anſwered,</hi> no hing is more ſimple, or more eaſily accompliſhed. The patriotiſm of the adminiſtrators of the departments and diſtricts is, at preſent, well tried and approved. For this one time, it is but to take all the procureurs-general of the departments and diſtricts; and to complete the number by members of the departments and diſtricts. Theſe will form a very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent legiſlature: they will re-eſtabliſh the conſtitution of 1789: all diviſions will be healed in France: the Royaliſts will lay down their arms: foreign powers will no longer have any colour for carrying on the war, and France. ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a ſolid government with which they can treat, will liſten with readineſs to terms of peace. For do not you imagine, <hi>the general added,</hi> the Republic can continue to exiſt: your crimes and your ignorance have deſtroyed its poſſibility.</p>
                     <p>Theſe three men made ſome objection to the general's propoſitions, but they liſtened very tranquilly to thoſe <hi>blaſphemies</hi> of the general, of which they afterward gave ſo dreadful an account. Desjardines, who proceeded fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the reſt in his addreſs and artifice, ſaid that he ſhould return to Paris to give an account of his miſſion; and that he hoped ſoon to ſee the general again. They took their leave of Dumourier without moleſtation; and certainly, he never thought of arreſting emiſſaries of ſuch little conſequence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="2l8" facs="unknown:026918_0212_0FD261A76E3DE018"/>General Dumourier has no doubt that, had he ſeconded their idea of replacing the National Convention by the ſociety of Jacobins, he had entirely gained the confidence of that ſociety; but he acknowledges that his temper, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps too ſincere in this inſtance, robbed him of the poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of ſeeming to yield to their meaſures. He inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceived that he could not turn this inſtrument to his purpoſes, but by plunging into a ſeries of horrid crimes: and the events that have ſucceeded, have proved to him that his judgment was not erroneous.</p>
                     <p>On the ſame day, he received a letter from the ſeven commiſſioners of the convention, met at Liſle, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to appear in that city, to anſwer to the charges alledged againſt him. He anſwered, that being in ſight of the enemy, employed in re-organizing his army, and in reſtoring its courage, (which was indeed true) he could not quit the army for an inſtant; but if the commiſſioners would come to him at Tournay, he would anſwer every accuſation with his uſual frankneſs; that When he ſhould have accompliſhed his retreat, and the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſhould be ſafe in the French <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     <p>GENERAL DUMOURIER was extremely uneaſy reſpecting the fate of the troops at Antwerp; having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived no intelligence from that quarter, and fearing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that General Rualt who bore his orders to General Maraſſe, had fallen into the hands of the enemy.</p>
                     <p>The retreat from Antwerp acroſs the Scheldt, by the extremity of Flanders, was long and difficult. But Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourier knew that the enemy were leſs numerous in that quarter than the troops at Antwerp. The Pruſſians and Dutch were before Gortruydenberg and Breda; and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel

Mylius, who preſented himſelf before Antwerp had not more than 2000 men, and thoſe were irregular troops of the Imperial army.</p>
                     <p>But the French troops at Antwerp had fallen into ſtill greater diſorder than any other part of the army. They were ſeized with panic, and the generals were no longer maſters of them. On the 26th, Colonel Mylius had the audacity to ſummon the city. Part of the French troops had already croſſed the Scheldt, but, inſtead of waiting for the remainder, they precipitately retired by Bruges to Dunkirk, excepting a ſmall body of them, which Colonel Thouvenot prevailed upon to halt at Ghent. General Maraſſe had ſunk the Ariel frig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> to according to Dumou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier's inſtructions, after ſending away her maſts, rigging and guns, by the canals to Dunkirk. He had alſo ſent away part of the magazines of the garriſon, but a great part ſtill remained, and more than 8000 men.</p>
                     <p>As the terror and confuſion which before had ſpread among the troops redoubled on the approach of Colonel Mylius, a council of war was held, in which it was unanimouſly decided, that it was more prudent to ſave this part of the army together with the magazines and other effects belonging to the French nation, than obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately to riſk the loſs of the whole.</p>
                     <p>It is impoſſible for Dumourier to form a candid judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this capitulation, ſince the rapid ſucceſſion of important events that followed, prevented him from any perfect knowledge of the circumſtances of the garriſon. The Imperialiſts are extremely dextrous in the diſpoſition and conduct of their advanced guards, multiplying them to the eyes of an enemy, and miſleading the enemy reſpecting their real force. It is alſo to be preſumed, that the French generals, embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſed and diſconcerted by the diſorder prevailing among the troops, imagined the whole Pruſſian and Dutch army to be before the place. No excuſe, however, is to be made for their having ſurrendered the citadel, which was altogether independent of the city, and in no one caſe ought to have been included in that capitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>On the 27th or 28th of March, the French troops quitted Antwerp. None of them paſſed by Courtray, and they were not at liberty to encamp at Haerlebeck, as had been deſigned. They entered the French territory in different bodies, and at different times, and part of
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:026918_0214_0FD261A8E6910048"/>
them were diſpoſed of by General Omoran in the camp of Caſſel and the lines of Dunkirk, and the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der helped to form the camp of Madelaine, near Liſle.</p>
                     <p>It was not till the 29th that Dumourier received intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of this diſperſion of more than 20,000 men of his army, and even then his intelligence was unaccompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by any detail. The diſperſion of the body of troops under Neuilly, and the evacuation of Mons, had expoſed his right, and that of Courtray now expoſed his left to ſtill greater danger, which the enemy might turn, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching by the left of the Sehelt, and if he ſhould be compelled to retreat before the enemy in the preſent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of his troops, he had nothing to expect but to be completely routed.</p>
                     <p>For theſe reaſons, he reſolved to raiſe the camp of Tournay in the morning of the 30th. He and before this, ſent General le Veneur to occupy that of Maulde.

                     <p>By the unexpected ſurrender of the citadel of Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp, the garriſons of Breda and Gertruydenberg Were entirely cut off from all communication with the army. They amounted to near 6000 men, that were on the point of being ſacrificed without the hope of aſſiſtance, and without any ſervice to enſue to France. Dumourier, therefore, ſent orders, through the medium of Colonel Mack, to General de Flers, and to Colonel Tilly, who commanded in thoſe two places to capitulate, on condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of being at liberty to maro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> to France with arms and baggage. This was accordingly done; and was an important ſervice rendered France, ſince one half of the army had already deſerted.</p>
                     <p>At this period the ſafety of the frontier towns in France was entirely owing to the ſuſpenſion of arms; for had the Imperialiſts preſſed forward, ſuch was the diſorder prevailing in the French army, they muſt have penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the frontiers.</p>
                     <p>In the midſt of this chaos of things, and of the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents and diſorders that reſulted in the French army, the
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:026918_0215_0FD2616C28E617C0"/>
troops never ceaſed to expreſs an attachment to their general, rendering juſtice to his efforts to preſerve them from ruin. The rear guard, and the troops of the line eſpecially, who had always ſeen him the laſt in every retreat, in the day or at night, and always expoſed to the greateſt danger, were moved with reſpect, and even compaſſion for the general, and with extreme reſentment againſt his enemies, the Jacobins and the National Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention. A wiſh for the re-eſtabliſhment of a limited Monarchy was almoſt general in the army. A few of the battalions of volunteers only dared openly to eſpouſe the Republic. The cavalry, and the troops of the line were altogether decided; and the artillery declared that in every caſe, they would defend their general. It was openly propoſed to march to Paris, and to overthrow the Anarchiſts, to whom the army juſtly attributed the whole of their diſgrace and misfortunes. It beeing ſaid that the general was to be commanded to appear at the bar of the National Convention, their conſtant language was, that they themſelves would conduct the general to Paris, and would ſhare his fortunes.</p>
                     <p>Dumourier attentively obſerved this diſpoſition in the troops, which he ſaw was ſupported by the complaints of the generals, and of the greater part of the other officers. Theſe latter, ſeeing the generals under whom they had been conducted to victory, outraged in the Jacobin Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, accuſed of treachery, arreſted, and treated without regard to decency or juſtice, naturally concluded, that their own elevation to the ſuperior ranks, would but expoſe them to the ſame diſaſters. Some of the generals, however, among whom was Dampierre, kept up a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious correſpondence with the leaders of the Anarchiſts; and, hoping to ſupplant their ſuperiors, by the aid of the preſent diſorders, they loudly proclaimed the ſame doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines as their colleagues of Paris, and by their falſe inſinuations kept alive the Jacobin phrenzy that infected part of the army.</p>
                     <p>The two parties were now in the greateſt fermentation, and the conteſt tended to an iſſue which could not but be prompt and violent. Three Commiſſioners of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, Lequinio, Cochon, and Bellegarde were in Valenciennes; theſe already treated the army and its generals as rebels, would not permit any communication between them and the garriſon, and ſtopt their convoys
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:026918_0216_0FD261B0B1C7E968"/>
of proviſion and money. They were bold enough to hazard a manifeſto againſt Dumourier, which they ſent to the army, and the garriſon of Conde.</p>
                     <p>The garriſon of Conde, conſiſting of four battalions and a regiment of cavalry, under General Neuilly, were extremely divided in opinion, but they ſeemed to incline to ſupport Dumourier, to whom General Neuilly was a1together attached.</p>
                     <p>At Liſle the conteſt was ſtill more marked and more violent. The Comiſſioners of the Convention, who had made this place their point of union, and the Jacobin Club inſtigated an extremely numerous populace againſt the higher rank of citizens. On the other hand the ſoldiers, eſpecially the troops of the line, broke our into tumults, and ſpoke loudly in behalf of their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and againſt the Anarchiſts. But they were without leaders, and their meaſures were void of plan and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. Aſfignats were alſo ſucceſsfully diſtributed among theſe troops, and the ſame means were employed in the army under the general's immediate command, and even with thoſe neareſt to his perſon.</p>
                     <p>The Commiſſioners of the Convention alſo endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to accompliſh their deſigns by aſſaſſination. On the 31ſt of March, fix volunteers, of the third battalion of La Marne, demanded leave to ſpeak to the general, who ordered them to be introduced. They entered with their hats on, the back part being placed in the front, having the word <hi>Republic</hi> chalked on them. They made a long and fanatical harangue to the general, the purport of which was, that they, and many others of their comrades, had ſworn to send him to the bar of the National Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, or, in imitation of Brutus, to ſtab him. Dumourier anſwered with great compoſure and gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that they were blinded by a miſtaken zeal; that they could not, but perceive the unfortunate condition of France; and that the rage with which remedies were applied, ſerved only to prove the impoſſibility of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the republic, ſince an unjust and unreſtrained government could not long exiſt. While the general ſpoke, they approached with a deſign of ſurrounding him, which, perhaps, would have been effected, but for the intrepidity of the faithfull Baptiſte, who ſeized upon the foremoſt, and called the general's guard to his aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ante. The volunteers attempted to reſiſt, but they were
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:026918_0217_0FD2616FAF027068"/>
overpowered; and the general not only ſaved their lives but prevented their being ill treated. He contented himſelf with ſecuring their perſons in priſon.</p>
                     <p>The indiguation of the army was general; and on the ſame day the different corps preſented adreſſes ſigned by individuals of every rank, proſeſſing an inviolable attachment to their general; and the greator part of them expreſſing their deſire of marching to Paris to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſh the conſtitution.</p>
                     <p>After hoſtilities had been thus commenced by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners of the Convention, and after the troops had thus declared their wiſhes, Dumourier ſet about the means of making himſelf maſter of Valenciennes, Conde, and Liſle; without which he could ſtrike no blow of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
                     <p>He now readily acknowledges that, although he did not for a moment loſe ſight of his object, he failed in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecting means which, doubtleſs were neceſſary at that period; but which he was induced to reject by his aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to perſidy and cruelty. He relied too confidently on the ſtrength of his legitimate means, and on the good ſaith and conviction of his troops; and he neither coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teracted his enemies by corruption, nor deſtroyed the more inveterate of them when it was in his power. A meaſure was propoſed to him that was probably eſſential to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. It was to aſſemble the troops of the line in a camp apart from the reſt and to diſarm and diſband the national guard. But this could not be accompliſhed without a dreadful effuſion of blood; for there had long exiſted an extreme animoſity between the national guards, and the troops of the line. There were many of the battalions of national guards, who had ſerved under his command with great valour, and had lately preſented addreſſes to him, couched in loyal and ſtrong turms; and he could not prevail on himſelf to recompence them with diſgrace, or perhaps, with death. And, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

paſſion in 1789. It became licentious in 1790 and 1791. By the ſucceſſes of the year 1792, the love of freedom, inſtead of being exalted into heroiſm, degenerated into a blind, inſolent, and barbarous phrenzy; and the period that we are reviewing in theſe memoirs added to the fero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of its ſpirit.</p>
                     <p>The ſtruggle for aſcendancy was not equal between Dumourier and the Jacobins. His means were enfeebled by his ſcruples. The crimes of the Jacobins were not to be cruſhed but by crimes more incredible than theſe; corruption was to be oppoſed by corruption, and treachery and cruelty to the attrocities and horrors of the Jacobins. The ſect of the Jacobins was not to be annihilated but by a monſter more frightful than itſelf; or by a foreign ſword. And hence the ſequel of this hiſtory is no more than an account of the miſtakes of Dumourier; who em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the incompatible deſigns of preſerving his own eſteem, and purging the nation of her crimes. In a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation he had formerly held at Louvain with Danton and La Croix, on a propoſal made by thoſe Commiſſioners relative to a conduct they wiſhed the general to adopt in Belgium, by no means very reputable; the general ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved (and he has ſince repeated the obſervation to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus) that he would never commit an action which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded as a crime, even for the ſalvation of his country. He has ſince been told that Danton ſaid <hi>General Dumou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier wants energy; his mind has never riſen to the true revolutionary pitch.</hi> The revolutionary pitch <hi>roſe</hi> after that period; and, Dumourier, who has not changed, could not but fail in the ſtruggle, ſince to ſucceed it was neceſſary to diſplay crimes greater than thoſe with which he had to combat.</p>
                     <p>Dumourier ſent orders to General Miaczinſky, who was at Orchies, to march with his diviſion to Liſle; to arreſt the Commiſſioners of the Convention, and the leaders of the clubs; to proceed from thence to Douay and remove General Moreton from the command of that town; to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim there and at Liſle the unanimous reſolution of the army to reſtore the Conſtitution: and aſterward to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed by Cambray to Peronne, where he was to take poſt. This unfortunate General did not ſufficiently perceive the importance of his charge. He ſpoke of it to various perſons, and among the reſt to St. George, the celebrated Mulatto, Colonel of a regiment of Hu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>rs, who betrayed the general and drew him into Liſle with a very ſmall eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cort.
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:026918_0219_0FD261718585A688"/>
The moment Miaczinſky entered the town, the gates were ſhut upon him. He was arreſted, conducted to Paris, and brought to the ſcaffold. This officer was a native of Poland, and was one of the chiefs of the confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, at the time that Dumourier was charged by the court of France to direct its operations, Miaczinſky had been made priſoner in an engagement with the Ruſſians; and afterward, claiming an indemnity from France, in which the general could not find means to ſerve him, he had obtained for him the rank of major-general, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to raiſe a free corps, and had afterward employed him with great utility in France and the army. Miac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zinſky, brave in war, did not diſplay the ſame courage in his perſonal defence when he was taken, nor at his death. He accused Dumourier of various crimes againſt the nation; and even of ſome g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ſs frauds, that were no doubt ſuggeſted to him by the enemies of Dumourier. He alſo accuſed La Croix, which was the cauſe of his ruin.</p>
                     <p>Miaczinſky's troops, after they were quitted by that officer, wandered on the Glacis of Liſle, into which place the garriſon would not admit them. Dumourier, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving intelligence of this, ſent one of his aids-de-camp, Colonel Philip de Vaux, to put himſelf at their head, and to conduct them to Orchies and Douay. De Vaux was arreſted through the treachery of a brother officer, taken to Paris, and executed. He died with great courage and conſtancy.</p>
                     <p>Philip de Vaux was born at Bruſſels, had ſerved in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria, and had afterward taken part againſt the Emperor in the revolution of his own country. Dumourier had known him at Paris, and appointed him his aid-de-camp. He was a man of capacity, of great courage, and of an exalted and feeling mind. In fine, he poſſeſſed the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities neceſſary to make a general officer.</p>
                     <p>The garriſon of Valenciennes was commanded by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor-General Ferrand, whom Dumourier had raiſed to the rank of Colonel, and afterward to that of major-general; and whom he believed to be attached to his intereſts. This officer was of an age not very liable to be heated with opinions; and, till this period, had appeared to be well informed and moderate. But characters moulder away before opinions, and Ferrand became one of the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate of Dumouriers accuſers, and one of the firmoſt ſupporters of the anarchiſts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="226" facs="unknown:026918_0220_0FD261B50D19AB10"/>
The grand provoſt of the army, nameſt l'Ecuyer, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of Dumourier as a favour, the charge of arreſting the Deputies at Valenciennes. He was no ſooner in that city, than he became their confident, and inſtrument: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though by a ſtrange accident he periſhed afterward on the ſcaffold. While he was in Valenciennes, he had written a circumſtantial letter to the general, reſpecting the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangements he had made for arreſting the deputies, and this letter was found in the pocket of the general's great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coat on the 4th of April.</p>
                     <p>Theſe two men, Ferrand and l'Ecuyer, undermined the general's plan for making himſelf maſter of Valenciennes; theſe being at firſt confidentially communicated to them; and they effected an entire change in the diſpoſition of the troops which he had contrived to ſend there.</p>
                     <p>Dumourier's deſign. Liſte and Valenciennes, being thus ſuddenly defeated, he had no other reſource than to make himſelf maſter of Conde. The ſituation of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, on the extreme frontier of France, was become alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether embarraſſing. The army depending upon the ſtrong towns for ſubſiſtence, Dumourier was compelled ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to diſband them, or to join the Imperialiſts, unleſs he could obtain poſſeſſion of one of the ſtrong towns. The firſt of theſe meaſures would have deprived him of all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource, and given a deciſive victory to the anarchiſts. The ſecond was repugnant to the feelings of the general, and the troops, inſpired by the laudable principle of national honour; and he could not have obtained the univerſal conſent of his army to this meaſure, ſince the opinions of the troops were divided, and ſince the indefatigable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues of the Jacobins had wrought ſuch a change in the diſpoſition of the ſoldiery. And the latter was impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, becauſe the General had no artillery to undertake a ſiege; his artillery being ſent to Liſle when he retreated from Belgium. The third of theſe meaſures alſo, muſt have produced a civil war. A regular ſiege would have demanded great length of time, during which the ſoldiery would have made the ſame reflections that operated on the mind of Dumourier, and which continually reſtrained him in the plans that ſeemed neceſſary to his object: theſe reflections regarded the horror of ſeeing Frenchmen com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat each other, having foreigners for ſpectators, to whom both parties would have become a prey, when they ſhould be mutually incapable of further reſiſtance.</p>

Dumourier therefore thought of leading his army to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris. But he could ſucceed in that, only in having a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority of opinions with him. Every other expedient was at once painful and uncertain, Every day, every hour di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed his hope. He beheld his ſituation, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving himſelf, and being ſubdued by his difficulties. He regarded them under every aſpect, and he cannot now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect the firſt five days of April without horror.</p>

                     <p>ON the firſt of April, General Dumourier, in order to be nearer his army, and to favour a project of ſurpriſing Valenciennes, (which had been propoſed to him, and which failed by the miſconduct of the general officer who was charged with its execution,) removed his head quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from the city of St. Amand to the ſuburbs; where was ſtationed a choſen body of cavalry, and where he was alſo nearer Conde. Various circumſtances had prevented his proceeding in the firſt inſtance to the latter city, but in that neglect he committed a great error, and perhaps it was the cauſe of compleating the ruin of his affairs. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it had been better if he had at firſt eſtabliſhed his head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quarters at Conde; but the events that paſſed in that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod were ſo ſudden and unforeſeen, he was ſo effectually ſhut out from intelligence, and was ſo compleatly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of all that paſſed beyond Valenciennes and Liſle, and he was ſo entirely occupied in obſerving and moulding to his purpoſe the diſpoſitions of his army, that to blame or juſtify the conduct into which he was driven by this ſtrong chain of circumſtances, it is neceſſary to have been in his ſituation.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps even it is well for him that he did not make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf maſter of Conde, for if the inconſtancy of the French character had then cauſed a ſtrong defection in his army, being in the centre of that ſtrong city, he had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

The commiſſioners of the Convention availed themſelves of Dumourier's heſitation in this reſpect to viſit Conde, and to iſſue proclamations, circulate aſſignats, and fill the town with emiſſaries of the Jacobins, The ſixth regiment of infantry, the only corps of troops of the line which had diſcovered a decided ſpirit of Jacobiniſm, and a battalion of National Guards of Verſailles, ſtruck terror into the mind of General Neuilly, who thenceforward was no longer maſter of the place; although he perſuaded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that he was, and continued to aſſert it to Dumourier, who too long relied on his ill founded confidence.</p>
                     <p>In this battalion of Verſailles, was a captain of the artillery company, named Le Cointre, ſon of the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated deputy of that name of Verſailles. This young man declaimed vehemently againſt the advocates of the conſtitution; and, being rudely handled on that account by ſome dragoon officers, he quitted the garriſon to lay his complaints before Dumourier, who cauſed him to be arreſted, that he might have an hoſtage for himſelf, in the perſon of the ſon of one of the moſt furious among the members of the <hi>Mountain.</hi> Dumourier alſo cauſed to be arreſted a lieutenant-colonel, an officer belonging to the ſtaff of the army, who declaimed openly and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently againſt him: and having no ſecure place in which he could keep theſe priſoners, he ſent them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the ſix volunteers, who had attempted to aſſaſſinate him, to Tournay; requeſting General Clair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fait to keep them as hoſtages in the citadel.</p>
                     <p>Lieutenant-General le Veneur, who at the time of La Fayette's deſertion had followed that officer, and who was indebted to Dumourier for his pardon, and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhment in his rank, now came to Dumourier to demand permiſſion to retire from the army, on the pretence of being in an ill ſtate of health. His object was, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the command of the army of the Anarchiſts. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourier granted him permiſſion to retire, and alſo to a general named Stetenhoffen, a foreigner whom Dumou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier had made major-general. Dampierre was at Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy with his diviſion, and carried on a treaty with the commiſſioners of the Convention, as did alſo General Chancel, who was cantoned at Freſnes. And their example was followed by General Roſiers, and General Kermorvan, who had the command of the Belgians in the camp of Bruille.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="229" facs="unknown:026918_0223_0FD26176B7EADD78"/>
Dumourier was the more affected by theſe inſtances of treachery, becauſe all thoſe officers had been indebted to him for their rank, had complained more loudly than any others againſt the Anarchiſts, and had preſſed with more ſeeming impatience the execution of his deſign of reſtoring order. Excepting Dampierre who died in the command of the army, and Chancel who replaced Neuilly at Conde, and was obliged to ſurrender after a long ſiege, theſe officers have been puniſhed for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude, by the ſuſpicions and diſdain of their patrons, and the loſs of their employments. This unhappy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of treachery of ſuperior officers, who were in appearance moſt attached to the cauſe of the general, could not fail to produce a pernicious effect on the ſoldiery, and add ſtrength to the party of the Jacobins.</p>
                     <p>Dumourier now ſaw that he could no longer hope to march to Paris without oppoſition from his army, as the temper of his troops at firſt ſeemed to promiſe. He ſaw that he would have to commence by a civil war, which he had always thought of with repugnance; and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel one part of his troops to combat the other, a dreadful extremity for a general who regarded his ſoldiers as his children, and who had never conducted them but by his kindneſs, and the influence of a mutual affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Another circumſtance rendered him timid, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived all his meaſures of energy. This was, the danger of the priſoners in the temple. It was to be feared that the Jacobins would inſtantly ſacrifice the unfortunate victims, whom they already treated too unworthily to afford any hope that they would ſpare them in the firſt moments of their fear and reſentment. Had thoſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners been ſacrificed in conſequence of Dumourier's march to Paris, he would have incurred the reproaches of Europe, and hiſtory would have conſigned him to infamy; while he would have prepared for himſelf an anguiſh, that would have endured through the remainder of his life.</p>
                     <p>General Dnmourier from the time of his being at Tournay, inceſſantly meditated on this dreadful circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. Beſide General Valence, the Duke de Chartres and General Thouvenot, who partook of his councils, he alſo confided his thoughts on this ſubject to Colonel Montjoy, and Colonel Nordmann, colonel of the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:026918_0224_0FD261B7ECC68258"/>
of Berchiny. He propoſed to ſend thoſe two officers with three hundred huſſars to Paris, on the pre text of arreſting deſerters, and ſending them back to the army. He meant to have given them diſpatches to the miniſter of war, which would have juſtified their going to Paris, and would have given it a natural air, in the caſe of their being interrogated. They were to proceed as covertly as poſſible by the foreſt of Bondy; and afterward, reaching the priſon by the Boulevard of the temple, were to force the guard, making falſe attacks in ſeveral different points, carry off the four illuſtrious priſoners, placing each of them behind an huſſar, and having a voiture ready in the foreſt, to puſh forward with the utmoſt ſpeed to Pont St. Maxence, where another body of cavalry were to be poſted to meet them.</p>
                     <p>But to this end it was neceſſary to be in poſſeſſion of either Valenciennes, or Liſie; and the circumſtances that followed defeated the project, to which thoſe two worthy officers whom we have juſt named, were altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther devoted. There remained no means of ſaving the illuſtrious priſoners from the rage of the Jacobins. To form a conſpiracy in Paris demanded time, and the emigrants had ſo ill ſucceeded in attempts of that nature, that it had been madneſs in the general to have placed any confidence in ſuch a plan. Deprived then of all hope of delivering the priſoners, the general had no other reſource in their behalf, than to poſſeſs himſelf of hoſtages for their ſafety. Hence he had ſo anxiouſly ſought to feize upon the Commiſſioners of the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at Liſle, and Valenciennes; and he was now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to detain ſuch as might put themſelves into his power.</p>
                     <p>On the morning of the 5th of April, a captain of Chaſſeurs, whom Dumourier had poſted at Pont-a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Marque, on the road between Liſle, and Douay, with fifteen truſty and reſolute men under his command, with orders to arreſt any couriers, but above all the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners of the Convention, if they took the road from Liſle to Paris, brought him advice that Beurnonville the miniſter of war had paſſed them on the road to Liſie, and had informed him. (the captain of Chaſſeurs) that he ſhould afterward proceed to the head quarters of his riend General Dumourier. The intimacy that ſubſiſted etween this miniſter and the General was known.
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:026918_0225_0FD26178B0ED2580"/>
Dumourier was aſtoniſhed that he had received no couri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er from Beurnonville, nor any manner of advice reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his journey, at a time when the General could no longer doubt of his being proſcribed, and when the <hi>Rubicon</hi> was already paſſed. This was the firſt and the only intimation which Dumourier received to prepare him for the important ſcene that followed.</p>
                     <p>About four o'clock in the evening, two couriers came to the General to announce the arrival of the miniſter of war with four commiſſioners of the National Convention. Terror and deſpair were painted on the countenance of theſe meſſengers. Interrogated by ſome of the ſtaff offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers reſpecting the cauſe, they did not heſitate to ſay that General Dumourier was utterly loſt, that the commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners came to conduct him to the bar of the Convention in virtue of a decree, but that the general would never reach Paris, ſince aſſaſſins were planted on the road by bands of twenty and thirty, at Gournay, Roye, and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis, in order to murder him. They even indicated who theſe aſſaſſins were, being ſoldiers belonging to two new regiments, called the Huſſars and dragoons of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public. The general had broken a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>quadron of the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars. for having refuſed to obey their colonel, and had ſent them back to France on foot and without arms, which the Jacobins had reſtored them in order to aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinate their general. The regiment of dragoons conſiſted of men who had committed numerous crimes at Paris, from which they had been ſent with great difficulty to join the army, where they attempted to repeat their crimes. Their conduct was cowardly and attrocious, and the general was compelled to act with ſeverity toward them on his retreat from the Netherlands. They after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward deſerted and fled to Paris. when they were now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched to be the accomplices of the Huſſars.</p>
                     <p>Immediately afterward the miniſter of war appeared, followed by the four commiſſioner, who were Camus, La Marque, Bancal, and Quinette. The miniſter after em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing the general with expreſſions natural to their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual attachment, Informed him that the commiſſioners came to notify to the general a decree of the National Convention. General Valence was already with Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourier, and the reſt of the ſtaff officers now crouded into the apartment. Partaking of the opinions of their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral as they had partaken of his fatigues, dangers, victories,
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:026918_0226_0FD261B976F06078"/>
and defeats, his fate was not to be ſeparated from theirs; and indignation rather that inquietude was expreſſed in their looks. Dumourier ſaw that this temper of mind might break out into violent conſequences, which induced him the more to preſerve the compoſure with which he was determined to act in this critical moment.</p>
                     <p>Dumourier would be unjuſt if he did not offer the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of his eſteem and gratitude, to thoſe generous men, who in the midſt of his diſgraces preſerved the conſtancy of their friendſhip to him, and their attachment to princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by ſacrificing emolument and honors, to follow him in his retreat. Nor can he forbear here to record the magnanimity of General Valence, who being offered the command of the Armies on condition of arreſting Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourier, not only ſpurned at the offer without heſitation, but concealed the dangerous temptations laid before him by the commiſſioners of the Convention from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Dumourier.</p>
                     <p>Camus ſpoke for the members of this deputation. In a manner that expreſſed ſome degree of irreſolution, he requeſted the general to go into another room with the deputies, and miniſter of war, in order to hear a decree of the Convention reſpecting him. The general anſwered, that as all his actions had ever been public, and as the ſubject of a decree paſſed by ſeven hundred perſons could be no myſtery, he ſaw no reaſon for complying with the requeſt, and that the officers who were preſent ought to be witneſſes of whatever ſhould paſs in this interview. Beur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonville, however, as well as the deputies, urged the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt with ſuch appearance of reſpect that the General went with them into an inner room, but his ſtaff officers would not permit the door to be cloſed, and General Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence entered the room with him.</p>
                     <p>Camus preſented the decree to Dumourier; who, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing read it with perfect compoſure, returned it, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that forbearing within certain limits to condemn a deciſion of the National Convention, he could not but judge this order to be untimely, ſince the army was diſorganized and diſcontented, and ſince his quitting it in that condition would be followed by its total diſſolution; that it would be prudent to ſuſpend the execution of the decree, till he ſhould have reſtored the army to its proper footing, when he would be ready to render an account of his conduct; and when it might be decided whether cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances required or permitted his appearance at Paris;

that he read in that decree, an article empowering the Commiſſioners to ſuſpend him from his functions and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point another General, in the caſe of his diſobeying the order; that the Convention having charged them with a commiſſion including ſuch ſeverity toward the general, and of ſo delicate a nature with reſpect to themſelves, had certainly relied no leſs on their prudence than on their firmneſs, that therefore he would throw himſelf on their diſcretion, and would not poſitively refuſe obedience, but merely demand a delay in the execution of their order: that, in fine, being now judges of all the circumſtances, they could eaſily reſolve on the conduct that became them, and if they were determined upon ſuſpending him, he would meet them half way, by himſelf offering his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation to them, which he had ſo often tendered during the laſt three months to the Convention.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Camus replied that the deputies had no authority to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the General's reſignation; and then ſaid,</hi> But if your reſignation were accepted of, what would be your conduct afterwards? I ſhould act as became me, <hi>the General an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered</hi>; but I have no heſitation in declaring to you, I will neither by going to Paris ſubject myſelf to be treated unworthily by fanatics, nor to be condemned to death by a revolutionary tribunal.—Then you do not acknowledge that tribunal, <hi>ſaid Camus.</hi>—I recogniſe in it, <hi>replied the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi> a tribunal of Blood and of Crimes, to which I never will ſubmit while I have a ſword that will not deceive me. I moreover declare, that had I the power I would aboliſh it, as being a diſhonour to a free Nation.</p>
                     <p>The other three deputies who were men of much more temper and moderation than Camus, perceiving that the converſation became intemperate, interpoſed, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to convince the general that the Convention had no inimical deſigns againſt him; that he was loved and eſteemed by every one, and that his preſence in Paris would deſtroy the calumnies of his enemies; that his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence from the troops would not be long, and that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties and miniſter of war would remain with the army till his return. Quinette offered to accompany the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to Paris to be the pledge of his ſafety, and to return with him, making the moſt fervent proteſtations that he would perſonally expoſe himſelf to all danger in the general's defence. After this the converſation became more cool and temperate, Bancal, a man of reading and
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:026918_0228_0FD261BB0EB08F20"/>
talent, endeavoured to win the general by his regard for his name, and cited examples of obedience and reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the laws of the Greeks and Romans. <hi>Let us have done with miſtakes, Sir,</hi> ſaid the general; <hi>we degrade the Roman hiſtory; and disfigure the Roman virtues, that they may ſerve as an excuſe for our crimes. The Romans did not maſſacre Tarquin. The Roman republic poſſeſſed a ſtable government and juſt laws. They neither had a Jacobin club, nor a revolutionary tribunal. We are in a ſtate of anarchy. Ferocious men thirſt for my blood, and I tell you that I have often acted the part of Decius but never will that of Curtius.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The deputies aſſured Dumourier that he had formed an unjuſt idea of the ſtate of Paris; and that indeed he was neither called before the Jacobins, nor the revolutionary tribunal, but to the Bar of the National Convention, and that he would ſpeedily return to his poſt.</p>
                     <p>I paſſed the month of January at Paris, <hi>ſaid the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi> and ſurely that city has not become more reaſonable ſince, eſpecially in the moment of public danger. I know by the moſt authentic of your journals, that the Convention is governed by Marat, the Jacobins, and the tumultuous tribunes filled with the emiſſaries of the Jacobins. The Convention has not the power of ſaving me from the fury of theſe men; and, if it became the reſpect that I ow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to appear before ſuch judges, even my deportment would provoke my death.</p>
                     <p>Camus then returned to his categorical queſtion. <hi>You refuſe to obey the decree of the Convention</hi>? The general anſwered that he had already ſtated to the deputies his view of the ſubject. He urged them to take a moderate courſe, and exhorted them to return to Valenciennes, and from thence to make a report to the Convention, ſetting forth the general's reaſons, and ſupporting thoſe by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the impoſſibility of taking the general from his army at this inſtant, without incurring the greateſt riſk of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banding it.</p>
                     <p>Dumourier acknowledges that, had they yielded to theſe counſels, he ſhould have been imprudent enough to have permitted their departure. The colleagues of Camus ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared by no means unwilling to liſten to reaſon, altho' on his part he rudely repulſed every conciliatory meaſure. <hi>Call to mind,</hi> ſaid one of them, <hi>that your diſobedience in this caſe will cauſe the ruin of the republic. Cambon ſaid in your tribune amidſt burſts of applauſe,</hi> anſwered the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:026918_0229_0FD2617F6CF619F0"/>
that the ſate of the republic reſts not upon any one man. I have, beſide, to obſerve that the name of the republic does not belong to us; our condition is abſolute, anarchy. I ſwear to you that I have no deſire to elude enquiry. I promiſe you on my honour, a pledge that is inviolable with military men, that when the nation ſhall have a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and laws, I will give a faithful account of my actions and motives. I will myſelf demand a trial. At preſent, it would be an act of inſanity in me.</p>
                     <p>The conference laſted more than two hours, but that which has been ſtated was the exact purport of it. The deputies retired into another chamber, to decide on the courſe they ſhould purſue.</p>
                     <p>Dumourier was at this period deceived reſpecting the deſigns, and the conduct of Beurnonville; in conſequence of which he has made unjuſt complaints of that miniſter. He learned afterward from a virtuous and impartial man, that Beurnonville was conſtant in his friendſhip to Dumourier; and the groſs accuſations of Marat againſt that miniſter is an additional proof of the fact: and Dumourier is eager to make this public avowal of his error.</p>
                     <p>It is certain that Beurnonville, being ſeveral times ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed to by Dumourier reſpecting the conduct he would obſerve in this caſe, conſtantly ſaid. <hi>I cannot adviſe you. You know what it becomes you to do.</hi> As ſoon as the deputies were withdrawn, the general complained that Beurnonville had forborne to give him intelligence of the approach of this important event, at the ſame time how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever requeſting him to join the army, and again to take upon him the command of the advanced guard. Beur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonville anſwered, <hi>I know that I ſhall fall a ſacrifice to my enemies, but I have reſolved to die at my poſt. My ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation is terrifying. I ſee you are decided, and that the ſtep you will take is of the moſt deſperate kind. I demand as a favour at your hands that you will not ſeparate my fate from that of the a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                              <desc>•••</desc>
                           </gap>ties.—Be aſſured that I will not,</hi> anſwered the General. Dumourier was at that moment unjuſt to the magnanimity of Beurnonville, whom he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered to be perſidious, or at the beſt unworthily carried away by circumſtances. May he receive ſome conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this juſtice rendered to him by Dumourier. And may his heart, juſtly offended, be open to receive the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement of his friend!</p>
                     <p>Beurnonville, Valence, and Dumourier returned to the officers, who impatiently waited the reſult of this long
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:026918_0230_0FD261BD866AAB70"/>
Conference. But their inquietude was not entirely diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated, for the general did not then acquaint them with the reſolution he had taken. Theſe officers have ſince told him that, had he conſented to go to Paris, they would have prevented it by violence.</p>
                     <p>When the deputies firſt arrived at the general's quarters, the regiment of Berchiny was drawn up in the court yard; and the general had commanded Colonel Nordmann to ſelect an officer on whom he could rely, together with thirty men, and to hold them in readineſs to execute his orders. The paſſions by which the troops were agitated were forcibly expreſſed in their looks, and the general exerted his influence to moderate them.</p>
                     <p>In this interval while the Deputies were deliberating, Dumourier in walking met doctor Menuret, ſurgeon to the army, and ſaid to him, <hi>Well doctor, what remedy ſhall we apply to this wound</hi>? Menuret anſwered quickly, <hi>the ſame as in the preceding year at the camp of Maulde, a grain of diſobedience.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In about an hour the deputies returned to the General's room, Camus much agitated, ſaid harſhly,</hi> Citizen General, are you ready to obey the decree of the National Convention, and go with us to Paris? <hi>The General replied,</hi> Not in this inſtant.—Then, <hi>ſaid Camus,</hi> I ſuſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nd you from your functions. You no longer command the armies. I forbid all perſons to obey you, and command every one to aſſiſt in arreſting you. I will go myſelf and place the ſeals on your papers.</p>
                     <p>A murmur of indignation was heard. <hi>Give me the names of thoſe perſons,</hi> Camus cried out rudely, pointing to the officers around him. <hi>They will themſelves give you their names.—I have now other employment,</hi> replied Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, who no longer knew what he ſaid: <hi>I demand your papers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Dumourier now ſaw that the emotion of his officers was at its height and on the point of producing ſome raſh action. He ſaid, in a firm tone, <hi>This is inſufferable. It is time to put an end to ſuch inſolence.</hi> And, in the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man language he commanded the Huſſars to enter. He then ordered the officer of the huſſars to arreſt the four de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties and the miniſter of war, but not to do them any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal injury, and to leave Beurnonville his arms.</p>
                     <p>Camus then ſaid, <hi>General Dumourier, you are about to deſtroy the Republic.—Say rather it is you, old madman,</hi> the General replied to him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="237" facs="unknown:026918_0231_0FD2618286ED8B58"/>
They were conducted into another chamber; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having dined, were conveyed in their own carriage to Tourmy, eſcorted by a ſquadron of the huſſars of Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiny. Dumourier ſent a letter to General Clairfait, ſaying that he ſent him hoſtages, who would be reſponſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the exceſſes that might be committed at Paris. He requeſted General Clairfait to treat the miniſter of war, with more diſtinction than the reſt.</p>
                     <p>Such were the facts relative to the arreſt of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners of the Convention, which was a meaſure forced on the General by circumſtances. As to the act of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering them into the hands of the Imperialiſts, it is to be remembered that Dumourier had no fortreſs in which he could keep them in ſafety, and that the Imperialiſts being as deeply concerned as himſelf in the fate of the priſoners of the Temple, they could not be placed in any hands ſo ſure. They could be detained merely as hoſtages, nor was there any danger to their perſonal ſafety, their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention being ſimply an act of precaution on the part of Dumourier. Beſides, it is to be recollected, that the Prince of Cobourg conſented to act on the footing of an auxiliary to General Dumourier, in this war, for the overthrow of the Jacobins, and for the re-eſtabliſhment of the Conſtitution. Hence theſe hoſtages were not really priſoners of the Imperialiſts, but thoſe of General Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourier, for whom they held them. The deputies and the miniſter of war were ſent to Maeſtricht, where they were kept till a change of circumſtances required their removal.</p>
                     <p>This event is one more inſtance of the blind precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion attending upon all the meaſures of the National Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention. It is to be remarked alſo, that Camus, who went poſt from Liege to vote for the death of Louis XVI. had in this, laſt inſtance, ſuddenly quitted the frontier, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the arreſt of General Dumourier, had himſelf dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the decree, and had demanded to be charged with its execution. It was therefore that he was ſo unreleuting during the conference, leſt his colleagues ſhould have yielded to perſuaſion, and ſhould have returned to Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenciennes, as they were counſelled to do by the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</p>

                     <p>IMMEDIATELY after this important event, Dumou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier ſent Colonel Montjoye to acquaint Colonel Mack with the circumſtance; and to appoint a time and place, for a conference between the General and Colonel Mack, for the purpoſe of finally concluding upon the terms of their treaty, and for ſettling the meaſures that ſhould be reciprocally taken, according to the conduct that ſhould be adopted by Dumourier's army after this deciſive period. Being informed that a congreſs of the Miniſters of the Combined Powers would ſpeedily be held at Antwerp, Dumourier ſent General Valence to Bruſſels that he might be nearer the neighbourhood of the Congreſs. During the night, Dumourier compoſed a ſhort manifeſto, which was digeſted and put into form the following day. In this, he drew up a recital of the facts of that day, and expoſed his motives for arreſting the Commiſſioners of the Convention. He particularly inſiſted on the neceſſity of poſſeſſing hoſtages, a regard for whoſe ſafety might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the crimes in which the Jacobins might otherwiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge on learning the event.</p>
                     <p>On the morning of the 3d of April, the General went to the camp, and addreſſed the troops on the part he had acted, who appeared to approve of it with enthuſiaſm. He afterward went to St. Amand, in which place were the corps of artillery, who teſtified the ſame approbation of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral's conduct, as the troops in the camp, although the moſt indefatigable zeal to ſeduce this corps was employed by the emiſſaries of the Jacobins of Valenciennes, and eſpecially by two of Dumourier's ſuperior officers, one of whom, a Lieutenant-colonel named Boubers, had received very particular obligations from the General.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="239" facs="unknown:026918_0233_0FD261842CFA5BC8"/>
Dumourier deemed it prudent to ſleep at St. Amand, for the purpoſe of marking his confidence in the troops there; and at this place Colonel Montjoye brought him the anſwer of Colonel Mack. It was agreed that the following morning the Prince of Cobourg, the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke Charles, and the Baron de Mack ſhould meet General Dumourier, between Boſſu and Conde, for the purpoſe of reſolving on the movements of the two armies, and reſpecting the direction of the ſuccours that ſhould be granted of Imperial troops in the caſe of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourier having occaſion to demand them.</p>
                     <p>The whole day of the 3d of April paſſed with as great ſucceſs as the General could expect. The army appeared of one mind, with the exception of ſome mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murs that were heard among ſome of the battalions of volunteers: and a movement which the General prepared to make on the 5th, was calculated to baniſh the ſecret means of intrigue. The General deſigned to take a new poſition with the greater part of his army near Orchies, by which means he would remove the troops from the dangerous neighbourhood of Valenciennes; would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the leiſure that belongs to a permanent camp, and in which intrigues have the greateſt ſcope for action; and would be able to menace Liſle, Douay, and Bouchain. He acknowledges that, had he adopted this plan imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately on his entering the territory of France, he would probably have been more ſucceſsful. But, at that peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od he relied on Valenciennes and Cond<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>; and, perhaps, it is to this error that the ſequel is to be attributed.</p>
                     <p>It is, however, difficult to determine at preſent what would have happened in that caſe. The character of the events of that period, is ſuch as no prudence could fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee; ſines they were the ſudden acts of the caprice of the people, which were ſubject to no calculation, and that followed each other with a rapidity to which neither foreſight nor talent could oppoſe any obſtacle. And it muſt be acknowledged that the principle which ſo abruptly detached the French ſoldiers from a General whom they had previouſly adored, has an aſpect that cannot be regarded without aprobation. They were in arms for the liberty of their country. They ſaw their General treat with the enemy. They thought themſelves betrayed, and they paſſed from an eſteem for their General to the hatred of him. They were not
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:026918_0234_0FD261C228BB7D80"/>
informed of the purport of his negotiations, nor of the care the General had taken in that treaty, of the intereſts, and honor of his country. He had not been able to do more, with reſpect to his troops, than to ſtate to them in general terms the neceſſity of changing the government, and putting an end to anarchy. They applauded the deſign; but, as the General had not aided his plan by ſeductions, nor by terrors, the firſt impreſſion wore ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily away; and the activity of the Jacobins, more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, more vigilant, and of a nature much more adapted to make impreſſions upon them, was employed with the utmoſt ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>The groſſeſt calumny takes root ſpeedily in the minds of men; but more than in any other time, in a period agitated by the doemon of anarchy. Suſpicion ripens in times of revolution, The word <hi>Traitor</hi> being once pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, the multitude endeavoured to find, in the defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this word, the exact portrait of the General, whom proclamations, but ſtill more the baſer intrigues of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, devoted to diſgrace. His prudence was now ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice; his love of the public welfare, perſonal ambition; and a ſilence dictated by his judgment, knavery. One quarter of an hour employed in the concealed labour of falſehood, ſupported by the powerful engine of corruption, effaced all ſober reflection in men, whoſe condition pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes them from much thought, and who delight in bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous and bloody ſcenes.</p>
                     <p>If we cooly examine the progreſs of the revolution, we ſhall ſee that the activity of the <hi>Gu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>llotire</hi> is the motive of the high patriotiſm of the French. The ſpectacle of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered heads, of torn limbs, carried in proceſſion throughout Paris and other cities, has begotten a terror in ſome, and in the reſt an audacious barbarity; and in both caſes has produced a deciſive effect, leading the former by fear, and the latter by the neceſſity of providing for their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity, to the endleſs multiplication of murders. The conſequence is that the blood ſpilt by this dreadful engine has converted the nation into a maſs capable of effecting aſtoniſhing objects.</p>
                     <p>Frenchmen, do not be led to ſuppoſe that the indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence with which Dumourier judges you, is an eulogium on your conduct! He deteſts your crimes. He regards the ſpecies of liberty you enjoy, as wild and incompatible with the intereſts of ſociety; and he would rather periſh on your unjuſt and permanent ſcaffold, than be the apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſt or partaker of your phr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This digreſſion faithfully paints the feelings of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourier's mind, at the dreadful period which perhaps de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided the fate of France. Agitated by the various paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſpringing from his ſituation, but ſtill directed by prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, he reſiſted the temptations of ambition. His juſtice would not permit him to be Cromwell, nor Monk, nor Coriolanus. His power was extreme, but his wiſhes mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate. And it is now a conſolation to him that he is unfortunate rather than criminal.</p>
                     <p>Dumourier received various reports every inſtant, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the diſpoſition of the garriſon of Conde. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to his moving with his army to Orchies, he ſaw the neceſſity of aſſuring himſelf perfectly of Conde; in order to arrange the movements of the Imperialiſts, his treaty with whom he dated not avow, till he ſhould have made a declaration to his troops of his ultimate views, and ſhould have commenced his march to Paris.</p>
                     <p>On the morning of the 4th, he departed from St. Amand for Conde. He had left General Thouvenot at St. Amand, to regulate various details relative to his projected movement, and to watch the public temper. An eſcort of fifty huſſars, which he ordered to attend him, not arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as he expected, and the time for his conference with the Prince of Coburg approaching, he left one of his aids-de-camp to follow him with the eſcort, and departed with the Duke de Chartres, Colonel Thouvenot, Colonel Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joye, ſome aids-de-camp, and eight huſſars; forming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether a company of about thirty perſons.</p>
                     <p>Dumourier proceeded towards Conde without any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, his thoughts being deeply engaged on ſubjects far different from the fatal event which was about to arrive, and of which he had not the leaſt preſentiment. Being within half a league of Conde, between Freſnes and Doumet, he met an officer diſpatched by General Neuilly, to inform him that the garriſon were in the greateſt fermentation, and that it would not be pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent for him to enter the place, till the commotion ſhould have ended, whether it ſhould be in his favour or againſt him. Dumourier ſent back the officer with an order to General Neuilly, to ſend the 18th regiment of cavalry to Doumet to eſcort him.</p>
                     <p>He had a little before overtaken a column of three bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talions of volunteers marching towards Conde, with their baggage and artillery. Surpriſed at this march, for which he had given no orders, he demanded of the officers where

At this time he was in the midſt of them, and had ſtopped by the ſide of a ditch to ſuffer them to paſs. He does not conceive why they did not then arreſt him.</p>
                     <p>While they were yet in fight it was that General Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illy's meſſenger arrived. Then comparing in his mind the tum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>At this inſtant, the head of the column ſuddenly quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the high road, and ran toward him, uttering dreadful cries. He then remounted his horſe, and proceeded at a moderate pace toward a broad ditch, on the other ſide of which was a marſhy ground. Shouts, inſults, reproaches, and above all the words, <hi>ſtop ſtop,</hi> forced him to paſs the ditch. His horſe having refuſed to take it, he was obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to clear it on foot. He was no ſooner on the other ſide, than a diſcharge of muſkets ſucceeded the former tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous cries. The whole column was inſtantly in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the head and centre endeavouring to overtake him, and the rear quitting the high road with equal rapidity, to get between him and the camp of Bruille, which he was endeavouring to regain.</p>
                     <p>He was now in the moſt imminent danger. He was on foot. The Baron de Scomberg threw himſelf from his horſe, and inſiſted on the general's mounting, though with the certain ſacrifice of his own life. The general refuſed. At length he mounted a horſe belonging to a domeſtic of the Duke de Chartres, who, being extremely active, fled on foot. Dumourier's horſe was taken and led in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph to Valenciennes. Two huſſars were killed, as well as two of the general's domeſtics, one of whom carried his great coat. Colonel Thouvenot had two horſes kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led under him, and ſaved himſelf at laſt by mounting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the faithful Baptiſte, who alſo loſt two horſes. The unfortunate Cantin, the general's ſecretary, was taken and periſhed on a ſcaffold. This young man poſſeſſed great underſtanding, courage, fidelity, and patriotiſm. The three battalions fired more than ten thouſand ball.</p>

The general, unable to regain his camp, proceeded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the Scheldt, and arrived, ſtill purſued, though not ſo cloſely, at a ferry, a little diſtance from the village of Wihers, which was ſituated on the Imperial territory. He paſſed the river, accompanied by five other perſons. The remainder gained the camp of Maulde, through a diſcharge of muſquetry. As ſoon as the general had paſſed the river he proceeded on foot through a moraſs, to a neighbouring houſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> where, at firſt he was refuſed admittance, but on announcing his name was immediately received by the worthy owner. Thence he continued his route on foot to Bury, where was quartered a diviſion of the Imperial regiment of dragoons of la Tour. Here he wrote to Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel Mack, and took ſome refreſhment, of which he ſtood greatly in need. He was already joined by the faithful Baptiſte, who, paſſing through the whole of the camp, had turned by Montagne, and had every where ſpread an alarm.</p>
                     <p>Dumourier learnt from Baptiſte, and other perſons du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the courſe of the day, that the deſigns of the three battalions were entirely unknown to the troops; that, on the news of their deſertion and attempt to murder the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral being ſpread, the ſtrongeſt indignation was expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſoldiery; and that the eſcort of huſſars and ſome other horſe had purſued the three battalions, who ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wheeling, had fled to Valenciennes, Baptiſte added, that the whole camp was in a ſtate of the greateſt inquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and importunately demanded the return of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</p>
                     <p>It was now too late to rejoin his army, and it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that he ſhould wait for Colonel Mack, to whom he owed an account of the reaſon of his failing in the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the morning. That officer arrived in the eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; and Dumourier having recited to him the attempt which had been made on his perſon, obſerved, that this was the crime of individuals, which far from corrupting the diſpoſition of his troops, would neceſſarily ſtrengthen their attachment to their General. and deſtroy all their remaining connection with the anarchiſts; that conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, far from being diſcouraged, his deſign was to return to his camp by day-break the following morning, to put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at the head of his ſoldiers who loudly demanded his return, and to purſue his plan openly and with the utmoſt vigour.</p>

Colonel Mack, to whom the military virtues were fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar, has ſince acknowledged that this ſpecies of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage then appeared to him more aſtoniſhing than that which is diſplayed in the dangers of a battle. Had he then ſeen all the ſoul of Dumourier, he would have found this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent ſecurity mingled with apprehenſion, excited by the example and fate of La Fayette. But the general's reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution was taken. He reſolved to ſacrifice himſelf through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out; and would not give his army occaſion to ſay, that the deſertion was on his part, or that, being recalled by his ſoldiers, he had reſiſted their wiſhes.</p>
                     <p>Dumourier paſſed part of the night in digeſting, with Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel Mack, the proclamation of the Prince of Cobourg, which appeared on the 5th of April, with that of General Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourier. The Imperial General in his proclamation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that he was now no more than an auxiliary in the war, againſt the anarchiſts of France; that it was not the intention of his ſovereign to make conqueſts, but to co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, in reſtoring peace and order to France, with Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Dumourier, whoſe principles, as they were expreſſed in his proclamation, he adopted.</p>
                     <p>It was again agreed by Colonel Mack, and Dumourier, that, as ſoon as the latter ſhould be maſter of Conde, he ſhould deliver it to the Auſtrians, in order to ſerve as a magazine and place of arms for the Imperial army, in the caſe of aid being demanded by Dumourier; that he ſhould be inſtantly furniſhed with ſuch ſuccours as he ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; that he ſhould ſpecify the number of infantry and cavalry to be granted him, the mode in which theſe ſhould ſerve, whether by a junction with his troops, or by mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one or more ſeparate diverſions in behalf of the cauſe; that, however, Dumourier ſhould not call for ſuccours, but in caſe of abſolute need, it being more agreeable to the mutual object of the parties, that he ſhould endeavour to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh it by his own troops only; and that, in caſe of his being able to do ſo, the Imperialiſts ſhould remain neuter, and ſhould not paſs the frontiers of France.</p>
                     <p>The proclamation of the Prince of Cobourg, made in conſequence of this negociation, has been condemned but unjuſtly. Of what real advantage had it not been to the Imperialiſts, and what ſolid glory had they not acquired, if, by enabling Dumourier to march to Paris, they could by this noble moderation have ſpared the blood and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="245" facs="unknown:026918_0239_0FD26188B1B84580"/>
that may be acquired with infinite difficulty will be no manner of compenſation.</p>
                     <p>It is to be feared that an avidity for conqueſts among the belligerent powers is the real obſtacle to the termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this deſtructive war. By this paſſion they were prevented from ſeizing upon the occaſion offered, by the departure of General Dumourier, and the conſequent annihilation of his army, of preſſing forward to Paris. The combined powers have ſince loſt their time in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a methodical war, while the French have been able to recover themſelves, and their armies have become more numerous, and better diſciplined.</p>
                     <p>On the 5th of April at day-break, Dumourier pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded with an eſcort of fifty Imperial dragoons to the advanced guard of his camp at Maulde, where he was received with the greateſt joy. He harangued the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral corps, by whom he was anſwered with expreſſions of affection. Notwithſtanding, he remarked that there were ſome indications of a contrary ſpirit, and ſeveral factious groups aſſembled in different parts.</p>
                     <p>His next deſign was to go to St. Amand, to prepare for the movement of his troops to Orchies, according to his former plan. As he was entering the city, one of his aids-de-camp came toward him on the full gallop, and informed him that during the night the corps of artillery, excited by the emiſſaries of Valenciennes, who had ſpread the report that the general was drowned in the Scheldt in flying to the enemy, had ſent a deputation to Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciennes, and that on the return of their deputies they had inſtantly roſe upon their generals, driven them from the place, and were preparing to march to Valenci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ennes.</p>
                     <p>Dumourier had with him, two ſquadrons of the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Berchiny, a ſquadron of the huſſars of Saxe, fifty curiaſſiers, and a ſquadron of the dragoons of Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon. Yielding to his emotions of paſſion, he reſolved to fall upon St. Amand with this body of cavalry. His officers, however, repreſented the danger and inutility of this ſtep, as he had no infantry at hand, and would ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject his eſcort to be mown down by the artillery. He gave way to their reaſoning. He learnt ſhortly after that the corps of artillery went to Valenciennes. The money belonging to the army and the equipages of the officers remaining in the city without guard, he commanded them to be conducted to Rumegies, at the diſtance of a
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:026918_0240_0FD261C65A146058"/>
league from his camp, on the road to Orchies, that village being protected by a part of his advanced guard cantoned there.</p>
                     <p>The corps of artillery was the ſlower and ſtrength of the French army. Feeling its importance, it abounded more than the others in clubs and orators, and indeed, might paſs for the Pretorian guard of the revolution. When its deſertion was known in the two camps, part of the troops followed, and confuſion and diſmay were ſpread among, the reſt. Several of the general officers who waited for the opportunity were eager to lead entire diviſions to Valenciennes. Thoſe who ſtill remained attached to the perſon, or principles of Dumourier, inſtead of ſhewing themſelves to their troops, and ſetting an example of courage, were ſtruck with terror, conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves, or thought only of their own ſafety. General La Marlier had been among the moſt forward of the enemies of Anarchy, and poſſeſſed the entire confidence of General Valenec; who, when he depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from Bruſſels, confided the whole of his baggage and effects to him, with a requeſt that he would ſend them alter Valence to Tournay. La Marlier appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated the money, horſes, and property of his general to his own uſe, and deſerted to Valenciennes.</p>
                     <p>Dumourier was at Rumegies, dictating, orders to be iſſued to the different parts of the army, when he heard of the defection of the troops in camp. Nothing was left him now but to provide for his perſonal ſafety. He mounted his horſe, attended by General Thou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>not, and his brother the colonel, the Duke de Chartresy Colonel Montjoye, and Lieutenant-colonel Barrois, two or three others of his ſtaff, and ſome Aids-de-camp, having no eſcort; and retiring to Tournay alighted at the quarters of General Clairfait. He was followed in about an hour afterward, by fifty Cuiraſſiers, half a ſquadron of the huſſars of Saxe, and the whole of the regiment of Berchiny. Thoſe brave and worthy men, brought with them the equipages belonging to the general and the ſtaff officers, excepting the ſaddle horſes of the general, which were ſtolen by one of his grooms, who joined the anarchiſts.</p>
                     <p>The troops of which we have juſt ſpoken and a few others that arrived ſhortly afterward, amounting to about ſeven hundred horſe, and eight hundred infantry, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the General without any ſolicitation on his part;
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:026918_0241_0FD2618B149B0640"/>
and this circumſtance renders him the more anxious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the ſate of thoſe men, the companions of his former glory, and of his laſt diſgrace.</p>
                     <p>Dumourier in retiring from France invited no one to follow him. His plan had totally failed, and a few men more or leſs on either ſide would not influence events. The individuals attached to his cauſe had ties of family and of intereſt in France, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved not to multiply misfortunes without benefit. Thoſe who followed him, therefore, had the real merit of being guided by principle.</p>
                     <p>In the confuſion that ſucceeded the General's depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, none of the orders that had been iſſued were exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted. Lieutenant-general Vouille, who commanded the advanced guard, did not receive the order of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing it within the camp of Maulde till the 6th, when it was no longer in his power. The General retired to Tournay, as did alſo Major-general Neuilly, who had abandoned Conde, Major-general de Bannes, Second, and de Dumas, and ſome of the principal officers of the battalions of Volunteers; where they were afterward joined by Lieuitenant-general Maraſſe, Major Generals Rault and Berneron, and Colonel Arnaudin.</p>
                     <p>The treaſury of the Army contained two millions of livres in ſpecie. It had been carried from St. Amand to Furnes, between Conde and Valenciennes, by a battalion of Chaſſeurs, who at firſt deliberated reſpecting the dividing of it among themſelves, but afterward being likely to quarrel, in order to avoid the bloodſhed that would enſue, made a merit of their patriotiſm and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted it to Valenciennes. Soliva, a commiſſary of the army of the Ardennes, purſued theſe troops with a ſquadron of the dragoons of Bourbon, retook the money of the Glacis of Valencienoes, and led it back to Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas: but being preſſed by new battalions was again obliged to adandon it. Soliva and the dragoons retired by Mons. They might have brought off the money had they paſſed by Bruille, and Mortagne, but the confuſion of the moment prevented recollection and foreſight. If the treaſury of the army had been ſaved, the General's ſituation had been very different; and the little army that followed his fortunes, would have encreaſed rapidly, being in a ſtate to pay them, inſtead of being as he really was, without money, This circumſtance proves, that the pay of the army was not embezzled by him, nor em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:026918_0242_0FD261C969D8B908"/>
as a means of corruption. Dumourier placed little confidence in means of corruption, in which as the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of a party his conduct was greatly erroneous.</p>
                     <p>Dumourier had not the qualities that were requiſite for the leader of a party. It is probable that he would have filled the ſtation of a General or an Ambaſſador with ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, under a ſtable government, whether monarchical, or republican. But the violent ſtate of things in France, deſtructive of all his pre-conceived ideas of juſtice, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, threw him entirely out of his ſphere. His acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, ſo greatly ſpoken of even by his enemies, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by his dread of committing crimes; and he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred his own eſteem to ſucceſs. Thus in his firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, after his retreat among the Imperialiſts, he ſaw the cauſe of his failure in himſelf, but he felicitated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on the fact. To have ſwayed the fortune of France, had undoubtedly given him a noble place in hiſtory; but to have been indebted for it to the flagitiouſneſs of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, was too ſevere a condition; and he was happy in reſigning one to eſcape the other.</p>
                     <p>He invites men of high ſtations to examine themſelves with the ſame auſterity; and moraliſts, to ſtudy the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which character has on events. Caeſar and Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey, determined a noble quarrel by noble means, and on both ſides were diſplayed greatneſs of mind, virtues, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ents. Had thoſe men been ſurrounded with the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt vices of the meaneſt claſſes in ſociety, they would have fled, or would have fallen victims. It demands a Maa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niello to conduct the populace, But when a great nation becomes an entire populace, neighbouring nations are thrown into the greateſt embarraſſment; becauſe the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tric ſpirit ſpreads with more rapidity among the people, than among the higher orders of men.</p>

Mons, accompanied by the Duke de Chartres, Colonel Thouvenot, Colonel Montjoye, and Lieutenant Colonel Barrois, paſſing by Bury, to concert meaſures with the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer commanding the Imperial advanced poſt, for protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the retreat of ſuch of the French as ſhould join the Imperialiſts.</p>
                     <p>The Imperialiſts were faithful to their truce. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that had they fallen on the French camp on the 5th of April, they might have utterly deſtroyed the army. Their conduct was therefore highly honourable: yet, without incurring the blame of perſidy, perhaps on that day they ought to have made a movement with their army, taking poſſeſſion of the camp of Maulde, and ſhewing themſelves at St. Amand: they not only would have found no reſiſtance, but probably would have been joined by ſeveral battalions of the French, which during more than four-and-twenty hours, appeared by their movements to be irreſolute as to the conduct they ſhould purſue. But however this may be, the ſidelity of the Imperialiſts to their engagements, is to be applauded. Their motives were moſt worthy, as well as the generoſity with which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the French refugees, who had certainly been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the braveſt of their enemies.</p>
                     <p>Dumourier found Colonel Mack at Bury, from which place they departed together for Mons, in the genaral's carriage. It was agreed between them, that the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialiſts ſhould inſtantly beſiege Conde, and that the place ſhould be ſummoned in the name of General Dumourier, who accordingly wrote the ſummons and ſent it the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing day to the Imperial head quarters. It was further agreed that a return ſhould be made of the officers and ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers which accompanied or followed Dumourier; that conſidering their having unfortunately loſt their military cheſt, they ſhould receive the pay of their reſpective ranks, at the rate that officers of the ſame rank in the Imperial ſervice were paid, and ſhould be placed on the ſame foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; that a commiſſary of war belonging to the Imperial army ſhould be attached to theſe troops, together with a French commiſſary, to certify the juſtice of the returns; that an advance ſhould be made from the Imperial trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury of 30,000 florins, which ſhould be put into the hands of the French ſtaff officers for the pay of their troops, that Dumourier ſhould have the rank, and eſtabliſhment of <hi>Feld-zeugmeiſter</hi> (general of the artillery); and that fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, this pay and advance ſhould be regarded as a loan to the party of Dumourier, and that the general ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, as ſoon as any progreſs ſhould be made in France.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="250" facs="unknown:026918_0244_0FD261CB736D5FF0"/>
It is a conſolation to General Dumourier, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions of his mifortunes continue to enjoy this eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Indeed they have, ſince that period, been ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the condition of taking an oath, which was not in the firſt inſtance required; but at that period they were the ſoldiers of a party which no longer exiſts, and it has been ſince deemed neceſſary to demand that ſecurity for their fidelity. Dumourier would himſelf become their pledge with readineſe, having throughout the war tried their fidelity, courage, and reſignation. Let them accept of this teſtimony of the eſteem and affection of their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and may they be recompenſed for their virtues in contributing to the ſucceſs of the power whom they will faithfully ſerve.</p>
                     <p>In purſuance of theſe arrangments, Dumourier cauſed, by the order of the Prince of Cobourg, 10,000 florins to be advanced to the French troops at Leuze; unwilling, through motives of delicacy, to take the whole of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney agreed to be advanced, becauſe in penetrating ſpeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily into France this ſum would have ſerved till they could have proceeded further into the interior part of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and Dumourier appeals to the Prince of Cobourg, Colonel Mack, and the other principal officers of the Imperial army, reſpecting the clearneſs and diſitereſtedneſs of his conduct. It was further decided that the general, till he ſhould be employed with his troops, ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with quarters, near thoſe of the Prince of Cobourg; and the Imperial head quarters being eſtabliſhed at Bouſſu, General Dumourier's quarters were fixed at the abbey of St. Ghiſlain.</p>
                     <p>Dumourier makes here an avowal of his gratitude to the general officers of the Imperial army, by whom he was treated with diſtinguiſhed marks of regard, and more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly by the Archduke Charles, and the Prince of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg. At this time was formed a friendſhip between Colonel Mack and Dumourier, which on the part of the latter will never be diminiſhed. Colonel Mack is an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer of uncommon virtue, and military talents, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded confidence placed in him by the Imperial army is the juſt recompence of his ſervices. It is greatly to be hoped, for the intereſt of the houſe of Auſtria, that the health of this officer will be reſtored.</p>
                     <p>During two days that Dumourier was at Mons, he was treated by the inabitants in a manner that is flattering to his own honour; and his reception was the ſame at Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay, Le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

he had rendered them, eſpecially on his return from Holland and during the retreat of his army to France.</p>
                     <p>It would be injuſtice not to name an inſtance of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate attention of the Prince of Cobourg to Dumourier's ſituation. The General ſeeing a corps of two hundred chaſſeurs belonging to the emigrants, as they paſſed thro' Mons, on their route to join the advanced guard of the army, repreſented to the Prince of Cobourg, that this mingling of the emigrants with his troops could not but produce fatal effects, eſpecially on entering France; and the Prince of Cobourg inſtantly gave counter orders to the chaſſeurs; ſending them by Namur, to ſerve in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced guard of the Prince of Hohenloe.</p>
                     <p>The Prince of Lambeſc-Lorraine teſtified alſo to the general his gratitude for the eſſential ſervice rendered to his houſe by Dumourier when he was Miniſter of Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Affairs, in preventing an unjuſt confiſcation of his property, and of that of the Princeſs of Vaudemont.</p>
                     <p>On the 7th of April, the Prince of Cobourg departed, with Colonel Mack, to attend the Congreſs, held at Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp; from which place he returned on the evening of the 8th. Dumourier paſſed thoſe two days at Leuze, in the midſt of his comrades, whoſe uneaſineſs he diſſipated by informing them of the eſtabliſhments made for them by the Imperialiſts. General Vouille took the command of theſe troops; and Dumourier, aſſiſted by General Thouvenot, began to reform them, according to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations of the Imperial army; which was the more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, as the refugees were compoſed only of fragments of the different corps; with the exception of the regiment of Berchiny. Dumourier quitted the companions of his misfortunes on the evening of the 8th, and felt ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiment that he ſhould not return to them. On the morning of the 9th he arrived at Mons, where he found the Prince of Cobourg, ſetting off for his head quarters. Dumourier went there alſo; and after treating further on what regarded their mutual intereſts, he went in the eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the quarters which had been prepared for him at the abbey of St. Ghiſlain.</p>
                     <p>On the morning of the 10th of April, a proclamation of the Prince of Cobourg was brought to Dumourier, dated the 9th, which entirely annulled the former proclamation of the 5th; and expreſsly declared, that the Prince of Cobourg would thenceforth carry on the war againſt France, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

The emigrants have had the imprudence to rejoice at the iſſuing of this latter, and to condemn the former. It might be demanded if theſe emigrants were Frenchmen. But, ſetting aſide the influence of paſſions, by which not only individuals, but alſo the governments intereſted in this war are Influenced, it will appear but too true, that the ſecond proclamation of the Prince of Cobourg in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving Dumourier's party of all means of acting in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert, and in ſetting forth the belligerent powers as rapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious conquerors, has attached the whole of the French armies to the intereſt of the National Convention, which the greater part of them had previouſly deteſted; has compelled the cauſe of royalty to be forgot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>This ſecond proclamation was iſſued at the concluſion of the Congreſs at Antwerp, in conſequence of the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the miniſters of the combined powers. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourier now ſaw that his treaty with the Imperialiſts was entirely deſtroyed; and, without offering uſeleſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of this ſudden change in the councils of the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialiſts, he conſulted only his character, and principles, and reſolved to ſacrifice all his perſonal intereſts.</p>
                     <p>He repaired inſtantly to the head quarters, and told the Prince of Cobourg frankly, that he came to thank him for the perſonal kindneſſes he had rendered him, and that he hoped to continue to merit his eſteem; that when he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into a treaty with the Prince of Cobourg, his object was the regeneraton of France, and not its diſmember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that he would not enter into any diſcuſſion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the motives of the combined powers; but that for his part, he could have no ſhare in leſſening the territory of France, or employ either his influence, or his mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate talents, in that taſk; and that therefore he felt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf obliged to withdraw from the coalition, and muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech the Prince of Cobourg to grant him a paſſport.</p>
                     <p>The Prince of Cobourg could not forbear to expreſs his high eſteem of his delicacy. The Arch Duke Charles, and Colonel Mack, alſo expreſſed their eſteem for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; and he departed for Bruſſels. Dumourier can have no doubt that, after a direct violation of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the treaty that had taken place, and after an open diſavowal of the proclamation iſſued in conſequence of

that treaty, his preſence muſt have been embarraſſing to the Imperialiſts, and that they regarded the reſolution he took with pleaſure. But it was not long that he left them in any perplexity, his reſolution was taken the moment he perceived ther deſigns.</p>
                     <p>Before Dumourier quitted the Imperial army, he had the ſatisfaction of knowing that his former companions would be continued in their rank and employments. They are well treated and ſerve in the Imperial army, where aſſuredly they will ſupport their reputation.</p>
                     <p>Being arrived at Bruſſels, he explained the motives of his conduct to the Count de Metternich, the emperor's miniſter in the Netherlands, who received him with the greateſt friendſhip, and gave him a paſſport for Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</p>
                     <p>In this place the memoirs of the public life of General Dumourier are concluded. The remainder of his life has been filled up with difficulties, dangers, perſecutions, and calumnies of every kind, of which he may one day render an account to the public.

                     <p>SUCH is the ſeries of events in three of the moſt diſaſtrous months of General Dumourier's life. In this ſhort period he has experienced all the miſeries, and all the dangers, that the weakneſs and wickedneſs of man can inflict upon a public character. Calumny and injuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice form the outline of this dark picture, which may ſerve as a leſſon to men of every deſcription, and from which philoſophy alone can extract thoſe conſolatory reflections which propriety of conduct and rectitude of motive ſupply. He hates, neither thoſe who have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famed his character, nor thoſe who have purſued his life, nor thoſe who have refuſed him an aſylum, and whoſe ungenerous and ill founded refentment perſecutes him wherever he flies. The firſt, are ignorant of the true ſtate of thoſe facts, which, from their very ſingularity, are exceedingly liable to miſrepreſentation. The ſecond,
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:026918_0248_0FD261D38CAEA888"/>
are actuated by that ſpirit of fanaticiſm, which is reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able proof. The third, are prejudiced by calumny, and conſider him as a dangerous character.</p>
                     <p>The Miniſters of foreign courts have given it out, after the Emigrants, that he is a proper object of ſuſpicion, and that they can never be ſure he will not veer about and put himſelf at the head of the French. His pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, and his three declarations, ought to be a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient pledge of his firmneſs: thoſe three pieces have raiſed him many enemies by the perverſe miſconſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion given to his expreſſions.</p>
                     <p>He avows that he paſſionately loves his country, and that he will never heſitate a moment to ſacrifice his life to its welfare; but he declares, at the ſame time, that whilſt it is polluted with crimes, and delivered over to the horrors of anarchy, he will never enter it again: that, proſcribed, as he is, and an outcaſt of ſociety, he prefers all the miſeries and all the dangers he may incur, to the moſt ſplendid ſituation in which the oppreſſors of his countrymen, and the inciters of their mad exceſſes, could place him.</p>
                     <p>He has been the open enemy of thoſe powers who wiſhed to interfere in the internal affairs of his country, both whilſt he was a miniſter, and whilſt he was a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; becauſe he was moſt firmly perſuaded, that the Revolution which was doubtleſs, expedient and inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, would have been accompliſhed, not only with innocence, but glory, if foreign interference and the open incouragement given to the emigrants, had not exaſperated to madneſs a people by nature impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and violent. After licentiouſneſs and anarchy had deſtroyed every thing in France, he wiſhed to avail him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of the ſame foreign powers to re-eſtabliſh order, not merely without injury to his country, but with the moſt tender regard for its intereſt and its glory.</p>
                     <p>When he ſaw that this became impracticable, he form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the plan of a diverſion, by which he conceived he might eſſentially ſerve the cauſe of his country and of Europe. Diſtruſt or other motives, prevented its exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. He grieves at the protraction of the ſufferings of human nature: he fighs impatiently for the termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this cala<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It has been ſaid that he was bribed over by the Dutch Patriots, and afterward ſold to the Prince of Orange a liſt of the principal conſpirators. This abſurd imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion appears in a German work on the French Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, called Minerva, much eſteemed for the beauty of its ſtyle. The author has certainly been deceived in this as well as in many other cicumſtances, of General Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourier's life, which the natural love of the marvellous has conſtantly magnified and blackened. He declares, that he never poſſeſſed a liſt of the Dutch Patriots, that he knew only a very ſmall party of theſe refugees in France, that he knew theſe only becauſe they formed a Batavian Revolutionary Committee at Antwerp; that he does not know the names of any of thoſe who may enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the ſame opinions in Holland; that he has never had any communication, either before or ſince, with the Stadtholder's party; that it is even impoſſible ſuch a communication ſhould have exiſted, as that court never forgave the manifeſto which preceded his expedition into Holland; that he never received a bribe; that he is poor, and glories in being ſo.</p>
                     <p>He will conclude theſe Memoirs with ſome observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the three claſſes of French emigrants. Foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are ſurpriſed, that they ſhould not unite in their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, becauſe they are unacquainted with their diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing characters. Their diviſions are a great misfortune, but they are almoſt without a remedy.</p>
                     <p>The firſt claſs, of which the Princes of the Houſe of Bourbon are the leaders, conſiſts of the old court, the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er order of eccleſiaſtics, the parliaments, and the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal financial department. Allured by the ſeductive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of this party on the one hand, and terrified by the extravagance of the Jacobins on the other, the low no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſſe have been induced to join them in military array. This claſs is compoſed of pure Royaliſts: they wiſh and demand the re-eſtabliſhment of the ancient monarchy, and of courſe, of abſolute deſpotiſm; and regret the old inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions with all their abuſes, inſtitutions which it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible ſhould ever re-appear, ſince a new order of things has rendered France no longer the France of former days, but a new nation, requiring as a new nation, a new mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and political conſtitution, to re-eſtabliſh on the broad baſis of general utility the ſecurity of the government, and the confidence of the people.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="256" facs="unknown:026918_0250_0FD261D469FCAC28"/>
The ſecond claſs, of which Fayette is the apparent leader, conſiſts of the conſtitutional monarchiſts, men who deſire a great reformation, or rather a total reformation, in the principles and forms of the old government. The greater part of this claſs were employed in the firſt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Aſſembly in the great work of forming the New Conſtitution; but falling, as they ſoon did, a ſacrifice to the cabals of the people of Paris, and above all to the frantic exceſſes of the Jacobins, paid dearly for the propagation of thoſe principles of Liberty and Equality, which, having been originally laid down by themſelves without any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification, and taken up by the people in too groſs and literal a ſenſe, were puſhed to that extravagant extent, which has brought about the ſubverſion of all the eſtates, and the general anarchy of France.</p>
                     <p>The third claſs, which is ſcarcely diſtinguiſhable from the former, but by the later date of their defection conſiſts of the military who followed General Dumourier: and all the nobles proſcribed on this occaſion, who could eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape from their country. This claſs includes all thoſe members of the National Convention who had the courage to vote in favour of Louis XVI. and againſt all the abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations which reſulted from his execution; and who, having atteſted their wiſhes in a proteſt had the good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to eſcape.</p>
                     <p>The firſt claſs, the moſt numerous, the moſt ſplendid, the moſt diffuſed over Europe, and the moſt favoured by its attentions —by little effectual aid, but great promiſes, and ſtill oftener by humiliations and caprice, poſſeſſes the moſt decided averſion to the two others; and confounds them in its ignorant preſumption with the Jacobins them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. The unjuſt impriſonment of Fayette excites in their boſoms no mercy for that unfortunate General. But againſt Dumourier, they level all their rage: and the zeal with which they calumniate his character, augment his diſtreſſes, and encourage his univerſal proſcription, is truly ſurpriſing.</p>
                     <p>This claſs has preſerved all its pride and all its preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. It will have every thing or nothing. The laſt ſucceſs of the Combined Armies fills them with frantic joy; and nothing is heard but offenſive ſchemes of revenge and perſonal ambition.

extravagant and always diſguſtful to the people where they reſide, who coolly obſerve their motions, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, with ſome plauſibility, that ſelfiſhneſs is their ſole leading principle, they have the preſumption to think that all Europe is only armed for their ſakes, and that when they re-enter their country, where they will recogniſe nothing—not even the veſtiges of their demoliſhed villas, they ſhall take poſſeſſion of their town-manſions, their country cottages, their elegant luxuries, their domeſtics, their dependents, and above all their power, and their credit.</p>
                     <p>The intolerance of this claſs of emigrants towards the two others precludes that union which is ſo eſſentially ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in their preſent unfortunate ſituation, were it only to excite, the attention and compaſſion of the ſeveral States where they have fled for protection, and rove without a ſettlement. There are notwithſtanding in this claſs, ſome few individuals of ſenſe borne away in the general maſs by their unlucky ſituation, and the prejudices of their birth, who from an exception to the general rule, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely reprobate the extravagance of the reſt, but they are little attended to. This claſs is divided too, within itſelf, into factions as active, as intriguing, as full of bickerings and jealouſies, as when it glittered at Paris or Verſailles. It is a court itinerant, which has loſt nothing of its occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, though deprived of its ſtability.</p>
                     <p>The other two claſſes of emigrants are infinitely more moderate and reaſonable, and might ſoon be brought to coaleſce. Fayette and Dumourier, if they met in any other place than a priſon, would ſoon underſtand each other; and the ſhades of difference, which have hitherto only ſeparated them, perhaps for want of a due explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, would melt away, and vaniſh before the common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of their country, and the common ſufferings of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. For theſe two chiefs, and theſe two claſſes have both been ſtrenuous for the eſtabliſhment of liberty in their country, and the reformation of abuſes. They have ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with firmneſs the great cauſe of human nature, and, if they have differed in the means, they have agreed in the principle.</p>
                     <p>General Dumourier declares to the emigrants of every deſcription, whom force or inclination, has ſeparated from their country, that it is only by a well cemented union they can acquire that conſideration, which alone can bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their ſituation at the cloſe of the war, whether they ſucceed in returning to their country, or whether they are
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:026918_0252_0FD261D5F3F6C3D0"/>
doomed to relinquiſh it forever: that it is the advantage of misfortune to purify the mind, and to temper it for the hardier virtues: that it is time to renounce the language of prejudice, ſince it is no longer underſtood in France: that, that country is more different from the France of 1788, than from Gaul in Julius Caeſar's time; that it even changes every ſix months; and, that unfortunately the Jacobins have been more prudential in the gradations of their crimes, than the emigrants, who, without giving themſelves the trouble to examine the progreſs of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional genius, build all their ſchemes on the ſtate of France at the point of time that they left it.</p>
                     <p>Their unfortunate ſituation may continue a long time, it may become utterly without a remedy: the worſt ſhould always be ſuppoſed, that we may not be miſled by falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious expectations. If they don't perſiſt, in ſhaking off their arrogance, their extravagance, their imprudence, their internal diſcord they will ſoon diſguſt the people who give them ſhelter, and whoſe temper will inſallibly be ſoured on a thouſand occaſions by the war, their minds will not be fortified to bear the triumphs of ſucceſs, or the deſperation of a failure: in the firſt caſe, they will abuſe their return, and be driven into a baniſhment more hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs than their preſent one; in the ſecond, they will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the moſt wretched men upon the face of the earth.</p>
                     <p>Baniſhment, like every other condition of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, has its advantages. It gives us objects of compariſon, of which we would never otherwiſe have an idea; it gives us information; it calls forth our energies by its difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; it renders us indulgent and ſociable, it excites be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ourſelves and our protectors a reciprocation of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility and benevolence. The upright man, the man of wiſdom and reflection, brings back from this involuntary pilgrimage, a ſtore of thoſe hardy and of thoſe gentle vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, which qualify him better to benefit his country, and lead to that univerſal philanthropy which dimiſhes the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal effects of national partialities.</p>
                     <p>General Dumourier gives them another piece of advice, which he carefully obſerves himſelf—to be indulgent to their countrymen, and not to revile a whole nation by too indiſcriminate reproaches. It is <hi>imprudent,</hi> at leaſt, to brand as rebels twenty millions of men who riſe againſt a hundred thouſand.

                     <p>They ſhould never calumniate the nation at large: they may juſtly lament that the French are blindfolded, and led through crimes into every extravagance. But there is one point of view which is conſolatory to every true Frenchman: he ſees through all this anarchy, a moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined courage, and the greateſt frankneſs of opinion. With theſe qualities the French may be brought back from their errors; but it is by reaſon, and not by reproaches, that this can be accompliſhed. Let thoſe among the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grants whoſe ſituation, whoſe influence, and whoſe know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, may one day call them to the important duty of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhing order in France, let theſe men fit themſelves for reclaiming the public opinion, by inſtantly ſacrificing their reſentment, of whatever nature, or however juſt, and ceaſing to exaſperate by invectives the whole of, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of France. The character of that people may be eclipſed for a time, but will never be entirely obliterated, and what is crime in ſome few individuals, is energy in the nation at large.</p>
                     <p>The hiſtory of the world does not preſent an inſtance of a nation aſſailed by ſo many enemies at once, leſs terrified at the thunder of the charge, or keeping them at bay in every quarter with ſuch obſtinate reſolution. The laſt campaign, which was enough to have cruſhed them at once, only diſplayed one general maſs of valour; and if they yield, the next campaign, they will be ſubdued, but they will not be degraded. It is greatly the intereſt of the emigrants that the French ſhould not be deſpiſed; for whatever their nation may ſuffer in the eſtimation of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, will be a loſs to themſelves. They have already, for the laſt two years, been guilty of a great miſtake in repreſenting to foreign powers that the French armies were contemptible, and utterly incapable of making any reſiſtance. This miſtake, which has proved ſo fatal to the Pruſſians, has taken away all credit from their reports. Let us never hear ſuch miſrepreſentations again—They are much too ſerious.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="260" facs="unknown:026918_0254_0FD261D77059E248"/>
The French nation, collectively taken, will always be amiable. She is labouring at this moment under a moral diſtemper, whoſe dreadful convulſions only render her a greater object of alarm. Foreigners may employ the ſword, but her emigrant offspring ſhould only approach her with the ſoothing accents of perſuaſion: — it is their intereſt to do ſo: their deſign of ſuperinducing order on that confuſion which has driven them from their country, will, otherwiſe, every month and every week, become more perfectly hopeleſs.</p>
                     <p>This advice is not the reſult of baſe compliance, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal intereſt, or ambition. General Dumourier declares, and his Memoirs will prove, that he reprobates the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate of things in France; that he ſees in them only the ſubverſion of every rational principle, and the utter impracticability of promoting public happineſs; he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, that he will never warp to ſuch an order of things; and that he would chuſe beggary, proſcription, wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and perpetual exile, in preference to any re-eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his country that muſt be purchaſed by the ſacrifice of his moral principles, — but he declares, too, that he loves his countrymen, and that were he poignarded in their delirium tomorrow, he would breathe out his laſt accents, in a lamentation of their errors, and a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to his country.</p>

                     <head>Monthly Review. SAMUEL HARRISON SMITH, SUBMITS TO THE PATRONAGE OF THE CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES, THE RE-PUBLICATION OF THE MONTHLY REVIEW, ENLARGED.</head>
                     <p>IN ſelecting this work for the preſs, the Publiſher's candor obliges him to ſay that views of a pecuniary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion had a primary influence on his conduct; but his feelings will not permit him to withhold the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration that a conſciouſneſs of the many advantages at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant on its circulation, if it did not originate, at leaſt, fixed his wavering reſolution. Its ſubſervience to the leading principles on which our preſent proſperity depends, and on which alone our future well-being can be ſecured, renders it an object worthy of public regard. If the diffuſion of the Monthly Review can be ſhewn to carry with it theſe important benefits, the Printer cannot heſitate a moment in the aſſurance, that it will meet with a warm and general ſupport. For the ſatisfaction of thoſe who may not have an opportunity of recurring to the work itſelf, a ſhort account of its nature, its tendency, and its execution, is preſented.</p>
                     <p>I. IT profeſſes to be a review of all the original publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations that appear in Great Britain, and ſuch of thoſe written on the Continent as are deemed works of merit. In this review, the author's principles, talents, and infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation are teſted by the rules of ſcience and criticiſm, a deciſion is pronounced, which if equitably made, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther holds forth his offspring to cordial patronage, or cold neglect. The reader of the Review is not dictated to by the writer of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

to his opinion, through a deficiency of materials qualify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to form a judgment himſelf; he is enabled to judge both of the merit of the original, and the juſtice of the criticiſm, by copious extracts, which are uſually made from all works of an intereſting nature.</p>
                     <p>IN theſe performances, information and criticiſm are happily blended. To uſeful and improving narrative are added intereſting argument and ſpirited diſcuſſion; form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo pleaſing an aſſemblage as to command the lively attention even of thoſe whoſe impatience revolts at the labour of peruſing a lengthy, ſyſtematic work. The review of any publication, may be conſidered, if the phraſe be allowed, as its kernel, presenting its hidden treaſures, without condemning the reader to the labour of exploring them. No evidence can be more concluſive of the charms this periodical work poſſeſſes than the eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in which it is held in England. This eſtimation will be beſt underſtood by an acquaintance with the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement it receives. This ſurpaſſes that of any other iſſue of the preſs, except ſuch as are intimately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with religious duties.</p>
                     <p>II. IT is conducted with diſtinguiſhed ability, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaken impartiality. The liberal patronage which ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains it, foſters the one, and inſures the other. More than twenty thouſand diſintereſted perſons cannot be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to unite in the ſteady ſupport of any object, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that object being both laudable and deſirable. By an cxtenſive circulation and correſpondent encouragement, the proprietors are enabled to command the talents of men diſtinguiſhed for their acquiſitions in the ſeveral de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments of ſcience and literature. The generous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward which talents thus exerted receive, aided by that ſprit of independence which knowledge ever inſpires, raiſe the writers for this work above thoſe paltry temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations which ſo often corrupt mean and unenlightened minds. Theſe remarks are ſtrengthened in the higheſt degree, by a cloſe attention to the manner in which this
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:026918_0257_0FD261EEA5F18040"/>
performance has actually been executed. Few reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have been caſt upon it, and of theſe few, moſt of them exhibit the traits of mortified dulneſs. Thoſe works which have received the laſh of ſeverity from the Reviewers, have almoſt univerſally retreated into obſcurity, while ſuch as have been crowned with the meed of praiſe, have gradually raiſed their heads and flouriſhed, in ſpite of prejudiced or intereſted oppoſition. It is not contended, that this has been an univerſal effect; but it is averred to have been a general one.</p>
                     <p>III. THE Monthly Review from its commencement to the preſent day, has uniformly aided and ſupported the cauſe of civil and religious liberty. In times, when freedom of expreſſion apparently approached the verge of deſtruction, when oppoſition to the infatuated coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils of Britain, drew forth the vengeance of government, and endangered the exiſtence of the patriot, the authors of this publication, inſtead of yielding to the power that menaced them, ſummoned to their cauſe all the energy of indignant truth, and thereby formed a barrier to that ſervile ſubmiſſion which had begun to ſpread itſelf among the people. During the American conteſt, they boldly pronounced the conduct of miniſters to be replete with folly and depravity, and enjoyed the ultimate ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of beholding the nation proſelytes to their ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. At the preſent criſis, when in England liberty is in her laſt agonies, and ſudden ruin threatens every man who dares to doubt the infallibility of the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrators of her government, we obſerve this work pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving its wonted dignity: In ſome ſmall degree, it is true, accommodating itſelf to the ſpirit of the times, that prejudice may be more ſucceſsfully eradicated by appearing to yield to it. But never meanly applauding what reaſon muſt condemn, never baſely courting the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the powerful by panegyrizing their crimes: Avoiding the imputation of a raſh intemperate zeal, at the ſame time that no ſit occaſion is ſuffered to paſs without a clear expoſure of thoſe principles which conſtitute the</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="4" facs="unknown:026918_0258_0FD261DBA43A1028"/>
THESE obſervations have been made in order to draw the attention of Americans to a work, which, on account of its extent and the variety of printing in its execution (almoſt every kind of letter occurring) requires an exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive patronage to compenſate the expences of conducting it. They might be enlarged to a much greater extent— but every perſon whoſe curioſity is awakened, will find no difficulty in obtaining ſatisfaction by an inſpection of the work itſelf, as it is much read notwithſtanding the heavy charges of importation.</p>
                     <p>THE Printer has but two additional remarks to make. Should that encouragement be received which the work is entitled to, he looks forward to the period as not a remote one, in which the publication ſhall receive an acceſſion of value, by a review of ſuch original works as appear among ourſelves. — The reduced price which the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing terms fix, below that of the Engliſh edition, as well as the early and regular manner in which the American edition will be printed, ſhould be influential induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, added to others too obvious to be mentioned, to give a preference of our own manufactory to any foreign one.</p>

The Editor earneſtly invites the learned and ingenious of his fellow-citizens to enrich with their labours, and make more worthy of American patronage, this uſeful publication.</p>

                     <head>SAMUEL HARRISON SMITH <hi>Has juſt Publiſhed,</hi> To be ſold by all the Bookſellers, Letters from a Father to his Son, ON VARIOUS TOPICS, RELATIVE TO LITERATURE AND THE CONDUCT OF LIFE. By J. AIKIN, M. D.</head>
                     <p>The following account of this performance is extracted from the Monthly Review.</p>
                     <p>"The ingenious and judicious author of the work now before us is ſo ſtrongly convinced of the propriety of an extenſion of the current plans of education, that, as we learn from the introductory letter, he has educated his ſon, to whom the letters are addreſſed, on a broad ſcale, which has comprized many changes of discipline, and has em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced a large field of inſtruction. By theſe means, he has endeavoured to give the young man a comprehenſive view of the objects before him, and to prepare him for the ſtudy of books, of men, and of nature, as well as for the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and uſeful diſcharge of profeſſional duties. In giving the finiſhing ſtroke to this important work of educating a ſon, he addreſſes him in a ſeries of letters, ſupplementary to thoſe inſtructions, which he had received, in a ſyſtema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic way, from books and lectures. Preſuming that his <hi>principles,</hi> in the courſe of a liberal education, had been well eſtabliſhed, he writes, 'rather with a view to place in a ſtrong and familiar light ſome ſubordinate truths belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the experimental practice of life, which, though not of the ſame fundamental importance with principles, are of no ſmall weight in promoting a man's happineſs and utility.' At the ſame time he communicates to him various obſervations on points of taſte and literature, in which his chief aim has been to obviate prejudices, and to give that turn to his ſon's thoughts which might enable him to judge and enjoy for himſelf, without firſt appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the deciſion of a dictator. The letters, throughout,
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:026918_0261_0FD261F4F65F01A0"/>
encourage and recommend that freedom of diſcuſſion, without which, as the author juſtly remarks, no difference exiſts between <hi>opinion</hi> and <hi>prejudice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The public is much indebted to Dr. Aikin for extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the utility of theſe letters beyond his own family; for that young man muſt have been very fortunately educated, and have made very extraordinary attainments, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reap from them much improvement, as well as enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment: nor is this publication by any means conſidered as peculiarly appropriated to the uſe of young men. The work being neither elementary nor ſyſtematic, brings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore its readers a great variety of pleaſing and intereſting ſubjects; on all of which it leads them into important and curious inquiries, or induces a train of uſeful or amuſing reflections. In this view, Dr. Aikin's publication may be conſidered as a valuable addition to the public ſtock of miſcellaneous eſſays, moral and critical; for (uſing the terms with ſome degree of latitude,) under theſe two claſſes all the letters may be with propriety arranged."</p>
                     <p>After making ſeveral very lengthy extracts, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viewers obſerve: "I he diverſified entertainment, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The Woodman is one of the few comic operas, which will ſtand this teſt. The plot without being intricate through a multiplicity of incidents, is ſufficiently intereſting.
