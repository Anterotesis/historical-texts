            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE Art of Printing (invented, but about two hundred Years ſince) has been a <hi>vaſt Service</hi> to Religion and Learning. Hence, the <hi>Statesman,</hi> the <hi>Phyſician,</hi> the <hi>Gentleman,</hi> the <hi>Mechanick,</hi> yea, the <hi>Ladies,</hi> as well as the <hi>Scholar,</hi> the <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> the <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and the <hi>Divine</hi> are furniſhed with <hi>agreeable Libraries.</hi> And tho' 'tis matter of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, that this excellent Art, has been abuſed, (as <hi>Muſick, Poeſy,</hi> and other Arts have alſo been,) to the Diſhonour of <hi>Almighty GOD,</hi> the Scandal of Religion, the hardning of the wicked, and the grief of Wiſe and Good Men: yet the Reformed Churches, and particularly our Nation, and Land have great cauſe to be thankful for this noble In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention; they being hereby richly ſupply'd (not only with various other uſeful Books, but) with great plenty of very excellent Sermons, Expoſitions of Scripture, Syſtems of Divinity, and the like; by which, (as many of the eminent Servants of God <hi>being dead, yet ſpeak unto us;</hi> ſo many other worthy Perſons, and eſpecially) the Miniſters of the Goſpel are ſtill bleſt with Opportunities of rendring their Uſefulneſs more <hi>extenſive</hi> and

               <hi>durable,</hi> which I think they ought to improve with all thankfulneſs and readineſs. For tho' I'm per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded we may be <hi>too forward</hi> to appear in Print; and am ſure that the <hi>ſuppreſſion</hi> of ſome things I've ſeen would have contributed as much, or more to the Honour of the Authors, their Country &amp; Religion, than the <hi>Publication</hi> of them: yet I verily believe that ſome good &amp; great <hi>Divines,</hi> who have been and are amongſt us, have been too <hi>ſhy, modeſt</hi> and <hi>reſerv'd,</hi> and made themſelves too far guilty of <hi>hiding their Talent in a Napkin,</hi> whilſt they've withheld from us what is <hi>more precious than Gold!</hi> And truly it's my humble Opinion, that we had much better hear with ſome <hi>feeble Eſſays &amp; weak Births</hi> from the Preſs, (which we are under no obligation in the World to patronize, admit under our ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>f, or touch with one of our Fingers,) than by <hi>raſh cenſuring</hi> ſuch honeſt well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meant Compoſures, <hi>&amp; ſcoffing</hi> at the Authors thereof, take an unhappy method to deprive our ſelves of the pleaſure &amp; advantage of peruſing many other more entertaining Meditations, &amp; Diſcourſes, by thus tempting the worthy Authors of them (that they may eſcape the ſcourge of the tongue, to refuſe expoſing them to publick view.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, I think that as the <hi>Miniſters of the Goſpel</hi> (of which Order, I confeſs my ſelf the moſt unworthy) ſhould ſee, that they have a <hi>Call of God,</hi> to <hi>Preach</hi> in this or that Place; and when they are ſatisfy'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhould not be diſcourag'd on any ſcore whatever: ſo when PROVIDENCE calls them to <hi>Publiſh</hi> their Sermons, or other Writings, (and <hi>Wiſdom is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to direct</hi> them in judging of this, they ought
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:002388_0005_0FDB353B9F308AF8"/>unqueſtionably to do it, <hi>and leave the Event with GOD.</hi> For my own part I do &amp; will (relying upon Divine Aids) govern my ſelf by this <hi>Rule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the <hi>enſuing Diſcourſe,</hi> all I ſhall ſay is; that I firſt Studied it <hi>for,</hi> and Preach'd it <hi>to</hi> my own People, without the leaſt tho't of it's being made Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, (it being partly occaſioned by a moſt unhappy and unreaſonable Controverſy about <hi>Singing by Note;</hi>) and having offer'd it in two other Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, where I was ſoon after called to Preach; I at length delivered it at <hi>your Lecture;</hi> where ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry of my Brethren in the Miniſtry were preſent, who expreſs'd their Approbation of it; and ſeveral amongſt you deſiring it might be publiſhed, I at length conſented to it; partly to <hi>make you ſome amends</hi> for not gratifying your deſires of ſeveral Sermons, you ſome Years ſince by repeated Votes ask'd of me; and partly becauſe I perceive <hi>it was not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable</hi> to ſome in whoſe bearing it was preached: who will, I hope, do <hi>me</hi> the <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and <hi>themſelves</hi> the <hi>Honour</hi> to change their minds about it, (if they'l vouchſafe to give it the reading,) and repent of the <hi>ill Temper</hi> they were in, when it was delivered to them in the Name of GOD from the <hi>Sacred Desk.</hi> However, I remember what is ſaid of the bearers of the moſt celebrated Preacher that ever was (the Son of God only excepted) that ſome <hi>believed,</hi> &amp; ſome <hi>believed not, Act. 28.24.</hi> But the chief Reaſon (I honeſtly profeſs) of my printing the following Diſcourſe is, becauſe I judge that (ſuch as it is) <hi>it's needful,</hi> and may (if God pleaſe to bleſs it) be <hi>uſeful</hi> amongſt us in this part of the Country, and
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:002388_0006_0FDB353E859588F0"/>wiſh there were no occaſion for it elſewhere. And tho' I might eaſily have enlarg'd on the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Signs</hi> of Prejudice; &amp; did ſo, eſpecially on the <hi>latter,</hi> in my own Pulpit: yet I was loth to add any thing to this Sermon, that was not in it, when de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to you: but if <hi>this</hi> find acceptance, I deſign <hi>another</hi> Diſcourſe <hi>concerning Chriſtians Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices againſt one another,</hi> if God give Opportunity, (unleſs any of my Reverend Fathers or Brethren will undertake that Subject, which I ſhould very much rejoyce in,) and if my Friends encourage my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in that work, I may therein ſpeak more largely to the Head mentioned.</p>
            <p>And now, Brethren, I thankfully acknowlege my obligations to you, for your kind acceptance of my poor Endeavours, from time to time, in the work of the Ministry: praying <hi>GOD,</hi> who has greatly bleſs'd the Goſpel amongſt you, eſpecially upon the <hi>firſt Settlement</hi> of your preſent worthy Paſtor (One Hundred &amp; Thirty ſix Perſons being added to your Church in the ſpace of Three Years; whereof <hi>80</hi> were added in one Year, &amp; <hi>31</hi> of them in one Day, May <hi>1.1715.</hi>) that He would take delight to dwell amongſt you, &amp; pour out abundance of his Spirit on <hi>you</hi> and <hi>yours:</hi> And entreating your <hi>conſtant fervent</hi> Prayers for <hi>me &amp; mine:</hi> &amp; particularly, beſeech you to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low this Diſcourſe (which Heaven has made ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceable to ſeveral in hearing it) with your Requeſts, that it may be uſeful to ſuch as ſhall ſee meet to read it.</p>

Philip</hi> being called by Chriſt to be an Apoſtle, and finding <hi>Nathanael;</hi> tells him, that they had <hi>found Him of whom Moſes in the Law and the Prophets did write, Jeſus of Nazareth the Son of Joſeph,</hi> i. e. The Meſſiah; The Conſolation of Iſrael, whom many were then juſtly expecting. But <hi>Nathanael</hi> could not receive this Truth. He believed in the Meſſiah, Who, he thought was yet to come: But did not believe, that Jeſus was He. hence he was prejudic'd againſt the Greateſt and Beſt Man that ever was in the World, even the Man Chriſt Jeſus. Not believing Him to be the Meſſiah, as indeed He was; He muſt needs eſteem Him a Grand Impoſtor. Hence alſo, he was prejudic'd againſt the Greateſt Dety in Chriſtianity, even that, of Receiving Jeſus Chriſt. Thus Chriſt came to His own, and (for the preſent) His own received Him not. <hi>Nathanael</hi>'s Prejudice, ſo blinded his mind, that he could ſee no Form nor Comelineſs in Jeſus Chriſt, who is Fairer than the Children of Men, even altogether Lovely: He could by no means believe Him to be the Meſſiah, and hence diſputes againſt believing in Him.</p>
            <p>IT is then, no New thing, for Real Saints to be preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic'd for a Time and in a Degree, againſt ſome of the Beſt Men in the World, yea, againſt ſome of the moſt Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Truths and Duties of Religion.</p>
            <p>Obſ. 3. THE <hi>true</hi> Reaſons of <hi>Natbanael</hi>'s Prejudice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt; or, whence it was, that he laboured of ſuch Prejudice. Now this was owing partly, to <hi>Nathanael</hi>'s Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and Miſapprehenſion: And partly, to <hi>Philip</hi>'s Defectiveneſs in preaching Chriſt to <hi>Nathanael.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. BUT then, His Prejudice was occaſion'd partly, by the Defective Account <hi>Philip</hi> gave him, of our Saviour. <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanael</hi> was a Man, well acquainted with his Bible no doubt: A Man that had ſearched the Scripture and underſtood from thence, that according to <hi>Mic.</hi> 5.2. the Meſſiah was to be born in Bethlehem, and not in Nazareth, or Galilee. Now ſome think that <hi>Philip</hi> ſuppoſed Chriſt to be born at Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, and that He was really the Son of <hi>Joſeph;</hi> and hence, fell in, with the Vulgar way of ſpeaking, calling our Saviour (as He was Uſually termed) Jeſus of N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>THAT <hi>Vulgar Expreſſions are ſometimes very impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and founded on great Mistakes.</hi> Indeed, had <hi>Philip</hi> throughly underſtood himſelf, and having ſpoken in the Popular Stile, had he expounded himſelf, and inform'd <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanael,</hi> that Chriſt was born in Bethlehem, though called Jeſus of Nazareth, becauſe that was the Place of His Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or, for any other ſufficient reaſon: And that He was really the Son of GOD, though called the Son of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> becauſe he was the Husband of His Mother, the Bleſſed Virgin; He might poſſibly have prevented <hi>Nathanael</hi>'s Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, and obviated his Objection, againſt Chriſt. But it may be he was himſelf ignorant in theſe Points. And his Defect may teach the Miniſters of the Goſpel to uſe their utmoſt Diſcretion, that they may anticipate any weighty Objection, that might ariſe in the minds of their Hearers: And to take heed, they don't beget or confirm Prejudices in their minds, againſt the Truth, by an over-popular and

Firſt, LET us conſider the Nature of Prejudice. Or, What we'er to underſtand here, by Prejudice. Now (tho' the word is frequently uſed in a different ſenſe, yet) by Prejudice, (agreeably to the Notation o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the Word) we intend here, <hi>A Raſh Judgment before Trial:</hi> or, a Wrong Judgment form'd in our Minds, before we'r well appriz'd of the Thing or Perſon we'r to judge of Now our Mind is prepoſſeſs'd, the Judgment is foreſtall'd (as we ſay) or, we prejudge the Thing.</p>
            <p>THE Object of Prejudice in general (as we here uſe the Word) is any Thing or Perſon. There are no Perſons, but we may poſſibly be prejudic'd with reſpect to them, either againſt them, or in their favour. There is no Error in Religion ſo abſurd, but ſome or other may embrace it. There is no Truth ſo evident, no Practice <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o commendable, but ſome or other may ſtumble at it.</p>
            <p>THE Prejudices that ariſe in our Minds, may not only be diſtinguiſh'd in regard of the Object of them (ſome reſpecting Perſons, others, Things: Some relating to Points in Philoſophy or Politicks; others, to Matters in Religion, which we'r now to conſider.) But in reſpect of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of them. Some are more inveterate and deeply rooted, others are more ſlight and eaſily removed. But then,</p>
            <p>Secondly, LET us take a view of ſome of the Cauſes of Prejudice in Matters of Religion, and ſee whence it is that even Good Men, are ſometimes under the Inſtuence of Prejudice. And here I might ſay, that it is owing Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally to the Corruption of our Natures. From the Beginning it was not ſo. GOD made Man Upright, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly free from all wrong Sentiments. But Man by his Apoſtacy, has loſt the Primitive Rect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ade of his Nature; and all his Powers are depraved and diſordered. His Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is darkned; His Will and Affections are become Rebellious and Ungovernable: the Poſſions firangely byaſs the Will; and both have a very powerful <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uence on the Underſtanding to puſh it on to make a judgment of Things
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002388_0012_0FDB3549C7F36A68"/>and Perſons, before it's rightly inform'd; and hence it comes to be fill'd with Prejudice.</p>
            <p>NOW this Corruption remains in part even in good Men; and does in this way frequently diſcover it ſelf in them.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, It might be added, that Satan has a great hand in the Prejudices that are to be found in Chriſtians againſt the things of GOD, as well as in thoſe againſt One Another. That Grand Adverſary has near Acceſs to our Minds, and a Power of Suggeſting Thoughts to them. He can if permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, fill Mens Hearts. <hi>Act.</hi> 5.3. He can miſrepreſent Perſons and things to our Minds. He carries on his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed Deſigns againſt us, very much in this way. He can blind the Mind. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. He can enter into Men. <hi>Luke</hi> 22.3. And ſome he leads Captive <hi>at his Will.</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>6. And this he does by firſt filling the Mind with Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice.</p>
            <p>Briefly, IT might be Obſerv'd, that it proceeds from the Juſt Judgment of GOD upon ſome Perſons and Societies; that the Minds of Men are fill'd with Prejudice in Matters of Religion. GOD in His ſpotleſs Sovereignty does ſometimes thus puniſh Sin with Sin. We read of thoſe, who <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they received not the Love of the Truth — for this cauſe GOD ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſion, that they ſhould believe a Lye,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2.10, 11. It alſo proves a <hi>Comprehenſive Judgment</hi> on ſome Families, Towns and Churches, yea Countries; that ſome Good Men are preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic'd with reſpect to ſome <hi>Things</hi> and <hi>Perſons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT to be more particular, (not that I pretend to Enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merate all the ſpecial Cauſes of Prejudice, for they being various, according to the various Objects they refer to, this would be an endleſs Task) I will mention a few Inſtances, which will help to illuſtrate the Point.</p>
            <p>Firſt. PREJUDICES in Religion ſometimes ariſe, from a Miſunderſtanding, or Miſapplication of the Sacred Scriptures. The Apoſtle Peter obſerves that in the Epiſtles of the Great Doctor of the Gentiles, there were <hi>ſome things hard to be underſtood</hi>—which ſays he, the <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned Wrest</hi>— 2 Pet. 3.16. The Original Word ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002388_0013_0FDB354B45671268"/>
               <hi>Wreſt,</hi> is a Meraphor, (ſay the Criticks) from Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors, who put a Man on the <hi>Wrack</hi> and Torture him ſo long, till they make him ſpeak what he never meant to ſpeak. Thus ſome Perſons ſerve the Scriptures, they force a ſenſe upon it, which the Holy Spirit never intended, nor came it into, his mind. There are many that hear the Word that do not underſtand it. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.19. Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers may juſtly expoſtulate with ſome of their Hearers, as our Bleſſed Saviour did with ſome of his, Joh. 8.43. <hi>Why do you not understand my Speech?</hi> Yea this is ſometimes the Caſe of Chriſt's Diſciples. Joh. 12.16. <hi>Theſe things understood not his Diſciples at the firſt.</hi> Others, they Underſtand indeed, but they miſapply the Word. Sometimes, they apply to others what they ſhould apply to themſelves, and miſerably blunder in the Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation they make to themſelves. And hence they're pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judic'd againſt many Truths and Duties in Religion, and againſt thoſe that don't think with them.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, Oftentimes theſe Prejudices are the product of Education. We ſuck in Prejudice, even from the Breaſt. The Prejudices of Education are ſometimes very <hi>numerous</hi> and commonly very <hi>powerful.</hi> The mind being in our tender Years, more ſuſceptive of Impreſſions of this kind. And ſuch Prejudices are not eradicated but with great difficulty. They're often propogated from the Father to the Son, and from one Generation they're tranſmitted to another. This we ſee awfully verifyed in the Prejudices the Jewiſh Nation are under againſt Chriſtianity, and by many ſorrowful Inſtances amongſt Chriſtians of various Opinions in Circumſtantial Points in Religion. Too many Chriſtians taking up their Principles in Religion very much upon Truſt from thoſe that have the Care of their Education, they're unaccountably prejudic'd in their favour and againſt the contrary. <hi>Mens Poſterity often approve their ſayings and Practices, tho' they are not good,</hi> Pſal. 49.13.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, Theſe Prejudices Sometimes ariſe from the Great Veneration Men have for Ancient Cuſtoms, or what they falſely call, <hi>Ancient.</hi> There are indeed Cuſtoms that
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:002388_0014_0FDB354BAC128438"/>are Lawful and Commendable, To ſuch the Apoſtle refers, 1 Cor. 11.16. And the more Ancient ſuch are doubtleſs the more Venerable.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or want of Diſtinguiſhing and duely comparing Cuſtoms with the Rule, many are betray'd into woful Prejudices againſt many of their Fellow Chriſtians that can't ſubmit to the Cuſtoms they've a Fondneſs for. Now ſuch as are govern'd by Cuſtom, and are not able, or don't give themſeves leave to Examine the Grounds of Cuſtom, and whither it be Conſonant to Reaſon and Scripture, will neceſſarily be prejudic'd in ſome meaſure againſt the Truth, whenever the Cuſtoms they follow, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be unlawful or inexpedient.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, Sometimes Mens Prejudices in Matters of Religion owe their Original to their great Affection to, and high eſteem of theſe and thoſe Perſons, and their mean tho'ts of others. There are too many who in this reſpect have the Faith of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt with reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of Perſons.

            <p>AGAIN, Sometimes Mens Unweary Arguing from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, produces Prejudices in their Minds. By this means perſons are ſometimes prejudic'd againſt the Servants of CHRIST. Thus when the Inhabitants of <hi>Melita</hi> of old, ſaw the Viper fatten on the Apoſtles Hand, they immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately thence inter, that he was a <hi>Murderer;</hi> and therefore tho' <hi>he had eſcaped the Sea, Vengeance ſuffered him not to live,</hi> Acts 28.4.

AGAIN, Some Peoples Prejudices are occaſioned by their <hi>Lusts and Idols.</hi> Thus the Diſciples of Old were prejudic'd againſt <hi>Mary's</hi> Anointing our Saviour at the Houſe of <hi>Simon</hi> the Leper. <hi>Matthew</hi> ſays, <hi>they'd indignation,</hi> ſaying, <hi>to what purpoſe is this waſte <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>
               </hi> Chap. 26.8. <hi>Mark</hi> tells us, <hi>They murmur'd againſt her,</hi> Chap. 14.5. <hi>John</hi> informs us, <hi>that Judas Iſcariot that betray'd him,</hi> ſaid, <hi>Why was not this Ointment ſold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?</hi> Chap. 12.5. And adds, ver. 6. <hi>Not that he cared for the poor, but this he ſaid, becauſe he was a thief and had the bag, and bare what was therein.</hi> It was their Coveteouſneſs that produc'd their Prejudice againſt that Noble Action, and the Godly Woman by whom it was done. Thus Mens inordinate Love of Money prejudices them againſt the Doctrine of giving Alms, and Works of Piety, <hi>or devoting their Tenths to Pious Uſes.</hi> And their Love to many other Luſts, prejudices them againſt the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of the Word: And the Adminiſtration of Diſcipline and Cenſure of the Church.</p>
            <p>FINALLY, (to mention no more Particulars) Mens Prejudices are often owing to the Unskilfulneſs or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſs and Cowardice, or Unexemplarineſs of the Miniſters of the Goſpel. Some Pretenders to the Sacred Function are Unskilful and cannot: Others are Cowardly and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>are not; others are Idle and Lukewarm and do not; Others are Unfaithful and will not rightly divide the Word of Truth. They Preach themſelves, ſtudy their own Eaſe and Secular Intereſt; Prophecy ſmooth things; and daub with Untempered Mortur; Crying Peace, Peace, when there is no Peace! Hence the People are Prejudiced againſt the Truth! Thus when the falſe Prophets of Old had flattered <hi>Ahab,</hi> that he ſhould proſper at <hi>Ramoth-Gilend,</hi> this Prejudiced him againſt the Truth delivered to him by <hi>Micaiah,</hi> and confirmed h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s hatred of him, ſo that he order'd the Prophet to Priſon, with direction that he ſhould have Priſoners fare.
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002388_0017_0FDB3553A51BFC18"/>Thus thoſe Miniſters that don't ſpeak the Oracles of GOD, plainly, boldly, zealouſly and yet prudently, and live agreeably, will Prejudice their Hearers, it's to be feared, againſt the Truth faithfully diſpenſed by others.</p>
            <p>AND now having conſidered ſome of the Cauſes of Mens Prejudices in Matters of Religion, I might have ſhown the Cauſes of Chriſtians Prejudices againſt one another: And ſaid that ſometimes Chriſtians (ſuch as they are) are Prejudiced againſt others; becauſe others are Prejudiced againſt them: Or, becauſe they too eaſily take up Reports of their Fellow Chriſtians, without enquiring into the Foundation thereof: or, becauſe they hear of others Failings, but not of their Humiliations: The News of which is not wont to fly ſo ſwiftly as that of their Miſcarriages: But it's beſide my preſent deſign to inſiſt on theſe things. Let us therefore,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, CONSIDER, Some of the Woful Effects of Prejudice in Matters of Religion. Theſe are very nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; A few Inſtances may be propoſed under two Heads. 1. They hinder much Good. 2. They do much Harm.</p>
            <p>Firſt, THEY hinder much Good. They hinder Mens doing good. They often hinder Mens accepting Chriſt and Entring on a Courſe of Religion. Some are prejudic'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt engaging in a Courſe of Religion, becauſe they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that the power of Godlineſs is inconſiſtent with Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; others, becauſe they apprehend it will hurt their Worldly intereſt: Like the Young Man in the Goſpel, who went away from Chriſt Sorrowful, becauſe he had <hi>Great Poſſeſſions;</hi> and could not find in his heart to ſell all, to buy the Pearl of great price; or, becauſe they obſerve that ſome Profeſſors of Religion, don't live anſwerably to their Profeſſion. By ſuch groundleſs Prejudices, ſome are diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from giving up themſelves to GOD.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:002388_0018_0FDB355504F67E18"/>
AGAIN, Theſe Prejudices, as they obſtruct a work of <hi>Converſion,</hi> ſo they hinder a work of <hi>Reformation.</hi> So long and ſo far as Men are prejudic'd, either in favour of their own Corrupt Tenents, or Irreligious Practices; or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Truths and Ways of God; they'll hold faſt deceit and refuſe to return. If they've left off to be wiſe and are gone back from God, and are turned aſide after lying vanities; they'll not return, or but feignedly, while their woful Prejudice are retained. Briefly, let what will be amiſs, and let it be ever ſo obvious, while the Man is under the Malignant Influence of Prejudice, he'll hold on his Way, and wax worſe and worſe.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, Prejudice in matters of Religion hinders Mens Receiving Good. It lamentably obſtructs the ſucceſs of the Goſpel, the Efficacy of the Word, Sacraments and Cenſures. The Word tho' ever ſo Excellently Preach'd won't profit, unleſs mined with Faith, received in Love, laid up in the Heart, and practiſed in the Life. Now Men won't do this, while prejudic'd againſt the Word. So then, theſe Prejudices, hinder Mens doing and receiving Good: They hinder the Divine Bleſſing from accompanying their Endeavours and the Means of Grace, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Glory of GOD and the Good of Souls, which is the Chief Good.</p>
            <p>Secondly, THEY do much harm, they do a World of Miſchief. Firſt, they often hurt Mens Credit, fully their Reputation, darken their Character, and render them ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious to a great degree.</p>
            <p>HENCE, it is that Men often ſpeak and act very Unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably; they're ſo far from carrying it Chriſtianly, that they don't ſhew themſelves Men. They'r like thoſe the Apoſtle Peter deſcribes, <hi>they ſpeak evil of the things they underſtand not:</hi> Or, like thoſe we read of, 1 Tim. 1.7. <hi>They underſtand neither what they ſay, nor whereof they affirm.</hi> Now it is very diſhonourable for any thus to <hi>

               </gap>ation to another. And no wonder, for Chriſtians are too often, more zealous in ſome <hi>Little Points</hi> that are the Objects of their Prejudice, than in the weightieſt Matters in Religion. Now GOD is won't to vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the Iniquity of the Fathers upon the Children— And ſince it's not unuſual for the ſame mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>FURTHERMORE, Theſe Prejudices, hurt Mens Souls. Were it only Mens Names, Eſtates and Families that were
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002388_0020_0FDB35597A69FEA8"/>hurt, it were ſad, but <hi>this</hi> is not all. They hurt their Souls, and that innumerable ways. They are ſinful in themſelves, and expoſe Men to numberleſs Temptations to Sin. They lay Men open to the Wiles of Satan, and give him (who loves to fiſh in troubled Waters) a great advantage to betray them into many Sins: They greatly quench and grieve and vex the Holy Spirit, and cauſe Him to ſuſpend his Aſſiſting and Comforting Influences. They hinder Mens Growth in Grace, and render them ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, meer Dwarſs in Chriſtianity all their Days.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, They are Hurtful to Societies. They often occaſion abundance of Sinful Contention and vain Jangling. They ſet on Fire the whole Courſe of Nature, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times throw all into the laſt Confuſion. And becauſe of theſe things God is often angry, with whole Churches, and Nations and Kingdoms. None that are acquainted with Church Hiſtory will doubt the Truth of this—</p>
            <p>IN <hi>ſhort,</hi> The Prejudices of Chriſtians in Matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, tend to bring an Odium upon Religion it ſelf and the Profeſſors it; yea they reflect diſhonour upon the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Author of it, which is the greateſt Miſchief that can be thought of. As nothing does ſo much Commend Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to the Love, Eſteem and Practice of Men, as Unity and Charity among the Profeſſors of it, joyn'd with their otherwiſe Blameleſs and Uſeful Lives: So, Nothing does more effectually Scandalize the World againſt Religion, and <hi>cauſe them to ſet their Mouths againſt the very Heavens, than Sinful Contentions and Animoſities and want of Chriſtian Charity among the Profeſſors of it.</hi> Now if Prejudice be at the Bottom of all this, then that is ultimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Blameable Cauſe</hi> that Religion is brought into Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repute, and that Men ſay to the Almighty depart from us. But thus I've mention'd ſome of the Doleful Effects of Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice in Religious Matters, and proceed in the Laſt place to propoſe a Method of Preventing or Removing ſuch Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices. And here are Two Inquiries to be briefly Anſwer'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:002388_0021_0FDB355B120D3740"/>
Firſt, WHAT ſhould Chriſtians do, to prevent theſe Prejudices? That they may'nt be infected with this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious Malady?</p>
            <p>I Anſwer,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> THEY ſhould take heed of being prejudic'd at the Diſpenſers of the Word, or Profeſſors of Religion. When once perſons are prejudic'd againſt the Diſpenſers of the Word, they'll by and by be prejudic'd againſt their Miniſtry; their way of Preaching, yea againſt the Matter they preach. They'll ſometimes groundleſly Suſpect the Preacher has ſome particular Reference to their Caſe (and pray Sirs what if he has?) and this is an Unpardonable Crime with them! Hence they Nauſeate and Diſreliſh the Beſt Sermons, and ſeveral ways they diſcover this; forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, Miniſters are to give to every one their Portion in its Seaſon, whither they will hear or whither they will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear, and that upon pain of Eternal Damnation if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent not. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.8. Such are therefore Unreaſonable Men, with a witneſs (from all of whom, <hi>Libera nos Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine!</hi>) that are angry with the Miniſters of CHRIST for telling them the Truth, ſeeing herein they do, but what it is their Duty to do; Neceſſity is laid upon them and wo be unto them if they do it not. They ſhould then beware of being prejudic'd againſt the Miniſters of Religion, that would Steer clear of Prejudices in Religion. For moſt certain it is, that when Men have learnt on any ſcore to deſpiſe the Meſſengers of the LORD; they'll ſoon deſpiſe the Meſſage, and loath the beſt Sermons they can preach, as the Iſraelites did the Manna in the Wilderneſs. Hence thoſe very Sermons which whilſt they were free from Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, againſt the Miniſters of the Goſpel, they would have highly applauded, and thought they could ſcarce ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in Commending, now they'll Hiſs as ſcarce worth the Hearing. I ſpeak what I know, and teſtify what I have ſeen in ſeveral Inſtances! <hi>Horreſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ferens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:002388_0022_0FDB355F2B1AF538"/>
AGAIN, They muſt alſo take hoed of being prejudic'd againſt the Profeſſors of Religion, and looking upon them in general as a Company of Hypocrites. For though its probable there's none of our Churches, wherein there are not ſome Hypocrites, yet the Law of Charity obliges us to hope, that many it may be the moſt are Sincere. And ſuch are very unjuſt that condemn all, for the ſake of ſome few. And they act very unſafely in this reſpect, in that this their way tends to prejudice them againſt Religion.</p>
            <p>Secondly, THEY ſhould be well acquainted with the Word of GOD, and Read and Hear it and ſubmit to it as the Word of GOD.</p>
            <p>THE Sacred Scriptures <hi>are able to make wiſe unto Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> to <hi>enlighten the Eyes;</hi> and <hi>make wiſe the Simple.</hi> They are perfect, Teaching all that is neceſſary to be Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved and Done in Religion. And ſo long and ſo far as our Judgments and Practices are govern'd by the Word of GOD, we're ſafe; there's no Danger of our being preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic'd againſt the Truths and Ways of GOD. But when we depart from this Rule, we are immediately in Danger. So then Chriſtians ſhould ſearch the Scriptures daily and diligently, and labour to Underſtand what they Read and Hear, and Submit to what they find to be the Truth, how contrary ſoever to their Opinion or Practice, Humour or Intereſt: Or to the Opinion or Practice of any other Perſon or Party. Chriſtians muſt therefore Read and Hear the Word, as the Word of GOD, and not as the Word of Man. For when once Chriſtians come to hear Sermons as the Word of Man and look no further, not conſidering in whoſe ſtead the Miniſters of the Goſpel ſtand while in the Diſcharge of their Office; and in whoſe Name they ſpeak; they'll ſoon be in danger of ſaying at leaſt in their Practice, as the Hearers of the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah, Chap.</hi> 6.16, 17. — <hi>We will not Walk therein — We will not Hearken:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:002388_0023_0FDB1268C63C3100"/>
Thirdly, THEY ſhould take heed of Superſtition. Some Perſons are much addicted to Superſtition. Thus it is with moſt that are of a Scrupulous Conſcience. They'r ready to look upon many things as Sins, which God has not forbidden: And many things as Duty which GOD has not required. They'd be wiſer and holier, not only than their Teachers, but then God Himſelf. Whereas it is by the Law, we attain the knowledge of Sin, <hi>And where there is no Law there is no Tranſgreſſion.</hi> Now as Prejudice ſometimes begets Superſtition, ſo Superſtition leads to Prejudice, and not ſeldom ends in it, as in an enchanted Circle. Chriſtians then muſt carefully avoid Superſtition, or beware of thinking themſelves or others, oblig'd to do more than the Law requires, or to abſtain from what the Law no where forbids.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>COME and See.</hi> i. e. Get and maintain within you a Teachable, Governable Diſpoſition. <hi>Come and See.</hi>

<pb n="18" facs="unknown:002388_0024_0FDB3563452AB548"/>how it makes way for Sattn's entring into Men, and gives him a great Advantage againſt them: How it keeps Chriſt out of the Soul, and keeps Multitude of Souls out of Heaven. And oftentimes, it is a ſmall matter at firſt that occaſions the Prejudice, or that Perſons are Prejudic'd about, that proves fatal and ruinous. A ſmall matter ſometimes prejudices Chriſtians againſt one another, whereby they're betray'd into many Sins, and diverted from many Duties, and they are left to go on in the paths of the Deſtroyer, heaping up Wrath againſt the Day of Wrath—.</p>
            <p>Finally, BE much in Prayer to GOD to keep your Hearts and Minds thro' Chriſt Jeſus. All our Endeavours to keep our ſelves will be in vain unleſs GOD undertake for us. He is Iſraels Keeper, He keepeth the feet of His Saints! Let us then commit the keeping of our Souls to Him, who is able to keep what we commit to Him; and to preſent us faultleſs before the preſence of His Glory with exceeding Joy!</p>
            <p>But then the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second Enquiry</hi> is, WHAT ſhould Chriſtians do when under Prejudice, to get their Prejudices Removed? What ſhall they do, that their Minds may be cured of this evil Diſeaſe, which weakens and defiles their Minds; Unfits them for and hinders them in then Operations, Tarniſhes their B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y, and will prove deadly to the Soul, unleſs it be realed</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>COME and See.</hi> If you've any reaſon to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, if any Wiſe, Knowing, Experienc'd Chriſtians ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt to you their Fears you are infected with this Diſeaſe, <hi>Come</hi> to the Word and to the Houſe of GOD, and try your ſelves by the Signs of Prejudice propos'd there. It's a rul'd Caſe, determin'd by the <hi>Infallible Judge of Com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>erſies,</hi> even Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>That be that doth evil bateth the Light,</hi>—Job. 3.20. It's alſo an Argument of Prejudic, when Perſons reject Principles and Practices in Religion, becauſe embrac'd and profeſs'd and attended to, by ſuch as they've no Charity for. <hi>Alas the Truth
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:002388_0025_0FDB3568521DD528"/>is as precious in the Church of Rome, as in the Churches of New England.</hi> This Truth can loſe nothing of its Excellency becauſe believ'd and profeſs'd by an Heretick. Its never the leſs a precious Truth, <hi>That its ſafeſt to Truſt to the Righteouſneſs of CHRIST alone for Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> becauſe <hi>Bellarmine</hi> the Atlas of Popery confeſs'd it at his Death. Its never the leſs a precious Truth and a Fundamental Article of our Holy Religion, That <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God,</hi> becauſe the Devils in our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours Time confeſs'd it (without doubt) with a curſed Deſign to prejudice the World againſt it. Now this I ſay, Try your ſelves by ſuch Signs; and be willing to know you are infected with this Diſtemper, if you are ſo. What Good will it do you to perſwade your ſelves, you are well, when you are Sick. Some People in a Phrenzy, or Delirious, when the Mortal Fever is even at the height think themſelves well, and they would deſtroy themſelves if not prevented. But before the Diſtemper prevail thus far, ſee your Malady, and ſee your Danger; See the Neceſſity and Advantage of your being healed, and alſo the Neceſſity of your being in the Uſe of Means. You will never be cured if you do not do ſo. <hi>The whole have no need of the Phyſician, but they that are Sick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, SEEK out ſeaſonably and in good earneſt for Help. The longer you delay, the more the Diſeaſe will prevail, and the more difficult will be the Cure. If other Methods avail not, repair to your Spiritual Phyſician, your Paſtor, and be content to follow his Direction, and, don't be angry with him, for telling you that you'r infected (as the manner of ſome is) and giving you an Account of the Riſe, Seat and Tendency of your Diſtemper, and how 'twill operate, and what you muſt do to be cured; and for doing his utmoſt to heal you.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, FOLLOW the Inſtructions of your Spiritual Phyſician, ſo far as they are conſiſtent with Scripture and Reaſon, and don't meddle with ſuch as don't underſtand your Malady, or with ſuch things as may be a diſſervice
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:002388_0026_0FDB356B883FB1C0"/>to you. This is tho't Reaſonable amongſt Men, in other Caſes, we all readily ſubmit to this Method, when we or ours are Sick —. We don't baulk the Directions of the Phyſician becauſe the purſuing of them, will put us in Pain, or make us Sick, or it may be occaſion us ſome ſhame, and a little ſhock our Modeſty. Well, Let us be as wiſe for our Souls.</p>
            <p>Finally, LOOK <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> GOD to direct to, and bleſs Means for your Cure. Without Him, we are all Phyſicians of no value! He is the Great Phyſician of Souls, The Lord our Healer. And tho' He will have us uſe the Means, we muſt not reſt in them, but wait on Him for a Bleſſing. And in as much as in this Caſe, our Diſeaſe is alſo our Sin, we muſt bewail it before God, and beg of Him Repentance and Forgiveneſs.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now ſhut up the Diſcourſe, with ſaying Two Things upon the whole,</p>
            <p>Firſt, LET us Pity and Pray for and as we can be Help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to ſuch as Labour under ſuch Prejudice as we have heard ſomething of. We are all of us Objects of Pity, when and ſo far, as we are under the power of ſuch Prejudice. We are then eſpecially objects of the Divine Compaſſion in that reſpect, and wo unto us if God ſhould mark ſuch our Iniquities againſt us! We are alſo, under ſuch Circumſtances ſo far objects of the Pity of our Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Chriſtians. Let us then have Compaſſion one towards another, and manifeſt it, by Praying heartily one for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Bearing one anothers Burdens, and making all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Allowance one for another; and Endeavouring with the Meekneſs of Wiſdom to heal one another. Indeed Chriſtians that ſeem wilfully prejudiced, are to be admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and reproved, but then we muſt do it ſeaſonably and ſuitably: ſtill remembring and governing our ſelves by theſe Rules, Let all things be done to the Glory of God: To Edification and in Charity, as well as Decently and in Order.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:002388_0027_0FDB356D01157F10"/>
Secondly, LET us all take heed of Prejudice in Matters, wherein Religion is concerned. This is our Luty, Wiſdom and Intereſt. The Light of Nature, The Word of GOD. The woful Experience of the People of GOD oblige to this. Theſe Prejudices render us ſo far unlike to God. While we indulge them we are making work for Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and lay our ſelves open to the Devices of Satan. Let ſuch as think they ſtand, take heed then, leaſt they fall. He that is not Prejudiced in this or the other caſe, and that ſtands and wonders at his Neighbour's weakneſs, may be as miſerably Prejudiced in ſome other caſe, it God ſee meet to let looſe his Corruptions, and ſuffer the Evil One to aſſault Him. Let us then, not be high-minded but fear!</p>
            <p>AND now to Him that is able to keep us from falling, or, to recover us if fallen, under the Influence of Prejudice in Religion; To the only Wiſe God our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, be Glory and Majeſty, Dominion and Power, both now and Ever. AMEN.</p>
