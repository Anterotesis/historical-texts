            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a common Miſtake which hath too much prevailed in theſe Times, and in this Country, and that even among ſome well-meaning People, that they ſeem to account the Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Sermons, to be the principal and moſt important and edifying Part of the publick Worſhip of GOD. Hence, as it is very likely that Some, heretofore, left the Church under the Notion that they could elſewhere meet with, what was then, though with very little Reaſon, called the moſt powerful Preaching; ſo Others may have conformed to the Church, principally, from being ſenſible (eſpecially in the late Times of Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) that the Doctrines of Chriſtianity were more truly, more purely, and in a more inſtructive Manner taught in the Church than out of it. In which they indeed judged very rightly; and this was, among others, a very good Reaſon for their conforming to it. And as this was the principal Occaſion with Many, of their coming over to us, ſo it is not unlikely that there may be Some, with whom the Worſhip of the Church, after all, may ſeem but tolerable for the ſake of the Doctrine, and they may not, even yet, have any high Senſe of the Excellency of it, and its vaſt Preference to the extempore Way.</p>
            <p>ON the other Hand, it is very probable, that there are but too many of Thoſe who have been bred up, and lived
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:008892_0005_103092F14DC091A0"/>
all their Days in the Boſom of the Church, and in the Uſe of its publick Worſhip; who, partly by Reaſon of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monneſs of it, and partly their Negligence, and for Want of giving a due Attention to the Propriety and Excellency of every Part of it; may not be ſufficiently ſenſible what a Pearl of ineſtimable Price they enjoy, nor duly thankful for it: As they daily breathe in the Air, and enjoy the Sun, and the Beauties and Fruits of the Earth, without being ſo deeply ſenſible of theſe wonderful Favours and Bleſſings of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, (by Reaſon of the Commonneſs of them, and their own ſtrange Incogitancy) or being ſo affectionately thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for them, as the vaſt Worth and Importance of them do moſt reaſonably deſerve and require.</p>
            <p>WHAT I aim at, therefore, in the following Diſcourſe, is to awaken us all, both of the one and the other Sort, to a juſt Senſe of the intrinſic Worth and Excellency of that Method of worſhipping God our Heavenly Father, which we are ſo happy as to enjoy in the <hi>Church of England;</hi> that we may be affectionately thankful to his kind Providence for ſo ordering Things as to give us the ineſtimable Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of it; that we may give the ſtronger Attention to the Propriety and Uſefulneſs of every Part of it; and that our Souls may be filled with the greater Devotion and Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Uſe of it; as being ſenſible that we do truly <hi>worſhip God in the Beauty of Holineſs,</hi> and are under the greateſt Advantage of <hi>growing up in Holineſs and Comfort thro' Faith unto eternal Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is indeed an unſpeakable Advantage that we enjoy by the preaching of God's Holy Word, and particularly in this excellent Church, in that we have it explained to us in the cleareſt and moſt intelligible Manner, and that according to the original Simplicity of the Goſpel. That being freed from human Schemes and Devices, we are ſet at Liberty from all thoſe idle abſurd and groundleſs Notions of God and the Goſpel, which, both tend to give us hard and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Apprehenſions of <hi>the Father of Mercies,</hi> and to make his Goſpel, (the plaineſt and beſt Thing in the World) a meer unintelligible Riddle, almoſt void of common Senſe; and at the ſame Time, to weaken and enervate it's moſt powerful Motives to the utmoſt Vigour and Activity on our
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:008892_0006_103092F422648508"/>
Part, and to diſcourage our earneſt Prayers and Endeavours, by filling us with endleſs Doubts and Fears, and dark Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mizes and Deſpondencies: For in the Church we are led to attend to nothing but the plain Language and Meaning of the Holy Ghoſt; and have all the moſt ſalutary Doctrines, Precepts, Promiſes and Threatnings of the Goſpel ſo clearly ſet before us, and the Way of our Duty and the Road to everlaſting Happineſs made ſo plain, that <hi>he that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s may read,</hi> and <hi>the wayfaring Man though a Feel cannot err there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in:</hi> This I ſay is an unſpeakable Happineſs, and we ought to prize it <hi>beyond Gold, even the fineſt Gold,</hi> and to <hi>taſte a Sweetneſs in it</hi> beyond that <hi>of Honey, and the Honey Comb,</hi> and make Conſcience of diligently attending upon it; but yet ſtrictly ſpeaking, preaching is not to be conſidered as being properly a Part of the publick Worſhip, but rather as an Appendage to it.</p>
            <p>FOR the proper Notion of Worſhipping God, conſiſts in praiſing him for all his Benefits, and praying to him for whatſoever we want both for Soul and Body, and in devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ourſelves to his true and faithful Service: In all which we do, as it were, converſe with the great <hi>Father of our Spirits,</hi> and have the neareſt Intercourſe with him that our Souls are capable of; and conſequently ſhould put the greateſt Value upon it, as the principal End of our meeting together at the Houſe of God; and that we may openly and jointly do all the Honour we can to him our common heavenly Father. So that if there were no Sermon at all, we ſhould go together to the publick Offices of Prayer and Praiſe, with not a Whit the leſs Zeal and Forwardneſs; foraſmuch as our Buſineſs there, is, not to hear any new Thing, but to do our Duty to our great Creator, and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor; eſpecially ſince the Reading of God's Holy Word is a great Part of our publick Worſhip, and that, vaſtly preferable to any human Compoſition or Preaching whatſoever.</p>
            <p>LET us then learn to value Things in Proportion to the real Worth of them, and prefer the Worſhip of the Church, for the ſolid intrinſick Worth and Importance of it, before any the moſt eloquent Preaching: Wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

Many that would hardly think it worth their While to go to Church meerly to worſhip God, though that is by far the moſt valuable and important Part of our publick Service. And we ought to account it a very great Advantage and Excellency of our Church, that her publick Worſhip is always the ſame, and equally excellent, even the beſt in the World, howſoever indifferent the Capacity or Abilities of the Miniſter may be, conſidered as a Preacher. In order therefore that we may highly prize it, and make a ſerious and conſcientious Uſe of it, and think ourſelves very happy in it; I proceed, from the Words I have read, to explain and point out to you, the real Worth and Excellency of it; and in Conformity to it, call upon you all, as I truly may, in the Words of the holy Pſalmiſt, <hi>O! Worſhip the Lord in the Beauty of Holineſs.</hi>

               </gap>r therein we addreſs GOD, as our <hi>heavenly Father,</hi> which ſtrongly teaches and obliges us to be his holy and obedient Children.

Particularly, we pray that we a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

all, in every Thing, learn to <hi>do</hi> and <hi>ſubmit to his holy Will,</hi> as the Saints and Angels do <hi>in Heaven,</hi> that we may be forever holy and happy with them.

            <p n="2">2. HAVING made this Entrance on the publick Worſhip of God, we proceed to the Celebration of his <hi>Praiſes</hi> in the Pſalms of holy <hi>David,</hi> and other devout Hymns, taken out of the New Teſtament, and that admirable Chriſtian Hymn called <hi>Te Deum,</hi> between the Leſſons; all which breathe nothing but Holineſs, Devotion and Purity. For they do either celebrate the Glories, Perfections, and Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of God, in his wonderful Works of Creation, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, or Redemption; or expreſs our Senſe of our entire Dependence upon Him, and innumerable Obligations to his infinite Goodneſs; our Abhorrence of every Thing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing to Him, or our Reſolution to be in all Things obedient to his Will; or explain the Duty and Happineſs
<pb facs="unknown:008892_0016_103093120243C5E0"/>
of every Virtue, or the Baſeneſs, Perverſeneſs and Miſery of every Vice; or open the glorious Views both of God's Kingdom of Grace, and his Kingdom of Glory, and teach us the Practice and Experience of all thoſe heavenly Graces which are neceſſary to qualify us for an Intereſt in the Glories, and Felicities thereof. Theſe, and ſuch as theſe, are the noble Subjects of thoſe ſublime Odes, all which are in effect, nothing elſe but univerſal <hi>Holineſs to the Lord.</hi> So that the <hi>Pſalms</hi> are a moſt copious Store-Houſe of Devotion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of an endleſs and moſt beautiful Variety.</p>
            <p n="3">3.

This ſure, if any Thing may be called impoſing the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Men in the Worſhip of God; for I believe it may be truly ſaid, (with regard to many of their Aſſemblies at leaſt) that there are twenty Times as much Scripture in one of our Services, as in one of theirs.</p>

The People's Part is generally intermixed with the Miniſter's, and ſhort Reſponſes, in the Form of Eja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations, with ſet and continued Prayers, in which there is an agreeable Variety, and the Prayers are each of them ſhort, in Imitation of our Lord's Prayer; and there is a correſpondent Variety of Actions of the Body, ſuited to this Variety of the Exerciſes of the Mind; all wiſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived to keep the Congregations wakeful, lively and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.

            <p n="4">4. Tho' there is ſuch a grateful Variety in our Method of Worſhip, there is nevertheleſs a moſt <hi>beautiful Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi> therein preſcribed, which if acted up to, would vaſtly add to the Beauty and Excellency of it: Particularly in the uniform Appearance and <hi>Geſture of the Body</hi> in the whole Aſſembly, preſcribed to each Part of Worſhip. This is made light of by many as a trivial Matter, but herein they are certainly much in the wrong. St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s reaſoning is very forcible to ſhew the Neceſſity of bodily Worſhip, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> vi. 20. where he tells us <hi>we are bought with a Price,</hi> meaning our Bodies as well as our Souls, and that with no leſs a Price than the Blood of the Son of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is moſt fit and reaſonable that we ſhould <hi>glorify God with our Bodies as well as our Spirits,</hi> which are equally his; and of great Uſe is bodily Adoration: The Eye is apt to affect the Heart, and the Livelineſs and Activity of our Bodies naturally awakens and enlivens our Minds. Hence the Church ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> wiſely thought fit to direct and preſcribe the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>ons and Poſtures of our Bodies as well as the Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our Minds, that as St. <hi>Paul</hi> directs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xiv. 40, 26, <hi>all Things may be done decently and in Order. and for the Uſe of edifying.</hi> Now the Poſtures of the Body I ſhall here mention are ſitting, ſtanding and kneeling: Of theſe <hi>ſitting</hi> is the fartheſt from betokening any thing like Reverence or Devotion. For which Reaſon it is very ſtrange that any Chriſtians ſhould uſe that Poſture either in Prayers or Sacraments, ſince according to the common Acceptation of Mankind, nothing is underſtood to be more diſreſpectful and irreverent, and therefore indecent and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd. It is indeed not improperly indulged while we are in a Condition of Hearers and Learners, as in the Time of Sermon, but utterly inconſiſtent with the Condition of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers, in which Caſe <hi>ſtanding</hi> or <hi>kneeling</hi> was always uſed by the Church of God; and with good Reaſon; becauſe
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:008892_0024_10309325090E0610"/>
the Poſture or Action of the Body was ever conſidered as a Kind of Language expreſſive of the inward Senſe of the Mind, and as ſuch it is uſed in holy Scripture; where you obſerve that <hi>kneeling</hi> is always the Poſture of <hi>Prayer,</hi> and <hi>ſtanding</hi> the Poſture of <hi>Praiſe;</hi> which we ought accordingly to obſerve, if we would expreſs a due Regard to that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Almighty Being whom we adore. For this Reaſon our Church, according to Scripture, preſcribes that we kneel at our Prayers and ſtand at our Praiſes. Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Beauty implies <hi>Uniformity in the Midſt of Variety,</hi> the <hi>Beauty of Holineſs</hi> in the Worſhip of God, muſt manifeſtly imply that according to the Rules of the Church we ſhould all act alike in one uniform Manner. If then, there be not that Beauty of Uniformity in our Worſhip that were to be wiſhed, it is not becauſe the Church doth not preſcribe it, but becauſe we do not act up to her Preſcriptions. What can be more beautiful than a well-diciplined Army, where all look one Way, all obſerve the ſame Motions, all act alike with the utmoſt Exactneſs, according to the Word of Command. Now what is a Beauty there, would be equally ſo in the public Worſhip, where, as well as in an Army, all ſhould be Life and Activity, Uniformity and Exactneſs, <hi>Decency and Order,</hi> as if one Soul animated every Body. This would be indeed to <hi>worſhip God in the Beauty of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.</hi> Moreover,</p>
            <p n="5">5. As our Worſhip would be entirely beautiful if the Rules of it were obſerved as to the Uniformity of Geſture; ſo I muſt think it another great Article in its Beauty, that the <hi>People hear a uniform vocal Part</hi> in it, inſomuch that we do lit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For as there cannot be imagined a more beautiful Sight than for a large Number of Worſhippers to join together in Worſhip with one Heart and Voice, like Children in doing Honour to a common Parent; ſo it looks like a Kind of holy Strife, in our Method of joint vocal Worſhip, who ſhall do the greateſt Honour to our common heavenly Parent, while, <hi>keeping the Unity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace,</hi> we do, as it were, call upon one another, (the Miniſter and the People interchangably) and <hi>admoniſh one another</hi> in the ſhort

Reſponſes, and in the <hi>Pſalms and Hymns and ſpiritual Songs,</hi> all with Life and Spirit chaunting forth the high Praiſes of God. I am ſenſible, to thoſe who have been bred up in a contrary Way, this Method may ſeem at firſt to look like Confuſion; but let me aſſure thoſe to whom it may ſo ſeem, that if they would only have each his Book, and ſee every Thing with his own Eyes, and come a little while into the Cuſtom, this Objection would not only entirely vaniſh, but ſoon turn into the Appearance of a very ſenſible Beauty, and be found to be a ſolid Advantage. For not only the Eye, as I obſerved before, but alſo the Ear would affect the Heart, and it would not only animate a Spirit of Devotion towards God, but a Spirit of Charity towards one another, to find ourſelves ſurrounded with our Chriſtian Neighbours and Brethren, all joining together, and according to the Pattern of the holy Apoſtles, (<hi>Acts</hi> iv. 24) <hi>lifting up our Voices with one Accord</hi> in the Prayers and Praiſes offered up to Almighty God. My Neighbour's Voice will be ſo far from interrupting, that it will rather animate my Devotion, and give it the more Life and Spirit. This is what, I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, I find to be the Caſe; and I believe I may appeal to the Experience of all that have had an Opportunity of coming into a Habit of it. And let me farther aſſure you, that now after near forty Years Uſe of our excellent Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Worſhip, upon this Account, as well as the other Reaſons above mentioned, it is ſo far from growing tedious or a Matter of Formality, as ſome imagine, that every Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity ſeems to add freſh Life, and I ſee freſh Beauties, and find further Advantages in it from Time to Time. And one Thing that makes it the rather appear ſo amiable is, that in the Uſe of it I am off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And moreover, that, I find I am wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping God according to the antient Scripture Method, wherein it was the Manner for all the People to <hi>lift up their Voice with one Accord,</hi> not only in Singing, but in <hi>ſaying</hi> their Devotions.

               </gap> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the moſt antient Scripture Pattern, and that in Heaven as well as on Earth. And me thinks, as we would hope at length to join with the heavenly Choir above, we ſhould delight to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God in this beautiful Method while we are here on Earth, for this you muſt plainly ſee is to <hi>worſhip him in the Beauty of Holineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. And now <hi>laſtly,</hi> I might, if there was Room, add a good deal more upon the Beauty of our <hi>Poetry</hi> and <hi>Muſic.</hi> As to the Poetry of the Verſion of the Pſalms which we uſe, I muſt think it none of the leaſt of the many Beauties and Excellencies wherein we have vaſtly the Advantage of our Neighbours, that we uſe ſuch an excellent Verſion, which excels theirs beyond all Compariſon. And in the Harmony of our Muſic we generally excel, and ſhould do ſo much more, if we would more generally take a little Pains to be verſed in the Tunes and Rules of Singing. And truly it is very diſagreeable to ſee ſo many ſit down with their Mouths ſhut, when the reſt are engaged in ſo beautiful and amaiable a Part of Worſhip, than which nothing can more contribute to the promoting of Devotion and Holineſs. How can it be, that any of you can ſit as unconcerned Spectators, while ſo heavenly and delightful a Part of Worſhip is carrying on; eſpecially thoſe of the Fair Sex, whoſe Voices joined with ours, would mightily add to the Beauty and Harmony of this melodious Part of Worſhip; in which, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks all ſhould be active and forward to do what they can, and every one might do ſomething in bearing a Part in it. And if to our vocal, we add inſtrumental Muſic; if according to the antient Scripture Method, we add Organs to our Voices, and if to both of them we would add the ſincere and intenſe Devotion of our Hearts, our Worſhip would then be a very Heaven upon Earth, eſpecially if we uſed the admirable Chaunt of the Cathedral.</p>
            <p>Thus I have endeavoured to demonſtrate, not only that ours is the true genuine Worſhip, and that it is adapted in the beſt Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to promote Devotion and Holineſs, but that we do truly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God <hi>in the Beauty of Holineſs.</hi> Let us therefore, my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, rejoice and give Thanks to Almighty God for the unſpaek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Advantages we enjoy, and be zealous in our Attachment <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
