            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

sheweth that it was Idolatry, for which many of them were plagued and punished: and yet their meaning was to worship the true God in the Calf; for they were not so simple as to think or believe that that dead Idol or Image was God; and therefore the Idolatry of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is as gross and wicked as their was.</p>
            <p>Pray let us represent to our selves two Souls, one Protestant and the other Papist, and both before Jesus Christ at the fearful day of his Judgment. If Christ ask the Protestant Soul, why she did not make Images, nor bow down her self to them, nor worship them, nor serve them; she will answer him, it is because thou didst say unto me, <hi>thou shalt not make unto thee any Graven Image, or any likeness of any thing; thou shalt not bow down thy self to them, nor serve them.</hi> And If Jesus Christ, as I suppose should say unto her, thou oughtest to understand there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Idols, and distinguish between the worship of <gap reason="foreign">

And tho' the Lord saith by <hi>Hosea,</hi> 13. <hi>In me only is thy help there is no favour besides me.</hi> Nevertheless the Pope to fatten his Cheeks, and fill his Truncks with Money, will have us to have recourse un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Saints, and take them for our Advocates and Mediators, as it may be seen in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> Seff. 25.

the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> 1. 3. <hi>That Jesus Christ purged himself our sins;</hi> and in St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> Rom. 1. 1. <hi>There is now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus.</hi> And in <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 13. <hi>Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord, from henceforth, yea</hi> saith the Spirit, <hi>that they may rest from their labours, and their works do follow them.</hi> And in the Book of <hi>Wisdom</hi> canonized by the general Council of <hi>Trent, The souls of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous are in the hands of God, and there shall no torment touch them.</hi> Nevertheless the <hi>Roman Church</hi> believeth and teacheth that there is a place called Purgatory, wherein the Souls of the Just are tormented and afflicted, some for a short time, some for a hundred years, some for a thousand and upwards, and others to the end of this World. <hi>I do constantly hold,</hi> saith Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth, finding Purgatory to be very ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable for his Kitchin, <hi>there is a Purgatory, and that the souls there detained are holpen by the suffrages of the faithful.

               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I shew she doth destroy her self, when she will have us to believe under the pain of damnation, that there is a Purgatory.

               </gap> for the purgation of a Murther, but for the punishment of it. Therefore seeing Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, according to the Papists, is only for the pain due to sins, they destroy themselves, when they call it Purgatory. For it hath no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in the Holy Scripture; Christ sheweth out two places, Heaven and Hell, saying that the rich mans soul, which was unmerciful to <hi>Lazarus,</hi> went after his death to Hell, and there was tormented, and that <hi>Lazarus</hi> soul (he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead) was carried into <hi>Abraham's</hi> Bosom, a

To the Thief which was executed with Christ at his passion, and believed in him, Christ answered, <hi>This day shalt thou be with me in Paradise:</hi> which sheweth that the souls of the faithful never come into Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory fire, to be burnt and punished; for all their sins are forgiven, and consequently the punishment incident to the same is forgiven al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, and their souls pass from death to life, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Heaven.

               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Papists hold their general Councils and their Pope cannot err; but they are deceived, for St. <hi>Austin</hi> plainly teacheth, that only the Scriptures cannot err; <hi>General Councils,</hi> saith he, <hi>which are gathered of all the Christian World, are often corrected, the former by the latter, when by any trial of things that is open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed which was shut, and that is known which was hidden.</hi> If a General Council may be corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, as saith <hi>Austin, ergo</hi> it may err; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he speaketh thus to <hi>Maximiand</hi> the Bishop of the <hi>Arians; Neither ought I to alledge the Council of</hi> Nice, <hi>nor thou the Council of</hi> Arimene, <hi>to take advantage thereby; for neither am I bound nor held by the authority of this, nor thou of that; for set Matter with Matter, Cause with Cause, Reason with Reason; try the matter by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Scriptures.</hi> The Council of <hi>Cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> condemned the setting up Images in the Church, and the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> afterwards allowed them. One of them being contrary, must needs be erroneous. And that is granted by it self, when in a set form of Prayer, which is appointed to be said after every Council, they pray, <hi>That God would spare their ignorance, and pardon their errors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Pope himself may err. Pope <hi>Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> doth teach, <hi>That young Children cannot be
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:000384_0018_0FA503D32DF077B0"/>
saved except they receive the Baptism of Christ, and also the Communion of the Body and Blood of Christ.</hi> Pope <hi>Galatius</hi> Decreed, <hi>that all they should be excommunicated which would receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords Supper but in one kind.</hi> But this Doctrine is taxed for an error by all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, and the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> made a Decree contrary to the Doctrine of the Pope <hi>Gelasius. Si quis dixerit ex Dei proecepto vel necessitate salutis omnes &amp; singulos Christi fideles, utramque speciem sanctissimi Eucharistioe Sacramenti sumere debere, anath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ma sit. Ergo</hi> the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> may err, and we may see it in their Decrees, wherein it is written, <hi>that he is to be judged of none except he be found erring from the faith,</hi> whereby it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that they thought he might err in matters of Faith, or else that exception was put in vain. All men are subject to error; all men are liars in their own words, and sinners in their works, therefore by their own confession, General Councils and Popes are not infallible; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when they say they cannot err, they both contradict themselves and add to the Word of God, and think above that which is written.</p>
            <p>They boast also the Popes Supremacy; they say that the Pope hath preheminence or autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ove<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> all the other Bishops; but upon what ground, I know not. They say it is because he i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Successor to <hi>Peter,</hi> and because <hi>Peter</hi> had such a preheminence and authority over the rest of
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:000384_0019_0FA503D401CF4D78"/>
the Apostles, therefore the Pope being his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor, must be so over all Bishops. But it is false that <hi>Peter</hi> had such preheminence over the rest of the Apostles. I grant that Christ said to <hi>Peter,</hi> after he had confessed him to be that Christ, and the Son of the living God, <hi>Thou are</hi> Peter, <hi>and upon this Rock I will build my Church;</hi> but these words give no superiority to <hi>Peter</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the rest, only they shew that the Church is builded, not upon the Person of <hi>Peter,</hi> but upon the Rock, namely upon Christ, whom <hi>Peter</hi> confesseth to be the Son of the living God; for as saith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 4. <hi>That Rock was Christ, and other foundation no man can lay, but that which is laid already, namely, Jesus Christ.</hi> And in the second Chapter to the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesians,</hi> he saith, <hi>That the Church is builded upon the Foundation of the Prophets and Apostles,</hi> Christ Jesus himself being the head-stone in the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Where then can they find that <hi>Peter</hi> was made Prince of the Apostles? and had prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence or authority over them? they answer it is when Christ gave unto <hi>Peter</hi> the Keys of binding and losing; but hereunto I say, that Christ therein gave no authority more to <hi>Peter</hi> than to the rest; for he doth not say I give unto thee, but I will give unto thee, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise was afterwards performed, and when it was performed, the Keys or the power of bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and losing was given not only to <hi>Peter,</hi> but
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:000384_0020_0FA503D4AD0D4F58"/>
also unto all the rest together. <hi>Go ye</hi> saith Christ <hi>unto all Nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in <hi>John,</hi> the twentieth he speaketh thus, <hi>Receive ye the Holy Ghost; whatsoever sins ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, they are remitted unto them, and whatsoever sins ye retain, they are retained.</hi> By these words we may see that Christ speaketh unto all the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, and not to <hi>Peter</hi> only, and so it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that <hi>Peter received no power</hi> more than the rest of the Apostles; Pray, let them tell me, where was <hi>Peter's</hi> Supremacy, when <hi>Paul</hi> repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him to his face? <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 11. <hi>I withstood him to his face, saith</hi> Paul, <hi>because he was to be blamed.</hi> Where was <hi>Peter's</hi> Supremacy, when at the Council held at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> where the Apostles were, yet not <hi>Peter,</hi> but <hi>James</hi> ruled the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and according to his Sentence was the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree made? and when there was a contention amongst the Apostles, who should be the greatest amongst them, Christ told them plainly these words, <hi>Luk.</hi>22. <hi>The Kings of the Gentiles exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise Lordship over them, and they that exercise Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority upon them are called Benefactors; but ye shall not be so, but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger, and be that is chief as he th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="17" facs="unknown:000384_0021_0FA503D56657A4B0"/>
therefore since the Popes Supremacy over all the other Bishops, is grounded by the Papists upon <hi>Peter's</hi> Supremacy over the rest of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles; and since <hi>Peter</hi> hath not such a prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence or authority over them, it followeth that the Pope hath none over the other Bishops.</p>
            <p>This is confirmed by St. <hi>Hierosm ad Evagram</hi> he saith, <hi>That the Bishop of</hi> Eugubium, <hi>or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the least See, is equal to the Bishop of</hi> Rome; for they all joyned in the same Commission, they must serve in the Church, be diligent to discharge that great charge in the Church, which their Master Jesus Christ hath equally laid upon them. And Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> himself af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth, <hi>That whosoever taketh the title of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Bishop to his See, he cannot be less than An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore the Roman Church addeth to the Word of God, and thinketh above that which is written, when she boasteth of the Supremacy, or Superiority of their Popes over all other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, since this Doctrine hath no ground in the Holy Scriptures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> believeth that their Pope hath authority to depose Kings and Princes, and to kill those they call Heretick. But upon what ground I know not; It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

By me</hi> faith he, <hi>Kings Reign, and Princes bear Dominion.</hi> He remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth Kings, and setteth up Kings; seeing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is God, that hath this authority proper to himself, which way can the Pope claim it, without injury to the Power of God? they answer, it is by reason of his Keys; but they must remember that the Keys given, were the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently by authority of the Keys he cannot meddle with terrestrial Kingdoms to shut out those that are in them. And he hath no more authority by the power of the Keys, or of bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and losing, than any other Bishop; for the Keys were given to all the rest of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles as well as to <hi>Peter;</hi> For Christ spoke thus; <hi>Job.</hi> 20.23. <hi>Receive ye the Holy Ghost, whose so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them, and whose so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever sins ye retain, they are retained.</hi> And therefore for any Minister of the Gospel, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to claim authority above another, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the will of Christ, for they are all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently joyned in one Commission, and consequently have all equal authority. And therefore the Pope hath no more authority by the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:000384_0023_0FA503D85F34B178"/>
vertue of his Keys, than any other Bishop, that is to say, none at all to depose Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: his duty is rather to obey them, and to teach the same obedience to others, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles of Christ did. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Submit your selves</hi> (saith Peter) <hi>to every ordinance of men for the Lords sake, whether it be to the King as su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers,</hi> &amp;c. and Christ himself said, <hi>His Kingdom was not of this world,</hi> he refused to be made a King. Himself payed tribute to <hi>Caesar,</hi> and commanded others to do the same. If Christ were subject to <hi>Caesar,</hi> is it not a shame to the Pope to exalt himself a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove <hi>Caesar,</hi> I mean above a King?</p>
            <p>The Papists answer that he got this sovereign Authority by donation from <hi>Constantine,</hi> but I will grant some Christian Emperour was so foolish as to give his Empire (which is neither likely, nor credible) yet I say it was not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to take it, if he will be a Minister of the Gospel, or Successor of the Apostles: for Christ hath expresly forbidden his Apostles, and in them all the Ministers of the Gospel, all such Dominious, saying thus unto them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 26. <hi>The Kings of the Nations reign over them, and they that be great amongst them, bear Rule or Dominion, but it shall not be so with you;</hi> which words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prohibitory, shew that they must not reign like Kings of Nations, but they must serve in

By these words it appeareth clearly that it is contrary to the Holy Scripture, to say, that the Body of Jesus Christ is yet upon Earth; yet the <hi>Roman Church</hi> believes that Christs Body is still upon Earth in several places, therefore she addeth to the Word of God, and thinketh above that which is written, therefore she is Heretick.</p>
            <p>I know what the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> saith for the Proof of her Belief; her principal Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is this; <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.26. <hi>Christ took bread and gave thanks, and said, Take ye and eat, this is my Body, which is broken for you.</hi> Jesus Christ saith the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> is true: He hath said in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Bread, <hi>this is my Body,</hi> therefore this Bread ought to be changed into the true Body of Jesus Christ; and to shew (she saith) that it is not the Figure of Jesus Christ, and these words, <hi>this is my Body,</hi> are not Metaphorical (as the Protestant Church believeth) because he said, <hi>which is broken for you;</hi> now it is not the figure of Jesus Christ, which was broken for us, but the true Body.</p>
            <p>To which I answer, it is certain that Jesus Christ is true, and though he said, <hi>This is my Body which is broken for you,</hi> and that it was the true Body of Jesus Christ which was broken for us, and not the Figure; that doth not hinder
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:000384_0028_0FA503DE6B054A58"/>
these words from being Metaphorical: And to let you see clearly, observe my reason. <hi>This is my Body which is broken for you,</hi> (is) that is to say <hi>signifieth or representeth,</hi> as you may see in several other passages of the Scripture, as for example in this; <hi>the Rock was Christ,</hi> where this word (<hi>was</hi>) means <hi>did signifie or represent. Which is broken for you,</hi> the Relative (<hi>which</hi>) doth not serve to shew the Transubstantiation, or that the Bread is changed into the true Body of Jesus Christ, because it is related to the word (<hi>Body</hi>) and not to the proposition, <hi>This is my Body;</hi> it hath relation to the Attribute, and not to the Subject; that which, according to Cardinal <hi>Cajetan,</hi> hindereth not this Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to be Metaphorical, no more than this, <hi>the Rock was Christ;</hi> for if the Evangelist had added, which was crucified, or which was rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed again; as the Relative (<hi>which</hi>) would not hinder this Proposition from being Metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal; likewise these words, <hi>which is broken for you,</hi> hinder not the other Proposition, to be Improper or Metaphorical.</p>
            <p>Mark, that his Body was not broken before he Suffered. How did he say then, <hi>which is broken,</hi> before it was broken? there is no sense of it but this; the Bread was broken, and sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified that his Body should be broken; now as the breaking of the Bread, did signifie the breaking of his Body, so the Bread must signifie
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:000384_0029_0FA503DF2E611BA0"/>
his Body: but as his body was not broken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, when the Bread was broken, so the Bread could not be his Body indeed, for then his Body should have been broken, when the Bread was broken. If because Christ saith <hi>This is my Body, this is my Blood,</hi> they will have these words to be expounded Literally; why then do they not expound the other words of Christ litterally also, as concerning the Cup? for the Text saith, that he took the Cup, and said, <hi>This is my Blood.</hi> I am sure they will not say that the Cup was the Blood of Christ, (as the words be) but they will grant a Figure in those words, namely <hi>Continens pro Contonto,</hi> that by the Cup is meant the Wine in it; if then they will admit a Figure in this, why may not there be a Figure in the other? namely <hi>Signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam pro <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I may prove as well that Christ is a Door, because he saith, <hi>I am a Door;</hi> or a Vine, because he saith, <hi>I am a Vine;</hi> for his sayings are alike; Figurative Speeches must not be construed Lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally: Now that they may see, that not we on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly say it is Bread and Wine after Consecration, Christ himself doth call it Bread and Wine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had given it as he did before; <hi>Mark</hi> 14. 25. there he sayes, <hi>I will drink no more of the fruit of the Vine:</hi> Here Christ saith, that it was
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:000384_0030_0FA503DFEC38EC40"/>
the fruit of the Vine, which he drank, but his Blood is not the Fruit of the Vine, therefore Wine was his Drink, and not Blood; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore after Consecration, Wine was still Wine. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith plainly and expresly, 1 Cor. 11. 26,27,28. <hi>That the Communicant doth eat Bread,</hi> Ergo, it remaineth Bread after the words of Consecration: For if it were Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

And as it is plainly said, Joh.6.63. <hi>This is my Body,</hi> so it is plainly said, <hi>These words are Spirit,</hi> that is they must be understood Spiritually, and not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:000384_0031_0FA503E0B1CEA410"/>
It was Christs manner to teach by Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, and Figures, shewing one thing by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For Example, Christ calleth the Lamb the Passeover, in place whereof this Sacrament succeeded, and therefore presently after they had eaten the Passeover, Christ Instituted this Sacrament to be used for it; Christ, I say, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Lamb the Passeover, and yet the Passeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was this, an Angel passed over the Houses of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> and struck the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> this was not a Lamb, and yet because a Lamb was a Sign of this Passeover, as the Bread and Wine is of Christs body, therefore Christ called the Lamb the Passeover, as he called the Bread and Wine his Body. That may be seen again in Circumcision, Baptism, and the Cup. For Circumcision is called the Covenant, and yet Circumcision was nothing but the cutting away of a skin; and the Covenant is this, <hi>In Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's Seed all Nations shall be blessed, I will be their God, and they shall be my People, I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend and save them, and they shall serve and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship me.</hi> This is not Circumcision, and yet as though Circumcision were the Covenant it self, it is called the Covenant, because it signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the Covenant; so Bread and Wine are called Christs Body, because they signifie Christs Body.</p>
            <p>Baptism is called Regeneration, and yet Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism <hi>is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="28" facs="unknown:000384_0032_0FA503E19B1CF2D0"/>
is the renewing of the mind to the Image wherein it was Created. This is not Baptism, and yet as though Baptism were Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation it self, it is called Regeneration; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it signifieth Regeneration; so the Bread and Wine are called Christs Body and Blood, because they signifie them.</p>
            <p>And the Cup is called the New Testament; and yet the Cup is but a piece of Metal, filled with Wine, and the New Testament is, <hi>He which believes in the Son of God shall be saved.</hi> This is not a Cup, and yet as though the Cup were the New-Testament it self, it is called the New Testament; so the Bread and Wine are called <hi>Christs Body and Blood,</hi> because they sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie <hi>Christs Body and Blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this Doctrine of ours may be confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, because every Sacrament was called by the thing which it signified, and yet never any Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament was taken for the thing it self, It is the consent of all Writers, that a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a Sign, therefore not the thing signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, no more than the <hi>Bush</hi> at the Door, is the Wine in the <hi>Cellar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But</hi> what then will the Papists say, is there nothing in the Sacrament but <hi>Bread and Wine?</hi> Nay, we say not that the Sacrament is nothing but a bare Sign, or that we receive no more than that you see; for <hi>Christ</hi> saith, <hi>that it is his Body,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>that it is the Communion of
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:000384_0033_0FA503E225633A60"/>
Christs Body and Blood:</hi> Therefore there is more in Sacramental <hi>B</hi>read than in common <hi>B</hi>read; though the nature be not changed, yet the use is changed; it doth not only serve the body as it did before, but also it bringeth a bread with it which nourisheth the Soul; for as sure we receive bread, so sure we receive <hi>Christ.</hi> And you may see this by this Similitude; Thou hast an Obligation in thy hand, and I ask thee what hast thou there? and thou sayest, I have here an hundred Pounds; why, say I, there is nothing but Paper, Ink and Wax. Oh, but by this, sayst thou, I will recover an hundred Pounds, and that is as good. So this is as good, that under these signs you receive the vertue of Christs <hi>B</hi>ody and <hi>B</hi>lood by Faith, as if you did eat his <hi>B</hi>ody, and drink his <hi>B</hi>lood indeed.</p>
            <p n="7">7<hi>thly.</hi> This Doctrine of Transubstantiation is also contrary to the Senses, to Reason, and to the Holy Fathers.</p>
            <p>When the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would oblige me to believe that what my Senses behold, is not <hi>B</hi>read nor Wine, but the true <hi>B</hi>ody and <hi>B</hi>lood of Jesus Christ, it is clear that it is contrary to them, since they are sensible of the contrary; for my eyes see them to be <hi>B</hi>read and Wine; I smell <hi>B</hi>read and Wine; I tast <hi>B</hi>read and Wine; and my hands feel <hi>B</hi>read and Wine.</p>
            <p>They confess with us, that it is contrary to the Senses, but that this Mystery ought not to
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:000384_0034_0FA503E5A8664130"/>
be measured by the Senses, and that Jesus Christ being true, and having taken <hi>B</hi>read and Wine, saying, <hi>this is my Body, and this is my Blood;</hi> this <hi>B</hi>read and Wine must be changed into his <hi>B</hi>ody and Blood: that indeed it is contrary to the Senses, but they ought not to be Judges in the Mysteries of Faith.</p>
            <p>I answer, that Jesus Christ made use of the Senses to prove to his Apostles, that he was not a Spirit, but a body, when he saith to them, <hi>Luk.</hi>24.32. <hi>Handle me and see, for a Spirit hath no flesh and bones as ye see me have.</hi> And if the Fathers Disputing against the <hi>Marcionites</hi> and <hi>Eutichians,</hi> the former of which believed that Jesus Christ had not a true body, but only the appearance; and the latter, that the substance of his body was changed into the Godhead after his Resurrection: they made use of the same words of Jesus Christ, <hi>Handle me and see, for a Spirit hath no flesh and bones as ye see me have.</hi> To provethe falsity of their belief, I may, after their example, make use of my Senses in the Sacrament of the Eucharist, and and say, to let the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> know, that what they believe to be the true Body and Blood of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> is truly Bread and Wine, <hi>Handle and see.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They say besides that, the reason why <hi>Christ</hi> Body was not seen in the Sacrament, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is there miraculously, and that there
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:000384_0035_0FA503E6DF0135C8"/>
is a Miracle in the Sacrament; whereunto I answer, that if the Bread be turned into the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Body of <hi>Christ,</hi> by a Miracle, then should it appear visibly so: for the nature of every Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle is to be visible to the outward eye and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, as when Christ turned Water into Wine; it was visibly Wine; when <hi>Moses's</hi> Rod was turned into a Serpent, it was visibly a Serpent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> and so if the Bread be turned into the very Body of <hi>Christ,</hi> it is visibly a body, if they will hold a Miracle therein. But <hi>Austin</hi> answereth there is no Miracle in the Sacrament, saying thus, <hi>Honorem tanquam Religiosa possunt habere, staporem tanquam Mira non possunt:</hi> That is, <hi>the Sacraments may have honour as things Religious, but are not to be admired as Miracles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8<hi>thly.</hi> It is also contrary to reason, first, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it supposes the same body in several pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces at one time; a body may be considered objectively at one time in several places, but that it should be physically or substantially in many places at one time altogether, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would have, which saith and obligeth to believe, that the body of Jesus Christ is substantially in Heaven, and Earth, and in every place, where the Priest pleaseth to consecrate, or pronounce these words, <hi>This is my body, this is my blood;</hi> and in every part of the consecrated bread: so that if you divide it into a thousand parts, it is there in every part
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:000384_0036_0FA503E7715A75E0"/>
wholly: it is that which is contrary to reason, because according to reason, a body of six foot in dimension, cannot occupy no more place, than the circumference of six foot; and though it may be successively in several places, yet it cannot at the same time.</p>
            <p>And these words of <hi>Peter, Act.</hi>3.22. whom the Heaven must receive until the times of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of all things prove my sayings evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently. For if his Body be in Heaven, and that he hath a true Body (as all men know he hath) how can it be that it should be both in Heaven and in Earth, as touching his Body, at one time? for though he have a glorified Body, yet he retaineth the nature and property of a true Body still, which can be but in one place at once; and so saith <hi>Austin, Corpus Domini in quo resurrexit, uno tantum loco esse potest<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>:</hi> That is <hi>The Body of the Lord wherein he rose again, can be but in one place only.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is against Reason, because it maketh Accidents exist without any Subject; it is the nature of Accidents to be joyned to their Subject: as for Example, it is the nature of the whiteness of a Stone to be joyned to the Stone; so that if you destroy the nature or substance of the Stone, you must of necessity destroy its whiteness, and other its Accidents, and according to the Opinion of modern Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers, who say that Accidents are nothing
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:000384_0037_0FA503E83043DD90"/>
else than matter modified, that is to say, as it is disposed to this or that fashion, it followeth that matter cannot be destroyed without its Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents being destroyed likewise with it. It is the Opinion of <hi>Iraeneus,</hi> who saith, <hi>That we cannot consider water, without its humidity, nor fire without heat, nor a stone without hardness; these things being so united, that the one cannot be without the other, but that they must exist together.</hi> And the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> teacheth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, for in their mystery of Transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they put the Accidents without any Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; they put colour and quantity without matter, smell and tast without substance; hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and humidity without their being any thing that is hard and moist, which I may very well say or affirm is contrary to reason.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ninthly,</hi> Likewise it is contrary to the holy Fathers; they say that the Eucharist Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted is Bread, such as we eat, and which satisfieth the Belly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theodoret</hi> saith, <hi>Neque enim signa mystica post sanctificationem recedunt a matura sua, manent enim in priore substantia, figura &amp; forma, &amp; videri &amp; tangi possint sicut prius,</hi> That is, <hi>The mystical signs after Consecration do not depart from their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for they abide still in their former substance, figure and form, and may be both seen and felt as before.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The same <hi>Theodoret</hi> saith, <hi>That Jesus Christ
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:000384_0038_0FA503E91740ED38"/>
hath honoured the visible Symbols with the Name of his Body and Blood, not in changing their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but in adding grace to it.</hi>

If they had believed that the Consecrated Wine was the Blood of Jesus Christ, as now the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> believeth, is it credible that they would have mixt Ink with it, and dipped their Pens with it? no, it is not to be believed, for the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would not do so now, but would believe they should commit an horrible Sacriledg.</p>
            <p>That which confirms all that I am about to alledge from the Fathers against the pretended mystery of Transubstantiation, is, that when they Disputed against Idolaters, they confuted them with these words; <hi>Why do ye adore what your hands have made, and which hath neither Speech, nor motion, and which is subject to fire,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:000384_0041_0FA503EC0399F388"/>
and to corruption, and to be stollen away by Thieves?</hi> If at that time, they had believed that Jesus Christ had been under the Accidents of Bread and Wine, and if the Fathers had taught that Doctrine, it is most certain the Idolaters would have retorted their Argument, and have said, that the God which they adored in the bread was a work of their own hands, which hath neither speech, nor motion, but was subject to corruption, to fire, and to be stolen away; but we do not find they made such an Answer. Therefore it is a sign that this Doctrine was not taught by the Fathers but was contrary to them. Moreover, if they had believed Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation, that is to say, the changing of the Bread and Wine into the true Body and Blood of Jesus Christ, they would not have failed to instruct us that a body is under a point that it hath Accidents without any Subject; that it is after the manner of a Spirit; they would have taught us what nourishes our bodies in the receiving of the Sacrament and from whence come the worms which are ingendred in the bread; they would have told us what kind of action it is which maketh Christ exist under the species of bread and wine; whether it was a Reproduction, or Adduction, or U<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation? I say they would have taught us all these things, since the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> giveth now a particular Instruction in it; now since
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:000384_0042_0FA503ECCD4B84C8"/>
they were as wise and learned, as the present Doctors of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> now, and since they said nothing of it, it is a mark that this Doctrine was contrary to their Opinion.</p>
            <p>And when they disputed against the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cionites</hi> and <hi>Eutichians</hi> the former of which believed that Jesus Christ had not a true body, but only an appearance; and the latter that the substance of his body was changed into the Godhead after his Resurrection; they alledged these words of our Lord, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 39. <hi>Handle me and see, for a Spirit hath no flesh and bones as ye see me have.</hi> If they had believed that in the Lords Supper the Accidents had continued without the substance of bread and wine (as the present Church of <hi>Rome</hi> believes) the <hi>Marcionites</hi> would not have failed to alledge this example to prove that the senses perceived in Jesus Christ an appearance of a body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reallity, as they did see in the Lords Supper an appearance of bread and wine when they were not really there. But so it is that they did never alledge such an Example; therefore I may truly say that this was not the belief of those times, and that it was contrary to the opinion of the antient Fathers.</p>
            <p>And to shew you the right Father of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation, it was one of the Dreams of <hi>Innocentius</hi> the third, in the year of our Lord 1215. So many years passed before
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:000384_0043_0FA503ED992D3890"/>
Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation was named, and then a Pope set it first on foot; so it came out of <hi>Rome,</hi> and for want of Scriptures hath been defended with Fire and Sword.</p>
            <p>You see then that the Doctrine of Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation is contrary to the Holy Scriptures; and since notwithstanding the <hi>Roman Church</hi> doth believe it, it is evident they add to the Word of God, and think above that which is written, and therefore they are Heretick.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Roman Church</hi> doth not only think a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove that which is written, and add to the Word of God; but also diminisheth from it, as I will shew you evidently.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> The Apostle of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> will not only have us to speak in the Church with a known tongue; but also he sheweth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of them which speak in an unknown. <hi>Except Pipe or Harp</hi> saith he, <hi>give distinction in the sound, how shall it be known what is Piped or Harped? If the Trumpet giveth an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the Battle? So likewise you, except ye utter by the tongue words easie to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air. I thank my God,</hi> saith he, <hi>I speak with tongues more than you all, yet in the Church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Nevertheless, when the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> had mounted themselves to an eminent degree of grandeur in the world, then nothing would serve their turnes, but they must be giving Laws, and prescribing Rules, though never so irregular and unreasonable; and as Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors usually bring in, and oftentimes impose their own language, on those they have subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and intied for their Slaves; so the Popes made it their business to plant their Roman Rites, Ceremonies and Language in what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches they could, that the same might afterwards serve as an argument of their Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, and the others dependence.</p>
            <p>It is then manifest the Roman Church dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth from the Word of God, and thinketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove that which is written.</p>
