            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THERE is not a greater evidence either of the reality or the power of religion, than a firm belief of God's uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal preſence, and a conſtant attention to the influence and operation of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. It is by this means that the Chriſtian may be ſaid, in the emphatical ſcripture language, <hi>to walk with God, and to endure as ſeeing him who is invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:015224_0004_0F97835157401278"/>THE doctrine of divine providence is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry full and complete in the ſacred oracles. It extends not only to things which we may think of great moment, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore worthy of notice, but to things the moſt indifferent and inconſiderable: <hi>Are not two ſparrows ſold for a farthings,</hi> ſays our Lord, <hi>and one of them falleth not on the ground without your heavenly Father; nay, the very hairs of your head are all numbered.</hi> It extends not only to things beneficial and ſalutary, or to the direction and aſſiſtance of thoſe who are the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the living God; but to things ſeemingly moſt hurtful and deſtructive, and to perſons the moſt refractory and diſobedient. He over-rules all his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and all their actions. Thus we are told, that <hi>fire, hail, ſnow, vapour, and ſtormy wind, fulfil his word,</hi> in the courſe of nature; and even ſo the moſt impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and diſorderly paſſions of men, that are under no reſtraint from themſelves, are yet perfectly ſubject to the dominion of Jehovah. They carry his commiſſion, they obey his orders, they are limited and reſtrained by his authority, and they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire with every thing elſe in promoting
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:015224_0005_0F97835225736700"/>
his glory. There is the greater need to take notice of this, that men are not ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſufficiently aware of the diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between the law of God and his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; they are apt to ſuppoſe, that as the temper of the ſinner is contrary to the one, ſo the outrages of the ſinner are able to defeat the other; than which nothing can be more falſe. The truth is plainly aſſerted, and nobly expreſſed by the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt in the text, <hi>Surely the wrath of man ſhall praiſe thee; the remainder of wrath ſhall thou reſtrain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS pſalm was evidently compoſed as a ſong of praiſe for ſome ſignal victory obtained, which was at the ſame time a remarkable deliverance from threatning danger. The author was one or other of the later prophets, and the occaſion probably the unſucceſsful aſſault of Jeruſalem, by the army of Senacherib king of Aſſyria, in the days of Hezekiah. Great was the inſolence and boaſting of his generals and ſervants againſt the city of the living God, as may be ſeen in the thirty-ſixth chapter of Iſaiah. Yet it pleaſed God to deſtroy their enemies, and, by his own
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:015224_0006_0F978352F4B93CF8"/>
immediate interpoſition, to grant them deliverance. Therefore the Pſalmiſt ſays in the fifth and ſixth verſes of this pſalm, <hi>The ſtout-hearted are ſpoiled, they have ſlept their ſleep. None of the men of might have found their hands. At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob! both the chariot and the horſe are call into a deep ſleep.</hi> After a few more remarks to the ſame purpoſe, he draws the inference, or makes the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection in the text, <hi>Surely the wrath of man ſhall praiſe thee; the remainder of wrath ſhalt thou reſtrain:</hi> which may be paraphraſed thus, The fury and injuſtice of oppreſſors, ſhall bring in a tribute of praiſe to thee; the influence of thy righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous providence ſhall be clearly diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the countenance and ſupport thou wilt give to thine own people ſhall be gloriouſly illuſrated; thou ſhalt ſet the bounds which the boldeſt cannot paſs.</p>
            <p>I AM ſenſible, my brethren, that the time and occaſion of this pſalm, may ſeem to be in one reſpect ill ſuited to the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſting circumſtances of this country at preſent. It was compoſed after the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was obtained; whereas we are now
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:015224_0007_0F9783549AD68390"/>
but putting on the harneſs, and entering upon an important conteſt, the length of which it is impoſſible to forſee, and the iſſue of which it will perhaps be thought preſumption to foretell. But as the truth, with reſpect to God's moral government, is the ſame and unchangeable; as the iſſue, in the caſe of Senacherib's invaſion, did but lead the prophet to acknowledge it; our duty and intereſt conſpire in calling upon us to improve it. And I have choſen to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon it on this day of ſolemn humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation as it will probably help us to a clear and explicit view of what ſhould be the chief ſubject of our prayers and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, as well as the great object of our hope and truſt, in our preſent ſituation.</p>
            <p>THE truth, then, aſſerted in this text, which I propoſe to illuſtrate and improve, is,—<hi>That all the diſorderly paſſions of men, whether expoſing the innocent to private injury, or whether they are the arrows of divine judgment in public cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, ſhall, in the end, be to the praiſe of God</hi>: Or, to apply it more particularly to the preſent ſtate of the American Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, and the plague of war,—<hi>The am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:015224_0008_0F978355147B7050"/>
of miſtaken princes, the cunning and cruelty of oppreſſive and corrupt miniſters, and even the inhumanity of bruial ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, however dreadful, ſhall finally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the glory of God, and in the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, while the ſtorm continues, his mercy and kindneſs ſhall appear in preſcribing bounds to their rage and fury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN diſcourſing of this ſubject, it is my intention, through the aſſiſtance of divine grace,</p>
            <p n="1">I. To point out to you in ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, how the wrath of man praiſes God.</p>
            <p n="2">II. To apply theſe principles to our preſent ſituation, by inferences of truth for your inſtruction and comfort, and by ſuitable exhortations to duty in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant criſis<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>IN the <hi>firſt</hi> place, I am to point out to you in ſome particulars, how the wrath of man praiſes God. I ſay in <hi>ſome</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, becauſe it is far from being in my power, either to mention or explain the whole. There is an unſearchable depth in
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:015224_0009_0F978355D283B348"/>
the divine counſels, which it is impoſſible for us to penetrate. It is the duty of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good man to place the moſt unlimited confidence in divine wiſdom, and to believe that thoſe meaſures of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that are moſt unintelligible to him, are yet planned with the ſame ſkill, and directed to the ſame great purpoſes as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the reaſon and tendency of which he can explain in the cleareſt manner. But where revelation and experience ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles us to diſcover the wiſdom, equity, or mercy of divine providence, nothing can be more delightful or profitable to a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mind, and therefore I beg your at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to the following remarks.</p>
            <p>IN the <hi>firſt</hi> place, the wrath of man praiſes God, as it is an example and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtration of divine truth, and clearly points out the corruption of our nature, which is the foundation ſtone of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of redemption. Nothing can be more abſolutely neceſſary to true religion, than a clear and full conviction of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of our nature and ſtate. Without this there can be neither repentance in the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:015224_0010_0F9783569AA69DD8"/>
ſinner, nor humility in the believer. Without this all that is ſaid in ſcripture of the wiſdom and mercy of God, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding a Saviour, is without force and without meaning. Juſtly does our Saviour ſay, <hi>The whole have no need of a phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, but thoſe that are ſick. I came not to call the righteous but ſinners to repentance.</hi> Thoſe who are not ſenſible that they are ſinners, will treat every exhortation to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and every offer of mercy, with diſdain or defiance.</p>
            <p>BUT where can we have a more affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting view of the corruption of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, than in the wrath of man, when exerting itſelf in oppreſſion, cruelty, and blood. It muſt be owned, indeed, that this truth is abundantly manifeſt in times of the greateſt tranquillity. Others may, if they pleaſe, treat the corruption of our nature as a chimera; for my part, I ſee it every where, and I feel it every day. All the diſorders in human ſociety, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part even of the unhappineſs we are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to, ariſes from the envy, malice, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, and other luſts of man. If we
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:015224_0011_0F97835756259228"/>
and all about us were juſt what we ought to be in all reſpects, we ſhould not need to go any further for heaven, for it would be upon earth. But war and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence preſent a ſpectacle, ſtill more awful. How affecting is it to think, that the luſt of domination ſhould be ſo violent and univerſal? That men ſhould ſo rarely be ſatisfied with their own poſſeſſions and acquiſitions, or even with the benefit that would ariſe from mutual ſervice, but ſhould look upon the happineſs and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of others, as an obſtruction to their own. That, as if the great law of nature were not enough, <hi>Duſt thou art, and to duſt thou ſhalt return,</hi> they ſhould be ſo furiouſly ſet for the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of each other. It is ſhocking to think, ſince the firſt murder of Abel by his brother Cain, what havock has been made of man by man in every age. What is it that fills the pages of hiſtory, but the wars and contentions of princes and empires? What vaſt numbers has lawleſs ambition brought into the field, and delivered as a prey to the deſtructive ſword?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:015224_0012_0F9783581878B5A0"/>IF we dwell a little upon the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, they become deeply affecting. The mother bears a child with pain, rears him by the laborious attendance of many years; yet in the prime of life, in the vigour of health, and bloom of beauty, in a moment he is cut down by the dreadful inſtruments of death. <hi>Every battle of the warrior is with confuſed noiſe, and garments rolled in blood;</hi> but the horror of the ſcene is not confined to the field of ſlaughter. Few go there un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>related, or fall unlamented; in every hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile encounter, what muſt be the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon the relations of the deceaſed? The bodies of the dead can only be ſeen, or the cries of the dying heard for a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle day, but many days ſhall not put an end to the mourning of a parent for a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved ſon, the joy and ſupport of his age, or of the widow and helpleſs offspring for a father, taken away in the fullneſs of health and vigour.</p>
            <p>BUT if this may be juſtly ſaid of all wars between man and man, what ſhall we be able to ſay that is ſuitable to the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:015224_0013_0F978358D3E5E710"/>
abhorred ſcene of civil war between citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen and citizen? How deeply affecting is it, that thoſe who are the ſame in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, the ſame in blood, in language, and in religion, ſhould, notwithſtanding, butcher one another with unrelenting rage, and glory in the deed? That men ſhould lay waſte the fields of their fellow ſubjects, with whoſe proviſion they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves had been often fed, and conſume with devouring fire thoſe houſes, in which they had often found a hoſpitable ſhelter.</p>
            <p>THESE things are apt to overcome a weak mind with fear, or overwhelm it with ſorrow, and in the greateſt number are apt to excite the higheſt indignation, and kindle up a ſpirit of revenge. If this laſt has no other tendency than to direct and invigorate the meaſures of ſelf-defence, I do not take upon me to blame it, on the contrary, I call it neceſſary and laudable.</p>
            <p>BUT what I mean at this time to prove by the preceding reflections, and wiſh
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:015224_0014_0F978359907D5FE0"/>
to impreſs on your minds, is the depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of our nature. <hi>From whence come wars and fightings among you,</hi> ſays the apoſtle James *, <hi>come they not hence even from your luſts that war in your members.</hi> Men of lax and corrupt principles, take great delight in ſpeaking to the praiſe of human nature, and extolling its dignity, without diſtinguiſhing what it was, at its firſt creation, from what it is in its preſent fallen ſtate. Theſe fine ſpeculations are very grateful to a worldly mind. They are alſo much more pernicious to uncautious and unthinking youth, than even the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to a diſſolute and ſenſual life, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which they are fortified by the dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of natural conſcience, and a ſenſe of public ſhame. But I appeal from theſe viſionary reaſonings to the hiſtory of all ages, and the inflexible teſtimony of daily experience. Theſe will tell us what men have been in their practice, and from thence you may judge what they are by nature, while unrenewed. If I am not miſtaken, a cool and candid attention,

It ſhould at once lead us to acknowledge the juſt view given us in ſcripture, of our loſt ſtate; to deſire the happy influence of renewing grace each for ourſelves; and to long for the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of righteouſneſs and peace, when <hi>men ſhall beat their ſwords into plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhares, and their ſpears into pruning hooks; when nation ſhall not lift up ſword againſt nation, neither ſhall they learn war any more</hi>

                  <p>I cannot help embracing this opportunity of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a remark or two upon a virulent reflexion thrown out againſt this doctrine in a well known pamphlet, <hi>Common Senſe.</hi> The author of that work expreſſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf thus, <q>If the firſt king of any country was by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, that likewiſe eſtabliſhes a precedent for the next; for to ſay, that the right of all future genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions is taken away, by the act of the firſt electors, in their choice not only of a king, but of a family of kings for ever, hath no parallel in or out of ſcripture but the doctrine of original ſin, which ſuppoſes the free will of all men loſt in Adam; and from ſuch compariſon, and it will admit of no other, hereditary ſucceſſion can derive no glory. For as in Adam all ſinned, and as in the firſt electors all men obeyed; as in the one all mankind were ſubjected to Satan, and in the other to Sovereignty; as our innocence was loſt in the firſt, and our authority in the laſt; and as both diſable us from re-aſſuming ſome former ſtate and privilege, it unanſwerably follows that ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal ſin and hereditary ſucceſſion are parallels. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable rank! Inglorious connection! Yet the moſt ſubtle ſophiſt cannot produce a juſter ſimile <note place="bottom">Common senſe, page <hi>11.</hi> Bradford's Edition</note>.</q>
Without the ſhadow of reaſoning, he is pleaſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the doctrine of original ſin as an object of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt or abhorrence. I beg leave to demur a little to the <hi>candor,</hi> the <hi>prudence,</hi> and the <hi>juſtice</hi> of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Was it <hi>modeſt</hi> or <hi>candid</hi> for a perſon without name or character, to talk in this ſupercilious manner of a doctrine that has been eſpouſed and defended by many of the greateſt and beſt men that the world ever ſaw, and makes an eſſential part of the eſtabliſhed Creeds and Confeſſions of all the Proteſtant churches without exception? I thought the grand modern plea had been freedom of ſentiment, and charitable thoughts of one another. Are ſo many of us, then, beyond the reach of this gentleman's charity? I do aſſure him that ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption and ſelf-confidence are no recommendation to me either of his character or ſentiments.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Was it <hi>prudent,</hi> when he was pleading a public cauſe, to ſpeak in ſuch opprobrious terms of a doctrine, which he knew or ought to have known was believed and profeſſed by, I ſuppoſe, a great majority of very different denominations. Is this gentleman ignorant of human nature, as well as an enemy to the chriſtian faith? Are men ſo little tenacious of their religious ſentiments, whether true or falſe? The prophet thought otherwiſe, who ſaid, <hi>Hath a nation changed their gods which yet are no gods?</hi> Was it the way to obtain the favour of the public, to deſpiſe what they hold ſacred? Or ſhall we ſuppoſe this author ſo aſtoniſhingly ignorant, as to think that all men now, whoſe favour is worth aſking, have given up the doctrine of the New Teſtament. If he does, he is greatly miſtaken.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In fine, I aſk, where was the <hi>juſtice</hi> of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding? Is there ſo little to be ſaid for the doctrine of original ſin, that it is not to be refuted, but deſpiſed? Is the ſtate of the world ſuch, as to render this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine not only falſe, but incredible? Has the fruit been of ſuch a quality as to exclude all doubts of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the tree? On the contrary, I cannot help being of opinion, that ſuch has been the viſible ſtate of the world in every age, as cannot be accounted for on any other principles, than what we learn from the word of God, that <hi>the imagination of the heart of man is only evil from his youth, and that continually</hi>

for bringing ſinners to repentance, and for the correction and improvement of his own children. Whatever be the nature of the affliction with which he viſits ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſons, families, or nations; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be the diſpoſition or intention of thoſe whoſe malice he employs as a ſcourge, the deſign on his part is, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke men for iniquity, to bring them to repentance, and to promote their holineſs and peace. The ſalutary nature, and ſanctifying influence of affliction in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, is often taken notice of in ſcripture, both as making a part of the purpoſe of God, and the experience of his ſaints. <note n="‡" place="bottom">Heb. xii.11.</note>

This is plain from the nature of the thing, and from the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of experience. Public calamities, particularly the deſtroying ſword, is ſo awful that it cannot but have a powerful influence in leading men, to conſider the preſence and the power of God. It threatens them not only in themſelves, but touches them in all that is dear to them, whether relations or poſſeſſions. The prophet Iſaiah ſays, <note n="§" place="bottom">Iſaiah xxvi, 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 9.</note> 
               <hi>Yea in the way of thy judgments, O Lord, have we waited for thee,—for when thy judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn righteouſneſs.</hi> He conſiders
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:015224_0019_0F978362996845C0"/>
it as the moſt powerful mean of alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſecure, and ſubduing the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate. <note n="†" place="bottom">Iſaiah xxvi.11.</note> 
               <hi>Lord when thy hand is lifted up, they will not ſee, but they ſhall ſee and be aſhamed for their envy at the people, yea the fire of thine enemies ſhall devour them.</hi> It is alſo ſometimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented as a ſymptom of a hopeleſs and irrecoverable ſtate, when public judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have no effect. Thus ſays the prophet Jeremiah, <note n="*" place="bottom">Jeremiah v.3.</note> 
               <hi>O Lord are not thine eyes upon the truth? thou haſt ſtricken them, but they have not grieved; thou haſt conſumed them, but they have refuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to receive correction: They have made their faces harder than a rock, they have refuſed to return.</hi> We can eaſily ſee in the hiſtory of the children of Iſrael, how ſevere ſtrokes brought them to ſubmiſſion and penitence. <hi>When he ſlew them then they ſought him, and they returned and enquired early after God, and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer</hi> 
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Pſalm lxxviii.34, 35.</note>. Both na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in general, and private perſons are
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:015224_0020_0F978363588782B0"/>
apt to grow remiſs and lax in a time of proſperity and ſeeming ſecurity, but when their earthly comforts are endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered or withdrawn, it lays them under a kind of neceſſity to ſeek for ſomething better in their place. Men muſt have comfort from one quarter or another. When earthly things are in a pleaſing and promiſing condition, too many are apt to <hi>find their reſt,</hi> and be ſatisfied with them as their only portion. But when the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and paſſing nature of all created com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is diſcovered, they are compelled to look for ſomething more durable as well as valuable. What therefore can be more to the praiſe of God, than that when a whole people have forgotten their reſting place, when they have abuſed their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, and deſpiſed their mercies, they ſhould by diſtreſs and ſuffering be made to <hi>hearken to the rod,</hi> and return to their duty.</p>
            <p>THERE is an inexpreſſible depth and variety in the judgments of God, as in all his other works, but we may lay down this as a certain principle, that if there were no ſin, there could be no ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering. Therefore they are certainly for
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:015224_0021_0F9783641426A548"/>
the correction of ſin, or for the trial, il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtration, and perfecting of the grace and virtue of his own people. We are not to ſuppoſe, that thoſe who ſuffer moſt, or who ſuffer ſooneſt, are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more criminal than others. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour himſelf thought it neceſſary to give a caution againſt this raſh concluſion, as we are informed by the evangeliſt Luke, <hi>There were preſent at that ſeaſon ſome that told him of the Galileans, whoſe blood Pilate had mingled with their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices. And Jeſus anſwering ſaid unto them, Suppoſe ye that theſe Galileans were ſinners above all the Galileans, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſuffered ſuch things, I tell you nay, but except ye repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh.</hi> 
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Luke xiii.1.</note> I ſuppoſe we may ſay with ſufficient warrant, that it often happens, that thoſe for whom God hath deſigns of the greateſt mercy, are firſt brought to the trial, that they may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy in due time, the ſalutary effect of the unpalatable medicine.</p>
            <p>I MUST alſo take leave to obſerve, and I hope no pious humble ſufferer
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:015224_0022_0F978364D2F46AC0"/>
will be unwilling to make the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that there is often a diſcernible mixture of ſovereignty and righteouſneſs in providential diſpenſations. It is the prerogative of God to do what he will with his own, but he often diſplays his juſtice itſelf, by throwing into the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace thoſe, who, though they may not be viſibly worſe than, others, may yet have more to anſwer for, as having been favoured with more diſtinguiſhed privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, both civil and ſacred. It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for us to make a juſt and full compariſon of the character either of perſons or nations, and it would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely fooliſh for any to attempt it, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for increaſing their own ſecurity, or impeaching the juſtice of the Supreme Ruler. Let us therefore neither forget the truth, nor go beyond it. <hi>His mercy fills the earth.</hi> He is alſo <hi>known by the judgment which he executeth.</hi> The wrath of man in its moſt tempeſtuous rage, fulfills his will, and finally promotes the good of his choſen.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THE wrath of man praiſeth God, as he ſets bounds to it, or reſtrains it by his

providence, and ſometimes makes it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently a mean of promoting and illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating his glory.</p>
            <p>THERE is no part of divine providence in which a greater beauty and majeſty ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, than when the Almighty Ruler turns the councils of wicked men into confuſion, and makes them militate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt themſelves. If the pſalmiſt may be thought to have had a view in this text to the truths illuſtrated in the two former obſervations, there is no doubt at all that he had a particular view to this, as he ſays in the latter part of the verſe, <hi>the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of wrath ſhalt thou reſtrain.</hi> The ſcripture abounds with inſtances, in which the deſigns of oppreſſors were either wholly diſappointed, or in execution fell far ſhort of the malice of their intention, and in ſome they turned out to the honour and happineſs of the perſons or the people, whom they were intended to deſtroy. We have an inſtance of the firſt of theſe in the hiſtory to which my text relates <note n="*" place="bottom">The matter is fully ſtated and reaſoned upon by the prophet Iſaiah ch. x. from the 5th to the 19th verſe.</note>. We have alſo an inſtance
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:015224_0024_0F978366685A4E98"/>
in Eſther, in which the moſt miſchievous deſigns of Haman, the ſon of Hameda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha the Agagite againſt Mordecai the Jew, and the nation from which he ſprung, turned out at laſt to his own deſtruction, the honour of Mordecai, and the ſalvation and peace of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>FROM the New Teſtament I will make choice of that memorable event on which the ſalvation of believers in every age reſts as its foundation, the death and ſufferings of the Son of God. This the great adverſary and all his agents and inſtruments proſecuted with unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenting rage. When they had blackened him with ſlander, when they ſcourged him with ſhame, when they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned him in judgment, and nailed him to the croſs, how could they help eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeming their victory complete? But, oh the unſearcheable wiſdom of God! they were but perfecting the great deſign laid for the ſalvation of ſinners. Our bleſſed Redeemer by his death finiſhed his work, overcame principalities and powers, and made a ſhew of them openly, triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:015224_0025_0F978367121C5A40"/>
over them in his croſs. With how much juſtice do the apoſtles and their company offer this doxology to God, <hi>They lift up their voice with one accord. and ſaid, Lord thou art God which haſt made heaven and earth, and the ſea, and all that in them is: Who by the mouth of thy ſervant David haſt ſaid, Why did the Heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things. The kings of the earth ſtood up, and the rulers were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together againſt the Lord, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Chriſt. For of a truth, againſt thy holy Child Jeſus, whom thou haſt anointed both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el were gathered together, for to do whatſoever thy hand and thy counſel de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined before to be done</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Act. iv.24—28.</note>.</p>
            <p>IN all after ages in conformity to this, the deepeſt laid contrivances of the prince of darkneſs, have turned out to the confuſion of their author; and I know not, but conſidering his malice and pride, this perpetual diſappointment, and the ſuperiority of divine wiſdom, may be
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:015224_0026_0F978367D6EB7268"/>
one great ſource of his ſuffering and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The croſs hath ſtill been the ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of truth, under which it hath been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried through the world. Perſecution has been but as the furnace to the gold to purge it of its droſs, to manifeſt its puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and increaſe its luſtre. It was taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of very early, that the blood of the martyrs was the ſeed of chriſtianity; the more abundantly it was ſhed, the more plentifully did the harveſt grow.</p>
            <p>SO certain has this appeared, that the moſt violent infidels, both of early and later ages, have endeavoured to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for it, and have obſerved that there is a ſpirit of obſtinacy in man which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines him to reſiſt violence, and that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity doth but increaſe oppoſition, be the cauſe what it will. They ſuppoſe that perſecution is equally proper to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate truth and error. This tho' in part true will by no means generally hold. Such an apprehenſion however gave oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to a glorious triumph of divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of an oppoſite kind, which I muſt ſhortly relate to you. One of the Roman emperors, Julian, ſurnamed the
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:015224_0027_0F978368930994B8"/>
apoſtate, perceiving how impoſſible it was to ſuppreſs the goſpel by violence, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to extinguiſh it by neglect and ſcorn. He left the Chriſtians unmoleſted for ſometime, but gave all manner of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to thoſe of oppoſite princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and particularly to the Jews, out of hatred to the Chriſtians; and that he might bring public diſgrace upon the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lileans, as he affected to ſtile them, he encouraged the Jews to rebuild the temple 2of Jeruſalem, and viſibly refute the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of Chriſt, that it ſhould ly under perpetual deſolation. But this prophane attempt was ſo ſignally fruſtrated, that it ſerved as much as any one circumſtance to ſpread the glory of our redeemer, and eſtabliſh the faith of his ſaints. It is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by ſome ancient authors, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly by Ammianus Marcellinus a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then hiſtorian, that fire came out of the earth and conſumed the workmen when laying the foundation. But in whatever way it was prevented, it is beyond all controverſy, from the concurring teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Heathens and Chriſtians, that little or no progreſs was ever made in it, and that in a ſhort time, it was entirely defeated.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:015224_0028_0F97836952DFD150"/>IT is proper here to obſerve that at the time of the reformation, when religion began to revive, nothing contributed more to facilitate its reception, and increaſe its progreſs than the violence of its perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. Their cruelty and the patience of the ſufferers, naturally diſpoſed men to examine and weigh the cauſe to which they adhered with ſo much conſtancy and reſolution. At the ſame time alſo, when they were perſecuted in one city they fled to another, and carried the diſcoveries of Popiſh fraud to every part of the world. It was by ſome of thoſe who were perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted in Germany, that the light of the reformation was brought ſo early into Britain.</p>
            <p>THE power of divine providence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears with the moſt diſtinguiſhed luſtre, when ſmall and inconſiderable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and ſometimes, the weather and ſeaſons have defeated the moſt formidable armaments, and fruſtrated the beſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed expeditions. Near two hundred years ago, the monarchy of Spain was in the height of its power and glory, and determined to cruſh the intereſt of the
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:015224_0029_0F97836A678391F0"/>
reformation. They ſent out a powerful armament againſt Britain, giving it oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentatiouſly, and in my opinion profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the name of the Invincible Armada. But it pleaſed God ſo entirely to diſcomfit it by tempeſts, that a ſmall part of it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home, though no Britiſh force had been oppoſed to it at all.</p>
            <p>WE have a remarkable inſtance of the influence of ſmall circumſtances in provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the Engliſh hiſtory. The two moſt remarkable perſons in the civil wars, had earneſtly deſired to withdraw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the contentions of the times, Mr. Hampden and Oliver Cromwell. They had actually taken their paſſage in a ſhip for New-England, when by an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary order of council they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to remain at home. The conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this was, that one of them was the ſoul of the republican oppoſition to monarchical uſurpation during the civil wars, and the other in the courſe of that conteſt, was the great inſtrument in bringing the tyrant to the block.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:015224_0030_0F97836AD0BF3370"/>THE only other hiſtorical remark I am to make is, that the violent perſecution which many eminent Chriſtians met with in England from their brethren, who called themſelves Proteſtants, drove them in great numbers to a diſtant part of the world, where the light of the goſpel and true religion were unknown. Some of the American ſettlements, particularly thoſe in New-England, were chiefly made by them; and as they carried the knowledge of Chriſt to the dark places of the earth, ſo they continue themſelves in as great a degree of purity of faith, and ſtrictneſs of practice, or rather a greater than is to be found in any proteſtant church now in the world. Does not the wrath of man in this inſtance praiſe God?

            <p>IN the firſt place, I would take the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity on this occaſion and from this ſubject, to preſs every hearer to a ſincere concern for his own ſoul's ſalvation. There are times when the mind may be expected to be more awake to divine truth, and the conſcience more open to the arrows of conviction than at others. A ſeaſon of public judgment is of this kind, as appears from what has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſaid. That curioſity and attention at leaſt are raiſed in ſome degree is plain from the unuſual throng of this aſſembly. Can you have a clearer view of the ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your nature, than when the rod of the oppreſſor is lifted up, and when
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:015224_0032_0F97836FE9060F58"/>
you ſee men putting on the habit of the warrior, and collecting on every hand the weapons of hoſtility and inſtruments of death? I do not blame your ardour in preparing for the reſolute defence of your temporal rights. But conſider I beſeech you, the truly infinite importance of the ſalvation of your ſouls. Is it of much moment whether you and your children ſhall be rich or poor, at liberty or in bonds? Is it of much moment whether this beautiful country ſhall increaſe in fruitfulneſs from year to year being cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated by active induſtry, and poſſeſſed by independent freemen, or the ſcanty produce of the neglected fields ſhall be eaten up by hungry publicans, while the timid owner trembles at the tax gatherers approach? And is it of leſs moment my brethren, whether you ſhall be the heirs of glory, or the heirs of hell? Is your ſtate on earth for a few fleeting years of ſo much moment? And is it of leſs mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, what ſhall be your ſtate through endleſs ages? Have you aſſembled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther willingly to hear what ſhall be ſaid on public affairs, and to join in implor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:015224_0033_0F9783715E28DB10"/>
the bleſſing of God on the councils and arms of the united colonies, and can you be unconcerned, what ſhall become of you for ever, when all the monuments of human greatneſs ſhall be laid in aſhes, for <hi>the earth</hi> itſelf <hi>and all the works that are therein ſhall be burnt up.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHEREFORE my beloved hearers, as the miniſtry of reconciliation is committed to me, I beſeech you in the moſt earneſt manner, to attend to <hi>the things that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to your peace, before they are hid from your eyes.</hi> How ſoon and in what manner a ſeal ſhall be ſet upon the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and ſtate of every perſon here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, it is impoſſible to know, for he who only can know does not think proper to reveal it. But you may reſt aſſured that there is no time more ſuitable, and there is none ſo ſafe as that which is preſent, ſince it is wholly uncertain whether any other ſhall be yours. Thoſe who ſhall firſt fall in battle, have not many more warnings to receive. There are ſome few daring and hardened ſinners who deſpiſe eternity itſelf, and ſet their maker at defiance,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:015224_0034_0F978371918E08A8"/>
but the far greater number by ſtaving off their convictions to a more convenient ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, have been taken unprepared and thus eternally loſt. I would therefore ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly preſs the apoſtles exhortation, <hi>We then, as workers together with him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you alſo, that ye receive not the grace of God in vain: For he ſaith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of ſalvation have I ſuccoured thee: Behold, now is the accepted time; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, now is the day of ſalvation</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Cor. vi.1, 2.</note>.</p>
            <p>SUFFER me to beſeech you, or rather to give you warning not to reſt ſatisfied with a form of godlineſs, denying the power thereof. There can be no true religion, till there be a diſcovery of your loſt ſtate by nature and practice, and an unfeigned acceptance of Chriſt Jeſus, as he is offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the goſpel. Unhappy they who either deſpiſe his mercy, or are aſhamed of his croſs! Believe it, <hi>there is no ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in any other. There is no other name under heaven given amongſt men by which we muſt be ſaved.</hi> Unleſs you are united to him by a lively faith, not
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:015224_0035_0F97837256BCB1A8"/>
the reſentment of a haughty monarch, but the ſword of divine juſtice hangs over you, and the fulneſs of divine vengeance ſhall ſpeedily overtake you. I do not ſpeak this only to the heaven daring pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligate, or grovelling ſenſualiſt, but to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very inſenſible ſecure ſinner; to all thoſe however decent and orderly in their civil deportment, who live to themſelves and have their part and portion in this life; in fine to all who are yet in a ſtate of nature, for <hi>except a man be born again, he cannot ſee the kingdom of God.</hi> The fear of man may make you hide your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanity; prudence and experience may make you abhor intemperance and riot; as you advance in life, one vice may ſupplant another and hold its place; but nothing leſs than the ſovereign grace of God can produce a ſaving change of heart and temper, or fit you for his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate preſence.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From what has been ſaid upon this ſubject, you may ſee what ground there is to give praiſe to God for his favours al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready beſtowed on us, reſpecting the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:015224_0036_0F9783732210F280"/>
cauſe. It would be a criminal inatten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not to obſerve the ſingular interpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of providence hitherto, in behalf of the American colonies. It is however impoſſible for me in a ſingle diſcourſe, as well as improper at this time to go thro' every ſtep of our paſt tranſactions, I muſt therefore content myſelf with a few remarks. How many diſcoveries have been made of the deſigns of enemies in Britain and among ourſelves, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as unexpected to us as to them, and in ſuch ſeaſon as to prevent their effect? What ſurpriſing ſucceſs has attended our encounters in almoſt every inſtance? Has not the boaſted diſcipline of regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and veteran ſoldiers been turned into confuſion and diſmay before the new and maiden courage of freemen in defence of their property and right? In what great mercy has blood been ſpared on the ſide of this injured country? Some important victories in the ſouth have been gained with ſo little loſs, that enemies will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably think it has been diſſembled; as many, even of ourſelves thought, till time rendered it undeniable. But theſe
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:015224_0037_0F978373D52DEBB8"/>
were comparatively of ſmall moment. The ſignal advantage we have gained by the evacuation of Boſton, and the ſhameful flight of the army and navy of Britain, was brought about without the loſs of a man. To all this we may add, that the counſels of our enemies have been viſibly confounded, ſo that I believe I may ſay with truth, that there is hardly any ſtep which they have taken, but it has oper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated ſtrongly againſt themſelves, and been more in our favour than if they had followed a contrary courſe.</p>
            <p>WHILE we give praiſe to God the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme diſpoſer of all events, for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition in our behalf, let us guard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the dangerous error of truſting in, or boaſting of an <hi>arm of fleſh.</hi> I could earneſtly wiſh, that while our arms are crowned with ſucceſs, we might content ourſelves with a modeſt aſcription of it to the power of the higheſt. It has given me great uneaſineſs to read ſome oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, vaunting expreſſions in our news papers, though happily I think, much reſtrained of late. Let us not return to
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:015224_0038_0F9783748EDB3900"/>
them again. If I am not miſtaken, not only the holy ſcriptures in general, and the truths of the glorious goſpel in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, but the whole courſe of providence ſeems intended to abaſe the pride of man, and lay the vain-glorious in the duſt. How many inſtances does hiſtory furniſh us with of thoſe who after exulting over, and deſpiſing their enemies, were ſignal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſhamefully defeated. <note n="*" place="bottom">There is no ſtory better known in Britiſh hiſtory, than that the officers of the French army the night pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the battle of Agincourt, played at dice for Engliſh priſoners before they took them, and the next day were taken by them.</note> The truth is, I believe, the remark may be applied univerſally, and we may ſay, that thro' the whole frame of nature, and the whole ſyſtem of human life, that which promiſes moſt, performs the leaſt. The flowers of fineſt colour ſeldom have the ſweeteſt fragrance. The trees of quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt growth or faireſt form, are ſeldom of the greateſt value or duration. Deep wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters move with leaſt noiſe. Men who think moſt are ſeldom talkative. And I think it holds as much in war as in any thing, that every boaſter is a coward.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:015224_0039_0F978375515D5FA0"/>PARDON me my brethren for inſiſting ſo much upon this which may ſeem but an immaterial circumſtance. It is in my opinion of very great moment. I look upon oftentation and confidence to be a ſort of outrage upon providence, and when it becomes general, and infuſes it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the ſpirit of a people, it is a forerunner of deſtruction. How does Goliah the champion, armed in a moſt formidable manner expreſs his diſdain of David the ſtripling with his ſling and his ſtone. <hi>And when the Philiſtine looked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout and ſaw David, he diſdained him: for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair countenance. And the Philiſtine ſaid unto David, Am I a dog, that thou comeſt to me with ſlaves? And the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtine curſed David by his gods, and the Philiſtine ſaid to David come to me and I will give thy fleſh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beaſts of the field.</hi> But how juſt and modeſt the reply? <hi>Then ſaid David to the Philiſtine, thou comeſt to me with a ſword and with a ſpear, and with a ſhield, but I come unto thee in the name of the Lord of hoſts, the God of the armies of Iſrael, whom thou haſt defied</hi>

<pb n="38" facs="unknown:015224_0040_0F9783761A3F3148"/>
was well pleaſed with a remark of this kind thirty years ago in a pamphlet,<note n="†" place="bottom">Britains Remembrancer.</note> in which it was obſerved, that there was a great deal of prophane oſtentation in the names given to ſhips of war, as the Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, the Valiant, the Thunderer, the Dreadnought, the Terrible, the Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand, the Furnace, the Lightning, the Infernal, and many more of the ſame kind. This the author conſidered as a ſymptom of the national character and manners very unfavourable, and not likely to obtain the bleſſing of the God of Heaven <note n="*" place="bottom">I am ſenſible that one or two of theſe were ſhips taken from the French, which brought their names with them. But the greateſt number had their names impoſed in England, and I cannot help obſerving, that the Victory often celebrated as the fineſt ſhip ever built in Britain, was loſt in the night without a ſtorm, by ſome unknown accident, and about twelve hundred perſons, many of them of the firſt families in the nation were buried with it in the deep. I do not mean to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any thing from this, but, that we ought to live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the practical perſuaſion of what no man will doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally deny, that there is no warring with the elements, or him who directs their force, that he is able to write diſappointment on the wiſeſt human ſchemes, and by the word of his power to fruſtrate the efforts of the greateſt monarch upon earth.</note>.</p>

               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:015224_0041_0F978376D5779718"/>3. From what has been ſaid you may learn what encouragement you have to put your truſt in God, and hope for his aſſiſtance in the preſent important conflict. He is the Lord of hoſts, great in might, and ſtrong in battle. Whoever hath his countenance and approbation, ſhall have the beſt at laſt. I do not mean to ſpeak prophetically, but agreeably to the analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of faith, and the principles of God's moral government. Some have obſerved that true religion, and in her train do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, riches, literature, and arts, have taken their courſe in a ſlow and gradual manner, from eaſt to weſt ſince the earth was ſettled after the flood, and from thence forbode the future glory of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. I leave this as a matter rather of conjecture than certainty, but obſerve, that if your cauſe is juſt,—if your prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples are pure,—and if your conduct is prudent, you need not fear the multitude of oppoſing hoſts.</p>
            <p>IF your cauſe is juſt—you may look with confidence to the Lord and intreat him to plead it as his own. You are all my wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:015224_0042_0F978378A9EDDF18"/>
that this is the firſt time of my introducing any political ſubject into the pulpit. At this ſeaſon however, it is not only lawful but neceſſary, and I wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly embrace the opportunity of declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my opinion without any heſitation, that the cauſe in which America is now in arms, is the cauſe of juſtice, of liberty, and of human nature. So far as we have hitherto proceeded, I am ſatisfied that the confederacy of the colonies, has not been the effect of pride, reſentment, or ſedition, but of a deep and general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, that our civil and religious liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and conſequently in a great meaſure the temporal and eternal happineſs of us and our poſterity depended on the iſſue. The knowledge of God and his truths have from the beginning of the world been chiefly, if not entirely confined to theſe parts of the earth, where ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of liberty and political juſtice were to be ſeen, and great were the difficulties with which they had to ſtruggle from the imperfection of human ſociety, and the unjuſt deciſions of uſurped authority. There is not a ſingle inſtance in hiſtory
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:015224_0043_0F97837910B00C88"/>
in which civil liberty was loſt, and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious liberty preſerved entire. If therefore we yield up our temporal property, we at the ſame time deliver the conſcience into bondage.</p>
            <p>YOU ſhall not, my brethren, hear from me in the pulpit, what you have never heard from me in converſation, I mean railing at the king perſonally, or even his miniſters and the parliament, and people of Britain, as ſo many barbarous ſavages. Many of their actions have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably been worſe than their intentions. That they ſhould deſire unlimited domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion if they can obtain or preſerve it, is neither new nor wonderful. I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe ſubmiſſion to their unjuſt claims, becauſe they are corrupt or profligate, although probably many of them are ſo, but becauſe they are men, and therefore liable to all the ſelfiſh bias inſeparable from human nature. I call this claim unjuſt of making laws to bind us in all caſes whatſoever, becauſe they are ſepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated from us, independent of us, and have an intereſt in oppoſing us. Would
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:015224_0044_0F97837A9B3D6768"/>
any man who could prevent it, give up his eſtate, perſon, and family, to the diſpoſal of his neighbour, although he had liberty to chuſe the wiſeſt and the beſt maſter? Surely not. This is the true and proper hinge of the controverſy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Great-Britain and America. It is however to be added, that ſuch is their diſtance from us, that a wiſe and prudent adminiſtration of our affairs is as impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as the claim of authority is unjuſt. Such is and muſt be their ignorance of the ſtate of things here, ſo much time muſt elapſe before an error can be ſeen and remedied, and ſo much injuſtice and partiality muſt be expected from the arts and miſrepreſentation of intereſted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that for theſe colonies to depend wholly upon the legiſlature of Great-Britain, would be like many other oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive connexions, injury to the maſter, and ruin to the ſlave.</p>
            <p>THE management of the war itſelf on their part, would furniſh new proof of this, if any were needful. Is it not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt with what abſurdity and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:015224_0045_0F97837B4F56B260"/>
they have conducted their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns? We had nothing ſo much to fear as diſſenſion, and they have by wanton and unneceſſary cruelty forced us into u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. At the ſame time to let us ſee what we have to expect, and what would be the fatal conſequence of unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited ſubmiſſion, they have uniformly called thoſe acts <hi>Lenity,</hi> which filled this whole continent with reſentment and horror. The ineffable diſdain expreſſed by our fellow ſubject, in ſaying, "That he would not hearken to America, till ſhe was at his feet," has armed more men, and inſpired more deadly rage, than could have been done by laying waſte a whole province with fire and ſword. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, we wanted not numbers, but time, and they ſent over handful after handful, till we were ready to oppoſe a multitude greater than they have to ſend. In fine, if there was one place ſtronger than the reſt, and more able and willing to reſiſt, there they made the attack, and left the others till they were duly informed, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely incenſed, and fully furniſhed with every inſtrument of war.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="unknown:015224_0046_0F97837EF22065C0"/>I MENTION theſe things, my brethren, not only as grounds of confidence in God, who can eaſily overthrow the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the wiſe, but as deciſive proofs of the impoſſibility of theſe great and growing ſtates, being ſafe and happy when every part of their internal polity is dependent on Great-Britain. If, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their diſtance, and ignorance of our ſituation, they could not conduct their own quarrel with propriety for one year, how can they give direction and vigour to every department of our civil conſtitutions from age to age? There are fixed bounds to every human thing. When the branches of a tree grow very large and weighty they fall off from the trunk. The ſharpeſt ſword will not pierce when it cannot reach. And there is a certain diſtance from the ſeat of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, where an attempt to rule will either produce tyranny and helpleſs ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, or provoke reſiſtance and effect a ſeparation.</p>
            <p>I HAVE ſaid, if your principles are pure —The meaning of this is, if your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:015224_0047_0F97838001E5FE10"/>
oppoſition to the claims of the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh miniſtry does not ariſe from a ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and turbulent ſpirit, or a wanton contempt of legal authority; from a blind and factious attachment to particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons or parties; or from a ſelfiſh rapacious diſpoſition, and a deſire to turn public confuſion to private profit—but from a concern for the intereſt of your country, and the ſafety of yourſelves and your poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity. On this ſubject I cannot help ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, that though it would be a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle if there were not many ſelfiſh perſons among us, and diſcoveries now and then made of mean and intereſted tranſactions, yet they have been comparatively inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable both in number and effect. In general, there has been ſo great a degree of public ſpirit, that we have much more reaſon to be thankful for its vigour and prevalence, than to wonder at the few appearances of diſhoneſty or diſaffection. It would be very uncandid to aſcribe the univerſal ardour that has prevailed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all ranks of men, and the ſpirited exertions in the moſt diſtant colonies to any thing elſe than public ſpirit. Nor
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:015224_0048_0F978380909AE678"/>
was there ever perhaps in hiſtory ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral a commotion from which religious differences have heen ſo entirely excluded. Nothing of this kind has as yet been heard, except of late in the abſurd, but malicious and deteſtable attempts of our few remaining enemies to introduce them. At the ſame time I muſt alſo for the honour of this country obſerve, that though government in the ancient forms has been ſo long unhinged, and in ſome colonies not ſufficient care taken to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute another in its place; yet has there been, by common conſent, a much greater degree of order and public peace, than men of reflexion and experience foretold or expected. From all theſe circumſtances I conclude favourably of the principles of the friends of liberty, and do earneſtly exhort you to adopt and act upon thoſe which have been deſcribed, and reſiſt the influence of every other.</p>
            <p>ONCE more, if to the juſtice of your cauſe, and the purity of your principles you add prudence in your conduct, there will be the greateſt reaſon to hope, by
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:015224_0049_0F97838151348698"/>
the bleſſing of God, for proſperity and ſucceſs. By prudence in conducting this important ſtruggle, I have chiefly in view union, firmneſs, and patience. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very body muſt perceive the abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of union. It is indeed in every body's mouth, and therefore inſtead of attempting to convince you of its import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, I will only caution you againſt the uſual cauſes of diviſion. If perſons of every rank, inſtead of implicitly comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the orders of thoſe whom they themſelves have choſen to direct, will needs judge every meaſure over again, when it comes to be put in execution. If different claſſes of men intermix their lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle private views, or claſhing intereſt with public affairs, and marſhal into parties, the merchant againſt the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder, and the landholder againſt the merchant. If local provincial pride and jealouſy ariſe, and you allow yourſelves to ſpeak with contempt of the courage, character, manners, or even language of particular places, you are doing a greater injury to the common cauſe, than you are aware of. If ſuch practices are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:015224_0050_0F9783821B899750"/>
among us, I ſhall look upon it as one of the moſt dangerous ſymptoms, and if they become general, a preſage of approaching ruin.</p>
            <p>BY firmneſs and patience, I mean a reſolute adherence to your duty, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your account with many difficulties as well as occaſional diſappointments. In a former part of this diſcourſe, I have cautioned you againſt oftentation and vain glory. Be pleaſed further to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that extremes often beget one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, the ſame perſons who exult extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagantly on ſucceſs, are generally moſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to deſpondent timidity on every little inconſiderable defeat. Men of this cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter are the bane and corruption of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſociety or party to which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, but they are eſpecially the ruin of an army if ſuffered to continue in it. Remember the viciſſitude of human things, and the uſual courſe of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. How often has a juſt cauſe been reduced to the loweſt ebb, and yet when firmly adhered to, has become finally tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant. I ſpeak this now while the
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:015224_0051_0F978382D7F22C38"/>
affairs of the colonies are in ſo proſperous a ſtate, left this proſperity itſelf ſhould render you leſs able to bear unexpected misfortunes—The ſum of the whole is, that the bleſſing of God is only to be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for by thoſe who are not wanting in the diſcharge of their own duty. I would neither have you to truſt in an arm of fleſh, nor ſit with folded hands and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that miracles ſhould be wrought in your defence.—This is a ſin which is in ſcripture ſtiled <hi>tempting God.</hi> In oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to it, I would exhort you as Joab did the hoſt of Iſrael, who though he does not appear to have had a ſpotleſs character throughout, certainly in this inſtance ſpoke like a prudent general and a pious man. <hi>Be of good courage, and let us behave ourſelves valiantly for our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and for the cities of our God, and let the Lord do that which is good in his ſight</hi>

            <p>I SHALL now conclude this diſcourſe by ſome exhortations to duty founded upon the truths, which have been illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated above, and ſuited to the intereſting

ſtate of this country at the preſent time; and,</p>
            <p n="1">1. SUFFER me to recommend to you an attention to the public intereſt of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or in other words zeal for the glory of God and the good of others. I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready endeavoured to exhort ſinners to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, what I have here in view is to point out to you the concern which every good man ought to take in the national character and manners, and the means which he ought to uſe for promoting pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic virtue, and bearing down impiety and vice. This is a matter of the utmoſt moment, and which ought to be well underſtood, both in its nature and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. Nothing is more certain than that a general profligacy and corruption of manners makes a people ripe for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. A good form of government may hold the rotten materials together for ſome time, but beyond a certain pitch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the beſt conſtitution will be ineffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, and ſlavery muſt enſue. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand, when the manners of a nation are pure, when true religion and internal principles maintain their vigour, the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:015224_0053_0F97838456BC2CD8"/>
of the moſt powerful enemies to oppreſs them are commonly baffled and diſappointed. This will be found equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly certain, whether we conſider the great principles of God's moral government, or the operation and influence of natural cauſes.</p>
            <p>WHAT follows from this? That he is the beſt friend to American liberty, who is moſt ſincere and active in promoting true and undefiled religion, and who ſets himſelf with the greateſt firmneſs to bear down prophanity and immorality of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry kind. Whoever is an avowed enemy to God, I ſcruple not to call him an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to his country. Do not ſuppoſe, my brethren, that I mean to recommend a furious and angry zeal for the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantials of religion, or the contentions of one ſect with another about their peculiar diſtinctions. I do not wiſh you to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe any body's religion, but every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy's wickedneſs. Perhaps there are few ſurer marks of the reality of religion, than when a man feels himſelf more join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſpirit to a truly holy perſon of a different denomination, than to an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:015224_0054_0F9783855C23D3B0"/>
liver of his own. It is therefore your duty in this important and critical ſeaſon, to exert yourſelves every one in his proper ſphere to ſtem the tide of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing vice, to promote the knowledge of God, the reverence of his name and worſhip, and obedience to his laws.</p>
            <p>PERHAPS you will aſk, what it is that you are called to do for this purpoſe far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than your own perſonal duty? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer this itſelf when taken in its proper extent is not a little. The nature and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bligation of viſible religion is, I am af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, little underſtood and leſs attended to.</p>
            <p>MANY from a real or pretended fear of the imputation of hypocriſy, baniſh from their converſation and carriage every ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of reſpect and ſubmiſſion to the living God. What a weakneſs and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſpirit does it diſcover for a man to be aſhamed in the preſence of his fellow ſinners, to profeſs that reverence to almighty God which he inwardly feels? The truth is, he makes himſelf truly liable to the accuſation which he means to avoid. It is as genuine and
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:015224_0055_0F978385CFBA2750"/>
perhaps a more culpable hypocriſy to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to have leſs religion than you really have, than to appear to have more. This falſe ſhame is a more extenſive evil than is commonly apprehended. We contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute conſtantly, though inſenſibly, to form each others character and manners; and therefore, the uſefulneſs of a ſtrictly holy and conſcientious deportment is not confined to the poſſeſſor, but ſpreads its happy influence to all that are within its reach. I need ſcarcely add, that in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as men are diſtinguiſhed by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, literature, age, rank, office, wealth, or any other circumſtance, their example will be uſeful on the one hand, or pernicious on the other.</p>
            <p>BUT I cannot content myſelf with barely recommending a ſilent example. There is a dignity in virtue which is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to authority, and ought to claim it. In many caſes it is the duty of a good man, by open reproof and oppoſition, to wage war with prophaneneſs. There is a ſcripture precept delivered in very ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar terms, to which I beg your attention; <hi>Thou ſhalt not hate thy brother in thy
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:015224_0056_0F9783895BEB04B8"/>
heart, but ſhalt in any wiſe rebuke him, and not ſuffer ſin upon him.</hi> How prone are many to repreſent reproof as flowing from ill nature and ſurlineſs of temper? The Spirit of God, on the contrary, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders it as the effect of inward hatred, or want of genuine love, to forbear reproof when it is neceſſary or may be uſeful. I am ſenſible there may in ſome caſes be a reſtraint from prudence, agreeably to that caution of Solomon, <hi>Caſt not your pearls before ſwine, leſt they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rent you.</hi> Of this every man muſt judge as well as he can for himſelf; but certainly, either by open reproof, or expreſſive ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, or ſpeedy departure from ſuch ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, we ought to guard againſt being <hi>partakers of other mens ſins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>TO this let me add, that if all men are bound in ſome degree, certain claſſes of men are under peculiar obligations to the diſcharge of this duty. Magiſtrates, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, parents, heads of families, and thoſe whom age has rendered venerable, are called to uſe their authority and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for the glory of God and the good
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:015224_0057_0F97838AECD036B8"/>
of others. Bad men themſelves diſcover an inward conviction of this, for they are often liberal in their reproaches of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of grave characters or religious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, if they bear with patience the prophanity of others. Inſtead of enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the duty of men in authority in general, I muſt particularly recommend this matter to thoſe who have the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of ſoldiers inliſted for the defence of their country. The cauſe is ſacred, and the champions for it ought to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Nothing is more grieving to the heart of a good man, than to hear from thoſe who are going to the field, the horrid ſound of curſing and blaſphemy; it cools the ardor of his prayers, as well as abates his confidence and hope in God. Many more circumſtances affect me in ſuch a caſe, than I can enlarge upon, or indeed eaſily enumerate at preſent; the glory of God, the intereſt of the deluded ſinner, going like a devoted victim and imprecating vengeance on his own head, as well as the cauſe itſelf com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his care. We have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times taken the liberty to forebode the
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:015224_0058_0F978B4A1A3AD030"/>
downfall of the Britiſh empire, from the corruption and degeneracy of the people. Unhappily the Britiſh ſoldiers have been diſtinguiſhed among all the nations in Europe, for the moſt ſhocking profanity. Shall we then pretend to emulate them in this infernal diſtinction, or rob them of the horrid privilege? God forbid. Let the officers of the army in every degree re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that as military ſubjection, while it laſts, is the moſt compleat of any, it is in their power greatly to reſtrain, if not wholly to baniſh, this flagrant enormity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I EXHORT all who are not called to go into the field to apply themſelves with the utmoſt diligence to works of induſtry. It is in your power by this means not only to ſupply the neceſſities, but to add to the ſtrength of your country. Habits of induſtry prevailing in a ſociety not only increaſe its wealth, as their immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate effect, but they prevent the introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of many vices, and are intimately connected with ſobriety and good morals. Idleneſs is ths mother or nurſe of almoſt every vice, and want, which is its inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable companion, urges men on to the
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:015224_0059_0F978B4B5FC19BB0"/>
moſt abandoned and deſtructive courſes. Induſtry, therefore, is a moral duty of the greateſt moment, abſolutely neceſſary to national proſperity, and the ſure way of obtaining the bleſſing of God. I would alſo obſerve, that in this, as in every other part of God's government, obedience to his will is as much a natural mean, as a meritorious cauſe of the advantage we wiſh to reap from it. Induſtry brings up a firm and hardy race. He who is inured to the labour of the field, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the fatigues of a campaign. The active farmer who riſes with the dawn and follows his team or plow, muſt in the end be an overmatch for thoſe effeminate and delicate ſoldiers, who are nurſed in the lap of ſelf-indulgence, and whoſe greateſt exertion is in the important pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for, and tedious attendance on, a maſquerade, or midnight ball.</p>
            <p n="3">3. IN the laſt place, ſuffer me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend to you frugality in your fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and every other article of expence. This the ſtate of things among us renders abſolutely neceſſary, and it ſtands in the moſt immediate connection both with vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:015224_0060_0F978B4B90C97470"/>
induſtry, and active public ſpirit. Temperance in meals, moderation and decency in dreſs, furniture and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page, have, I think, generally been characteriſtics of a diſtinguiſhed patriot. And when the ſame ſpirit pervades a people in general, they are fit for every duty, and able to encounter the moſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable enemy. The general ſubject of the preceding diſcourſe has been the wrath of man praiſing God. If the unjuſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of your enemies, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds from you many of the uſual articles of luxury and magnificence, ſhall contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to make you clothe yourſelves and your children with the works of your own hands, and cover your tables with the ſalutary productions of your own ſoil, it will be a new illuſtration of the ſame truth, and a real happineſs to yourſelves and your country.</p>
            <p>I COULD wiſh to have every good thing done from the pureſt principles and the nobleſt views. Conſider, therefore, that the Chriſtian character, particularly the ſelf-denial of the goſpel, ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to your whole deportment. In the
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:015224_0061_0F978B4C60AA5DA0"/>
early times of Chriſtianity, when adult converts were admitted to baptiſm, they were aſked among other queſtions, Do you renounce the world, its ſhews, its pomp, and its vanities? I do. The form of this is ſtill preſerved in the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of baptiſm, where we renounce the devil, the world, and the fleſh. This certainly implies not only abſtaining from acts of groſs intemperance and exceſs, but a humility of carriage, a reſtraint and moderation in all your deſires. The ſame thing, as it is ſuitable to your Chriſtian profeſſion, is alſo neceſſary to make you truly independant in yourſelves, and to feed the ſource of liberality and charity to others, or to the public. The riotous and waſteful liver, whoſe craving appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites make him conſtantly needy, is and muſt be ſubject to many maſters, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſaying of Solomon, <hi>The bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower is ſervant to the lender.</hi> But the frugal and moderate perſon, who guides his affairs with diſcretion, is able to aſſiſt in public counſels by a free and unbiaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed judgment, to ſupply the wants of his poor brethren, and ſometimes, by his
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:015224_0062_0F978B4D0FC16E98"/>
eſtate and ſubſtance, to give important aid to a ſinking country.</p>
            <p>UPON the whole, I beſeech you to make a wiſe improvement of the preſent threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning aſpect of public affairs, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that your duty to God, to your country, to your families, and to your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, is the ſame. True religion is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but an inward temper and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward conduct ſuited to your ſtate and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances in providence at any time. And as peace with God and conformity to him, adds to the ſweetneſs of created comforts while we poſſeſs them, ſo in times of difficulty and trial, it is in the man of piety and inward principle that we may expect to find the uncorrupted patriot, the uſeful citizen, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible ſoldier.—God grant that in America true religion and civil liberty may be inſeparable, and that the unjuſt attempts to deſtroy the one, may in the iſſue tend to the ſupport and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of both.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>AS ſoon as I had conſented to the publication of the foregoing ſermon, I felt an irreſiſtible deſire to accompany it with a few words addreſſed to you in particular. I am certain I feel the attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of country as far as it is a virtuous or laudable principle, perhaps it would be nearer the truth to ſay, as far as it is a natural and pardonable preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice. He who is ſo pleaſed may attribute it to this laſt when I ſay, that I have never ſeen cauſe to be aſhamed of the place of my birth; that ſince the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of letters in Europe in the cloſe of the fourteenth and beginning of the fifteenth century, the natives of Scotland have not been inferior to thoſe of any other country, for genius, erudition, military proweſs, or any of thoſe accompliſhments which improve or embelliſh human nature. When to this it is added, that ſince my coming to Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica at an advanced period of life, the friendſhip of my countrymen has been as much above my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation as deſert, I hope every reader will conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what is now to be offered as the effect not only of unfeigned good will, but of the moſt ardent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
            <p>It has given me no little uneaſineſs to hear the word <hi>Scotch</hi> uſed as a term of reproach in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican controverſy, which could only be upon the ſuppoſition that ſtrangers of that country are more
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:015224_0064_0F978B50AD3B77C0"/>
univerſally oppoſed to the liberties of America than thoſe who were born in South-Britain, or in Ireland. I am ſenſible that this has been done in ſome news<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>papers and contemptible anonymous publications, in a manner that was neither warranted by truth, nor dictated by prudence. There are many natives of Scotland in this country, whoſe oppoſition to the unjuſt claims of Great-Britain has been as early and uniform, founded upon as rational and liberal prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and therefore likely to be as laſting, as that of any ſet of men whatever. As to Great Britain itſelf, time has now fully diſcovered that the real friends of America in any part of that kingdom were very few, and thoſe whoſe friendſhip was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſted, and in no degree owing to their own political factions, ſtill fewer. The wiſe and valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able part of the nation were, and as yet are, in a great meaſure ignorant of the ſtate of things in this country; neither is it eaſy for the bulk of a people to ſhake off their prejudices, and open their eyes upon the great principles of univerſal liberty. It is therefore at leaſt very diſputable, whether there is any juſt ground for the diſtinction between Scots and Engliſh on this ſubject at all.</p>
            <p>This diſpute, however, I do not mean to enter upon, becauſe it is of too little moment to find a place here, but ſuppoſing that, in ſome provinces eſpecially, the natives of Scotland have been too much inlined to ſupport the uſurpations of the parent ſtate, I will firſt endeavour to account for it, by aſſigning ſome of its probable cauſes; and then offer a few conſiderations which ſhould induce them to wipe off the aſperſion entirely, by a contrary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="unknown:015224_0065_0F978B51B0D85D30"/>As to the firſt of theſe, I will mention what I ſuppoſe to have been the firſt and radical cauſe, and which gave birth to every other, of the diſaffection of ſome of the natives of Scotland to the juſt privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of America. What I have in view was the friends of liberty in many places of America, taking the part of, and ſeeming to conſider themſelves as in a great meaſure engaged in the ſame cauſe with, that very diſtinguiſhed perſon, John Wilkes, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> of London, This was done not only in many writings and news-paper diſſertations, but one or two colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, in ſome of their moſt reſpectable meetings, manifeſted their attachment to him, and ſeemed to conſider him as their patron and friend. No. 45, which was the moſt offenſive number of a worthleſs paper, was repeated and echoed, by the moſt ſilly and ridiculous alluſions to it, through every part of the country, and by many who could not tell what was ſignified by the term.</p>
            <p>It will not be neceſſary to ſay much on the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of ſuch conduct, becauſe I ſuppoſe thoſe who expected Wilkes's mob would pull down the parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament- houſe, or that there would be inſurrections all over the kingdom in behalf of America, are by this time fully ſatisfied of their miſtake. It appears now in the cleareſt manner, that, till very lately, thoſe who ſeemed to take the part of America in the Britiſh parliament, never did it on American principles. They either did not underſtand, or were not willing to admit, the extent of our claim. Even the great Lord Chatham's bill for reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on would not have been accepted here, and did not materially differ from what the miniſtry would have conſented to. The truth is, the far greateſt part
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:015224_0066_0F978B5259997F50"/>
of the countenance given in Britain to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of this country, was by thoſe who had no other intention in it than to uſe them as an engine of oppoſition to the miniſtry for the time being. It is true, ſome of them have now learned to reaſon very juſtly, and upon the moſt liberal principles; but their number is not great, and it was not the caſe with any one ſpeaker or writer, whoſe works I have had the opportunity of peruſing, till the very laſt ſtage of the quarrel.</p>
            <p>What effect this Wilkiſm (if I may ſpeak ſo) of many Americans may be ſuppoſed to have had upon the minds of gentlemen from Scotland, it is not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to explain. That gentleman and his aſſociates thought proper to found the whole of their oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the then miniſtry, upon a contempt and hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the Scots nation; and by the moſt illiberal methods, and the moſt ſcandalous falſehoods, to ſtir up a national jealouſy between the northern and ſouthern parts of the iſland. There was not a vile term or hateful idea, which ancient vulgar animoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had ever uſed, though long union had made them ſcarcely intelligible, which he did not rake up and attempt to bring into credit, by writing and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. The conſequence of this is well known. Wilkes and ſome others were burnt in effigy in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and it produced ſo general an attachment to the king and miniſtry, as has not yet ſpent its force. In theſe circumſtances is it to be wondered at that many who left Scotland within the laſt fifteen years, when they heard Wilkes and thoſe who adhered to him extolled and celebrated by the ſons of liberty, ſhould be apt to conſider it as an evidence of the ſame ſpirit, and that they were engaged in ſupport of the
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:015224_0067_0F978B531B316D00"/>
ſame cauſe. Perhaps we may go a little higher with this remark, in tracing political appearances to their ſource. It is generally ſaid that the King himſelf has diſcovered a violent rancorous perſonal hatred againſt the Americans. If this be true, and I know nothing to the contrary, it may be eaſily accounted for upon the very ſame principles.</p>
            <p>I am far from ſuppoſing that this was a good reaſon for any man's being cool to the American cauſe, which was as different from that of Wilkes, as light is from darkneſs. It was indeed doing great diſhonour to the noble ſtruggle, to ſuppoſe it to have any connection with who ſhould be in or out of court-favour at London; and therefore it was always my opinion, that thoſe who railed againſt the King and miniſtry only, did not carry the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment home, nor fully underſtand the nature of their own plea. In order to juſtify the American oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, it is not neceſſary to ſhew that the perſons in power have invaded liberty in Britain; it is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to ſay that they, with the concurrence of the whole nation, have refuſed to ſuffer it to continue in the colonies.—This leads me to the ſecond part of my deſign, which was to lay before you the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which, I think, ſhould induce every lover of juſtice and of mankind, not only to be a well-wiſher, but a firm and ſtedfaſt friend to America, in this important conteſt.</p>
            <p>It has been often ſaid, that the preſent is likely to be an important aera to America. I think we may ſay much more; it is likely to be an important aera in the hiſtory of mankind. In the ancient migrations, a new country was generally ſettled by a ſmall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connected, and often an ignorant band. The people
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:015224_0068_0F978B53D096E708"/>
and the ſoil were alike uncultivated, and therefore they proceeded to improvement by very ſlow de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; nay, many of them fell back and degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated into a ſtate vaſtly more ſavage than the people from whence they came. In America we ſee a rich and valuable ſoil and an extenſive country, taken poſſeſſion of by the power, the learning, and the wealth of Europe. For this reaſon it is now exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting to the world a ſcene which was never ſeen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. It has had a progreſs in improvement and population ſo rapid as no political calculators have been able to aſcertain. I look upon every thing that has been ſaid upon this ſubject to be mere conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, except in ſuch places as there has been an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual numeration. When men ſay that America doubles its number in fifteen, twenty, or twenty-five years, they ſpeak by gueſs, and they ſay nothing. In ſome places that may be under or over the truth; but there are vaſt tracts of land that fill every year with inhabitants, and yet the old ſettled places ſtill continue to increaſe.</p>
            <p>It is proper to obſerve that the Britiſh ſettlements have been improved in a proportion far beyond the ſettlements of other European nations. To what can this be aſcribed? Not to the climate; for they are of all climates: Not to the people; for they are a mixture of all nations. It muſt therefore be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved ſingly into the degree of Britiſh liberty which they brought from home, and which pervaded more or leſs their ſeveral conſtitutions. It has been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated to us, I know not how often, by the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary ſhort-ſighted writers in favour of ſubmiſſion to, or re-union with, Great Britain, that we have thriven very much in paſt times by our dependance
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:015224_0069_0F978B5563961F68"/>
on the mother-country, and therefore we ſhould be loth to part. Theſe writers forget that the very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint is, that ſhe will not ſuffer us to enjoy our ancient rights. Can any paſt experience ſhew that we ſhall thrive under new impoſitions? I ſhould be glad any ſuch reaſoners would attempt to prove that we have thriven by our dependence, and not by the degree of independence which we have hitherto en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed. If we have thriven by our dependance, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it is a neceſſary conſequence that thoſe provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces muſt have thriven moſt which have been moſt dependent. But the contrary is ſelf-evident. Thoſe which have hitherto enjoyed the freeſt form of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, though greatly inferior in ſoil and climate, have yet outſtripped the others in number of people and value of land, merely becauſe the laſt were more under the influence of appointments and authority from home.</p>
            <p>When this is the undeniable ſtate of things, can any perſon of a liberal mind wiſh that theſe great and growing countries ſhould be brought back to a ſtate of ſubjection to a diſtant power? And can any man deny, that if they had yielded to the claims of the Britiſh parliament, they would have been no better than a parcel of tributary ſtates, ruled by lordly tyrants, and exhauſted by unfeeling penſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, under the commiſſion of one too diſtant to hear the cry of oppreſſion, and ſurrounded by thoſe who had an intereſt in deceiving him. It ought, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in my opinion, to meet with the cordial appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of every impartial perſon, as I am confident it will of poſterity, that they have united for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon defence, and reſolved that they will be both free and independent, becauſe they cannot be the one without the other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="unknown:015224_0070_0F978B564AC2A768"/>As this meaſure, long foreſeen, has now taken place, I ſhall beg leave to ſay a few things upon it; in which I mean to ſhow, 1. That it was neceſſary. 2. That it will be honourable and profitable. And, 3. That, in all probability, it will be no injury, but a real advantage, to the iſland of Great Britain.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It had become abſolutely neceſſary. All reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, but upon the footing of abſolute unconditional ſubmiſſion, had been poſitively refuſed by Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; unleſs, therefore, the colonies had reſolved to continue in a looſe and broken ſtate, with the name of a government which they had taken arms to oppoſe, the ſtep which they have now taken could not have been avoided. Beſides, things had proceeded ſo far, and ſuch meaſures had been taken on both ſides, that it had become impoſſible to lay down a ſcheme by which <hi>they</hi> ſhould be ſure of our dependance, and <hi>we,</hi> at the ſame time, ſecured in our liberties. While things continued in their ancient ſtate, there was perhaps a power on the part of each, of which they were hardly conſcious, or were afraid and unwilling to exert. But after the encroachments had been made and reſiſted, to expect any thing elſe than a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual attempt to extend authority on the one hand, and to guard againſt it on the other, is to diſcover very little knowledge of human nature. In ſuch a ſituation, though every claim of America ſhould be yielded, ſhe would ſoon be either in a ſtate of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual confuſion, or abſolute ſubmiſſion. The king of England, living in his Engliſh dominions, would not, and indeed durſt not, aſſent to any act of an American legiſlature, that was, or was ſuppoſed to be hurtful to his Engliſh ſubjects. This is not found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on conjecture, but experience. There is not (at
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:015224_0071_0F978B56CB50ED48"/>
leaſt Dean Swift affirms it) any dependence of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land upon England, except an act of the Iriſh par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, that the king of England ſhall be king of Ireland. This laſt has a ſeparate independent legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature, and in every thing elſe but the above circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſeems to be perfectly free; yet if any man ſhould aſſert, that the one kingdom is not truly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the other, he would in my opinion know very little of the ſtate and hiſtory of either.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A ſtate of independency will be both honourable and profitable to this country. I paſs over many advantages in the way of commerce, as well as in other reſpects, that muſt neceſſarily accrue from it, that I may dwell a little on the great and leading be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, which is the foundation of all the reſt. We ſhall have the opportunity of forming plans of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the moſt rational, juſt, and equal prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. I confeſs I have always looked upon this with a kind of enthuſiaſtic ſatisfaction. The caſe never happened before ſince the world began. All the governments we have read of in former ages were ſettled by caprice or accident, by the influence of prevailing parties or particular perſons, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by a conqueror. Important improvements in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed have been forced upon ſome conſtitutions by the ſpirit of daring men, ſupported by ſucceſsful inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections. But to ſee government in large and popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous countries ſettled from its foundation, by deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate counſel, and directed immediately to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic good of the preſent and future generations, while the people are waiting for the deciſion with full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the wiſdom and impartiality of thoſe to whom they have committed the important truſt, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly altogether new<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We learn indeed from hiſtory,
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:015224_0072_0F978B59DB03EC90"/>
that ſmall tribes and feeble new ſettlements, did ſometimes employ one man of eminent wiſdom, to prepare a ſyſtem of laws for them. Even this was a wiſe meaſure, and attended with happy ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. But how vaſt the difference, when we have the experience of all paſt ages, the hiſtory of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſociety, and the well known cauſes of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity and miſery in other governments, to aſſiſt us in the choice.</p>
            <p>The proſpect of this happy circumſtance, and the poſſibility of loſing it, and ſuffering the ſeaſon to paſs over, has filled me with anxiety for ſome time. So far as we have hitherto proceeded, there has been great unanimity and public ſpirit. The inhabitants of every province, and perſons of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations, have vyed with each other in zeal for the common intereſt. But was it not to be feared that ſome men would acquire over-bearing influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? that human weakneſs and human paſſions would diſcover themſelves, and prevent the finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of what had been ſo happily begun. In the time of the civil wars in England, had they ſettled a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular form of government aſſoon as the parliament had obtained an evident ſuperiority, their liberties would never have been ſhaken, and the revolution would have been unneceſſary. But by delaying the thing too long, they were broken into parties and bewildered in their views, and at laſt tamely ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted without reſiſtance to that very tyranny againſt which they had fought with ſo much glory and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. For this reaſon I think that every candid and liberal mind ought to rejoice in the meaſures lately taken through the States of America, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the late Declaration of Independance, as it will
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:015224_0073_0F978B5ADF407148"/>
not only give union and force to the meaſures of defence while they are neceſſary, but lay a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the birth of millions, and the future im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of a great part of the globe.</p>
            <p>I have only further to obſerve, 3. That I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent the Independence of America will, in the end, be to the real advantage of the iſland of Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. Were this even otherwiſe, it would be a weak argument againſt the claim of juſtice. Why ſhould the ſecurity or proſperity of this vaſt country be ſacrificed to the ſuppoſed intereſt of an inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable ſpot? But I cannot believe that the miſery and ſubjection of any country on earth, is neceſſary to the happineſs of another. Blind partiality and ſelf intereſt may repreſent it in this light; but the opinion is deluſive, the ſuppoſition is falſe. The ſucceſs and increaſe of one nation is, or may be, a benefit to every other. It is ſeldom, indeed, that a people in general can receive and adopt theſe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſentiments, they are nevertheleſs perfectly juſt. It is induſtry only, and not poſſeſſions, that makes the ſtrength and wealth of a nation; and this is not hindered but encouraged, provoked, and rewarded by the induſtry of others <note n="*" place="bottom">See David Hume's Eſſay on the jealouſy of trade.</note>.</p>
            <p>But to leave the general principle, or rather to apply it to the caſe of Great Britain and America: What profit has the former hitherto received from the latter? and what can it reaſonably expect for the future? Only its trade, and ſuch part of that trade as tends to encourage the induſtry and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the number of the inhabitants of that iſland. It will be ſaid, they intend to raiſe a large, clear, net revenue upon us, by taxation. It has been ſhewn
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:015224_0074_0F978B5B566CEFB0"/>
by many, that all the taxes which they could raiſe would only ſerve to feed the inſatiable deſire of wealth in placemen and penſioners, to increaſe the influence of the crown, and the corruption of the people. It was by the acquiſition of numerous provinces that Rome haſtened to its ruin. But even ſuppoſing it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and that without any bad conſequence among themſelves, they were to acquire a great addition to their yearly revenue, for every ſhilling they gained by taxes, they would loſe ten in the way of trade. For a trifling addition to the ſums of public money to be applied or waſted by miniſters of ſtate, they would loſe ten times the quantity diſtributed among uſeful manufacturers, the ſtrength and glory of a ſtate. I think this has been ſometimes compared to the difference between draughts of ſpirituous liquors to intoxicate the head or weaken the ſtomach, and cool refreſhing food to give ſoundneſs, health, and vigour to every member of the body.</p>
            <p>The trade, then, of America, as ſoon as peace is ſettled, will be as open to them as ever. But it will be ſaid, they have now an excluſive trade, they will then but ſhare it with other nations. I anſwer, an excluſive trade is not eaſily preſerved, and when it is preſerved, the reſtriction is commonly more hurtful than uſeful. Trade is of a nice and delicate nature; it is founded upon intereſt. It will force its way wherever intereſt leads, and can hardly by any art be made to go in another direction. The Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards have an excluſive trade, as far as they pleaſe to confine it, to their own plantations. Do they reap much benefit from it? I believe not. Has it made their own people more induſtrious at home? Juſt the contrary. Does it, in the natural courſe
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:015224_0075_0F978B5C158AA600"/>
of things, make a people leſs careful to work as well and as cheap as others, to procure voluntary purchaſers, when they know they can ſend their goods to thoſe who are obliged to take them? Does it not both tempt and enable great merchants in the capital, to import from other nations what they can export to ſuch a forced market, to advantage? By this means a conſiderable profit may come into the coffers of a few particulars, while no eſſential ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is done to the people, and the ultimate profit is carried to that country where the goods are produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or fabricated. It has been repeatedly ſaid by political writers in England, that the balance of trade is againſt that country to every nation, excepting Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal and their own plantations. I will not anſwer for the truth or univerſality of this aſſertion, but if it is true in any meaſure, I will venture to affirm, upon the principles of general reaſon, that the cauſe which produces it is no other than the excluſive trade they have hitherto enjoyed to the American ſettlements.</p>
            <p>But the circumſtance which I apprehend will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute moſt to the intereſt of Great Britain in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican Independence is, its influence in peopling and enriching this great continent. It will certainly tend to make the American States numerous, powerful, and opulent, to a degree not eaſily conceived. The great and penetrating Monteſquieu, in his Spirit of Laws, has ſhewn in the cleareſt manner, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing contributes ſo much to the proſperity of a people, as the ſtate of ſociety among them, and the form of their government. A free government overcomes every obſtacle, makes a deſart a fruitful field, and fills a bleak and barren country with all
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:015224_0076_0F978B5CE2BF5AF0"/>
the conveniences of life. If ſo, what muſt be the operation of this powerful cauſe upon countries en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying in the higheſt degree every advantage that can be derived from ſituation, climate, and ſoil? If the trade of America has hitherto been of ſo great benefit to England, how much more valuable may it be when theſe countries ſhall be ſtill more highly improved, if ſhe ſhall continue to enjoy it? This argument is liable to no objection but what may ariſe from the loſs of an excluſive trade, which I have already conſidered. It may be added, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that there is not now, nor ever has been, any averſion in the Americans to the people of Great-Britain, ſo that they may be ſure of our trade if they treat us as well as others, and if otherwiſe, they do not deſerve it.</p>
            <p>I might illuſtrate the argument by ſtating the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable conſequences of a contrary ſuppoſition. If Great Britain ſhould prevail, or overcome the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican States, and eſtabliſh viceroys with abſolute authority in every province, all men of ſpirit and lovers of freedom would certainly withdraw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to a corner, if ſuch could be found, out of the reach of tyranny and oppreſſion. The numbers of the people at any rate would ſenſibly decreaſe, their wealth would be ſpeedily exhauſted, and there would remain only a nominal authority over a deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late country, in return for a vaſt expence laid out in the conqueſt, and in place of a great and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table trade, by which both nations were made hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. One of the arguments, if they may be called ſo, made uſe of againſt this country, and on which an obligation to obedience has been founded, is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the expence they have been at in blood
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:015224_0077_0F978B5D8B5A8268"/>
and treaſure for our protection in former wars. This argument has been often anſwered in the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt manner, but if they ſhall continue to urge it, how fearful to think of the obligations we ſhall be under, after this war is finiſhed? Then ſhall we owe them all the ſums which they ſhall have laid out in ſubduing us, and all that we have ſpent in attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to prevent it; all the blood which they ſhall have ſhed in attacking us, and all that we ſhall have ſpilt in our own defence. There is unqueſtionably a loſs to Great Britain by the one ſide of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count as well as the other; and it tends to ſhow, in the cleareſt manner, the unſpeakable folly as well as great injuſtice of the promoters of this war.</p>
            <p>Thus I have ſtated to you, though very briefly, the principles on which I think the American cauſe ought to be pleaded, and on which it ought to be eſpouſed and ſupported, by every lover of juſtice and of mankind. But though the general plea in juſtice were leſs clear than it is, there is a light in which the conduct of the oppoſers of it has always appeared to me unreaſonable and ungene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to the higheſt degree. That reſiſtance to Great Britain has been determined on, in the moſt reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute manner, through all the colonies, by a vaſt majority, is not only certain but undeniable. In the beginning of the controverſy, ſome writers, with an impudence hardly to be paralelled, called the fact in queſtion, attempted to deceive the people in this country, and effectually deceived the people of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, by making them believe that it was only a few factious and violent men that had engaged in the conteſt. It is not very long ſince a writer had the courage to aſſert, that "nine tenths of the people
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:015224_0078_0F978B60A06A2050"/>
of Pennſylvania were againſt independence." The falſhood of ſuch miſrepreſentations is now manifeſt, and indeed was probably known from the beginning by thoſe who deſired to have them believed. Tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this for granted, then, for an inconſiderable minority, whether natives or ſtrangers, to ſet themſelves in oppoſition to the public councils, is contrary to reaſon and juſtice, and even to the very firſt principles of the ſocial life.</p>
            <p>If there is any principle that was never contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted upon the ſocial union, it is, that as a body every ſociety muſt be determined by the plurality. There was a time when it was not only juſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent but neceſſary, that every one ſhould ſpeak his mind freely and fully of the neceſſity or expediency of reſiſting the authority of Great Britain. But that time is over long ago. The meaſures being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved upon, and the conflict begun, one who is bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neuter can ſcarce be forgiven, a ſecret plodding enemy muſt be conſidered as a traitor. Every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who continued among us after the deciſive reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions formed by all the colonies, ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as pledging his faith and honour to aſſiſt in the common cauſe. Let me try to illuſtrate it by a ſimilar caſe. Suppoſe that a ſhip at ſea ſprings a leak, which expoſes the whole company to the moſt imminent danger of periſhing. Suppoſe a counſel is called of all the perſons on board to determine what port they ſhall endeavour to gain. Then it is not only the right but the duty of every one to ſpeak his own judgment, and to preſs it upon others by every argument in his power. Suppoſe a great majority determines to puſh for a certain place, and to go to the pump by turns every quarter of an hour; but
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:015224_0079_0F978B622CE5CA28"/>
that two or three or one, if you pleaſe, is of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that they ſhould have gone another courſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the wind, current, or any other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and that it would be beſt to change hands at the pump only every half hour. All this is well. But if after the determination this ſame gentleman, becauſe his advice was not followed, ſhould refuſe to pump at all, ſhould ſlily alter the ſhip's courſe, or deaden her way by every means in his power, or even ſhould only by continual complaints and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondent fears diſcourage others on whoſe activity the common ſafety depended, I deſire to know what treatment he would receive or deſerve? With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt he would be thrown over board in leſs time than I have taken to ſtate the caſe. I am not able to perceive the leaſt difference between this ſuppoſition and what takes place in America at the preſent time.</p>
            <p>If this argument is juſt with reſpect to every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant of the country, it ought to have ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional weight with thoſe who are not natives, and whoſe reſidence is not certain or has not been long. There is a great degree of indecency in ſuch taking any part againſt what the majority of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants think to be their intereſt and that of their country. Were they even wrong, their miſtake ſhould be lamented, not reſiſted; on the contrary, it would be the part both of generoſity and juſtice to ſupport them effectually in a conteſt which wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom would have declined. We ſee indeed every day melancholy inſtances of a baſe and ſelfiſh temper o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perating different ways. Many when they do not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that rank and honour which their pride and partiality think their due, or if their advice is not
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:015224_0080_0F978B6394A1B148"/>
followed, immediately renounce the ſervice of their country, and it may go to deſtruction for them. In oppoſition to this, let me recommend the example of the illuſtrious Fabius of Rome. He had given ſtrict orders to all his officers not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the enemy, but to keep at a diſtance. Unluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily his lieutenant-general, by his own raſhneſs, got entangled with a part of the army under his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and was engaged. Fabius, preferring his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try's good to fame, rivalſhip, and ſafety, came im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to his ſupport with all expedition, and thereby gained a glorious and complete victory.</p>
            <p>I hope you will take in good part the above re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, which I think contain nothing that is vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulent or indecent againſt any man or body of men. They are the effects of judgment and conviction. The author, as is probably known to many of you, has been perſonally abuſed in news-papers at home for the part he was ſuppoſed to have taken in the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican cauſe, which was in ſome degree indeed the motive to this addreſs. He hopes that an honeſt and faithful ſupport of liberty and equal govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this part of the world, will be no juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to his character, either as a ſcholar, a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, or a Chriſtian, and that it is perfectly conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with an undiminiſhed regard for the country which gave him birth.</p>
