            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>A PREFACE is, in common, like the Bill of Fare to an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment; where the reader ſees what he has to ſet down to. But the author of the <hi>Pill for Porcupine</hi> treats his cuſtomers a little in the Iriſh ſtyle, and introduces his eſſay with ſomething which he might, with more juſtice, have called a poſtcript.
<q>
                  <l>So Paddy's reaſon never fails</l>
                  <l>To geer draft horſes by their tails.</l>
               </q>
However, he calls it a Preface, and as ſuch we will conſider it.— The principal intention of this ſaid preface is to give us a taſte of the author's wit againſt the <hi>ſtory-tellers and pumpkin-vines of Connecticut and Maſſachuſetts;</hi> and to drag Mr. CAREY limp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in, by the head and ſhoulders, in order to tell the reader that Porcupine had dubbed him a man of honor, that he was a good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocrat, and had riſen from care to contentment, without being elated by his proſperity.</p>
            <p>With theſe compliments to Mr. CAREY I perfectly acquieſce, for as Porcupine has not been very liberal in conferring praiſe, there is the more reaſon to ſuppoſe it merited in the preſent inſtance; and he is quite as welcome to a place of honor among the democrats, for as theſe gentry are not remarkable for their attachment to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution and government of the United States, God forbid I ſhould ever envy him his fame. If there is any credit to be gained by oppoſing the government and its chief magiſtrate, under which many a citizen, beſides Mr. CAREY, has riſen from <hi>care</hi> to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment,</hi> from the ſtate of a needy adventurer to that of indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and eaſe, he is welcome to it all.</p>
            <p>But I plainly ſee that no order of ſociety, no change of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:030314_0003_0FE74F0012261E40"/>
will deſtroy inveterate habits and the prejudices of education, if engrafted on a natural ſtock. Some men, we know, are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed through their lives by a love of peace, order, and ſtability; others again are ever reſtleſs, turbulent and vindictive, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they go, they both carry their diſtinctive habits along with them.</p>
            <q>"Coelum non animum mutant, qui trans mare currunt."</q>
            <p>He has now a chance, therefore, of partaking of that "eſteem" and of "thoſe careſſes" of the world, ſo pleaſing to the ingenuous mind, and of becoming, as well as Mr. YOUNG, "one of your fine modern gentlemen of yeſterday." But it is not only here; in all the civilized countries of the world <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> riches give conſideration to their poſſeſſors: it is ſo in Scotland as well as Ireland; it is ſo even in France, that ill-fated country of ſans-culottiſm: riches have made many a man taken notice of there, and marked his head for the guillotine; if the owner even was innocent, his wealth was a liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticide.</p>
            <p>Having now ſaid all that I intended of the Preface, I will make a few remarks on the manner in which the piece was introduced to the public. There was as much myſtery uſed in bringing it to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket as if the author thought the ware was contraband, and his life was in danger; but ſurely ſo much caution was not neceſſary in Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, one of the freeſt places in the world for ſcandal; where men deal without fear or reſtraint in all that is abuſive and ſcurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and where neither wiſdom nor virtue give protection to their owners.—On its firſt appearance the ſale was confined to the publiſhers, and to the ware-houſes of Meſſrs. CAREY, RICE, and CAMP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BELL, as if it had been a company adventure, and they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, contrary to the common uſage, to engroſs it all to themſelves; as they did for ſome time, though they afterwards permitted others to partake with them, finding it neceſſary, I ſuppoſe, in order to diſpoſe of their ware.</p>
            <p>But no part of this myſterious buſineſs deſerves more notice than the choice that was made of a publiſher. It looked as if the author intended to give the whole an air of burleſque, by chooſing out of all the printers and book-ſellers in the city, a ſober old gentleman, with the phiz of a covenanting elder, to midwife his ſcurrility. This was a grave preface indeed to a dirty ſubject; but though a little ſingular, was not altogether without example. It is likely he took
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:030314_0004_0FE74F0A22BAC710"/>
the hint from Dr. SWIFT's Tale of a Tub. The Dean tells us in his hiſtory of the three brothers, that when Jack had an itch for throwing dirt, he always began the work with a down-looking, pſalm-ſinging face, in order to draw the people about him, and then pelted away manfully. Our author, I ſuppoſe, thought the trick a good one, and reſolved to try it in vending his pamphlet; with this difference only, that the one diſtributed his filth in the ſtreets, and the other was to do it from behind his counter.</p>
            <p>As it would be tireſome to myſelf, as well as diſguſting to the reader, to follow this writer through the whole of his miſrepreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, ſcurrility and nonſenſe, in the following anſwer I ſhall only ſelect ſome particular parts of the performance, and offer a few obſervations on them; which I will do with as much connection and order as the ſubject will admit, or is poſſible in purſuing a Jack o' Lanthorn, who dances from place to place, without any other appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent plan than to ſcatter abuſe as he goes.</p>

            <head>TIT FOR TAT, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>"WHAT a cabal was raiſed" ſays this writer in the firſt page of his pamphlet, "againſt citizen GE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NET, becauſe a certain party had aſſerted, that he interfered in the internal government of our country: was he more culpable than the other (the Britiſh agent) who does it by means of a hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling?" as if there was any analogy between the conduct of GE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NET and that of <hi>Peter Porcupine,</hi> who is the hireling alluded to. In one caſe, a foreign miniſter queſtioned the authority of the Executive of the United States; threatened to appeal from it to the people at large, and really did ſo; caballed with turbulent and ambitious men; ſet on foot popular clubs to embarraſs the government; and in ſhort carried his inſolence and intrigues to ſuch an alarming height, as to oblige the Preſident to inſiſt on his recall: in the other, it is in defence of this government, againſt the emiſſaries that GENET left behind, and his ſucceſſors have ſince raiſed up, that moſt, if not all the eſſays under the ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Porcupine have been levelled. So that if the Britiſh miniſter or agent had any concern in ſetting him to work, which ſincerely I do not believe, he certainly acted a friendly part by by our government: but as there is not the leaſt evidence of ſuch a connection, it would be unjuſt to deprive Peter of any part of the credit he has gained by a ſpontaneous act.</p>
            <p>As far as I am able to judge of his motives from his writings, he has been provoked to take up the pen by the ſcurrilous abuſe that has been wantonly heaped on his native country; and to defend the government of this againſt its worſt enemies, the creatures of France, who have endeavored to reduce
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:030314_0006_0FE5B95040026548"/>
America to the ſame ſubjection to her ambitious polititics as every other nation that has been curſed with her alliance. This ſprightly and ingenious writer expects no other reward nor patronage than ſuch as he has received already, from a liberal and enlightened public: his enemies therefore may be aſſured that he neither feels "a contrition" for what he has publiſhed, nor "has the fountain nearly ran dry." Long may he continue the champion of order and the federal government, as well as a ſcourge to all its ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, whether of American, Engliſh, French or Iriſh growth! The peaceable and good citizens of the United States, from whatever nation derived, he never deſigned to offend, and he is happy in being aſſured that few of them are his real enemies, whatever the cut-throats of France or the thieves of Ireland may be. The baſe attempt, therefore, of this pamphleteer, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to accuſe him of vilifying the very reſpectable citizens of Philadelphia, as a "mob or banditti," is of a piece with other democratic tricks, and is doubtleſs intended to collect a mob, in order to anſwer his wit and arguments by the rhetoric of ſtones and brick-bats.</p>
            <p>As we proceed in the examination of this pamphlet, we ſhall find the writer is as much an enemy of human nature, and of all its amiable feelings, as he is of candor and truth. In page 10, "With regard" ſays he "to the murders and outrages com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the French nation, there are none will believe a ſingle fact ſtated by Porcupine, except <hi>credulous children</hi> or prejudiced <hi>old women,</hi> ſinking into their dotage." Why he excepts children and old women I cannot gueſs: it would have been nearer the mark had he ſaid <hi>they only</hi> diſbelieve, for few others are ſo igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of what has paſſed on the ſanguinary theatre of France, as to doubt what Porcupine has narrated in his <hi>"Bloody Buoy."</hi> The murders at Paris on the 2d and 3d of September; the maſſacres at Avignon and Verſailles; the ſhootings and drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings at Lyons and Nantes; and all the other horrid ſcenes in the various departments, which fix an indelible ſtain on the name of liberty, have all been confirmed by ſuch a cloud of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, that none but thoſe who are determined to ſhut out conviction, can entertain a doubt. Their own public papers, to go no further, contain undeniable proofs of the ferocious cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:030314_0007_0FE5B9526FC7E348"/>
of this people, from the firſt year of the revolution to this day—from JOURDAN, the cut-throat of Avignon, to BUONA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PARTE, the modern Attila, and ſcourge of Italy; and the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories of all their former civil wars are ſtamped with the ſame character, although none of them equalled the preſent in bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſcenes. Formerly they had ſome ſenſe of Religion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain them, but now the Stygian philoſophy of their <hi>Diderots,</hi> their <hi>Ceruttis</hi> and their <hi>Condorcets</hi> has not only ſoured the ſmall mixture of humanity they had in their natures, but removed all fear of God and love of man from their hearts. In aid of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ferocity, they now poſſeſs the <hi>ſang froid</hi> of daemons.</p>
            <p>The hecatombs of innocent women and children, ſacrificed on the altar of their Moloch, the Goddeſs of Liberty, are "no evidence" ſays this pamphleteer, none at all "of the cruelty and injuſtice of the nation, but are the fulleſt proofs of their lenity and forbearance." What think you, Reader, of a monſter who would venture to contaminate an American preſs with ſuch ſentiments? Beware of ſuch men, for he that would advocate ſuch cruelties, would imitate them, if he dared. He is worſe, indeed, than the very inſtruments who committed them, for he cannot plead the ſame excuſe of example, of fear or revenge: he ſits down, coolly, at his deſk, three thouſand miles remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the terrible ſcene, and enjoys, with the complacency of a daemon, the ſacrifice of thouſands of victims, whoſe cruel fate would make an American ſavage ſhudder with horror. With him it is all "lenity and forbearance, ſhort-lived preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, or the reſult of irreſiſtible neceſſity": and ſo ſaid <hi>Robeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pierre</hi> and his ſatellites, when engaged in their murdering work: their cant phraſe for murder was <hi>travailler à la Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> One of theſe monſters, writing of the Royaliſts in la Vendée, very coolly remarked, that if the remaining popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did not exceed thirty or forty thouſand ſouls,—"certainly the quickeſt way to finiſh the war, is to cut all their throats"<note n="*" place="bottom">

reader, was one of your modern philoſophers! the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of a treatiſe entitled <hi>Prejudices Deſtroyed!</hi> and theſe mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are ſtill held up by their American admirers as worthy of imitation.</p>
            <p>But to repeat proofs of the unparalleled atrocities committed in France, would be painful to the humane reader, and to thoſe of the ſame temper as this writer it would be labour loſt; they would not "believe a ſingle fact" becauſe recorded in the <hi>Bloody Buoy.</hi> To ſuch I recommend the peruſal of Miſs HELEN WIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIAMS'S laſt letters from Paris. She is a republican, as well as a great admirer of the French nation: her ſiſter is married to one of the Revolutioniſts. "When the future hiſtorian," ſays this elegant writer, "whoſe faithful pen muſt trace the hideous features of the Vendéan war, in all their deformity, ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe ſcenes which I dare not name, let no one, becauſe he may conſider ſuch crimes as ſcarcely within the verge of human poſſibility, doubt that they have been committed."</p>
            <p>But, according to this writer, Porcupine is not alone "in his abuſe of the French nation; Mr. HAMILTON has trodden the ſame path before him. The latter in his writings has endeavor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to prove that it was not from diſintereſted motives that France took an active part in the American Revolution, but to pull down the enormous and overbearing pride of England"— and is there a ſingle Democrat weak enough to think otherwiſe? "But" adds he, <q>admitting this was the motive, <hi>they</hi> certainly loved us more than Great Britain did; and if they loved us more, ought not our gratitude to be in proportion to that love, in preference to Britain, as theirs was in preference to us.</q> There is ſomething very much like nonſenſe both in meaning and conſtruction of this whining ſentence about love, but as I am not fond of quarrelling with men for the blunders of mere ignorance, I will endeavor to gueſs at his meaning. It is then, if I underſtand him, that, although France entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the American war from mere hatred and jealouſy of Great-Britain, ſhe thereby evinced her ſuperior affection for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of theſe States, and has, in conſequence, a juſt claim to a preference when her intereſt and that of her rival are brought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:030314_0009_0FE5B9595580A380"/>But if we admit the premiſes, the concluſion by no means follows. The Britiſh colonies in America were planted, che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed and protected by the parent ſtate at a great expenſe; ſhe thought ſhe had a legitimate authority over them, and when they revolted, ſhe conſidered them as rebellious children, whom ſhe had a right to reduce to obedience and ſubmiſſion: had Ireland or any part of the iſland of Great-Britain revolted, ſhe would have acted in the ſame manner: but it does not follow, becauſe ſhe carried her parental claims too far, that ſhe had leſs friendſhip for her children than a foreign nation had, whoſe government was an abſolute deſpotiſm, whoſe religion and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners were diametrically oppoſite—a nation which had been the inveterate enemy of the name of an Engliſhman for ages, and which, not twenty years before, had invaded this country with fleets and armies, with an intention to ſubjugate or expel the inhabitants. For a bigotted tyrant to be converted into a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron of civil and religious liberty, an avowed enemy into a real friend, without any apparent cauſe, is too great a miracle to meet with belief now a days. If a man does me a good office to ſerve himſelf or to injure a third perſon who is his enemy, or for both reaſons combined, there is no merit whatever in the act. The caſe between this country and France was exactly parallel. She conſidered the Britiſh colonies as part of the national ſtrength, as a limb of the body politic, and if ſhe could but cut it off, ſhe would not care if it rotted immediately afterwards, unleſs ſhe expected to derive ſome future benefit from it.</p>
            <p>Her motives to aſſiſt America were juſt the ſame as induced her to aid the Pretender and the rebels of Scotland in 1715 and 1745; to excite the <hi>patriots</hi> in Holland, who, by the bye, were all <hi>ariſtocrats,</hi> againſt the Stadtholder; to ſupport the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Sweden called the <hi>Hats</hi> againſt another called the <hi>Night-Caps,</hi> to the great detriment of the nation; and to aſſiſt the Genoeſe in ſubjugating the brave inhabitants of Corſica. All theſe acts originated in the ſame baſe and cowardly policy, that ever governed the cabinet of Verſailles, and that ſtill predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates in the ſecret councils of the nation, as we have wofully
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:030314_0010_0FE5B95A83A9CA38"/>
experienced. A tenth part of the money they have ſpent, and a twentieth part of the pains they have taken, to diſturb and injure their neighbors, wiſely beſtowed on their own people and government, would long ago have placed them with real digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at the head of the nations, the great object of their ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; whereas by their moſt ſplendid ſucceſſes hitherto they have never riſen to eminence but with the curſes of all good men on their heads. This, ſo far as relates to the ancient gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, has the conſent of the republicans themſelves, and how applicable it is to the preſent rulers, poſterity will decide.</p>
            <p>But if we leave motive out of the queſtion, and admit that "one good turn deſerves another", and that it does, has grown into a maxim, it was certainly due to the party who did the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; to the royal family and nobles of France; to men who have been murdered, or have fled from the daggers of the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſins, and whoſe memories the democrats of this country, the vile ingrates, as well as the Jacobins of France, purſue with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſant yells of defamation. Their enemies in France would not allow them to breathe the vital air, and thoſe of America will not admit that they poſſeſs a ſingle virtue. The merit of all their actions in promoting the independence of America, by ſome kind of hocus pocus, is inſtantly transferred to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicans, who had no more voice in the buſineſs than the ſlaves of Algiers. All the benefits we received from Louis XVI. are carried to the credit of the republic, and all the evils we ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under Louis XV. are charged to the deſpotiſm of the king. This is the way theſe democrats keep their accounts: God preſerve my affairs from ſuch raſcally book-keepers!</p>
            <p>"National pride, ambition, folly and intereſt," this ſcribbler aſſerts, "are the governing and only motives, which actuate kings towards each other," and yet <q>France, [mark the man's inconſiſtency, France, under an abſolute monarch] more <hi>enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened</hi> and <hi>magnanimous</hi> than all the reſt, gave America early proofs of her friendſhip, by entering into a treaty of alliance with her.</q> Enlightened and magnanimous! Ah! poor Louis, he would have been leſs magnanimous, indeed I think he would, had he been more enlightened! Little did he imagine, when he ſent his <hi>La Fayettes,</hi> his <hi>D'Eſtaings, De Graſſes,</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chambeaus,</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:030314_0011_0FE5B95C1D24B950"/>
to fight our battles, that they would bring back with them a tyger from the woods of America, that in the courſe of twelve years would deſtroy him and all his family!—and that after he was dead the people of America would curſe his memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry! No, no, magnanimity was as far from the heart of this unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate king as foreſight was from his head. He intended to dig a pit for his neighbor, and fell into it himſelf. It is a leſſon of importance to kings; and no country was ſo ſit to teach the leſſon as France, whoſe kings, for more than three centuries before, had been conſtantly employed in embroiling the affairs of their neighbors.</p>
            <p>But we will leave theſe monarchs to their own deſigns: I grant that, in general, they are ambitious and intereſted enough, and I am afraid the motives of the ill-fated Louis were not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than thoſe of kings in common—if they were, I am ſure we have been vaſtly ungrateful—and we will now turn to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection between republics. Here, if we believe this writer, and all of the ſame ſtamp, the ſcene brightens: it is on the repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican floor we are told to look for "univerſal benevolence", "diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſted friendſhip", and "cordial attachment"—a mere Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenium!</p>
            <p>I do not know from what ſources this writer has derived his hiſtorical knowledge; to judge from what he aſſerts, one would imagine that he had ſtudied the Hiſtory of Utopia, the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic of Plato, the Social Contract of Rouſſeau, and other politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal reveries: I never read them but as ingenious romances: my information concerning men in civil ſociety, is drawn from the annals of governments not quite ſo viſionary. I have looked into the hiſtory of Switzerland, cantoned into a number of pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty republics; ſurrounded and interſected by almoſt impaſſable mountains; poor, frugal, and in a good degree virtuous: yet the daemon of diſcord found his way among them, and often impelled one diminutive commonwealth to draw the ſword a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt another. Venice and Genoa, two commercial republics, have engaged in long and frequent wars, to extend their trade or enlarge their power. Every ſchool-boy knows that Rome and Carthage, two of the moſt eminent republics of antiquity, were the ſlaves of avarice and ambition, and contended for empire
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:030314_0012_0FE5B96336C4BC98"/>
with unrelenting animoſity, until one of them was wholly ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Carthage had her Hamilcars and her Hannibals, and Rome had her Catos, the patriots of thoſe days, who were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly impelling ther fellow-citizens to deſtroy fleets, burn towns, and cut the throats of the inhabitants, or to drag them into captivity. The Republics of Lacedaemon, Athens and Thebes were always at daggers drawn. The States of Greece were never at peace among themſelves, except when the ſwords of the Perſians were at their doors: and their common danger was not ſufficient to unite them perfectly, until they were bound together by the authority of one head, a Philip or an Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Had it not been for ſome ſuch power, to ſilence their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magogues, patriots ſuch as we are curſed with, nothing is more likely than that they would have yielded at laſt to the arms or the gold of the great king; who, when he could not conquer, knew, as well as any French miniſter, that "Patriots have their price."</p>
            <p>What ſhall we think then of this ſilly writer, when he talks of the intereſt, ambition and pride of kings, and of the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and friendſhip of Republics? ſhall we not ſay that he talks like one that dreams? But theſe quacks have a plaiſter for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſore. They will tell you, that the ancients were ignorant beings, unacquainted with the principles of government, with the due arrangement of power, the checks and balances diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by modern politicians. This is not ſo clear as ſome may imagine; but be it as it may, it is certain that they poſſeſſed quite as much public virtue, and as much love of country, the grand cement of ſociety, as we do; and were quite as free from the ſelfiſh paſſions, the bane of public and private happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as we are, after ſo many centuries of improvement. It is virtue that gives ſtability to empire, it is righteouſneſs that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alteth a nation, more than any choſen form of government whatever.</p>
            <p>We have already had a ſcantling, in our own infant country, the beſt conſtructed republic that ever exiſted, of the propenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of theſe ſame fellows, called patriots: we have ſeen how they would manage our affairs if God in his wrath ſhould put them into their hands: have we not experienced, in a time of
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:030314_0013_0FE5B96471F29B18"/>
univerſal peace, and a ſtate of unexampled proſperity, that there are men among us <hi>proud, ambitious, diſcontented</hi> and <hi>ſtupid enough</hi> to attempt to ſubvert this goodly ſtructure, to proſtrate its honor in duſt, and to ruſh madly into a war, without cauſe, or means, or end?</p>
            <p>Theſe men ſhould either ceaſe clamouring againſt the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their own country, and vomiting their gall againſt its beſt citizens, or ſay no more in praiſe of republican virtue and happineſs. Let us firſt ſhew an example of the love of peace, without which no country can proſper, of harmony, of mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and wiſdom, that the world may ſee what good the ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem is really capable of producing; as we are the only republic now exiſting, except a few inſignificant communities neſtled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the rocks of Italy: and if, after the experience of one hundred years, which is a ſhort age for an empire, we have proved the excellence of the form and materials, we may exult. Until then, every wiſe man will be modeſt, and forbear joining in cry with thoſe yelping curs who are ever diſturbing the world with their noiſe.</p>
            <p>But let us follow this writer; <q>to convince America and the world more fully" ſays he, "that her former ſervices were not the effect of a temporary, ſordid, ſelfiſh intereſt, ſhe (France) has ſince made overtures for entering into a treaty anew; on principles the moſt <hi>honourable</hi> and <hi>flattering</hi> to the national dignity of America, and <hi>advantageous</hi> to her inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts. But Mr. HAMILTON, <hi>ſtiff in opinion and always in the wrong,</hi>
               </q> not content with queſtioning the purity of Louis's mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives in the former treaty, "by his influence in the cabinet council of America, defeated her friendly deſigns, and render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all her (generous) overtures (for another) abortive." Sad fellow! But as it is not juſt to condemn him, before we exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine theſe overtures, nor to take things on the word of this writer, we will recur to Citizen GENET'S account of the affair: he was better acquainted with the buſineſs than any other perſon on this ſide the Atlantic, being the agent employed to bring it forward. In his <hi>Inſtructions,</hi> which he afterwards pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in his own defence, we were informed that the United States were invited to the honor of making "a common cauſe"
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:030314_0014_0FE5B96541CF2E38"/>
with the French, in their war with all the world; of "guaran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeing their Weſt-India iſlands"; of "receiving commiſſions", as generals, colonels, captains, &amp;c. in and under the authority of the Republic; "of ſuſpending all our other commercial pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits; and" of refuſing admiſſion into our ports to all nations with whom they were or might be at war; in order—for what, think you—"<hi>to befriend the Empire of Liberty!!</hi>—and on condition of our compliance with theſe very <hi>honorable</hi> and <hi>flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering</hi> terms, and on this condition alone; we are promiſed "a free commerce with the French Weſt-Indies"; where, by the bye, the whites, blacks and yellows were too buſy in burning towns and plantations, and in cutting of throats, in a little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute they had of their own, about <hi>the empire of liberty,</hi> to attend much to commerce. If the Britiſh had not landed, and ſnat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched part of the country from deſtruction, I believe they would by this time have had no commerce at all.</p>
            <p>This is the treaty the French citizen had to propoſe, and which the Preſident and his council thought proper to reject. Indeed what plea could they offer to the world, or to their own conſciences; what temptation had they for contracting any kind of treaty with a band of daring uſurpers, whoſe hands were ſtill reeking with the blood of their own king, our benefactor, whom they had murdered in violation of the moſt ſolemn con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract. The alliance might have been uſeful and glorious to them, but to us it would have been diſgraceful and ruinous. What think you, my fellow-citizens, of a foreigner, who at this time of day undertakes to advocate ſuch inſidious and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical overtures? is there any degree of contempt and deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion adequate to ſuch inſolence? A man muſt either be a fool himſelf, or have a very mean opinion of the underſtanding of his readers, before he would venture to pollute paper with ſo daring an inſult.</p>
            <p>Were it not for the great pains that have been taken and ſtill are taking to miſlead the public mind, it would be unneceſſary to take any notice at this time, of a ſubject that has been ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and ſo fully handled before; but before I quit it, I will make one more remark, and it will come in more à propos in this place than in any other. Whatever advantages the United
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:030314_0015_0FE5B9675660CA50"/>
States derived from their treaties with France, they ceaſed with the death of the king: ſince that epoch they have produced no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but diſcord: and happy had it been for us if the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, when citizen GENET firſt ſet his foot in America, had, with his wonted firmneſs, declared that the relation between the two countries was diſſolved; that the guillotine of Robeſpierre and Orleans had cut the tie. He would then have had but one battle to fight: whereas, by admitting the revival of a contract extinguiſhed by themſelves, he has had to contend with the republic and her American allies about the interpretation of every material article; and planted thorns in his own admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, which have at length goaded him to a reſignation, when his virtues, talents, and good name are ſtill neceſſary to the preſervation of his country.</p>
            <p>However heterodox this opinion may ſound in the ears of ſome men, I am ſure it is not ſingular, and I think the recent conduct of the French ſufficiently proves that it is not unfound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. They have manifeſted by their actions, which ſpeak louder than words, that they conſider the treaties as null and void, ſo far at leaſt as they bind on themſelves, and that they never intended to make uſe of them as any thing more than a ſtepping ſtone to the new one projected: and as they have failed anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this purpoſe, they are reſolved that they ſhall not protect our ſhips and cargoes from their rapacity. After this ſhort digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, reader, we will now ſtep back to the ſpot where we left our author diſcharging his venom againſt Mr. HAMILTON.</p>
            <p>"From the influence" ſays he, "Mr. HAMILTON'S writings <hi>has</hi> had, in giving a tinge to the American character, I am convinced <hi>it</hi> will render <hi>them</hi> the contempt and ſcorn of Europe." That is, his writings firſt tinge the American character, then <hi>it</hi> renders <hi>them</hi> the contempt and ſcorn of Europe—which is a droll kind of a battle between <hi>it</hi> and <hi>them:</hi> however, we ſhall by this means be fully revenged of theſe wicked writings, for if they once become the ſcorn of Europe, it will not be long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they will become the ſcorn of America too.—But I do not believe a word of all this nonſenſe:—it is a beautiful tinge that Mr. H's writings have given to the American character—it is the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:030314_0016_0FE5B96ADC3538D0"/>
ſky-blue of peace<note n="*" place="bottom">See "Pacificus"</note>; and if ſuch publications as the one now before me do not communicate any worſe impreſſion, which from their fleeting nature I hope they will not, I am convinced ſhe long will retain her preſent amiable colour in the eyes of the world. God, in his mercy, preſerve her from the blood-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured tinge of France!</p>
            <p>"Have we not daily ſtriking proofs of my aſſertion," adds he. "Have not the American citizens been treated with <hi>coldneſs</hi> by the French"? Yes, if by coldneſs he means that they have ſeized, and plundered, and detained our property, to the value of four or five millions of dollars, for which we ſhall never receive a ſingle ſous. This is the coldneſs of death, and is a miſerable return for the animating warmth American hoſpitality has communicated to their half-dead, diſtreſſed emigrants. "Have they not been haraſſed, vexed, and buffetted by the Engliſh? Yes, God confound the plunderers of both nations: but it is unjuſt not to make this diſtinction, that the latter owed us no favours, and that by the laſt treaty with them, we ſhall recover full compenſation for all our legal demands. "And have not the Algerines compelled us to purchaſe a treaty, at the enormous ſum of twelve hundred thouſand dollars?" Yes, and they have, to the eternal diſgrace of Europe, compelled her moſt powerful ſtates to buy treaties on ſtill more humiliating terms: but I hardly think thoſe blackguard Muſſulmen ever ſaw any of Mr. HAMILTON'S writings; or care in the leaſt whether we hate the French or the Engliſh moſt. They hate all men, who are not circumciſed according to the law of Mahomet, and if they have any property, conſider it as a natural game.</p>
            <p>We have now done with his abuſe of the French; <hi>the only na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> from which America could expect to receive <hi>real acts of friendſhip!</hi> and ſhall next follow our author in viewing his conduct with regard to the United States internally, "where" he ſays "we will find as little cauſe of approbation and panegric." Then he proceeds to tell his readers that in the Convention, ſummoned to frame the Federal Conſtitution, Mr. HAMILTON was foiled in his attempt to introduce a monarchical government,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:030314_0017_0FE5B96C79D8D298"/>
and that, on finding the conſtitution was popular, and "admitted great latitude of conſtruction," he at length ſigned it: but as this was forced work, he did it grudgingly, and not only "me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated but ſought revenge" for his diſappointment.</p>
            <p>However, from the account given his reſentment was not very deep, or he had an excellent knack at concealing it; for the firſt act of public notoriety that we find him engaged in, was "in conjunction with Mr. MADISON, to write in ſupport of the conſtitution"; and he did it ſo ſucceſsfully that "he not only eſtabliſhed his reputation as a man of abilities, but as a firm federaliſt, and that too among the real friends of the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion." Whether he has perſevered in ſupporting what he did not altogether approve, we ſhall ſee further as we proceed; but it is certain Mr. MADISON has changed in his conduct greatly, for he has openly and ſtrenuouſly oppoſed the conſtitution and its whole executive branch. The one has been the champion of what he did not approve, becauſe it was popular, and the other has combated what he did approve, becauſe he has been diſappointed. Which, reader, is the moſt virtuous public character?</p>
            <p>But reſentment ſtill rankled in Mr. HAMILTON'S breaſt; he ſtill cheriſhed a predilection for royalty and the pomps of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment—and of courſe a ſecret averſion for our plain republican manners. To this ſource may be traced, ſays our <hi>equality-man,</hi> the introduction of <hi>Etiquette, Buſtle, Levees,</hi> and a train of other ariſtocratic creatures, who daily mounted guard at the Preſident's door, to the great ſcandal and terror of all good ſans culottes: indeed it is ſtrongly ſuſpected that theſe ſame gentry, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with HAMILTON and others, formed a conſpiracy to blow up the Conſtitution and all its friends, ſome dark night, when they were faſt aſleep; but happily the deſign was diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered time enough to prevent it.—</p>
            <p>One of the principal perſons engaged with him in the helliſh plot was a certain Mr. JOHN FENNO, editor of the United States Gazette. The part he was to act, was to inſert time after time, in his <hi>Courtly</hi> paper, certain inſidious para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphs, calculated to poiſon the public mind, and to give it an ariſtocratic tinge; ſuch, for inſtance, as "Juſt arrived in town, the Honorable Mr. ſuch a one"—and "The Honorable Mr.
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:030314_0018_0FE5B96D9DDBF778"/>
—, from Richmond, Norfolk or Charleſton, on his way to Boſton"—and, to carry on the "Diabolical Scheme" ſtill better, he was directed to "interſprerſe, occaſionally, ſome pious ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſome good old woman to the eaſtward, who had been drowned for witchcraft," and a thouſand other incantations, all tending to the ſame dreadful purpoſe. Happily, as I have ſaid the plot was diſcovered before it was ripe for execution; by which "the paper loſt it's circulation, and the printer was obliged to change it into a daily Gazette," as well as to raiſe the price from three to eight dollars pr. annum!!</p>
            <p>When this machiavelian ſcheme failed, Mr. HAMILTON was obliged, ſays our Sanſculottes, to vary his plan, and to attack ſome other quarter. As ſoon as he came into the office of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary of the Treaſury, for which the Preſident was weak enough to think him well qualified, finding the finances of the United States, void of order, and void of hope, ſomething like mother <hi>Chaos,</hi> before time began; when the domeſtic creditors apprehended all their ſcraps of paper would become, like old <hi>Conti,</hi> fit for nothing but to light a pipe with, and the foreign creditors began to look upon us as a nation of ſwindlers and pick-pockets—at this time, I ſay, he contrived his d—d fund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſyſtem, by which hope was brought back to the widow and orphan at home, and foreigners recovered their ancient faith in American honour. This, it is plain, was a home ſtroke at the Democratic part of the Conſtitution, for, in direct op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to Democratic principles, it was calculated to pay off our debts; and every body knows that a man, and by the ſame reaſon, a government out of debt, is out of credit. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, to pay debts is a mark of a pitiful ſpirit, unworthy the high-mettled Democrat, whoſe principal inducement to engage in the war, was to put his creditors at defiance.</p>
            <p>But all that preceded was nothing, ſays our Pampheteer, to his laſt nefarious attempt, the <hi>Exciſe law.</hi> In this he mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted the whole depth of his malice, as well as the extent of his talents.

were paſſionately fond of whiſkey, he reſolved that, as it was a Democratic liquor, they ſhould not drink it duty free. He pretended that in the diſtilleries they waſted a grain, by which they might fatten hogs, horſes and cows, and thereby increaſe the real wealth and ſtrength of the ſtate; inſtead of which, by drinking ſo much ardent ſpirits, they not only injured their healths, but continued poor and drunkards, as their fathers had been before them. For this reaſon he taxed it at the enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous rate of ſeven or eight cents pr. gallon; and as it is not uncommon in that country for a man to conſume a quart or more a day, ſo every day he choſe to get drunk, he was obliged to pay two or three cents towards the diſcharge of the public debt. This any body will allow, was ſufficient to ſhake the fidelity of the Whiſkey counties, was it ever ſo firmly rooted, and to produce a revolt. It had the effect: and Braddock's field was the <hi>Mons ſacer</hi> to which the plebeans ſeceded, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult and organize their force. Warm debates took place: ſome of the moſt wary, willing to ſecure a retreat, if things went contrary to their wiſh, propoſed moderate meaſures, but

                  <l>And reaſoned high of war and ſeparation,</l>

            <p>As is common on ſuch occaſions the violent prevailed: the ſtandard of rebellion was unfurled, alias liberty-poles were erected, and damnation drank to HAMILTON and the Exciſe law in many gallon of whiſkey. This our author ſays was the criſis that the Secretary wiſhed for. It was not ſubmiſſion to the law he deſired, it was oppoſition, which would pave the way for a military force. "Hence we find him giving encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to the oppoſition, by an ill-timed forbearance of urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the judiciary authority." Had he at the commencement, "ordered ſuits in law to be commenced againſt the refractory, it is univerſally believed, by thoſe who know better than Mr. HAMILTON, the temper of people in the weſtern counties of Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania, and the <hi>reſpect which they have always manifeſted</hi> for the judiciary authority, that ſubmiſſion would have been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained:" or in other words, had the Secretary aſſumed a bold
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:030314_0020_0FE5B975463606E0"/>
decided tone at firſt, the buſineſs would have been brought ſooner to a cloſe.</p>
            <p>Let us examine this ſtatement a little further: let us ſuppoſe Fox, the cowardly deputy-marſhal, who fled from among them to ſave his life, had been ſent back with peremptory orders to execute his proceſs at all riſques whatever; or in caſe he could not be prevailed with to go, had the marſhal himſelf been or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to proceed on the buſineſs, and to ſummon all the civil au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to his aid; the worſt that could have happened, was, that ſome of them might have been ſcalped, and others of them perhaps only branded, or tarred and feathered, to the no ſmall entertainment of the rebels. In ſuch a caſe the militia would have been called out in 92 inſtead of 94, and ſooner this had happened the better, as ſo much time would have been ſaved; for no body is fooliſh enough to believe, after the amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments made in the law, and ſo much pains taken to reconcile them to it without ſucceſs, they would have ſubmitted, 'till they were forced. Force at length, and nothing but force, wrought ſubmiſſion: it was the logic of fifteen thouſand bayonets that convinced the Weſtern Sansculottes of their miſtake, and taught them what they had never learned before, due "reſpect to the judiciary authority."</p>
            <p>It is true enough therefore that the Secretary "was unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the temper" of the people. Accomodation or lenient meaſures were not calculated to operate ſucceſsfully on their licentious ſpirits. After baniſhing the exciſe from among them, and the officers too, they might have returned to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect ſubmiſſion, ſuch as ſuited their own palates, for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of protection and defence, but it would ever have been precarious and uncertain. A man who by an excurſion on the high-way, or on the high ſeas, acquires a booty worth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, thinks the laws of ſome uſe, when they protect him in the enjoyment of his acquiſitions. That is a dreadful villain indeed, who does not acknowledge the neceſſity of <hi>reſpecting</hi> the laws ſome part of his life.</p>
            <p>After the maſſacre of the Indians at Coneſtogo and Lancaſter, and the attempt that followed, to cut the throats of a remnant that fled to Philadelphia for ſhelter, ſome thirty years ago; and
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:030314_0021_0FE5B97705A90538"/>
after butchering the inhabitants of three or four Moravian towns in cold blood, at the cloſe of the continental war; the heroes, theſe very whiſky boys for aught I know, returned, very quietly, to their homes and to <hi>the reſpect they always had and ſince have manifeſted to the laws.</hi> Theſe licentious pranks, theſe overleapings of law, are too habitual with ſome of the back ſettlers of Pennſylvania: at one time it is a thirſt for blood, and at another for whiſkey; but at all times it manifeſts a wild, diſorderly, and ſomewhat a cruel temper.</p>
            <p>But Mr. HAMILTON not only betrayed his ignorance, in the eſtimate he formed of the character of the Weſtern people, he was equally miſtaken when he took ſo much pains to procure evidence, to impeach thoſe old foxes FINDLEY, SMILIE and GALLATIN. However active theſe gentlemen were at firſt, in ſpreading the whiſkey mania, they ſoon found their authority with the populace was ſupplanted by new favorites, men of greater daring; and they wheeled to the right about, and left the poor deluded devils in the lurch. They took care to make their own peace by complying with the Preſident's Proclamation, —the door left open for repenting ſinners,—and HAMILTON might have earthed a fox in the foreſts of Alleghany, ſooner than he could have entrapped one of them. No, no; "they became active in ſuppreſſing the Inſurrection"—when they found it was likely to miſcarry: they had raiſed the devil, and they were reſolved to ſnatch at ſome credit in laying him too. Whether the ignorant herd will re-elect theſe betrayers to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent them in the general and ſtate legiſlatures is uncertain; if they do, it will be conſidered hereafter as a proof either that they are extremely ignorant, or not ſincere in their repentance.</p>
            <p>But it is amazing, if we believe this writer, what a number of different forms the Secretary aſſumed to come at evidence to cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate theſe leaders. One moment we find him in the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an "hoſpitable friend"; next he put on the "ſubtilty of a fiend"; and when theſe failed, we find him "like the frog in the fable"; and this frog is cloathed with all the "terrors of an inquiſitorial monk, with knitted brow and angry look". In ſhort old <hi>Proteus</hi> was a fool to our American ſecretary for variety of ſhapes: that ſlippery god could not aſſume more than one at
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:030314_0022_0FE5B9783857B8A8"/>
a time; but here we find the ſecretary like a frog, and a monk, and looking as angry as the d—l, all at one inſtant: certainly if Major POWERS<note n="*" place="bottom">One of the Witneſſes interrogated.</note> and the reſt of them had not been as wily as himſelf and as brave as Caeſar, he would have extorted ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from them. But it was all labour loſt: he never once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected that the whiſkey-boys wanted true and real repreſentatives in Congreſs; none of your ſhams;—and that had they betrayed their candidates, a chamber in the Penitential Houſe, or a hempen collar would have put them to the neceſſity of chooſing others not quite ſo fit.</p>
            <p>We come next to our author's elaborate defence of Iriſh ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty—a taſk equal in honor to that of Hercules, in cleanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Augean ſtable—but as I always hated lengthy calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and am ſure I ſhould ſoon grow tired of one applied to determine the exact number or proportion of Iriſhmen hanged in America, I leave this job to Porcupine. It is a national queſtion, and I dare ſay he can determine with mathematical pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, whether our author's calculation be exact or not. In the meanwhile I will be ſo candid as to declare that we have more than a <hi>quantum ſufficit</hi> both of Engliſh and Iriſh rogues among us; though the natives of Hibernia are vaſtly the moſt numerous. What is the preciſe cauſe of the difference; whether the Engliſh make a ſhift to hang moſt of their own rogues at home, and the Iriſh ſend theirs abroad, to propagate the breed, is hard for me to determine: but this I will ſay, for I love to give the devil his due, that, if war and juſtice muſt, for the good of mankind, have a certain number of victims in every country, we are moſt indebted to the Iriſh for our ſacrifices: and as, of courſe, there is ſome merit in being ſhot or hanged, as well as in labouring for the benefit of the world, in this reſpect, Hibernia, the palm is thine!—The preceding view regards only the moral cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the two nations, their propenſities for picking of pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets or cutting of throats, but it is neceſſary to do juſtice alſo to their reſpective political talents, which the reader will ſee, if he has patience, in the ſequel.</p>
            <p>Politics, however abſtruſe a ſcience it was formerly eſteemed,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:030314_0023_0FE5B97A27FF26A8"/>
has been ſo thoroughly explored by modern eſſayiſts, and the knowledge has been ſo thoroughly diſſeminated by thoſe laborious ſervants of the public, the editors of Gazettes, that every me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanic knows more now about civil rights and duties, than LOCKE, HARRINGTON, or SIDNEY. Every barber can tell you, to a hair's breadth, how far the line of ſubmiſſion goes, and where the right of inſurrection begins; when the voice of the majority ought to govern, and when the minority have a right to interpoſe their <hi>veto;</hi> whether a government divided into three branches, or ſpreading, like a gooſeberry buſh, all into branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, is beſt; whether the power of making treaties is ſuperior to the power of breaking them, and whether they both exiſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, like the principles of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil,</hi> in the Magian the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ology, always at loggerheads, or whether, like Caſtor and Pollux, they live and die by turns; how to manage the freedom of the preſs ſo that, like a cogged die, it ſhall always ſhew one ſide only; and a thouſand other difficult and delicate queſtions, where the ſhades of right and wrong meet, and almoſt run into one another. Although the preſent war is a conteſt for power among the leaders, with the people at large it is a mere war of opinions, and has been as zealouſly maintained by the pen, as by the ſword: rivers of ink as well as of blood have been ſpilt on the occaſion. But when the king and miniſtry of Great Britain thought proper to check the ardour of one part of theſe quilled warriors, as ſomewhat dangerous to their own government, the party and its friends were ſo offended that they fled from England and Ireland, boiling hot with reſentment. And now, courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reader, we come to diſcriminate the political characters of the two ſorts of emigrants.</p>
            <p>The exiles from England have not been as numerous as thoſe from the ſiſter Iſland; but what they have wanted in number, they have made up by ſuperior qualifications for miſchief. They are, generally ſpeaking, pupils of the Pariſian ſchool, whole-blood Philoſophers, who think of nothing but cutting the throats of all the kings in the world, and eſtabliſhing an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal republic over the whole, or having it cantoned into a number of ſmaller confederacies: there are others again who have ſomething that they call religion, in their heads, the mad diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:030314_0024_0FE5B97E83942EF8"/>
of BROTHERS, the mad prophet, and theſe look forward with joy to an approaching millenium. But however theſe two Engliſh ſects of revolutioniſts differ in the object or end, they agree perfectly about the means. Two hundred years of deſtruction and miſery, and an hundred millions of lives are nothing, if weighed in the balance againſt the extermination of Kings and Nobles. I have heard one of theſe enthuſiaſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing that he had eſcaped from the tyranny of Great Britain, and ſaying that he looked forward with rapture to the period, when the tower of London will be in flames, and the kennels running with blood: nothing, he ſaid, cauſed him ſo much regret, as the thought, that he had not diſtinguiſhed himſelf, by cutting the King's throat, before he left England.</p>
            <p>Now, I acknowledge that there are not many of the Iriſh patriots of this dreadful breed. They are moſtly a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grel race of reformers, neither ſo deeply ſkilled in politics, nor ſo very zealous about one form of government, more than another: they love liberty well enough, but could put up with a little tyranny, if the laws were not ſo d—d ſevere about the transfer of property; and to pay taxes for the ſupport of thoſe very laws they think is more than fleſh and blood can bear. On the whole, I acknowledge that the Engliſh enthuſiaſts, whoſe heads in general are abſolutely crazed, are much more to be dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than the patriots from Ireland. One of thoſe blood coloured philoſophers, with TOM PAINE'S <hi>Rights of Man</hi> in his hand, and a travelling guillotine by his ſide, would do more miſchief in a month, than a brace of raggamuffins from Ireland, who only make free with a mans "horſe or cow, from mere igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance," would do in half a century.</p>
            <p>Having now ſettled, with the utmoſt impartiality, this very important queſtion between the two nations, for which I expect the thanks of the <hi>Emigration Society</hi> delivered by their Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, I will take my leave of them both, with this friendly advice; "ceaſe vilifying the country you ſprung from, whatever or wherever it be, it is a mark of a baſe mind; and if you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer this, ſtay among us, and purſue ſome honeſt vocation with induſtry, leaving it to the natives to manage their own govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to their own liking, as they underſtand it beſt." When
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:030314_0025_0FE5B98089042AA0"/>
a foreigner intermeddles with the politics of the country, he never fails to tinge it, as far as he is able, with his own national prejudices and attachments. If he has fled from the ſeverity or juſtice of the laws of his former country, you diſcover his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment in every thing that he either ſays or does, that relates to it. Such a man, if he even prints a copy of an Engliſh work, cannot ſuffer it to paſs through his hands, without tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing ſome of his gall againſt the nation or it's government, into his American edition. This not only betrays a mind, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing with the malignant paſſions, but is an inſult to the reader, who does not pay his money to know the editor's politics, but to obtain information or entertainment from the author.— Such a perſon I have in my eye, who looking round a book ſtore one day, in ſearch of a book, that would anſwer to be reprint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, at length made his choice, when this, or ſome ſuch ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquy took place:</p>
            <p>
               <q>Mr. — ſaid he, ſuppoſing the author to be preſent," you have publiſhed a very uſeful work, and may I add, in uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal demand, of which I intend to print an American edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with improvements. Theſe improvements, except a few blunders of my own, ſhall conſiſt principally of all the abuſe I can invent againſt your nation, and your government, for I never can love, or forgive either of them. The thought of them only, makes my blood to boil. May ten thouſand d—ls fly away with them all! juſt before I left — I had like to have loſt my ears on a pillory, for only modeſtly exciting the people to cut one anothers throats.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This national buſineſs diſpatched, we will now attend to the claims of Maſter SWANWICK, and if I know my own mind, I intend to do him equal juſtice. It is of no importance to me, whether his father was a tide-waiter, or a waggon-maſter, or a Methodiſt teacher, or all three in one; whether the gentleman himſelf be the favorite of the ladies at t'other end of the town, or the topic of their diverſion; whether he is content to mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble orations in the Senate or boarding ſchool, in humble proſe, or diverts himſelf at the foot of Parnaſſus in proſe run mad; whether he is moſt vain of his fine Italian marble, and rich
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:030314_0026_0FE5B981CDFE2740"/>
paintings, or of his palace, where as in the Indian temples, the meaneſt article of furniture, is the idol himſelf. I care not a farthing about all theſe things: they may all apply to a wiſe man or a fool, and in my eſtimation neither add nor ſubtract from the real merit of the man. It is Mr. SWANWICK, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative in Congreſs, the bold and intruſive public character that I intend to examine.</p>
            <p>The firſt time he commanded my notice, was when on the State-houſe ground in Philadelphia, he canvaſſed for a ſeat in the State legiſlature. This was an unuſual ſight: in all the elections for thirty years preceding I had never once ſeen a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didate, paſſing off his own ticket. In that ſpace of time I had known ſome ambitious men, and many weak ones, ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous for ſeats in the legiſlature, but modeſty or ſome other old faſhioned virtue generally kept them from the ground on the day of election, or if they attended, it was only as ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, leaving it to their friends and well-wiſhers to take care of their intereſt. How ſhall we account for this novelty? Shall we ſuppoſe him vain enough to think himſelf above the common rules of decorum, or ſtupid enough to deſpiſe them?</p>
            <p>When by dint of art and induſtry he got into the houſe, it might have been expected that, as repreſentative for the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis, one of the greateſt trading cities of the Union, in which he poſſeſſed a conſiderable real eſtate, and carried on an exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive trade, her proſperity would be the principal object of his care. But Mr. SWANWICK had no head for ſpeculations of this kind. The vanity of being of ſome conſequence in the ſtate, was more eaſily gratified, and by means at the ſame time leſs oppoſed to his ruling paſſion, avarice. In conſequence of a quarrel with the ſtockholders in the Bank of <hi>North-America,</hi> his firſt ſtep after he got into the Legiſlature was to obtain a charter for another Bank, under the auſpices of the ſtate. To effect this, he united himſelf with a predominant party in the houſe, which had always been adverſe to the proſperity of the city and interior counties; and a large capital belonging to the ſtate, was imbarked in the purchaſe of ſhares in the new Bank. By this meaſure he embraced two objects; the indulgence of his ſpleen againſt the ancient bank, and opening a large field
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:030314_0027_0FE5B9840FD0BC90"/>
for ſpeculation as a ſubſcriber, and afterwards as a director of the new; both which he has managed to great account. Thus the public money has been employed in the Jew trade of uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in order to accommodate a few ambitious and daring ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culators; the commerce of city has not been enlarged by it, but engroſſed by a few avaricious men, who were able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand diſcounts at any time, when others were refuſed. It is reported that ſome of theſe very directors have diſcounted notes at the extravagant rate of 3 pr. centum pr. month, with the very money they have obtained at the bank at 6 pr. cent. pr. annum.</p>
            <p>The only honourable uſe of public money is public improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the melioration of the roads, the conſtruction of bridges, opening of inland navigation, and the eſtabliſhment of a loan office: by theſe means the activity and benefits of the capital are diffuſed and felt through every part of the community, not confined, as it diſgracefully has been, to a few avaricious indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals. Part of this ſame ſtock employed in the various ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, and turnpike roads would have given labour to many thouſand hands, and enabled the farmer to carry his produce to market at a cheap rate, from the moſt diſtant parts; and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part lodged in a loan office for the uſe of both the farmer, and the mechanic, would have enabled them to pay off their incumbrances, and advance their own and the general riches of the country.—</p>
            <p>On the contrary, men of public ſpirit, who embarked in works of general utility, after ſpending large ſums of their own money, have been reduced to the neceſſity either of loſing all that they had expended, or applying to the legiſlature, for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to raiſe more by a lottery to compleat them. Thus a taſte for gambling, only one degree above that of the Faro ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, has been ſanctioned by law; and the people have been ſeduced from the honeſt purſuits of induſtry, by the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of making their fortunes by the turn of a wheel. And theſe things have taken place among men, who make a mighty parade about the neceſſity and benefits of public ſchools, and an improved education; as if it were poſſible to make virtuous ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, merely by furniſhing their heads with knowledge, while
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:030314_0028_0FE5B989126A85F8"/>
their hearts are poiſoned with a ſpirit of gambling and idleneſs. Induſtry and temperance are the two cardinal virtues, on which the proſperity of a republic depends, and when they have fled, liberty and patriotiſm will ſoon follow, however ſcientifically men may learn to reaſon about them.</p>
            <p>After this little puffing orator, by his crooked politics, and the aſſiſtance of his tramontane colleagues, had diſgraced the commonwealth of Pennſylvania for a year or two, by ſome fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality or other he was removed to the legiſlature of the United States. Here he purſued the ſame perverſe ſyſtem, and attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf to that party in Congreſs, which had always oppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Federal Conſtitution, and every ſalutary act of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. His infamous conduct on the important queſtion of the Britiſh treaty is ſo well known, that little more need be ſaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him. A volume cannot convey more than his own confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, when he ſaid, Mr. MUHLENBURGH, who voted for the treaty had "ſaved his country" although he, himſelf had ſtruggled with all his might, and even at laſt voted againſt it. Can words deſcribe more deteſtable duplicity!—</p>
            <p>From celebrating Iriſh honeſty, the ſincerity of Dr. FRANK<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIN, and the tranſcendant merit of little Maſter SWANSKIN, the author paſſes, by a very natural tranſition, to calumniating the great and good Preſident of the United States, the illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous founder of Pennſylvania, and the moſt virtuous citizens of the Union in a lump; and his pen is equally well adapted to both offices, as an inſect gorged with filth from a dung-hill flies and drops it of choice on the whiteſt garment. "To be ill ſpoken of by ſuch a man, is conferring that ſort of honor, which it is alone within his competence, and which it is certainly moſt congenial to his nature and his manners to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow"—as to receive praiſe from him is the ſureſt proof that can be given, of inherent infamy in the object, on which it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed.</p>
            <p>It ſeems Dr. FRANKLIN choſe to keep up the farce to the laſt. In his will he bequeathed a few trifling legacies, as me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentos of his friendſhip, or, if you like the ſtile of our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor better, as proofs <hi>"of the goodneſs of his heart, and a wiſh to part in peace with all mankind."</hi> To the Philadelphia Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:030314_0029_0FE5B98AC91A71C0"/>
where his ſtatue ſtands in the front, like the pale monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Guilt, or like a Swiſs at the door of an hotel, he gave one old ſett of French works of little value; to the Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania hoſpital, the balances of his unſettled accounts, provided the managers would undertake to <hi>pay,</hi> as well as to receive, which they prudently choſe to decline; and to his worthy friend GEORGE WASHINGTON, he bequeathed his gold headed cane, ſurmounted with the cap of liberty, adding, "if it were a ſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, he is worthy of it." From this laſt article, this <hi>candid</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter infers, that the Doctor thought the Preſident always held "a ſceptre in higher eſtimation than a liberty cap," and if he really did, I ſhould eſteem it as a mark of his good ſenſe: but it is very clear, from the only natural conſtruction of the words, that the Doctor thought ſo himſelf—for however the <hi>Bonnet rouge</hi> may fit the head of an emancipated Frenchman, or the <hi>pileum</hi> ſuited the rabble of Rome, in celebrating their <hi>Saturna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> and qualified every blackguard to inſult a Metellus or a Cato, the old fox had more wit than to think that the modern liberty cap was a real badge of honor: No! no! he had carried it himſelf, only as a maſk, and thought proper to qualify this ſanſculotte legacy to General WASHINGTON, by adding, "if it were a ſceptre he is worthy of it." But to ſuppoſe that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he thought the General worthy of a ſceptre, as who is there that does not think ſo, he aſpired to any higher dignity than that of Preſident of the United States, is not only an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult to the office, but betrays a ſoul overflowing with ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
            <p>The whole of his life, the forty years of faithful ſervices devoted to the good of his country; his retirement from the army at the cloſe of the war, when a diſcontented ſoldiery, who idolized their general, would have given him a ſceptre if he had choſen it; his preſent ſeceſſion from the office of Chief Magiſtrate, with univerſal love and eſteem, ſo completely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove this baſe inſinuation, that it needs only to be mentioned, to excite general indignation againſt the author. But when it is known that this author is a foreigner by birth, every virtuous citizen will reſolve, that ſuch an ungrateful miſcreant is unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of an aſylum among us, and be ready to chaſe him back to
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:030314_0030_0FE5B98C0A0F7C38"/>

It is not ſufficient that theſe vermin find ſhelter and protection in the United States, but as ſoon almoſt as they come aſhore, they fall to their old trade of abuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing government, as if the two could not exiſt together.

            <p>After growling and gnaſhing his teeth againſt one of the greateſt men living,—who is the glory and ſafeguard of his country, our Iriſh wolf attempts to root up the graves: the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of both living and dead are his enemies, and he theirs. WILLIAM PENN, a name dear to all the <hi>real</hi> friends of civil and religious liberty, and venerated by the ſavage tribes to this very day, for his upright and peaceable conduct in the firſt ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of Pennſylvania, is treated with the ſame illiberal free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom as the great WASHINGTON: but it is natural, for ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude will ever purſue diſtinguiſhed merit as its evil genius, as long as envy exiſts in the world. Had this illuſtrious Quaker lived in the ancient ages of Greece, he would have been rank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the greateſt benefactors of Mankind, with MINOS, SO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LON and LYCURGUS: or had the Aborigines of this State been taught to believe in the exiſtence of tutelary Spirits, they would have canonized <hi>Brother Onas,</hi>

            <p>There are ſome prominent features in the face of this ſloven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brat, which proue it inconteſtibly to be the offspring of an Iriſh daddy. The moſt ſtriking are his frequent Hiberniciſms, and a clumſy attempt to wit, very much like nonſenſe—yes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Paddy, they are as much akin as two potatoes. Theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the author's antipathy to the yankees, leave not the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of a doubt as to his country: for the inhabitants of thoſe

ſtates, called Yankee, are generally attached to law and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of ſuperior morals, and watchful of ſtrangers that come among them: thieves and vagabonds don't thrive there: the air will poiſon them as quick as that of Ireland will a toad. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, their ſelect men encircle and guard their little ſocieties, and an Iriſhman is as much afraid to enter the incloſure, as a wolf is to enter a circle of fire in the night time: ſo that there is no credit to be given, not the leaſt, to what this lying varlet ſays of horſe-ſtealing in Connecticut, or bundling in Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts: they are only idle tales that he has picked up ſome where elſe, for take my word for it, reader, he has never been in either State.</p>
            <p>Having now nearly done with this ſcribbler and his pamphlet, before I take my leave of him, I will juſt whiſper in his ear a piece of wholeſome advice in the ſtyle of the inimitable Cervantes: <q>Let every man take care how he ſpeaks or writes of honeſt peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and not ſet down at a venture the firſt thing that comes into his joulter-head"—"Tell me, thou modern Sanſculottes, and ancient rebel! was it thy province to diſhonor and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front perſons ſo worthy of reverence and reſpect.
