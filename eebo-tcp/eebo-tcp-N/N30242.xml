            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> informs us, <hi>That it is appointed for all Men once to die; after that,</hi> ſays he, <hi>comes Judgment.</hi>— And I think if any Conſideration be ſufficient to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken a ſleeping drowſy World, it muſt be this— That there will be a Day wherein theſe Heavens ſhall be wrapt up like a ſcrowl, this Element melt with fervent Heat, the Earth and all the Things therein be burnt up, and every Soul and every Nation and Language ſummoned to appear before the dreadful <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> of the righteous Judge of Quick and Dead, to receive Rewards and Puniſhments according to the Deeds done in their Bodies.—The great Apoſtle juſt mentioned, when brought before <hi>Felix,</hi> could think of no better means to convert that ſinful Man than to reaſon of Temperance, Righteouſneſs, and more eſpecially of a Judgment to come.—The firſt might in ſome Meaſure affect, but I am perſwaded it was the laſt Conſideration, I mean of a Judgment to come, that made him tremble; and ſo bad as the World is grown yet there are few have their Conſciences ſo far ſcared, as with a red hot Iron, as to deny that there will be a Reckoning hereafter. The promiſcuous Diſpenſations of Providence in this
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:040181_0003_101632B50981EDF0"/>
Life, wherein we ſee good Men afflicted, deſtitute, tormented, and the Wicked permitted Triumphantly to ride over their Heads, has been always looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as an indiſputable Argument, by the generality of Men, that there will be a day in which God will Judge the World in Righteouſneſs, and Adminiſter true Equity unto his People.—Some indeed are ſo bold as to deny it, while they are engaged in the purſuit of the Luſt of the Eye, and the Pride of Life.—But follow them to their Death-Beds, ask them, when their Souls are ready to launch into Eternity, what they then think of a Judgment to come? and they will tell you they dare not give their Conſciencies the Lye any longer.—They feel a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful looking for of Judgment and fiery Indignation in their Hearts.—Since then theſe Things are ſo, does it not highly concern each of us, my Brethren, before we come on a bed of Sickneſs, ſeriouſly to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine how the Account ſtands between God and our Souls, and how it will fare with us in that Day? As for the openly Prophane, the Drunkard, the Whore-monger, the Adulterer, and ſuch like, there's no doubt of what will become of them—without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance they ſhall never enter into the Kingdom of God and his Chriſt, No, their Damnation ſlumbereth not, A burning fiery Tophet kindled by the Fury of God's eternal Wrath is prepared for their Reception, wherein they muſt Suffer the Vengeance of an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Fire.—Nor is there the leaſt doubt of the State of true Believers—For tho' they be deſpiſed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected of natural Men, yet being born again of God, they are Heirs of God, and joint Heirs with Chriſt— They have the earneſt of the promiſed Inheritance in their Hearts, and are aſſured that a new and living way is made open for them, into the Holy of Holies,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:040181_0003_101632B50981EDF0"/>
by the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, through which an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant entrance ſhall be Adminiſtred to them at the great Day of Accounts. The only Queſtion is, What will become of the almoſt Chriſtian, one that is content to go as he thinks in a middle way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, without being Prophane on the one Hand, or as he falſely imagined, Righteous overmuch on the other?—Multitudes there are in every Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and conſequently here preſent, of this Stamp— And what is worſt of all, it's more eaſy to convince the moſt notorious Publicans and Sinners of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of a ſtate of Salvation, than any of theſe—<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Notwithſtanding if Jeſus Chriſt may be our Judge they ſhall as certainly be rejected and diſowned by him at the laſt Day, as tho' they lived in open De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance of all his Laws.—For what ſays our Lord in the Parable of which the Words of the Text are a Reddition or Concluſion and which I intend to make the Subject of my preſent Diſcourſe.—Then, that is, at the Day of the Judgment, which he had been diſcourſing of in the foregoing and proſecutes in this Chapter, <hi>Shall the Kingdom of Heaven</hi> i. e. the State of profeſſors in the Goſpel Church, <hi>be likened unto Ten Virgins, which took their Lamps and went forth to meet the Bridegroom.</hi> In which Words is a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Alluſion to a Cuſtom prevailing in our Lords Time among the <hi>Jews,</hi> at marriage Solemnities, which were generally at Night, and at which it was Cuſtomary for the Perſons of the Bride-Chamber to go out in Proceſſion with many Lights to meet the Bridegroom.—By the Bridegroom then here ſpoken of, you are to underſtand Jeſus Chriſt—The Church <hi>i. e.</hi> True Believers are his Spouſe—he is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them by one Spirit even in this Life, but the Solemnizing of theſe ſacred Nuptials is reſerved till the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:040181_0004_101632B790495F60"/>
Day of Judgment, when he ſhall come to take them home to himſelf, and preſent them, before Men and Angels, as his purchaſe to his Father, without Spot or Wrinkle or any ſuch Thing.—By the Ten Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins we are to underſtand the Profeſſors of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in General—All are called Virgins, becauſe all are called to be Saints.—Whoſoever Names the Name of Chriſt is obliged by that very Profeſſion to depart from all Iniquity.—The pure and chaſte in Heart are the only Perſons that will be ſo bleſſed as to ſee God.—As Chriſt was born of a Virgin's Womb, ſo he can dwell in none but Virgins Souls, made Pure and Holy by the Cohabitation of his Holy Spirit.—But what ſays the Apoſtle? <hi>All are not</hi> Iſralites <hi>that are of</hi> Iſrael—<hi>All are not true Chriſtians that are called after the Name of Chriſt</hi>— No, ſays our Lord, in the 2d. v. <hi>Five of theſe Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins were Wiſe,</hi> i. e. True Believers, <hi>and five were Fooliſh,</hi> i. e. Formal Hypocrites.—But why are five ſaid to be Wiſe, and the other five Fooliſh?—Hear what our Lord ſays in the following Verſes, <hi>They that were Fooliſh took their Lamps and took no Oil with them: But the Wiſe took Oil in their Veſſels with Lamps.</hi>—They that were Fooliſh took their Lamps, <hi>i. e.</hi> The Lamp of an outward Profeſſion, they would go to Church, ſay over ſeveral manuals of Prayers, come perhaps even into a Field to hear a Sermon, give at a Collection, and receive the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament conſtantly, nay, oftner than once a Month. —But then here lay the Miſtake, they had no Oil in their Lamps,—no true Principle of Grace, no living Faith in their Hearts, without which tho' we ſhould give all our Goods to feed the Poor, and our Bodies to be Burnt it would profit us nothing.— In ſhort, they were exact, nay perhaps Superſtitious
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:040181_0004_101632B790495F60"/>
Biggots as to the Form; but all the while they were Strangers to and in effect denyed the Power of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs in their Hearts. They would go to Church, but at the ſame Time, think it no harm to go to a Ball or an Aſſembly, notwithſtanding they promiſed at their Baptiſm, <hi>to renounce the Pomps and Vanities of this wicked World.</hi>—They were ſo exceeding fearful of being Righteous overmuch, that they would even perſecute thoſe that were truly Devout, if they attempted to go a ſtep farther than themſelves. In one Word, they never effectually felt the Powers of the World to come.—They thought they might be Chriſtians without ſo much Inward feeling, and therefore, notwithſtanding their high Pretenſions, had only a Name to Live.</p>
            <p>And now Sir, let me pauſe a while, and in the Name of God, whom I endeavour to ſerve in the Goſpel of his dear Son, give me leave to ask one Queſtion. Whilſt I have been drawing, tho' in Minature, the Character of theſe fooliſh Virgins, have not many of your Conſciences made the Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and with a ſmall ſtill, tho' articulate, Voice, ſaid, thou Man, thou Woman art one of theſe fooliſh Virgins, for thy Practice and Sentiments agreeth thereto? Do not then ſtifle but encourage theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions, and who knows but that Lord, who is rich in mercy to all that call upon him faithfully, may ſo work upon you even by this fooliſhneſs of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as to make you wiſe Virgins before you return home?</p>
            <p>What they were you ſhall know immediately— <hi>But the Wiſe,</hi> ſays our Lord, ver. 4. <hi>took Oil in their Veſſels with their Lamps.</hi>—Obſerve, the Wiſe, that is, the true Believers, had their Lamps as well as the Fooliſh Virgins, for Chriſtianity does not require us
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:040181_0005_101632B927B81B28"/>
to caſt off all outward Forms.—We may uſe Forms and yet not be formal: For Inſtance, it is poſſible to worſhip God in a ſet Form of Prayer, and yet wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him in Spirit and in Truth. And therefore Brethren let us not judge one another. The wiſe Virgins had their Lamps, herein did not ly the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between them and the Fooliſh, that one worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God with a Form and the other did not.—No, as the <hi>Phariſee</hi> and <hi>Publican</hi> went up to the Temple to pray, ſo theſe Wiſe and fooliſh Virgins might go to the ſame Place of Worſhip and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ir under the ſame Miniſtry—But then the Wiſe took Oil in their Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels with their Lamps, they kept up the Form, but did not reſt in it, their Words in prayer were the Language of their Hearts, and they were no Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to inward Feelings, they were not afraid of ſearching Doctrine, nor affronted when Miniſters told them they deſerve to be damned—They were not ſelf Righteous, but were willing that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould have all the Glory of their Salvation, they were convinced that the Merrits of Jeſus Chriſt were to be apprehended only by Faith; but yet were they as careful to maintain good Works as tho' they were to be juſtified by them—in ſhort their Obedience flowed from Love and Gratitude, and was cheerful, conſtant, uniform, univerſal like that Obedience which the Holy Angels pay our Father in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>Here then let me exhort you to pauſe again; and if any of you can faithfully apply theſe Characters to your Hearts, give God the Glory and take the Comfort to your own Souls, you are not Falſe but true Believers.—Jeſus Chriſt has been made of God to you Wiſdom, even that Wiſdom, whereby you ſhall be made Wiſe unto Salvation—God ſees a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:040181_0005_101632B927B81B28"/>
between you and Fooliſh Virgins, if Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Men will not.—You need not be uneaſy if one Chance and Fate in this Life may happen to you both I ſay one Chance and Fate. For <hi>ver.</hi> 5<hi>th while the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom tarryed</hi> i. e. in the intermediate Space of Time which paſſed between our Lords Aſſention and his coming again to Judgment, <hi>they all ſlumbred and ſlept,</hi> the Wiſe as well as Fooliſh dyed, for Duſt we all are and to Duſt we muſt return, its no Reflection at all upon the Divine Goodneſs that Believers, as well as Hypocrites muſt paſs thro' the Valley of the Shadow of Death, for Chriſt has taken the Sting out of it, ſo that we need fear no Evil—It is to them a Paſſage to everlaſting Life. Death is only terrible to thoſe that have no Hope, becauſe they live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Faith in the World. Whoſoever there are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you, that have received the firſt Fruits of the Spirit, I am perſuaded you are ready to cry out with Holy <hi>Job</hi> we would not live here always, we long to be diſſolved that me may be with Jeſus Chriſt. And tho' Worms muſt deſtroy our Bodies as well as others, yet we are content, being aſſured that our Redeemer liveth, that he will ſtand at the latter Days upon the Earth, and that in our Fleſh we ſhall ſee God.</p>
            <p>But it is not ſo with Hypocrites and Unbelievers beyond the Grave, for what ſays our Lord? And at Midnight, obſerve at Midnight, when all was huſh'd and quiet, and no one dreaming of any ſuch Thing. A cry was made, The Voice of the Arch-Angel and the Trump of God was heard ſounding this general Alarm. <hi>To Things in Heaven, to Things in Earth, and to Things in the Waters under the Earth, BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HOLD</hi>—mark how this awful Summons is uſher'd in with the Word <hi>BEHOLD</hi>—to engage our Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

               <hi>Behold</hi> the Bridegroom cometh even Jeſus Chriſt the deſire of Nations, the Bridegroom of his Spouſe the Church—becauſe he tarried for a while to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe the Faith of Saints, and give Sinners ſpace to repent.—Scoffers were apt to cry out where is the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of his coming, but the Lord is not ſlack concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Promiſe, as theſe Men account ſlackneſs— For <hi>Behold</hi> he that was to come now cometh, and will not tarry any longer, he cometh to be glorified in his Saints, and to take Vengeance on them that know not God, and have not obeyed his Goſpel: He cometh not as a Poor deſpiſed <hi>Galilean,</hi> not to be ſtabled in a ſtinking Manger, not to be deſpiſed and rejected of Men, not to be blindfolded, ſpit upon, and buffeted, not to be nailed to an accurſed Tree, not as the Son of Man, but as he really was the eternal Son of an eternal God: He cometh riding in the Wings of the Wind, in the Glory of the Father, and his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Angels; and to be had in everlaſting Reverence of all that ſhall be round about him.—Go ye forth to meet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>I fear Sirs, too many amongſt us, are of this Mind.

And he knows who come to hear what the Babler ſays, and to run away with Part of a broken Sentence that they may hereof accuſe him—This Expreſſion then <hi>I know you not,</hi> muſt not be underſtood literral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, No, it implys a knowledge of Approbation as tho' Chriſt had ſaid you call me Lord, Lord, but you have not done the Things that I have ſaid.—You de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire me to open the Door, but how can you come in hither not having on a wedding Garment?

            <p>And now what Inference ſhall I draw from what has been deliver'd? Our Lord in the Words of the Text has drawn one for me, <hi>watch therefore for ye know neither the Day nor the Hour wherein the Son of Man cometh.</hi>

            <p>Watch, that is, be upon your Guard and keep your Graces in continual exerciſes: For as when we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to watch unto Prayer, it ſignifies that we ſhould continue inſtant in that Duty, ſo when we are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to watch, in general it means that we ſhould put on the whole Armour of God and live every Day as tho' it was our laſt. And Oh that the Lord may now enable me to lift up my Voice like a Trumpet! For had I a Thouſand Tongues, or could I ſpeak ſo loud that the whole World might hear me, I could not ſound a more uſeful Alarm, than that which is contained in the Words of the Text, watch therefore, my Brethren, I beſeech you by the Mercies of God in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Watch, be upon your Guard, Awake ye that ſleep in the Duſt: For ye know neither the Day nor the Hour wherein the Son of Man cometh,</hi> perhaps to Day, perhaps this Midnight, the CRY may be made: For in a Moment, in a twikling of an Eye, the Trump is to Sound.—However ſuppoſing the Final Day of Judgment may yet be a great Way off, yet the Day of Death is certainly near at Hand: For what is our Life? It is but a Vapour, it is but a Span long, ſo ſoon paſſeth it away and we are gone, bleſſed be God we are all here well.—But who out of this great Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude dares ſay, I ſhall go home to my Houſe in ſafety?
