            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>WHEN Our Bleſſed Saviour took upon him Human Nature, his Deſign was to make us partakers of the Divine Nature &amp; Happineſs: He came down from Heaven, that he might advance us to the bliſsful Manſions of his Father's Houſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver us from the Dominion of the Powers of Darkneſs, into the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Liberty of the Sons of God. As this is the greateſt bleſſing which God could give, or Man receive, Our Lord's Miſſion was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with the ſtrongeſt Evidence, that He did not only bear a good Will to Men, but had likewiſe Power to beſtow upon them all that Life &amp; Immortality which his Goſpel brought to light. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, His Divinity being hid under the veil of his Humanity, and the Majeſty of his Perſon being eclipſed, by the meanneſs of his outward Appearance, neither the excellency of his Life &amp; Doctrine, nor the completion of Antient Prophecies, nor mighty Miracles perform'd by him, were able to perſwade the obſtinate Jews to look upon him as the Promis'd Meſſias; on the contrary, they deſpis'd and rejected him, and ſtrove as much as in them lay, to make their Malice and Hatred infinite, like his Love. Such entertainment did the great Founder of our Religion meet with from an ungrateful World, for whoſe ſake he humbled himſelf here upon Earth, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dur'd ſo much Miſery &amp; Affliction. Jeſus Chriſt came to his Own
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:001544_0003_0FB3A8DFA1771F98"/>
and his Own receiv'd him not. The Converſion of the loſt Sheep of the Houſe of Iſrael, was his earlieſt and chief care; their Land was honour'd with his Sacred Birth, and to them the glad Tidings of Salvation were firſt Preach'd: But tho' Chriſt was in a Peculiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the glory of that People, yet the beams of his Light, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of his Coming, extended to the Ends of the World; after a long gloomy Night of Ignorance &amp; Error, the Sun of Righteouſneſs roſe upon all Nations, with healing under his Wings; the Partition Wall betwixt Jew &amp; Gentile was broken down, and a lively Faith qualified all People for the Divine Favour, and the participation of thoſe benefits which Chriſt purchaſs'd for his Church. <hi>For as many as receiv'd Him, to them gave he Power to become the Sons of God, even to them that believe on his Name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In diſcourſing upon which words, I'l <hi>Firſt</hi> conſider the Dignity of the Perſon whom we are to receive.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I'l ſhew, How we are to receive Him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The great advantage of doing ſo, for thereby we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Sons of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> I'l repreſent the great Sinfulneſs of not receiving Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And in the <hi>Laſt Place,</hi> Draw ſome Inferences from the whole.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt</hi> then, with reſpect to the Dignity of his Perſon: We are aſſured that Jeſus Chriſt tho' he condeſcended to be Born in Time, yet had a Being before Time was, and Exiſted from all Eternity; before he Sojourn'd in this World, He enjoy'd the Felicities of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which was his proper Country, and everlaſting Throne of the Prince of Peace. But as the firſt Adam by his Tranſgreſſion rendred himſelf Obnoxious to the Divine Wrath, and was baniſh'd from a Paradiſe upon Earth; ſo the ſecond Adam who knew no Sin, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent, for a while, a voluntary Exile from the Coeleſtial Paradiſe, that he might confer it upon us, and work a Reconciliation betwixt God and his Rebellious Subjects. <hi>I came forth from the Father,</hi> ſays he, <hi>and am come into the World.</hi> Again, <hi>I leave the World and go to
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:001544_0004_0FB3A8E11E54B988"/>
the Father,</hi> Joh. xvi. 17. In his Converſation with his Diſciples he ſet them his own Example, as the moſt perfect Model of Humility, Meckneſs, Self-denial, &amp; other Vertues, which he taught in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limeſt manner; His Soul was too great to be in love with Subluna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Vanity, &amp; therefore he affected no Grandeur, but avoided Oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and deſpis'd the air of Popular applauſe; as he was the Son of Man, he profeſs'd he <hi>came not to be Miniſtred unto, but to Miniſter, and to give his Life a ranſom for many</hi>: Yet that we may not doubt his heavenly Extraction, We read, <hi>That the Angels Miniſtred unto him, and Worſhip'd him: For being in the Form of God, he thought it no robbery to be equal with God; tho he made himſelf of no reputation, and took upon him the Form of a Servant, and was made in the likeneſs of men.</hi> T'was the grace and favour of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>That tho' he was Rich he became Poor, that we through his Poverty might be Rich.</hi> For 'tis undeniably plain and clear that Himſelf choſe that mean condition wherein he Lived, becauſe upon occaſion he could work a Miracle for the payment of the tribute Money; and all Creatures were obſequious to his pleaſure; He was Heir of all things; and tho' he had not where to lay his Head upon Earth, the glorious Manſions of Heaven were diſpoſed of by him; and ſince he aſſured his Diſciples, He went thither to prepare a Place for them. The moſt likely way to Wean their Affections from Earthly things, was to ſhew them in his own Perſon, how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle he valu'd the Delights and Conveniences of this preſent Life. He likewiſe took our Sickneſſes, and bore our Infirmities in his own Body, but at the ſame time gave his choſen Followers a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing demonſtration of Omnipotence in his wonderful Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuration upon the Mount, where his Face did ſhine as the Sun, and his Raiment became white as the Light; this ſhew'd him able to perform what he ſaid to the Jews, <hi>Deſtroy this Temple and in three Days I will raiſe it up</hi>; Signifying thereby his Reſurrection, which declared him to be the Son of God with Power, and was a mighty Argument of his Divinity, and the
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:001544_0005_0FB3A8E32C640B50"/>
Truth of his Religion. Such was the blindneſs of the People of Iſrael, that they eſteem'd him, Stricken, Smitten of God &amp; Afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; Whereas his Death ſerv'd to make his Victory and Triumph the more Illuſtrious, when he broke the Priſon of the Grave and aſcended up on High, and led Captivity Captive, and gave Gifts unto Men. The Angels received Him with Acclamations of Joy, and Sung; <hi>Lift up your Heads, O ye Gates, and be ye Lift up, ye Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Doors; and the King of Glory ſhall come in.</hi> Thus God Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted Chriſt far above all Principality and Power, and Might and Dominion, and every Name that is Named, not only in this World, but alſo that which is to come; and hath put all things under his Feet, and gave him to be the Head over all things to the Church. He is the living Stone, diſallowed indeed of Men, but choſen of God and precious; He is that Rock from whom the waters of Life flow; He is the Bright and Morning Star which chas'd away the Clouds of the Night, and brought in an Eternal Day; He is that Light which Lighteth every Man that cometh into the World, that Directs them here, and Guide's them into the happy Seats of End<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Glory hereafter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt is that Great Prophet who taught the way of God Perfectly. He renewed in Man the Image of God, by thoſe moſt excellent Rules and Precepts, which he gave for the Practice of true Holineſs &amp; Vertue. The Gentiles had by their great Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs almoſt quite Eras'd thoſe natural impreſſions of Good and Evil which were written in their Hearts; and the Jews by their corrupt gloſſes had miſerably defac'd the Moral Law which was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven in Tables of Stone. Our Bleſſed Saviour gave Strength and Beauty to them both, he Poliſh'd and Brighten'd the Principles of Reaſon, reſcu'd the Law from the falſe interpretations of the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, and preſs'd upon the Conſciences of the People the moſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult Duties of the Divine Life; for the better Obſervance of which, he makes a clear Revelation of Eternal Rewards and Puniſhments, and acquaints them that if their Righteouſneſs did not exceed the
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001544_0006_0FB3A8E4B2AB2548"/>
Righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees, they ſhould in no wiſe enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, but ſhould be caſt into outer dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, where there is Weeping and Gnaſhing of Teeth. Thus He framed the Nobleſt Inſtitution and Religion that was ever vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaf'd to Mankind; but this was not enough, for our firſt Parents and all their Poſterity being deeply fallen from their Primitive Perfection, 'twas expedient there ſhould be Satisfaction made for the Original and Actual Tranſgreſſions, which the Sons of Men are guilty of: Jeſus Chriſt alone could make a full and ſufficient Oblation and Satisfaction for the Sins of the World; becauſe in his Humanity he was of the ſame Nature with the Offenders, but without Sin; and his Divinity added an Infinite Value to his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, tho' it was not capable of Suffering. And now having obtain'd an Unchangeable Prieſt-hood, and having over-come Death by his Death, He continues his Care and Protection to his Church, which he bought with a price ineſtimable. He nouriſhes the Souls of his Diſciples with the Spiritual Food of his Word and Sacraments, pour's upon them plentiful Effuſions of his holy Spirit, and Promis'd to be with them to the End of the World. And in the laſt and greateſt act of his Regal Office, He ſhall come again with Glory to Judge both Quick and Dead; and ſhall Pronounce the Sentence of Everlaſting Puniſhment to the Bad, and Life Eternal to the Good and Pious.</p>
            <p>Thus I have conſider'd the Dignity and Excellency of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, which was the firſt thing I propos'd to Speak to. I come,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> To ſhew how we are to Receive Him. Now to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi> Chriſt, is to <hi>Believe</hi> on his Name; That is, To Exerciſe all the acts of ſuch a Faith as produceth the genuine fruits of Piety and Obedience. If we ſo acknowledge Chriſt as to believe in him, if we ſo believe in him as to Love him; if we ſo love him as to keep his Commandments; then we are rooted and grounded in love, and Chriſt dwells in our Hearts by Faith. This kind of
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001544_0007_0FB3A8E62FA981F0"/>
Faith is that Key which opens the heavenly Treaſures; that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Eye which diſcern's the Inviſible things of God; that Hand which reaches to the Tree of Life; and that Pillar of Fire which leads the true Iſraelites through the Wilderneſs of this World, into the Coeleſtial Canaan. For ſo it is Written; Joh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> iii 16. <hi>God ſo loved the World that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever believeth in Him ſhould not Periſh, but have Everlaſting Life.</hi> The Purifying of the Heart is one great property of Faith, and is the Wedding Garment put on by thoſe who truly believe in Jeſus Chriſt. Otherwiſe, if our Hearts be Unſanctifyed and full of Sinful Thoughts, we ſhall give our Saviour a worſe entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than he receiv'd in the Manger, among the brute Beaſts: But the Holy Spirit Purifies the Heart by Faith: as it is Written, <hi>Acts</hi> xv. 9. How acceptable to God Purity and Innocence is, there cannot be a greater inſtance than our Dear Lord's Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: She who was ſo much in favour with God, as to bring a Saviour into the World, was indeed deſcended from the Royal Line of the Kings of Judah, according to Ancient Prophecies, but at this time the Stem of Jeſſe was brought very low, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to its roots; and the bleſſed Virgin's Vertue was more Illuſtrious than her Family. And as God ſhew'd his great Love of Holineſs in the Conception of his beloved Son, ſo he likewiſe did at his Nativity. The humble Shepherds were the Perſons to whom the glad Tidings of great Joy were brought, and they heard the Angels Sing their Anthems of Praiſe, for the Birth of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. The heavenly Hoſt viſited them whoſe harmleſs Lives bore the neareſt reſemblance to their own: and who in their mean Calling retain'd ſome Footſteps of Man's Primitive Righteouſneſs. The Inhabitants of Courts and Cities were not diſpos'd to welcome a Lawgiver, who ſhould reform the Extortion and Injuſtice of the one; and the Pride and Luxury of the other: Earthly Treaſures were all their care, and they gave themſelves little trouble about the Heavenly; and accordingly Chriſt tell's
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001544_0008_0FB3A8E7AED113B0"/>
them, It was eaſier for a Camel to go thro' a needles eye than for ſuch to enter into his Kingdom. The Prince of Life will meet with no better a reception from us whilſt our affections lie groveling upon the Ground, and our minds cleave to the Duſt; but if we deſire nothing upon Earth in compariſon of him, and count all Temporal things as droſs, when they come in competition with our Duty; and Purify our ſelves from all filthineſs of Fleſh and Spirit; then we ſhall be qualified to entertain this Divine Gueſt in our Souls; our Bodies too will become living Temples of the Deity, and delightful Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of his Preſence. But this is not the only property of Faith; for it enlightens our Underſtandings as well as Sanctifies our Hearts; and this illumination of the Mind, makes us cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially imbrace the Religion of the Crucified Jeſus. For want of it the Jews ſtumbled and fell; they were an extremely carnal People, and look'd for happineſs no farther than the pleaſures of Senſe: At the time of our Saviour's appearing amongſt them, they retain'd their Polity &amp; Government, but their Necks were gall'd with the Roman Yoke, and they were Tributaries to that People; which made them impatiently long for the Meſſias, whom they expected to be a Temporal Deliverer, that ſhould raiſe Himſelf a Kingdom upon the ruins of the Roman Empire, and other Worldly Powers. Jeſus Chriſt diſappointing them in their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations; they were very far from owning Him to be the King of Iſrael. And as his Humiliation here below were a ſtumbling block to the <hi>Jews,</hi> who had ſome Knowledge of the true God, ſo was it fooliſhneſs to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> whoſe Minds the god of this World had wholly darken'd. There is nothing more evident to an Unprejudic'd inquirer, than that the Prophecies of the Old Teſtament concerning the Meſſias are made up of two ſorts of Predictions; One foretelling his firſt advent to Save the World, the other his ſecond coming to Judge the World. With reſpect to the former, the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> deſcribes Him, in the liii <hi>d.</hi> Chapter, <hi>As a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with Grief, without
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001544_0009_0FB3A8EC268F9CD0"/>
Beauty that we ſhould deſire him.</hi> With reſpect to the latter, <hi>Daniel</hi> uſes theſe Magnificent expreſſions, in the vii. Chapter 13, 14.v. <hi>I ſaw in the night Viſions, and behold One like the Son of Man, came with the Clouds of Heaven, and came to the Antient of Days, and they brought him near before him. And there was given him Dominion, and Glory, and a Kingdom, that all People Nations and Languages ſhould Serve him: His Dominion is an everlaſting Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, which ſhall not paſs away, and his Kingdom that which ſhall not be deſtroy'd.</hi> So groſs were the Underſtandings of the Jews, that the generality of them took no notice of this diſtinction, but refus'd the Holy One, and the Juſt. In like manner the Croſs of Chriſt was fooliſhneſs to the <hi>Greeks</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> becauſe the neceſſity of ſuch an excellent Perſons Sufferings was a thing beyond their comprehenſion; being unacquainted with the true origine of Mankind, they knew nothing of that Sacrifice of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement which was to reconcile them to God. Our Saviour's Sublime Precepts and Stupendous Miracles would certainly have given Him in their eſteem a preference to the greateſt of their Philoſophers were they ſatisfyed in the reaſons of his Paſſion; they would ſoon have deſiſted from their cruel Perſecutions, if they had been firmly perſwaded that the fulneſs of the Godhead dwelt in Him, who was numbred among the Tranſgreſſors. Such of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> who conſulted and believed the Scriptures made no Scruple of giving their aſſent to this Truth: The admirable Harmony betwixt the Old and New Teſtament, and the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Jeſus from the Dead, convinc'd them of his Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and took away the Scandal of his Croſs. Upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count St. <hi>Paul</hi> congratulates the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> in the following Words, <hi>Wherefore I alſo, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jeſus, and Love unto all the Saints, ceaſe not to give thinks for you, making mention of you in my Prayers; that the God of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Father of Glory, may give unto you the Spirit of Wiſdom and Revelation in the Knowledge of him: the eyes of your

Underſtanding being inlightn'd:</hi>— Eph. i.15, 16, 17.v. From hence it appears that Illumination of the Mind is the happy conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of a Lively Faith; and if it be joyn'd with true Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it will enable us worthily to Receive our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>I proceed therefore to ſhew,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The great advantages of doing ſo; for thereby we become the Sons of God. Nothing can give us ſo adequate an Idea of the greatneſs of this Priviledge, as the contemplation of the Miſery of our Natural Eſtate. How are we born to poſſeſs a few Months of Vanity here below<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> How ſhort is our Life! Short indeed in Time, but tedious in the Troubles that attend it! Our Reaſon does diſtinguiſh us from the reſt of the Creation in nothing more than in the pain it gives us; the brute Creatures are ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible only of the preſent Moment; but we double our Miſeries by anticipating the future, and reflecting upon the paſt: The Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Evils we ſuffer are many and real, and the happineſs we enjoy is but imaginary, or at the beſt, but a privation of Pain. So in Moral things, how weak and faint is the light of unaſſiſted Reaſon, how uncertain to direct our ſteps in the way that we ſhould walk, how unable to lead us to that Reſt and Happineſs which we ſo earneſtly deſire. The beſt Men among the Heathens allow'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in great Vices, and the moſt perfect of their Governments incourag'd ſeveral Enormities, by the very Laws of their Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; which is particularly true of the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi>: Tho' a <hi>Plutarch</hi> inform's us, The <hi>Spartan</hi> Virtue out-ſhin'd all the reſt. It is eaſy to account for this univerſal Corruption of the Gentile World, by obſerving how much at a loſs they were to Know what ſhould be the reward of their actions; the vulgar ſort were amus'd with a Poetical Fiction of <hi>Flowry</hi> Plains, and <hi>Elyſian</hi> Fields; but their moſt Exalted Sages confeſs'd it doubtful, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there was any ſuch thing as a Future State, or not. So true is the character which St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives of them, <hi>That they were
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001544_0011_0FB3A8EE90EF3480"/>
aliens from the common Wealth of Iſrael, and ſtrangers from the Covenant, having no hope, and being without God in the World: They were the Children of Wrath, and of Diſobedience, being dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> indeed were in a much better condition; and Iſrael was honour'd with the title of God's Son, even his firſt born: As it is Written, <hi>Exod</hi> iv.22.v. He was their God, and they were his People. But not to inſiſt upon the great Defects of their Law in many other points, I ſhall only mention at preſent this difference betwixt them and us. Tho' they were the Sons of God, and the Peculiar favourites of Heaven, yet they had no other expreſs Motive to Obedience than the Promiſe of an Earthly Inheritance: therefore it is that the inſpired Penmen ſo often lament the vanity of Human Life, wherein their comforts ended almoſt as ſoon as begun. That good Prince <hi>Hezekiah</hi> deſcribes this condition of Mortality in the moſt moving ſtrain. <hi>The Grave cannot Praiſe thee, Death can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Celebrate thee: They that go down into the Pit cannot hope for thy truth; the Living, the Living he ſhall Praiſe thee, as I do this day</hi>: Iſai. xxxviii.18, 19.v. But now the Goſpel has open'd a new Scene of things, and diſcover'd ſuch Myſteries as have been hid from the Foundation of the World· He that believeth in Chriſt tho' he were dead, yet ſhall he live: And whoſoever liveth and believeth in Him ſhall never dye. The Adopted Sons of God under this gracious Diſpenſation, are Heirs of the Kingdom of Heaven, and when they arrive at that happy Place, they ſhall Inherit there Immortal Glory and Eternal Joy. We muſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain no more of the calamities of this World, ſince they ſerve to quicken our Pace to a better; and Death it ſelf loſes its Terrors, as being but a ſhort Paſſage to an Endleſs Life. And that we may not miſs of the prize of the High Calling that is before us, God aſſiſt's us with the aids of his Holy Spirit, by whoſe Inſpiration the Thoughts of our Hearts are cleans'd, our Luſts ſubdu'd, and all the hindrances of our Salvation removed:

Such is God's Paternal Love and Care of us in and thro' Chriſt, That he has not given us the Spirit of bondage again to fear, but the Spirit of Adoption whereby we cry <hi>Abba Father,</hi> Rom. viii.14. Another inſtance of the Divine Goodneſs which we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy in this State of Adoption, is the Plenary Remiſſion of our Sins. The blood of Chriſt ſpeaketh better things than that of <hi>Abel,</hi> and taketh away the Sins of the World. They who ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely repent and believe the Goſpel, ſhall be Saved from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Death; God will be Merciful to their Unrighteouſneſs, and their Iniquities will he remember no more. The conſideration of theſe inexpreſſible benefits one would think ſufficient to make us perform the conditions upon which they are Promiſed, <hi>Namely,</hi> To Believe in Chriſt, by whom alone we are Juſtified and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil'd to God. But leſt there ſhould be in any of you an Evil Heart of Unbelief,</p>
            <p>I come in the <hi>Fourth</hi> Place, To repreſent the great Sinfulneſs of not Receiving Jeſus Chriſt as our Saviour. If our Duty riſes in proportion to the Means of Conviction, which are afforded us, then our guilt will be very great ſhould we deny our aſſent to the Truth of the Goſpel: for Almighty God in his Infinite Wiſdom has uſed all poſſible methods to Excite our Faith, and Engage our Obedience to Jeſus Chriſt: which will appear, if we do but conſider firſt, The Intrinſick Excellency of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, which evidently bears the ſtamp of Divinity upon it, as being agreeable to the higheſt reaſon, and advancing Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature to the greateſt Perfection it is capable of in this World; It acquaints us with the great End of our Creation, Eſtabliſhes a juſt empire over our Paſſions, and Inſtructs in the way of obtaining true Happineſs, <hi>viz.</hi> The Beatifick Viſion and Fruition of God: Nay, ſo compleat are the Doctrines of the Goſpel, That they do not only make our Lives more Divine and Rational, but likewiſe free them from a great part of the Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of this World: Were they duly obſerved, the Peace of God
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001544_0013_0FB3A8F1AEDE1F88"/>
would attend us thro' all the changes and chances of this Mortal Life, and ſafely conduct us to the Haven of Reſt and Felicity: The Wiſdom from Above which is firſt Pure, and then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, would reſtore this preſent State to it's Original Innocence and Tranquillity, and make Wars and Tumults which diſturb theſe Lower Regions to ceaſe in the Earth. In ſhort, The Chriſtian Religion does ſo infinitely exceed all others, that if there were no other argument, this alone is a ſufficient proof, that our Bleſſed Saviour was a Perſon ſent from God. But alas, This is the condemnation, that Light is come into the World, and Men love darkneſs rather than light, becauſe their deeds were evil; and therefore extraordinary Miracles were uſed to fix their belief and attention: The <hi>Jews</hi> were extremely Sottiſh in aſcribing them to the Devil, becauſe as our Saviour argu'd, they tended to the Deſtruction of Satan's Kingdom; they were moſt of them acts of Charity and Mercy towards Men, and were brought in confirmation of that holy Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which Jeſus Chriſt Publiſh'd to the World; whereby the Powers of Darkneſs were utterly ſubverted, and Mankind was reſcued from their Miſerable Slavery, and Subjection to Evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits: the Finger of God therefore was plainly viſible in thoſe Mighty Works, and they were effects of a Divine Power Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in Jeſus Chriſt. However, beſides this evidence of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles God has given us the ſure word of Prophecy to depend upon, that there might not be the leaſt pretence for Infidelity; how were the Time and Place of his Birth, the moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant actions of his Life, his bitter Death and Paſſion, and his Victory over Hell and the Grave exactly foretold many Ages before our Saviour's Incarnation; to Him bear all the Prophets Witneſs; Nay <hi>Iſaiah</hi>'s ſtile is ſo clear and particular, that it is difficult to relate the Hiſtory of paſt Tranſactions more diſtinctly than he has Propheci'd of things to come. How juſt then is that Sentence which Chriſt pronounces upon the Unbelieving
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001544_0014_0FB3A8F32105CFC8"/>
World, after his appearance among them? <hi>He that believeth not, is condemned already, becauſe he has not believed in the Name of the Only begotten Son of God.</hi> This is a very fruitful Topick, but I hope there is no need to inlarge upon it, and conſidering the Severity of the Seaſon, will conclude with a brief APPLI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CATION of what has been ſaid.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt</hi> then, Let us not neglect this Great Salvation; but let us ſincerely believe in Jeſus Chriſt, and act ſuitably to ſuch a belief. Our Duty is ſet before us in the cleareſt Light, and we have more Powerful Motives to Obedience than either <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles</hi> had; our Obligations therefore are greater, and more will be expected from us; and tho' we are Juſtified by Faith in the blood of Chriſt, yet we know, <hi>That without Holineſs no Man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi> Thus are we to receive Jeſus Chriſt here, if we expect to be receiv'd by Him here-after; for He ſolemnly declares, <hi>Not every one that ſaith unto Me, Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, but he that does the Will of my Father which is in Heaven</hi>; And, <hi>Ye are my Friends if ye do whatſoever I command you.</hi> S. Matth. vii.11.v. S. Joh. xv.14.v.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Let us ſet a juſt value upon the glorious Privilege of being made the Sons of God. As we are Heirs of Eternity, and entituled to a Kingdom that ſhall not decay, let us never do any thing unworthy of ſuch Hopes, and unbecoming ſuch a Relation; but let us walk as Children of the Light, and of the Day: and ſince Jeſus Chriſt has Sanctify'd our Nature in taking it upon Him, let us not Debaſe it with thoſe Vices which were inexcuſable even in the Heathens.</p>
            <p>But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly</hi> and <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Let us be careful to render our juſt Tribute of Praiſe and Thanksgiving for the ineffable Mercy of
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001544_0015_0FB3A8F481B5ED60"/>
God, in ſending His Own Son into the World. Our Saviour is come, and the Glory of the Lord is riſen upon us, which giveth Light to them that ſit in darkneſs, and guideth our Feet into the way of Peace. Let us therefore extol the Name of God, and ſay; <hi>Allelujah, for the Lord God Omnipotent Reigneth.</hi> Let us be glad and rejoyce, and give honour unto Him. <hi>Bleſſing, Honour, Glory and Power be unto Him that ſitteth upon the Throne, and to the Lamb for Ever and Ever.</hi>
