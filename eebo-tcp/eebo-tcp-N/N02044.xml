            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p n="2">2. THE only <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Standard</hi> of a Ministers whole Work and Duty.

That there is no <hi>Rule</hi> wanting for his Guide, no <hi>Law</hi> for his Observance, no <hi>Rubrick</hi> or <hi>Ritual</hi> for his Worship, no <hi>Foundation</hi> for his Faith or Hope; but what is there fully provided for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nor any room left for political <hi>Inventions</hi> or <hi>Institutions,</hi> in order to the full and faithful dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of his whole Trust. And this comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive <hi>Rule</hi> (as we may see in the foregoing <hi>Verse</hi>) is the SACRED SCRIPTURE<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>All Scripture is given by Inspiration of God, and is profitable,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that the Man of God may be perfect,</hi> &amp;c.— But that I may more distinctly explain the Words, I shall consider them as consisting of these two Propositions.</p>
            <p n="1">I. THAT a Gospel Minister is a <hi>Man of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. THAT the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> are every way sufficient to make him perfect in, and throughly furnish him for, the whole Work of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry.</p>
            <p>Prop. I. A Gospel Minister is a <hi>Man of God.</hi>— This dignifying Title, though most frequently given to the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Inspired Teachers,</hi> is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to the ordinary Ministers of the Gospel, in these respects.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:002428_0007_0FDB42390830B5D0"/>1. IN that they have their Mission and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission from him— They have their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission <hi>not of man, nor by men; but from Iesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Gal. l.1.</note>. And <hi>no man may take this honour to himself, but he that is called of God as was Aaron</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Heb. V.4.</note>— Though a mediate Separation to the <hi>Sacred Office,</hi> be the instituted Means to propagate the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry thro' the succeding Ages of the Church; yet the Office it self is immediately from Christ, who has <hi>ascended on high, to give gifts unto men,</hi> and continue <hi>Pastors and Teachers</hi> in his Church, <hi>till we all come in the Unity of the Faith</hi> 
               <note n="§" place="bottom">Eph. IV.10, 11, 12.</note>. <hi>And God who hath reconciled us to himself by Iesus Christ, hath given to us the Ministry of Reconciliation</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Cor. V.18.</note>.— Thus a Minister is a <hi>Man of God,</hi> by him appointed and authorized; and by him <hi>allowed to be put in trust with the Gospel.</hi> 1 Thes. II.4.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A Minister is a <hi>Man of God,</hi> in that he is engaged in the immediate Service, and employ'd in the Sacred Things of God.— He who commands the Service of innumerable Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Angels, has been pleased to dignify poor Dust and Ashes, with the Character of his Servants, and betrust them with the great Affairs of his Kingdom. That by their Ministry, (how contemptible soever in the eyes of the World) He may break down the strong holds of Sin and Satan in the Hearts of Men, rescue Sins miserable Captives, advance the Kingdom of his Grace, and erect Trophies on the ruins of Satans Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest in the World.— And as he has honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002428_0008_0FDB423A78335FF8"/>
them with this awful Trust, so has he set 'em apart to it, and sent 'em to preach in his Name the Gospel of the Kingdom, to instruct the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, to awaken the Secure, to comfort the Mourners, to detect the Self-deceivers, refute the Erroneous, discover the deceitfulness of Mens Hearts, lay open the Devices of Satan; and both by <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Discipline,</hi> earnestly pursue the rescue of Sinners from Destruction, and their Reconciliation unto God.— Thus are they <hi>Men of God,</hi> Men <hi>separated unto the Gospel of God,</hi> Rom. I.1. <hi>Labourers together with God,</hi> 1 Cor. III.9. And <hi>Ministers according to the dispensation of God, which is given to them, to fulfil the Word of God,</hi> Col. I.25. And this Appellation belongs to the Gospel Minister.</p>
            <p n="3">3. AS he represents God, and acts in his name and stead, in the discharge of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry.— Such are the riches of free Grace, and such the wonders of Divine Condescension, that injured Justice is stooping to treat with Rebels about a Reconciliation, and for that End he <hi>who is in Christ reconciling the World unto himself, has committed unto</hi> his Ministers <hi>the word of Reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Cor. V.18.</note>; and commission'd 'em in his Name, to propose the Treaty of Peace to poor Sinners; and to press upon 'em both the sweet Allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Gospel, and terrible Thunders of the Law, as powerful Incentives to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with offer'd Mercy.</p>
            <p>AND as God graciously condescends to treat with Rebels, so also to bring them into his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002428_0009_0FDB423BF6504C00"/>
and to deal with 'em as <hi>Children,</hi> and for that End has made his Ministers <hi>Rulers over his Houshold, to give every one their Portion of Meat in due season</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Luk. XII.42.</note> And has given them charge of the Affairs of his House, <hi>as Stewards of the Mysteries of God</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. IV.1.</note>— Thus then they are <hi>Men of God,</hi> as they are <hi>Ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech us by them,</hi> as they <hi>pray us in Christs stead, to be reconciled to God.</hi> 2 Cor. V.20. And as they are <hi>Stewards of the manifold Grace of God.</hi> 1 Pet. IV.10 — Thus I come to make some brief Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections upon this Proposition.</p>
            <p>AND I must first apply this Truth to you, My <hi>Reverend Fathers and Brethren,</hi> whose Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter I've now been considering. Suffer the most unworthy of your Number and Order, to stir up your <hi>pure Minds by way of Remembrance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. ARE we <hi>Men of God,</hi> this teaches us the Sacred Dignity of our Office and Character.— The Service of God is an Honour that the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est <hi>Intelligences of Heaven</hi> are ambitious of. What cause have we therefore with ravished Souls, to admire and adore that Grace of God, which dignifies such worthless Worms with the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of his <hi>Ambassadors?</hi> What cause of an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Emulation to walk worthy of so high an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; that God ben't dishonour'd, our Persons contemned, the Ordinances by us dispensed slighted and disesteemed, nor our Labours fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, by a licentious Walk, or by base sordid mean Spirits or Actions.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:002428_0010_0FDB42401E7D6F68"/>2. ARE we <hi>Men of God,</hi> this teaches us, that we must render an account of our <hi>Stewardship</hi> unto him. <hi>We watch for Souls, as these that must give an account</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. III.17.</note>. And blessed Lord! what a dreadful Account shall we have to give, if at last exposed to that Reprimand, <hi>Thou slothful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> — May the consideration of this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count always dwell in our Hearts, and invigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate our Ministerial Duties.

            <p>IF we follow the <hi>Man of GOD</hi> into his Study, what is the business of his private Meditations, but to consult the Sacred Oracles, that he may know what is <hi>the good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God?</hi> Whatever additional Helps may come into use, they are profitable only as being subservient to his clearer understandig, and better improving the Contents of this blessed Book; out of which he may be furnish'd with Addresses agreeable to every Circumstance of his Flock, and qualified to <hi>shew himself approved unto God, a Workman that need not be ashamed, rightly dividing the Word of Truth.</hi>

            <p>IF we further consider him in the Pulpit, thence addressing us in the Name of the Lord.

            </p>
            <p>AND now I come to the main thing intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to make some Improvement of this Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.</p>
            <p n="1">I. WE are hence instructed, that the <hi>Man of GOD</hi> has no Power or Authority to make any <hi>New Laws</hi> or <hi>Constitutions</hi> in the Affairs of God's House; or to make any Additions unto, or Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations of those <hi>Laws,</hi> that Christ has left us in the Divine Oracles. This being an Affair that has caused much Struggle and Debate; and that has been (as I observed before) throughout all succeeding ages of the Church, the source of innumerable Mischiefs and Confusions. I shall take liberty to be something particular upon this head, and consider what it is to make <hi>New Laws</hi>; and as I pass along, disprove our Claim to that Authority.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:002428_0015_0FDB4249839893F8"/>1. THEN the devising and imposing any PART or MODE of Worship that wants a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Institution, is a <hi>Legislature</hi> that we have no just claim to.— There are indeed several circumstantial Appendages to the Worship of God, such as <hi>Time, Place,</hi> &amp;c. that are not, nor is it possible they should be, particularly provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for in the Word of God. <hi>Wisdom is therefore profitable to direct,</hi> and determine these things, conformable to those general <hi>Rules,</hi> that require all things to be done <hi>to Edification, Decently and in Order.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT then to Institute any new PART of Worship, or to bring any thing into Gods im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Service, not expresly instituted by Christ, is a bold Invasion of his Royalty, who is <hi>Head over all things to his Church</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Eph. I.22.</note>; and whose Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative it is, to give <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Ordinances</hi> to his House. And no pretence of Innocency, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency, or the like, will legitimate our thus <hi>setting our Thresholds by Gods Thresholds, and our Posts by his Posts</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Ezek. XLIII.8.</note>. What more Innocent, what more Indifferent, than the cleanly Ceremony of <hi>washing Hands before Meat?</hi> Yet when Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on comes to be placed in it, and it's made a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of the Sanhedrim, <hi>Gods Commandment is transgressed by this Tradition.</hi> Mat. XV.3.</p>
            <p>AND no less faulty is the Invention, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of any Unscriptural MODE of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. For God has shewn us <hi>the form of his House, and the fashion thereof, and the goings out thereof, and the comings in thereof, and all the forms thereof, and
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002428_0016_0FDB424B07D28C58"/>
all the Ordinances thereof</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Ezek. XLIII.11.</note>. That Gods Worship wants not to be deckt with Ornaments of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Invention, nor the gaity of uninstituted Rites, to render it pleasing and beautiful in his Eyes: But on the contrary, is it not haughty Arrogance for vile Dust to suppose, he can wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship God in a way more <hi>decent</hi> and <hi>orderly,</hi> than he himself has contrived? And is it not an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming Christs Prerogative, to enjoin as Terms of Communion, any <hi>Modes of Worship,</hi> that he neither requires nor warrants?— In what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever guizes or disguizes this impleaded Practice may appear, with whatever specious Pretences it may be palliated; let it appear with the hoary head of Antiquity, with the Authority of never such great Men or Churches, or with never such a shew of Religion or Devotion; it will come under the same Condemnation with <hi>Ieroboam</hi>'s Feast, <hi>that it is devised of our own Hearts</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">1 King. XII.33.</note>. And I can't see, but that the most plausible Arguments by which this can be patronized, may be urged with as fair a shew in justification of <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi>; of <hi>Uzzah,</hi> or <hi>Ahaz</hi>'s <hi>Damascene Altar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. THE forming and imposing any New Acts or Constitutions, in the Government or Discipline of the Church, I take to be an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable <hi>Legislature.</hi>— That I may clear this somthing particularly, I shall premise these three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THAT Christ has appointed a <hi>Government</hi> or <hi>Discipline</hi> in his Church. Christ has not left
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002428_0017_0FDB424C77D68288"/>
his Church to be a Garden without Enclosure, a City without Walls, or a Vineyard without a Hedge; nor has he left his Disciples to be <hi>Lambs in a large place,</hi> an ungovern'd <hi>Mobile</hi>; that (as when there was no King in Israel) <hi>every one should do what is good in his own eyes,</hi> take his swing in sinful and licentious Courses; to the scandal of Religion, profanation of sacred Ordinances, and destruction of his own Soul.— But that Offenders may be reduced, rotten Members cut off, Scandal restrain'd, and the Church edified; Christ has constituted an Ecclesiastical Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and for that end appointed his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Officers, Laws, Ordinances, and Censures. The Necessity of which is manifest, from the Constitution of the Church, which consists of <hi>barren,</hi> and <hi>fruitful</hi> Branches; of Sound and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound; Tares and Wheat; Sheep and Goats; and must therefore quickly become a <hi>Babel,</hi> if without <hi>Discipline.</hi> The truth of which is also abundantly evident from many places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, particularly from <hi>Mat.</hi> XVIII. from 15 to 20 <hi>Verse, Tit.</hi> III.10. and I.13. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> II.6. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> V.20. <hi>cum multis aliis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I don't now design a Dispute upon the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Modes of Church-Government; but will venture to say with due deferrence and respect to those otherwise minded, that the <hi>Presbyterian Government</hi> appears to me the most conformed to the <hi>Laws of Christ,</hi> of any whatsoever; and does, for ought I know, as exactly quadrate with the Rule, as may be hoped for in this state of Imperfection.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:002428_0018_0FDB42513030A798"/>But I go on to premise,</p>
            <p n="2">2. THAT there are some External Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of <hi>Discipline,</hi> that are not set down pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely, or expresly provided for in the <hi>Word of God</hi>; but are left to the prudent Conduct of Church Governours. To exemplify this, we in these Parts manage the Discipline of the Church in <hi>Sessions, Presbyteries,</hi> and <hi>Synods</hi>; and have doubtless the Divine Warrant for our so doing. In order to this, there must be Time and Place appointed for such Conventions, and some Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Method for carrying on our Consultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons decently, and without Confusion: And in this case there being only general Rules left us in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> it necessarily belongs to us to consult and agree upon such Methods, as may best subserve the great Ends of Discipline, the Glory of God, and the Churches Weal.— The <hi>Synod</hi> at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> mention'd <hi>Acts</hi> XV. does in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed give us considerable Light, even in this case; but leaves many necessary Circumstances to be provided for, by Humane Wisdom and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. But then,</p>
            <p n="3">3. ALL the Substantials of Government are left upon Record in the Word of God, and are unalterable by any Humane Authority.— As Christ is sole <hi>King</hi> &amp; <hi>Legislator</hi> to his Church, it is an incommunicable Jewel in his Crown, to give all the <hi>Laws</hi> and all the <hi>Ordinances</hi> thereof; and it would therefore be an egregious Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction on his Faithfulness, to suppose any Case that can possibly occur unprovided for. It is a worthy saying of a venerable Synod <note n="*" place="bottom">Vindication of Presbyterial Government, p. 4.</note>,
<q>Christ
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002428_0019_0FDB425282509EF0"/>
as a King now sits at Gods right Hand, and is made <hi>head over all things to his Church,</hi> which Church is called the House of God, and who should appoint Orders for the Government of the House, but the Lord of the House? And to say that he hath not ordain'd how his House should be govern'd, i<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to make the <hi>Master less faithful in his own House,</hi> than his <hi>Servant Moses</hi> was.</q>
— These things premis'd, I reassume the Proposition, <hi>That it is an unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable Legislature, to make any Acts or Constitutions for the Substantials of Church-Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is an excellent Saying of the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor,</hi> worthy to be printed in Letters of Gold, and transmitted to latest Posterity <note n="*" place="bottom">Sermon before the King, <hi>March</hi> 31. 1717.</note>.
<q>And in this Sense therefore, his (Christs) Kingdom is not of this World, that he has in those Points left behind him no Visible Humane Authority, no Vicegerent that can be said properly to supply his place, no <hi>Interpreters</hi> upon whom his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are absolutely to depend, no Judges over the Consciences and Religion of his People. For if this were so, that any such absolute Vicegerent Authority, either for the making <hi>New Laws,</hi> or <hi>Interpreting</hi> old ones, or judging his Subjects in Religious Matters, were lodged in any Man upon Earth; the Consequence would be, that what still retains the Name of the <hi>Church of Christ,</hi> would not be the <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi>; but the Kingdom of those Men vested with such Authority.</q>
— The truth of this will appear most manifest if we consider,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:002428_0020_0FDB4254515D34A8"/>THAT whatever Acts or Constitution, can be devised, must be such as Christ has already made, or such as he has not made. There is no place for making Acts already made; and it's a daring Usurpation of Christs Throne, and rush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Pikes of that terrible Threatning, <hi>Rev.</hi> XXII.18. to make new ones that he has not instituted. Again,</p>
            <p>WE can make no Constitutions, but what must be either binding and obligatory, or not. If not, such chimerical Acts can be of no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther use, than as a subject of Debate, and bone of Contention. If binding, we exercise a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Dominion and Authority, and make our selves <hi>Lords over Gods Heritage,</hi> contrary to our Lords express Command, <hi>Mat.</hi> XX.25, 26. and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> V.3. Moreover,</p>
            <p>IF we make any Laws for the Discipline of the Church, they must be made either by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority derived from Christ, or by our own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. I'm sure it's imperious enough to claim such an Authority of our own, and I challenge the World to produce any such <hi>Dedimus potestatem</hi> from Christ, or the least lisp in the Bible that countenances such a Regal Power. I add,</p>
            <p>WHATEVER Constitutions can be formed for Church-Government, must be either of a Religious Nature, or meerly Humane Politicks and Prudentials. Now it's a ruled Case, that <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Religion is of Divine Original,</hi> and we have no Authority to put the Stamp of Religion upon the most innocent and indifferent thing in the World, as I have already proved from <hi>Mat.</hi> XV. And as for meerly <hi>Humane Politicks,</hi> the horrible
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:002428_0021_0FDB425581D7E4B0"/>
Confusion they have already brought upon the Church, would make 'em appear with but a very indifferent Aspect, in the eyes of all serious and thinking Persons, if we had not been forbid to <hi>set our Thresholds by Gods, and our Posts by his.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THESE, among the many Reasons that might be assign'd, make it appear, that no Pretence whatsoever can justify this usurped Power.</p>
            <p>IF never so many, and never so famous Churches have set us this Copy, we may not write after it.</p>
            <p>COULD we make Acts never so innocent in themselves, and never so agreeable to the State and Circumstances of our Churches, the <hi>Law-making Faculty</hi> would still be an Usurpation.</p>
            <p>LET us make never so many Pretences to found such Constitutions upon the Word of God, all the Churches in the World may put in the same Plea, and even the <hi>Papal Hierarchy</hi> and the <hi>Canons of Trent,</hi> pretend to the same Foundation, and have as much claim to this <hi>Legislative Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> from such Pretences, as we can have; that is, none at all.</p>
            <p>But I'le hasten forward, and consider,</p>
            <p n="3">3. THAT any authoritative obligatory <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation</hi> of the Laws of Christ, is a <hi>Law-making Faculty</hi> that we are not entitled to.— It's true the Ministers of Christ have Commission to <hi>Interpret</hi> his Laws, and it concerns them with utmost application to study his Mind and Will, that they may declare his whole Counsel to his People. But then these having no claim to <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility,</hi> can have no Authority to impose their <hi>Interpretations</hi>; nor is any Man absolutely obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:002428_0022_0FDB42594E450F98"/>
to receive them, any farther than they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to him just and true. The Reasons of this are obvious.</p>
            <p>WHATEVER Subjection is either required or performed unto such <hi>Interpretations,</hi> must be in obedience either to God or Man. Obedience to God it cannot be, when our Consciences (whether Regular or Erring, it's the same thing) tell us, that God requires no such thing at our hands. And if we owe any Obedience to Man in this case, it must be because he has an <hi>absolute legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Power,</hi> and is <hi>Lord over our Consciences.</hi> But <hi>who is he that judgeth another Mans Servant</hi>? since <hi>to his own Master he must stand or fall</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. XIV.4.</note>. Besides,</p>
            <p>THIS Power to impose <hi>Interpretations</hi> of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, must necessarily blend Light and Darkness, Truth and Falshood together; oblige us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve greatest Contradictions, and build our hope of Salvation upon the most contrary Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.—</p>
            <p>To exemplify this.</p>
            <p>THERE are some that <hi>Interpret</hi> the Scriptures in a <hi>Popish,</hi> some in a <hi>Protestant</hi> Sence; some in an <hi>Arminian,</hi> some in a <hi>Calvinist</hi> Sence; some (to instance no more) in an <hi>Arian</hi> or <hi>Socinian,</hi> and blessed be God, the most in a contrary Sence; and all these have an equal claim to impose their <hi>Interpretations.</hi> And must we believe them all? Must we believe that we are justified by Works <hi>ex condigno,</hi> and yet that we are <hi>justified by Faith alone, without the Works of the Law?</hi> Must we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Decrees of God Absolute, and yet Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional?
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:002428_0023_0FDB131A429577F0"/>
That our blessed Saviour is a meer Creature, and yet that he is essentially God, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal, and coeval with the Father? and a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred more like Contradictions, that may be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected out of the <hi>Interpretations</hi> of Scripture, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong these different Sects.</p>
            <p>IF we consider this with relation to Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, the Consequence is the same.— The Keys of Discipline belong to the <hi>Pope,</hi> say the <hi>Romans</hi>; To the <hi>Patriarch of Constantinople,</hi> say the <hi>Greek Churches</hi>; To <hi>Prelates,</hi> say the <hi>English Church</hi>; To Presbyters, say most other <hi>Reformed Churches</hi>; To the <hi>Community</hi> in conjunction with the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,</hi> say our <hi>Congregational Brethren.</hi> And which of these must we believe? I answer, none of 'em all. For though we agree in Principle with some of these, it is because we esteem their <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations</hi> just, and agreeable to the Mind of Christ; and so its Christs Authority, &amp; not theirs, that we found our Faith upon.</p>
            <p>THERE are two plausible Objections lie in our way, which I shall therefore endeavour to obviate.</p>
            <p>IT may be objected, How can Ministers be said to represent Christ, to preach in his Name, and by his Authority; and yet their Hearers not be obliged to receive their Doctrine; but at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to follow their several Sentiments, and (of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes) erring and misguided Consciences? But the Answer is easy.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Ministers of Christ</hi> do come to us in his Name, and by his Authority, when they preach nothing but what is contain'd in his Word, and we are under indispensible Obligation to receive
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:002428_0024_0FDB425E649D2F28"/>
the manifest <hi>Truths</hi> of God by them preached, <hi>not as the Word of Man, but as (it is in truth) the Word of God</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Thes. II.13.</note>. But they have no Commission to teach us to observe any thing, but <hi>what Christ has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">See Mat. XXVIII.20.</note>. And when they teach any other Doctrine, they come in their own Names, and not in Christs.— So then, we are to esteem them as <hi>Christs Ambassadors,</hi> and with awful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to attend their preaching, <hi>as if Christ was speaking to us by them,</hi> when we are convinced that they declare the <hi>Counsel of God</hi>: But are not bound to an implicite Faith, against contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Convictions. It concerns them therefore, to justify their <hi>Interpretations</hi> of Gods Word, by clear Scripture Evidence, to the Conviction of their Hearers; and thereby lay 'em under Obligations to Observance and Obedience.</p>
            <p>IT may be further <hi>objected,</hi> That this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine will destroy all Discipline. For if we have no power to impose our <hi>Interpretations</hi> of Christs Laws, neither have we Authority to impose a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Censures,</hi> founded upon such Interpretations. To which I answer:</p>
            <p>THERE can be but two Cases in which Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures should be administred, the one is <hi>Scandal,</hi> the other <hi>Heresy.</hi> And I can't see any imposition of our <hi>Interpretations,</hi> by Regular Discipline, in either of these.</p>
            <p>IT is but what the Light of Nature teaches, and all the different Sects of Christians are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed in, that evident and notorious <hi>Scandal,</hi> unqualifies Men for Salvation. For us therefore
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:002428_0025_0FDB4260D4434950"/>
to declare that <hi>the Unrighteeus shall not inherit the Kingdom of God</hi> , That wicked and profligate Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are unmeet for the Kingdom of his Grace or Glory; or to seclude such Criminals our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Fellowship, (which is, for ought I know, the highest Church-Censure) gives no handle of Complaint, nor is any imposition upon Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, unless Conscience be made an Umbrage for Licentiousness and Impiety. We impose no <hi>Interpretation</hi> upon the Delinquent, by barring him our Communion, for Obstinacy in notorious Impiety.</p>
            <p>AND as for <hi>Hereticks</hi> the Rule is plain,— <hi>Tit.</hi> III.10. being Obstinate, they are to be <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.</hi> And what imposition upon their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences can this imply?— Tho' we have no right to impose our <hi>Opinions</hi> and <hi>Interpretations</hi> upon them, we have an undisputed claim to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject theirs, and even to judge 'em Impious and Wicked, (when they are so) such as render the Heretick unfit for Communion in Sealing Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances.</p>
            <p>But to make this Case, if possible, a little plainer:</p>
            <p>THOUGH some plain and comprehensive Creed or Confession of Faith (for distinguishing such as receive, from those who reject <hi>the Faith once delivered to the Saints</hi>) may be useful and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, since the worst of Heresies may take shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter under the express Words of Scripture. Yet we are by no means to force these <hi>credenda,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any of differing Sentiments.</p>
            <p>WE may not so much as shut out of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, any such Dissenters, as we can charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:002428_0026_0FDB42625102D7D8"/>
hope Christ won't shut out of Heaven: But should open the <hi>Doors of the Church</hi> as wide, as Christ opens the <hi>Gates of Heaven</hi>; and <hi>receive one another, as Christ also received us, to the Glory of God</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. XV.7.</note>.</p>
            <p>AND tho' we ought to reject both the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy, and the Communion of those, who deny what we esteem the Fundamental Truths of our holy Religion; yet even these essential Articles of Christianity, may not be imposed by Civil Coercions, temporal Penalties, or any other way whatsoever.</p>
            <p>THESE things having been thus distinctly considered, I'le give you the sum of what has been said under this <hi>Inference,</hi> in the Words of Monsieur <hi>De la Pilloniere</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Answer to Dr. <hi>Surpe's</hi> Accusation. p. 66</note>
               <q>If you mean by that KINGLY Word NEW Laws, no more than outward REGULATIONS in matters indifferent, about appointing for your selves &amp; those who agree with you, Time, Place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of <hi>Publick Worship,</hi> and other like things, which may conduce to ORDER and DECENCY; I confess thus far <hi>it is no invasion of Christs Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Power.</hi> But if by the power of making NEW LAWS, you pretend to a power of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the least tittle to the FAITH <hi>that was once delivered to the Saints,</hi> or of encroaching by way of INTERPRETATION, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, upon that Freedom with which our Redeemer has made us <hi>Free</hi>; then you arrogate to your selves more than the Apostles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves did, and instead of his <hi>Messengers</hi> &amp; SER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VANTS, you become in part, the Usurpers of
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:002428_0027_0FDB4265F93EA9C0"/>
his <hi>Throne,</hi> and the LORDS of his People.</q>
But I hasten to a Conclusion, and shall add but this Reflection more.</p>
            <p n="2">II. WE are hence instructed, how great are our Obligations to adore and praise the Grace of God, in committing unto us his blessed Oracles, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are contain'd every thing necessary for our Salvation.— A Privilege by which we are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish'd from many of our Fellow-Creatures, who <hi>sit in darkness and see no light</hi>; and are under a necessity to perish for lack of Vision, while we are under the happy Influences of the Meridian Sun of the Gospel. God therefore justly expects from us, that we have lasting Impressions of his Goodness upon our Hearts, and that our grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Reflections thereon, actuate us to a careful Acquaintance with, and diligent Observance of his Will revealed in his Word. He expects that we revere his <hi>Threatnings,</hi> and thereby take war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to flee from the Wrath to come; that we obey his <hi>Precepts,</hi> and study a conformity to his blessed Laws; and that we comply with his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitations, and embrace a tendred Saviour upon his own Terms.— And O! that we might be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently alarum'd with the dreadful Prospect of having this precious Privilege, by our Unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness for, and Misimprovement of it, rise up in Judgment against us, and render our state more intolerable, than that of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> in the Day of Judgment, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Threatning, <hi>Mat.</hi> XI.23, 24. For <hi>how shall we escape, if we neglect so great Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi>?</p>
