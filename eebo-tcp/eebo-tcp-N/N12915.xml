            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>EARLY on Tueſday morning, the 17th inſtant, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived intelligence of eleven men deſerting to the enemy, three of whom were intercepted by parties diſpoſed for that purpoſe, and between two and three o'clock P. M. that day, I was informed that the remaining eight were concealed by a quaker, about ſeven miles from this place, up the Brandywine, before which, I had detached ſeven horſe and two parties of foot on each ſide the Brandywine to intercept them, and a party of nine horſe, detached with a party of foot, to remove, and if neceſſary to deſtroy the forage below Newcaſtle and Port-Penn, left me deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of a ſingle light horſe fit for duty, the towns-men having removed their horſes into the country upon our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving here; it was therefore out of the power of the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-maſter to procure horſes for this purpoſe, which reduced me to the diſagreeable neceſſity of ordering one horſe from each officer in the diviſion who kept two or more, which I judged ſupernumerary, and that the public had a right to their ſervice upon ſuch an emergency, though I firſt ſent captain Brown to apply to the colonels for a horſe a piece, and informed, there was no other probable method of mounting a party and effecting the purpoſe, which required the greateſt diſpatch; through miſtake captain Brown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed colonel Hall, he had my orders to take one of his

horſes for this purpoſe, which I at firſt did not direct or intend, only in caſe of refuſal, otherways ſhould have (in the firſt inſtance) iſſued an order to that purport; colonel Hall refuſed his horſe, which induced me to iſſue the encloſed order <note n="*" place="bottom">

<pb n="6" facs="unknown:016334_0006_0F9C26B704C16458"/>
other officers were, there appeared a conſiderable agitation, occaſioned, as he then learned, by ſome perſon having given information, that ſeveral deſerters, who had left the garriſon the night before, were concealed in a country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's houſe, about ſeven miles from town; whereupon the general gave orders, that they ſhould go and ſeize horſes wherever they could find them, his, or any other officers they could get, to mount a party to endeavour to apprehend the deſerters; ſoon after ſome perſon came back and reported to the general, that colonel Hall refuſed to let his horſe go, the general then gave peremptory orders that they ſhould go and take a horſe from any officer who had more than one; after a while a perſon returned to the general, and told him, that colonel Hall abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, and threatened to blow out the brains of any perſon who would come to take a horſe from him; the general then ſent an officer, lieutenant M‘Pherſon, at the head of a party under arms, and ordered him to bring a horſe from colonel Hall at all events.</p>
            <p>Doctor Montgomery being queſtioned by colonel Hall, whether the general's order, with regard to his own horſes, were confined to one, or extended to them all, anſwers, he thinks it was confined to one. The doctor being far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aſked, how many horſes the general had in his ſtables or paſture, anſwers, he thinks three, excluſive of the bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade major's and the doctor's own, which was then lame with the ſcratches. Colonel Hall further aſked the doctor, whether Mrs Marſhall, at whoſe houſe the general lodges, had any horſes, who anſwers, ſhe kept one all winter, but whether he was then in town or not he could not tell.</p>
            <p>Captain Brown, of the artillery, was next produced at an evidence, who upon oath declares, That a few days ago, upon his informing general Smallwood that ſeven of his company, and one of the ſecond regiment, who had deſerted the night before, were concealed about ſeven miles out of town, he directed him to collect a number of officers to go after the deſerters, and alſo to get horſes, to
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:016334_0007_0F9C26B7C3A02578"/>
take one of his firſt, and then go to the other officers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning with the colonels commandant, for others; that he thereupon went to colonel J. Carvil Hall, and told him that the general had ſent him there to take one of his horſes to go after ſome deſerters he had heard of, that the general had given one of his own, and had ordered him to go to the other officers, beginning with the colonels com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandant, for others.</p>
            <p>Colonel Hall then anſwered, he did not know any right the general had to order or take his horſes, he might diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of his own as he pleaſed, but that he ſhould not have his, and he would not let them go. Colonel Hall then aſked captain Brown, if he did not tell him at the ſame time, that the general had a right to command him and his ſervices, but he had no authority over his horſes, they were his private property; he anſwered yes, he ſpoke words to that effect.</p>
            <p>Lieutenant Brown, of the light horſe, upon oath ſaith, that he was with captain Brown when he told the general about his deſerters, upon which the general aſked him (lieutenant Brown) if he had any horſe to ſpare to go after them, that he anſwered he had not, that they were all upon duty who were fit to do duty.</p>
            <p>Colonel Sheriff, quarter-maſter to the diviſion, was next ſworn, who ſaith, That general Smallwood, on Tueſday laſt, ſent him the following order, viz. Ordered, that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel Sheriff impreſs one horſe from each officer in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion who keeps two or more. That upon his receiving the order, he immediately endorſed it as follows, viz. Sir, 'tis the general's expreſs orders to begin with the colonels of the regiments, and act as within ordered; which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorſement he directed to Mr. Edmondſon, a waggon-maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter belonging to the diviſion.</p>
            <p>Colonel Sheriff was then aſked, whether he thinks horſes could not have been got ſufficient for the party, without taking the officers horſes; anſwers, he thinks they could not have been got in leſs than two hours.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:016334_0008_0F9C26B90D605100"/>Mr. Edmondſon, brigade waggon-maſter, was next ſworn, who ſaith, That colonel Sheriff delivered him the orders above recited, which he ſhewed to colonel Hall, that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel Hall told him he ſhould have none of his, upon which he returned to colonel Sheriff, and colonel Sheriff directed him to inform the general of what had paſſed; the general then ordered him to return to colonel Hall, and tell him, if he did not let his horſe come, that he, this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent, ſhould take a party and bring one down; he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed colonel Hall of this order, to which colonel Hall replied, that he or any other perſon who ſhould head the party, he would put a bullet through; that he then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the general, and informed him what colonel Hall had ſaid.</p>
            <p>Lieutenant M‘Pherſon being duly ſworn, declareth, That on Tueſday laſt general Smallwood ſent for him, and upon his coming to his quarters, the general met him in the paſſage, and ordered him to go and fetch his guard, upon which he went to the back yard, where he found the guard parading, and brought them to the front door, and then went in to the general and told him the guard was ready, whereupon he ſat down and wrote the following orders, viz. Sir, You are ordered with the guard immediately to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed and impreſs one of colonel Hall's horſes, and bring him here without delay, as there are ſome deſerters, if diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch is uſed, may be taken. Herein fail not, and this ſhall be your juſtification.</p>
            <p>After receiving the order, he went at the head of the guard to colonel Hall's quarters, where upon enquiry, he found the colonel was rode out, upon which he went to the colonel's ſtables, and looking in at the window he ſaw a horſe ſaddled, which the forage-maſter (who was alſo ſent by the general) ſaid was the colonel's horſe; this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent then ordered the guard to break open the door, which was locked, but upon their entering they found it was not colonel Hall's horſe, though immediately after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards colonel Hall's horſe came running up to the ſtable

door, having a ſaddle on but no bridle, the deponent then cauſed the ſoldiers to catch the horſe, and they returned with the horſe under guard to the general.</p>
            <p>The following evidences were then called upon by colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel Carvil Hall, viz.</p>
            <p>Captain Steward, of the artillery, being ſworn, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth, That he was at colonel Hall's quarters when cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Brown came for his horſe, and that he underſtood his application to be founded upon an abſolute order to take the colonel's horſe; that the colonel refuſed to let him have his horſe, ſaying, that the general might command his ſervices, but his horſe he had no right to, he was his private property, and ſome time afterwards, (this depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent thinks after captain Brown went away) colonel Hall told him, and ſome others that were preſent, that he had already lent his horſe.</p>
            <p>Lieutenant Hoops was next called upon, who upon oath declareth, That a few days ago, upon hearing that ſome deſerters were concealed a little way out of town, and that the general wanted a party of officers to go after them, he went to colonel Hall's quarters with an intention of bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing a horſe from his paymaſter, and finding the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter not at home, he mentioned his buſineſs to the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, who told him to ſend to the ſtable and get his horſe for that purpoſe; he ſent accordingly and got the horſe and carried him off, and having hitched him to a poſt until the party would be ready, ſometime afterwards he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the horſe was at the general's, where he went and requeſted he might ride him, which the general, after ſome heſitation, agreed to. Lieut. Hoops was aſked by the court, whether or no he had borrowed the horſe before the general had ſent for him? Anſwered, he did not know.</p>

            <p>Queſt. 2d. Does Mr. Montgomery recollect that I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed my doubts that horſes could not be got unleſs the officers horſes were taken, and therefore ordered captain Brown to take one of mine, and apply to the other officers for theirs, as the only probable method of mounting the party? Anſwers yes.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 3d. Does Mr. Montgomery recollect the ſtate which my horſes were in, and his, and whether any of them were fit for the expedition, but the one I ordered? Anſwers, he thinks none were fit but the one.</p>
            <p>Captain Brown was next called upon and queſtioned by the general. Does captain Brown recollect that I expreſſed my doubts of obtaining horſes ſo ſpeedily as might be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, unleſs the officers horſes were taken, and that I directed him to take one of mine, and apply to the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels for one a piece, and to the other officers for their horſes, which muſt be preſſed, as there was no probable way of getting horſes otherways ſo ſpeedily as it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary? Anſwers, yes, I remember it well.</p>
            <p>Queſt. How long does captain Brown think colonel Hall's refuſing his horſe delayed the party, and at what o'clock does he think he made the application? Anſwers, he thinks he made the application between two and three o'clock, and that his refuſal delayed the party better than an hour.</p>
            <p>Colonel Hall then aſked captain Brown, whether he thinks his horſe was indiſpenſably neceſſary for the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that party? Anſwers, he thinks he was.</p>

            <p>Queſt. 3d. Colonel Hall then aſked captain Brown, whether he viewed his horſe as a talis-man. or whether there was any particular virtue in the number twelve? An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:016334_0011_0F9C26BAC5593B70"/>
he did not think there was any particular virtue in the number twelve, but thinks three or four more would have been neceſſary.</p>
            <p>The general then aſked captain Brown, whether or no ſeveral officers were not waiting who could not go for want of horſes? Anſwers, there were three or four who did not go for want of horſes</p>
            <p>Colonel Sheriff was then aſked by the general, does co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel Sheriff apprehend he could have got fifteen or ſixteen horſes in the town in the courſe of that afternoon, without taking the officers horſes agreeable to the order given him by the general? Anſwers, he thinks they could not have been got.</p>

               <head>Colonel HALL'S DEFENCE.</head>
               <p>THE firſt part of the charge is diſobeying a general order, I deny that any general order was ever delivered me; it is true captain Brown came to me and told me the general had ſent him to take one of my horſes. I viewed his calling upon me before he went to my ſtable and took my horſe, which from his orders, if legal, he had a right to do, a piece of politeneſs. I confeſs ſo extraordinary a mandate hurt my feelings, and I forbid him. The ſecond order, which was in writing, was brought by a waggon-maſter, and was by no means addreſſed to me, and which he alſo might have executed without ever calling upon me. The third and laſt order was ſimilar to the other two, and which the officer put in execution by breaking open my ſtable door, without ever ſeeing me, as the others might have done theirs. If the court are of opinion that any of theſe were orders, for the breach of which an officer can be puniſhed, I muſt confeſs hitherto I have been igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant what an order means. But ſuppoſe the order was to me, I was not bound to obey it, it was unmilitary, and a precedent of the moſt dangerous conſequence. Military authors of the firſt reputation agree, that the moſt ready and <hi>implicit</hi> obedience is due to every military order or command reſpecting duty, but at the ſame time poſitively
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:016334_0012_0F9C26BB83AEF670"/>
deny the right, and ſtrictly forbid the <hi>exertion</hi> of power to interfere in private property. The general might have prohibited me from drawing forage for my horſe, he might have forbid my keeping a horſe in the garriſon, I mean as commander of the poſt, but ſo long as I was permitted to keep a horſe, he was my own private property to every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and meaning, as fully as my coat, my ſhirt, or any thing elſe in my trunk, and as I have two coats, he might by the ſame rule of right, i. e. power, have ordered my trunk to be broke open, and one of them delivered to ſome naked ſoldier who could not do duty for the want of one. If I am not very much miſtaken, I remember to have ſeen an order of his Excellency's, expreſsly confining the power of impreſſing horſes to the quarter-maſter-general, or his deputy, who may deſcend deputiſing till it comes to the deputy waggon-maſter's deputy's ſervant, who ſhall have a right, if this precedent is eſtabliſhed, to diſmount any general, except the commander in chief, who may be ſo unlucky as to give him offence; for if the quarter-maſter had an authority to impreſs an officer's horſe at all, he had it independent of general Smallwood, who by the above order appears to be excluded that right—if then the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-maſter's right to impreſs officers horſes cannot be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted with any degree of conſiſtency, and the general ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was inveſted with that right. I know not on what mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary principle he can juſtify his ordering the quarter-maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to impreſs my horſe, and much leſs his aiding him with an armed force to break open my door. The very idea of military force in ſuch caſes is a denial of the right, it ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes an urgent neceſſity, requiring the immediate exertion of power to deprive an <hi>individual</hi> of his right for the greater good of the who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, becauſe, if every one is obliged by law to furniſh the general with a horſe on demand, he has no need of an armed force, as they are puniſhable by the civil law for a refuſal. The diſtinction in a civil and miliary view will not hold here, for when I entered the ſervice of my country, by no act of mine did I ſubject my
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:016334_0013_0F9C26BC43AE42C0"/>
private property to the diſpoſal of my commanding officer. It follows then, if the general had no <hi>right</hi> to take my horſe, I had a right to refuſe him, ſo that admitting that the order was to me, I was not obliged to obey it, and conſequently am unjuſtly arreſted; but as the laſt charge, however illy grounded, may carry a ſmall degree of crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality in the opinion of ſome of the members, I muſt beg their indulgence a little longer, while I make a few obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations on that head. I acknowledged above I oppoſed the execution of the general's <hi>pointed</hi> orders to take my horſe, but I could not diſobey them, they were not direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me, and rouſed by the arbitrary and illegal ſtretch of power, I did, upon the ſame principles that induced me firſt to take up arms in defence of the rights of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, threaten to defend it at the expence of the invader's life, but on the firſt moment's cool reflection gave up the reſolution, becauſe the illegality of the proceedings might be determined at much leſs expence than the life of a man, who, perhaps, thought he was in the execution of his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. I had lent one horſe to lieutenant Hoops to go upon the expedition far which he was demanded, and purpoſely to avoid the execution of my threat, mounted the other ſomewhat earlier than neceſſary, to train the regiment. Upon the whole, if the court finds me not guilty of a breach of order, or that thoſe orders were illegal, I ſhall readily reſt the juſtification of my conduct in the third charge, on an appeal to their own breaſts, and to every one whoſe feeling renders him worthy a commiſſion in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of a cauſe the moſt virtuous that ever men were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in.</p>
               <p>What inducement can any here preſent have to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing the eaſe and indulgence of retirement to the dangers and hardſhips of war?

               <p>AS I was not privy to, or favoured with a copy of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel Hall's defence to the court, till after the ſentence
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:016334_0015_0F9C26BDC4579A50"/>
was handed in to me, in juſtice therefore to myſelf I am bound to make the following remarks, as I think ſeveral parts of his defence exceptionable and unjuſt.</p>
               <p>Colonel Hall has taken great pains to juſtify his conduct to the court-martial, and has made uſe of a number of ſpecious arguments for that purpoſe, wherein it may be obſerved, that all his reaſonings are more properly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to the paſſions than to the juſtice and judgment of thoſe gentlemen who compoſed the court: truth and rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude need no gloſs to recommend themſelves to the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did mind, and notwithſtanding ſuch ſplendid argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the caſe in hand illuſtrates itſelf, and reſts entirely upon its own merits, as ſet forth in the evidence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</p>
               <p>That colonel Hall diſobeyed my orders, is a fact that the colonel himſelf does not controvert; that his compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with them would have aided the ſervice, is as noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; but whether thoſe orders were in themſelves unmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary, or iſſued in an unmilitary way, it certainly was not the buſineſs of a good officer to oppoſe their operation. As colonel Hall ſeems to be converſant with military au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, he will find ſeveral who pronounce, that officers have not even a right to declare a general order, which has a tendency to promote the ſervice, though iſſued out of the common line, illegal or oppreſſive, till ſuch order has been carried into execution, and its effects make it appear to be ſo. If general orders of this nature are to be oppoſed in one inſtance, they may in a thouſand, and from ſuch a precedent the conſequence might be, that an officer in time of action might refuſe to obey the orders of his commanding officer at the head of a line of battle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the orders were not conſonant with his opinion, and that they were unmilitary, or iſſued in an unmilitary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Such a diſpoſition for cavilling might be admiſſible at the bar of a county court, but can have no tendency to promote the ſervice, or create a good officer. If the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in chief had iſſued orders upon a ſimilar emergency,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:016334_0016_0F9C26BE84162480"/>
directing the quarter-maſter-general to impreſs one horſe from each officer in the line, who had from two to ſix, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to their reſpective rank and limitation, not to mention ſupernumeraries, and any officer had refuſed to let the quarter-maſter-general put that order in execution, I ſhould judge and pronounce him guilty of a breach of a general order, though the order was not particularly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to him.</p>
               <p>Every order given out by a commanding officer, which in its operation is general, and calculated to aid the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, is and ought to be obeyed as a general order, and will be reſpected as ſuch by every good officer, who would make a point of ſacrificing his private views to the good of his country.</p>
               <p>Horſes were to be impreſſed from ſuch officers, who had more than one, as they could no otherways be had; no officer was pointed out by name, and conſequently the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der could not be particularly directed to any one; they who were p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſſeſſed of more than one, came within the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and deſcription of this order; colonel Hall among others was affected by it; but he tells us he will not obey the order; 'tis <hi>unmilitary,</hi> 'tis <hi>a bad precedent,</hi> 'tis <hi>tyranny,</hi> 'tis <hi>deſpotiſm.</hi> But if colonel Hall will again peruſe his <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary authors</hi> of the firſt reputation, he will there find (I flatter myſelf) no law, rule or cuſtom, authoriſing officers to diſpute or diſobey the commands of their ſuperior of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, though they ſhould appear inconſiſtent. Moſt authors tell us, orders are firſt to be obeyed, and then the validity of them are to be canvaſſed, and a remedy can eaſily be obtained after ſervice done.</p>
               <p>The import of the word duty is great, and the idea in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite; and the way to circumſcribe its extent is for an officer to do every thing, and obey every order, that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears calculated to promote the good of that ſervice which he is engaged in. The circumſtances that appear in the proceedings of the court-martial in conſequence of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, will ſhew whether it was calculated to promote the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:016334_0017_0F9C26BF43BB5A50"/>
aforeſaid purpoſes, and whether colonel Hall was juſtifiable in refuſing to obey them.</p>
               <p>I view the horſe in queſtion as a ſupernumerary, fed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſufferance, and an expence to the public which was not allowed; certainly the public had a right to his ſervices, at leaſt for a few hours. Was colonel Hall's ſupernume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary <hi>coat</hi> to eat and drink at the public expence, its ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices might be required with as much propriety as its maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's; however, the allegory is as foreign to the ſubject, as the colonel's behaviour has been un-officer-like.</p>
               <p>The colonel thinks he has ſeen an order of his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency's, confining the power of impreſſing to the quarter-maſter-general or his deputy; this directly proves that power is lodged ſomewhere, and alſo preſuppoſes a right to exiſt in the commander in chief to carry ſuch powers into execution through the proper channels. Abſtracted from my inſtructions, which in this and other lights are pretty extenſive, as commander of this garriſon, I am moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly inveſted with a ſimilar right in the circle of my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and therefore ſhould judge an order directed to my diviſion quarter-maſter of equal validity.</p>
               <p>I ſhould apprehend the quarter-maſter-general, or his deputies, are the only perſons to receive and carry into execution orders for impreſſing horſes, &amp;c. and had I or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that duty to have paſſed through any other line, then the colonel himſelf might with great propriety have pronounced it unmilitary. To impreſs horſes or any other ſpecies of private property always implies an urgent neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity for ſuch a meaſure, and the neceſſity implies ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of importance to be effected, which otherways could not be brought about. In ſuch caſe no true friend to his country ought to oppoſe or throw the leaſt impediment in the way, and the perſons and property of officers, in my opinion, are not more ſacred than thoſe o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> the farmers, who, though they do not fight, yet feed thoſe who do, and are as neceſſary members of ſociety as the former. I agree that ſome men are actuated by intereſted and merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:016334_0018_0F9C26C0040403E0"/>
views, others by a ſpirit of contradiction and impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of controul, and in ſuch caſes will not lend their property with their own conſent; then force becomes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and indiſpenſable. Had colonel Hall like a good officer obeyed thoſe orders, which were neither new or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precedented, I ſhould not have been under the neceſſity of uſing a military force; therefore when the colonel, in the high flood of his wiſdom, makes uſe of this circumſtance to diſprove the right of impreſſing officers horſes, his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments only tend to convince the judicious of the neceſſity of taking ſuch meaſures, to reduce turbulent and refracto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſpirits to a ſenſe of their duty.</p>
               <p>When an officer once deviates from the line of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, by diſputing and controverting orders, 'tis neither ſtrange or uncommon to find him juſtifying one breach by the commiſſion of another. I am ſorry to include the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel in this deſcription; but after violating the order and putting on the cavalier with his commanding officer, he attempts to move the paſſions of the court by all the quib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling caſuiſtry of an attorney, miſtating facts, drawing unfair inferences, tending to miſlead the judgment; this certainly is no evidence of candour, whatever it may be of ingenuity. As I have been honoured with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of this garriſon by his excellency general Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, he certainly has inveſted me with every power for the good government thereof; therefore I apprehend, among many other powers received for that purpoſe, the power of impreſſing horſes, &amp;c. was one: this power enables me up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an emergency to impreſs colonel Hall's ſupernumerary horſe, and would perhaps have juſtified my going farther. If that power be arbitrary and illegal, the remedy muſt be ſought for and obtained at the fountain head. If then the power of ordering horſes to be impreſſed is veſted in me, colonel Hall, according to his own argument, had no right to refuſe, and conſequently the arreſt is juſt and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal.

eloquent alluſions, may divert the fancy, but ſhould never biaſs the judgment of men of ſenſe; nor do I believe this kind of rhapſody has had any undue influence on the minds of the court, and notwithſtanding they are intereſted in the event of the trial, my partiality for them induces me to think they made up their determination from an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of an impropriety in the addreſs of the order, which I ſtill apprehend has gone through the proper chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel; however, this will be determined by his excellency general Waſhington, in his approbation or diſapprobation of the ſentence. As the order was not addreſſed to colonel Hall, it is ſuppoſed he was not bound to obey it. I would aſk, was I to order the whole garriſon under arms at ſuch an hour, whether colonel Hall, not being particularly mentioned in the order, would think himſelf bound to obey ſuch an order, and form his regiment? According to the colonel's private opinion and the determination he would certainly not be obliged to pay any attention to it.</p>
               <p>Doubtleſs there are many officers who have as juſt a ſenſe of the merits of this preſent conteſt as colonel Hall, and are as honeſt men, who have ſuffered in their perſons, and ſacrificed as much, nay I will venture to ſay more, to the ſhrine of freedom, without all that diſplay of integrity and ſupererrogation that the colonel ſets forth.</p>
               <p>That colonel Hall refuſed to obey my orders is a fact that is allowed; that he threatened to take the life of the perſon authoriſed to execute theſe orders is alſo allowed; which conduct is certainly unlike an officer: wherefore I conclude, that colonel Hall is guilty of all the charges laid againſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Orders of the 31ſt ultimo being read, captain Norwood confeſſed he refuſed to comply with the tenor of that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: captain Norwood confeſſed likewiſe, that he believed that to be a general order, a copy of which he was ſerved with by major Hitchcock, and is as follows, viz.</p>
            <p>The number of priſoners now under guard, the ſcarcity of officers, and the difficulty of making up a court-martial for the trial of the priſoners, owing to the diſputes ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:016334_0026_0F9C26C603ED95B0"/>
about the rank of officers not being ſettled, combine to oblige the general to order captains to relieve ſubs, and ſubs to relieve captains, on the piquet guard, as there are not ſufficient captains for that purpoſe, excluſive of thoſe who compoſe the court-martial; the general is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſorry to find himſelf compelled to order ſubs to relieve the captains on piquet, which meaſure muſt be adopted or public buſineſs be ſtopped, and the number of priſoners remain an incumbrance, not only to the public, but to the troops and the preſent meaſures now to be adopted; the captains therefore are ordered to march off their guard upon the ſubs taking poſt with their relief.</p>
            <p>Captain Norwood ſays in his defence, that the neceſſity aſſerted in the orders did not exiſt at that time, as there were then a ſufficient number of ſubs off duty to have relieved the piquets, and inſiſted on having the general order to major Hitchcock inſerted, it being material to his defence; the ſubs to whom he alluded were, he ſays, lieutenants Ewing, Colegate and Ireland, who were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent to relief of the piquets. The general's order to major Hitchcock is as follows, viz.</p>
            <q>SIR, You are directed to relieve the ſubalterns on pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet by captains Long, Eccleſton and Norwood, that members may be got to ſet on the court-martial whereof colonel Ford is preſident, in order that the public buſineſs may be carried on, and that it may be relieved from the burthen of ſo many tories and priſoners.</q>
            <p>Captain Norwood ſays, that the reaſon for his not ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on court-martial was, that the rank between himſelf, Eccleſton and Long, was not ſettled, and that it was his tour to have gone on command inſtead of captain Selman, and that the court could have been formed without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the ſubalterns then on piquet, by ordering the field officers, or artillery officers, to ſit in the room of thoſe captains whoſe rank was in diſpute, and ſays farther, that he would cheerfully have obeyed that order if he had thought there had been a neceſſity for it, but that he thought
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:016334_0027_0F9C26C6C3A2B1D0"/>
himſelf pointed at particularly by the order from which he relieved the ſubs then on duty.</p>
            <p>Court adjourned till three o'clock.</p>
            <p>Court met according to adjournment. Colonel Ford being duly ſworn, depoſeth and ſaith, on being aſked by the court at the deſire of the general, Whether general Smallwood did not obſerve as follows:</p>
            <p>Queſtion by general Smallwood. Did I not obſerve to you, that the ſcarcity of officers and their ſcruples about rank would render it difficult to make up a court-martial, unleſs the officers would wave their ſcruples? And did I not deſire you to give my compliments to them, and to beg that they would wave them in the preſent inſtance, as there were ſo many priſoners who were an incumbrance?</p>
            <p>Anſwer by colonel Ford. The general did make the foregoing obſervations, and that he informed the court that the general hoped they would on that occaſion wave their ſcruples.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. Did you not acquaint the general, that all were willing to ſerve, except Long, Eccleſton and Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood.</p>
            <p>Anſwer. I informed the general, that captains Long, Eccleſton and Norwood, would not wave their ſcruples.</p>
            <p>Queſtion by the court. Did you inform the general, that captain Norwood was willing to ſit agreeable to the general order?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. I heard no ſuch thing, nor did I inform the general of ſuch a thing.</p>
            <p>Queſtion by the general. Did I not obſerve that I ſhould be under the neceſſity of ſending thoſe three gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen to relieve the ſubs on piquet, and place them that were on piquet on the court martial; as the ſcarcity of officers rendered this meaſure neceſſary? and did not I obſerve, that I hoped the officers who ſcrupled to ſit on court-martial on account of rank, would not think I pointed at them, as I had no other alternative?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. I think you made obſervations to that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:016334_0028_0F9C26C783557078"/>Queſtion. How many field officers are there in camp for duty?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. Four; viz. colonel Woolford, major How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, major Steward, and myſelf.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. Has not their duty been extremely hard ſince at this poſt?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. I think it has.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. From the duty they have done, would it not from your knowledge have been partial in me to have put them on the court-martial, and exempted the captains, who have done much leſs duty, from mounting on piquet?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. I do not know that captains have mounted piquet ſince we came to this poſt, until the time when captains Long, Eccleſton and Norwood were ordered to relieve the piquets.</p>
            <p>Queſtions aſked by captain Norwood of colonel Ford. How long had the ſubs done duty at this place before they were ordered to be relieved by captains?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. I think it was the ſecond day.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. Could not that court to your knowledge have been compoſed, without relieving the ſubalterns by cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, by putting field officers on that court, as well as the preſent?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. I think not, as colonel Woolford being a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior officer to me, the court muſt have been diſſolved, had he ſat.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. Could not that court have been compoſed except one member?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. I think it could, by putting major Howard and major Steward on.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. Did not colonel Ford hear me ſay, I was willing to ſit on that court-martial agreeable to the Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land roſter?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. I think I did.</p>
            <p>Queſtion by the general. Was not major Howard re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by colonel Woolford the morning the court was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:016334_0029_0F9C26C8439BDBD0"/>Anſwer. I think he was.</p>
            <p>Queſtion aſked by captain Norwood. How long had the field officers done duty before the captains were ordered to relieve ſubalterns?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. From the time the guards were firſt mounted at this place.</p>
            <p>Queſtion by the general. When was the court-martial ordered of which you was preſident?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. I believe on the 30th of May.</p>
            <p>Queſtions by the general to major Howard. Who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved you on the 30th of May, 1778?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. Colonel Woolford.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. Did you know that there was a court mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial ordered that day, and colonel Ford preſident?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. Not until I was relieved.</p>
            <p>Queſtions by the court. Did you know it after you was relieved?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. Yes.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. Did you know that major Steward was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to relieve colonel Woolford on the 31ſt ult.?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. Major Steward was appointed, but I did the duty in his room.</p>
            <p>Queſtion by captain Norwood to major Howard. Could not a court-martial have been compoſed on the 30th ult. by putting on three field officers, and leaving an officer to do the field duty?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. I believe it might have been done, by compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending the field officers who came off duty that morning.</p>
            <p>Colonel Woolford being ſworn, was aſked by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral—</p>
            <p>Queſtion. Do you know, from the ſcarcity of officers and the hard duty of field and ſubaltern officers, that I could have relieved the piquets otherwiſe, without injuring the field and ſubaltern officers much more than the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. I think they muſt have been injured more than the captains, from the returns that I have ſeen.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:016334_0030_0F9C26C981B001C0"/>Queſtion. Did you not ſee or hear the captains enter into a combination, not to be relieved but by captains? and did not you know that this could not be effected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſſolving the court-martial, or diſtreſſing the ſubs who had lately come off duty?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. I heard ſome of them ſay they would not be relieved but by captains, and I think they could not be relieved by captains without diſſolving the court-martial.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. Did you not diſſuade them from entering into ſuch a reſolution?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. I told them they had better not enter into ſuch a reſolution, for they would bring themſelves into trouble.</p>
            <p>Queſtion aſked colonel Woolford by captain Norwood How long did the field officers and ſubalterns do duty by the 30th of May?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. I do not know, as I went to quarters the night we encamped; by information I can inform the court it was from the 29th to the 30th.</p>
            <p>Brigade-major Hitchcock being duly ſworn, was aſked by the general with leave from the court—Had you any other way of relieving the piquet, eſtabliſhing the court-martial, furniſhing officers for the main guard, and the party of obſervation, than the mode I directed on the 30th ult. without injuring the few field officers and ſubalterns much more than the captains?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. I think it could not be done in any other manner.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. Had not the duty of the field and ſubaltern officers been harder latterly than the captains?</p>
            <p>Major Hitchcock, in anſwer to the above queſtion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents, that on the 26th of May, when the firſt brigade marched, and agreeable to the weekly returns (there then being four field officers returned fit for duty, ten captains and eleven ſubalterns) one field officer, one captain, and ſeven ſubalterns, were put on duty from the ſecond bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade; and one field officer, one captain, and ſix ſubal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:016334_0031_0F9C26C9D438FC98"/>
on duty the 27th of May, and continued, with the addition of one ſubaltern, to the 28th of May, as a rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement to the main and rear guards, and arrived that evening at our preſent encampment; and that on the 29th, three ſubalterns mounted on the piquets, and that they were relieved by three other ſubalterns on the 30th in the morning, who were ordered to be relieved by the three cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, Long, Eccleſton, and Norwood, and after being relieved went immediately on court-martial.</p>
            <div type="verdict">

               <p>I HAVE read and conſidered the proceedings of the court-martial in the caſe of captain Norwood. If our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary conſtitution does not authoriſe the court to inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the third charge exhibited againſt him, and to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine upon the ſame, and on the defence he offers, no powers can be derived from me for the purpoſe. However I am of opinion that they have a juriſdiction in the caſe, and that though a trial before ſuch a court may in its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences and operation bring in queſtion the character of a general officer, yet that this circumſtance will not ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſede their power of enquiry, as to the matters in charge, as they are not to paſs ſentence againſt the general officer. This I deliver as mere matter of opinion, and without the leaſt deſign or wiſh to influence the court to proceed in the caſe of captain Norwood, if their ſentiments are ſtill the ſame reſpecting the incompetency of their power.</p>

that they could not with propriety enter into an inveſtigation of the third article of the charge exhibited by general Smallwood againſt captain Norwood, was laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the court.</p>
               <p>They reconſidered their former deciſion, and ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained of opinion, that it was founded on military prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and that they could not depart from it.</p>
               <p>Captain Norwood obſerved to the court, that he had been arraigned before them, that he had plead to that part of his charge which they thought themſelves competent to proceed on, and that he now inſiſted on being tried on thoſe articles of the charge exhibited againſt him to which he had already plead.</p>
               <p>The court were of opinion, that, as captain Norwood had plead to his charge, he had a right to inſiſt on his trial, and determined that they would proceed to an inveſtigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the two firſt articles of the charge exhibited againſt captain Norwood.</p>

               <p>The charges were, 1ſt. Publicly declaring and implying that he did not regard the cenſure of the commander in chief, becauſe the facts ſet forth to him on his (captain Norwood's) trial, were miſtated.</p>

                  <pb n="36" facs="unknown:016334_0036_0F9C26CD8365A4E8"/>General Smallwood made an objection to the court's proceeding on the two firſt articles of the charge exhibited againſt captain Norwood, unleſs they would include the whole of the charge, in which caſe he was willing to give captain Norwood the fulleſt power of juſtifying his expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions with which he was charged.</p>
               <p>The court, after conſidering the objection made by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Smallwood to their proceeding further in the caſe of captain Norwood, were of opinion, that it was inadmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſince ſtopping their proceeding in conſequence of this objection, would be ſuppoſing that they had no right to continue them, and conſequently, that an officer who has arreſted another poſſeſſes the power of preventing the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme military court in the American army from examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the merits of the charge.</p>

               <p>Queſtion by the court at the requeſt of general Small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood. Had you any further converſation with captain Norwood concerning his trial, or on that ſubject at that or any other time?</p>
               <p>Anſwer. None that I recollect reſpecting the charges now before the court.</p>
               <p>Queſtion by the priſoner. Did you infer from the tenor of my converſation that I could mean a reflection on his Excellency or on the court-martial in any reſpect whatever?</p>
               <p>Anſwer. I thought you meant no reflection on the court, but I conceive that your expreſſions muſt have had a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to reflect on his Excellency, as it was ſuppoſing that
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:016334_0037_0F9C26CE4388E840"/>
his Excellency attended more to the repreſentation made by general Smallwood than to the proceedings of the court-martial, though I did not think you <hi>meant</hi> to convey this idea.</p>
               <p>Lieutenant Baily depoſes and ſays, That while the army lay at Valley-Forge, he heard captain Norwood ſay, in a public company, that he did not much mind the reprimand given him in general orders, becauſe he ſuſpected that the facts on which he was tried had been miſrepreſented to his Excellency by general Smallwood.</p>
               <p>Queſtion by the court. Did you hear any thing farther?</p>
               <p>Anſwer. Nothing.</p>
               <p>Queſtion by the priſoner. Did you conceive that I ſaid any thing diſreſpectful of his Excellency, or of the court-martial?</p>
               <p>Anſwer. I conceived you meant a reflection on general Smallwood, and no other perſon.</p>
               <p>Captain Norwood urges in his defence, That he never did, and never intended, to inſinuate any thing injurious to his Excellency, or to the court-martial, that it was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Smallwood only on whom he reflected.</p>
               <p>The court having conſidered the charges and the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, are of opinion, that captain Norwood did ſay, that he did not regard, or did not <hi>mind,</hi> the cenſure of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in chief, becauſe the facts ſtated to him on his (captain Norwood's) trial were miſrepreſented; and are farther of opinion, that his expreſſion had a tendency (though captain Norwood could not mean it) to reflect on his Excellency, as well as on general Smallwood. The court find captain Norwood guilty of breaches of the 5th article of the 18th ſection, and of the 2d article of the 2d ſection of the articles of war, and do ſentence him to be reprimanded in general orders. The court acquit captain Norwood of un-officer and un-gentleman-like behaviour, and of reflecting on the court-martial.</p>

General Smallwood then urged the propriety of their going into an inveſtigation of the charge at large, and inſiſted on their proceeding to the trial, and requeſted them to give captain Norwood every latitude he would aſk of juſtifying his aſſertions, by adducing evidence and recurring to the proceedings on his late trial, or proving any facts which happened thereon, urging their competency, and obſerving, that if captain Norwood juſtified the laſt article of the charge, they muſt acquit him, which would impliedly cenſure and ſubject ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Smallwood's conduct to an enquiry, but if he could not ſupport his allegations, their powers derived under the

               <p>THE commander in chief finds himſelf under the diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable neceſſity of diſapproving the proceedings of the court, becauſe they have not tried all the charges exhibited before them on each fact; agreeable to precedent and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon uſage, they ought to have given either a ſentence of acquittal or condemnation. To this end their power and juriſdiction ſeem to have been fully competent; the third charge, from its very nature, implied a right of juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the priſoner could not be diſcriminated in point of reaſon from either of the preceding ones, or any other, the matter in queſtion between the parties in this inſtance was the character and conduct of one of them.

               <p>Captain Norwood refuſed to plead to the two firſt arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the charge exhibited againſt him, he urged that he had already been tried on them by a former court-martial, and that he could not be tried twice for the ſame facts.</p>
               <p>The court having conſidered the objection made by cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Norwood, are of opinion, that our military conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion undoubtedly veſts the commander in chief with the power of diſapproving the proceedings of a court martial, and of ordering an officer to be tried again by the ſame or another court. The court were farther of opinion, that as general orders of the fourth inſtant poſitively directed them to proceed on the whole of the charge, they would inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the two firſt articles of the charge exhibited againſt captain Norwood, in the ſame manner as if he had plead to them.</p>
               <p>Captain Norwood pleads guilty of the third charge, and urges in juſtification that his expreſſions were true.</p>
               <p>Captain Norwood objected to general Smallwood's aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any queſtions of the ſeveral witneſſes who ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined in the courſe of his trial; he contends, that the general can have no right to aſk any queſtions, as the judge-advocate alone is empowered to proſecute.</p>
               <p>The court were of opinion, that, as the principal end propoſed by a court-martial muſt be to diſcover the truth, and as general Smallwood might aſk many queſtions which had a tendency to illucidate the different charges, he ſhould be permitted to propoſe any queſtions, which, if thought proper by the court, ſhould be aſked by the judge-advocate.</p>

While the court was ſitting captain Norwood ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that he was treated partially, as captain Eccleſton, who was arreſted on the ſame charge with himſelf, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed from his arreſt, while he was proſecuted; general Smallwood then declared, that had ſuch applications been made to him for the diſcharge of captain Norwood as were made for the diſcharge of captain Eccleſton, he too ſhould have been releaſed from his arreſt.</p>
               <p>Queſtion by the court. Was there any general order di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting that ſubalterns ſhould relieve captains?</p>
               <p>Anſwer. An expreſs order was iſſued for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Queſtion by the court. Did any private pique ſubſiſt between general Smallwood and captain Norwood previous to this arreſt?</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="unknown:016334_0046_0F9C26F6C3C7C9E8"/>Captain Norwood objects to the teſtimony of major Hitchcock, as containing nothing which reſpects the charges exhibited againſt him before this court. He enters now a general objection againſt any witneſſes who may be adduced, whoſe teſtimonies do not immediately tend to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucidate thoſe charges on which he is to be tried.</p>
               <p>The court having conſidered the objection of captain Norwood and the teſtimony of major Hitchcock, are of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that, as it appears from the teſtimony of captain Brice that the releaſement of captain Eccleſton from his arreſt conſtitutes a part of that partiality with which cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Norwood accuſes general Smallwood, an enquiry into that fact comes with propriety from this court, and they do determine that the teſtimony of major Hitchcock ſhall remain on their proceedings.</p>
               <p>Colonel Woolford depoſes and ſays, That in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the day on which captains Norwood and Eccleſton were arreſted, he met the latter gentleman, and was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by him that he was in arreſt; that this diſtreſſed him much, as he was apprehenſive he ſhould be caſhiered, and he was now ſenſible he had been in an error. Colonel Woolford told him, that if he would make ſuch acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments to general Smallwood, he did not doubt but the general might be induced to releaſe him from his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt. At captain Eccleſton's requeſt, colonel Woolford ſpoke to general Smallwood on this ſubject, and ſtated to him the converſation which had paſſed between captain Eccleſton and himſelf. General Smallwood ſaid this was all he requeſted from either gentleman, and captain Eccleſton was ſoon after releaſed from his arreſt.</p>
               <p>Queſtion by the priſoner. Did you ever hear me ſay any<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing comprehended in the charges exhibited againſt me before this court?</p>
               <p>Anſwer. I have heard you uſe ſome expreſſions relative to the character of general Smallwood, I am not certain what they were, but I think you ſaid he was no gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, or did not act like a gentleman.</p>

               <p>Captain Ghiſelin and captain Baytop took the places of captain Hinds and captain Davis, and were ſworn agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the articles of war. The proceedings of yeſterday were read to them. Colonel Woolford was again adduced to the court as a witneſs, and was aſked the following queſtions:</p>
               <p>Queſtion by the court at the requeſt of general Small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood. Do you remember the day that you, at the requeſt of captain Eccleſton, applied to general Smallwood to have <hi>him</hi> releaſed from his arreſt?</p>
               <p>Anſwer. It was the day preceding that on which the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral releaſed him.</p>
               <p>Queſtion by the court at the requeſt of general Small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood. What did general Smallwood ſay to you on your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication in favour of captain Eccleſton, with reſpect to that gentleman's releaſement?</p>
               <p>Anſwer. He ſaid that he had no other motive for arreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing captains Norwood and Eccleſton but to convince them of their error, and to prevent the ſervice from being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured in future by a ſimilar conduct; that ſince captain Eccleſton was ſenſible he had been wrong, if he would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it in writing, he (general Smallwood) would releaſe him, the general wiſhed the acknowledgment to be made in writing, that it might juſtify him in diſcharging Captain Eccleſton from his arreſt.</p>
               <p>The following witneſſes appeared at the requeſt of cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Norwood.</p>
               <p>Captain Oldham depoſes and ſays, That captains Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood and Eccleſton were arreſted at Chad's-Ford for the ſame crime, they were each brought before a court-mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, and each plead guilty to their charge. After cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Norwood had made his defence, the court aſked cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Eccleſton if it was ſufficient for him, he replied that it was. Almoſt immediately a note was given to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident, which releaſed captain Eccleſton from his arreſt. The court then proceeded on the trial of captain Norwood;
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:016334_0048_0F9C26F8439D6658"/>
in ſome little time general Smallwood came into the room ſome of the court obſerved to him, that they were deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining on captain Norwood's caſe, the general ſignified a deſire to hear the proceedings of the court, with captain Norwood's defence, read, this was done, he conceived that ſome part of captain Norwood's defence reflected on his conduct, and inſiſting upon having a defence againſt thoſe reflections entered; the propriety of entering ſuch a defence on the proceedings of the court, as captain Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood had been already tried ſo far as to be found guilty of the charge, was objected to by ſeveral members; at this general Smallwood grew exceedingly warm, ſignified that ſome of the court were partial, and farther ſaid, that if his defence was not entered with the proceedings, and opinion given on the whole, he would diſſolve the court and take Norwood to head quarters for trial; he far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſiſted that the preſident ſhould inform him by a note in the next room, where he would ſtay, whether his defence ſhould be entered or not; the court were of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that the general's defence, with his evidences, ſhould be entered, and opinion given conjointly on the whole.</p>
               <p>Queſtion by the court. Who was to proſecute captains Eccleſton and Norwood?</p>
               <p>Anſwer. I conceived that the judge-advocate, or perſon officiating as ſuch, was to proſecute them.</p>

               <p>Anſwer. No.</p>
               <p>Queſtion by the court. Was general Smallwood informed that the court had met before they proceeded on the trials of captains Norwood and Eccleſton?</p>
               <p>Anſwer. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Queſtion by the court. What induced the court to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed on thoſe trials without giving general Smallwood no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of their intentions?</p>
               <p>Anſwer. I conceived and believe the court thought, that as thoſe gentlemen plead guilty to their charges, teſtimony againſt them was unneceſſary.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="unknown:016334_0049_0F9C26F904C46DB0"/>Queſtion by the court at the requeſt of general Small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood. Was there any judge-advocate?</p>
               <p>Anſwer. A member took down the proceedings, and, I conceived, acted as judge-advocate.</p>
               <p>Queſtion by the court at the requeſt of general Small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood. Was he properly ſworn to execute that duty?</p>
               <p>Anſwer. I believe not.</p>
               <p>Queſtion by the priſoner. Was it cuſtomary in that divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for a member to act as judge-advocate?</p>
               <p>Anſwer. Yes, but they were not ſworn as judge-advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates.</p>
               <p>Queſtion by the priſoner. Was any perſon appointed by general Smallwood a judge-advocate?</p>
               <p>Anſwer. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Queſtion by the priſoner. Was it cuſtomary for an offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer who arreſted another to act as proſecutor?</p>
               <p>Anſwer. I cannot determine; I have not conceived them to be proſecutors.</p>
               <p>Queſtion by the court. Who ſwore the members of the court?</p>
               <p>Anſwer. The preſident.</p>
               <p>Queſtion by the court at the requeſt of general Small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood. Did general Smallwood make application to the court for evidence to be taken in behalf of the United States?</p>
               <p>Anſwer. I think the general requeſted that his witneſſes ſhould be examined, but I believed thoſe witneſſes were only to exculpate himſelf from thoſe reflections which cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Norwood, in his defence, had caſt on him, as I did not conceive evidences in behalf of the United States ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, when captain Norwood plead guilty to his charge.</p>
               <p>Queſtion by the court at the requeſt of general Small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood. When general Smallwood came into court, were the proceedings and ſentence in the caſe of captain Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood fully <hi>made up?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſwer. No, I believe the court had ſentenced him to be reprimanded, but had not determined in what manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="unknown:016334_0050_0F9C26F9C35944F0"/>Queſtion by the court at the requeſt of general Small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood. Was it on the firſt or ſecond day or the trial that general Smallwood inſiſted that the determination of the court ſhould be made on the evidence on both ſides, and not partially?</p>
               <p>Anſwer. I cannot recollect certainly, but I think on both.</p>
               <p>Queſtion by the court at the requeſt of general Small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood. Did captain Norwood object, the ſecond day, to the court's determining on the proceedings at large?</p>
               <p>Anſwer. Captain Norwood ſignified to the court, that he had been tried the day before, and ſaid, he hoped that the proceedings of that day would not be entered with thoſe of the preceding day.</p>
               <p>Queſtion by the court at the requeſt of general Small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood. Did captain Norwood accuſe general Smallwood in court of acting partially in diſcharging captain Eccleſton from his arreſt?</p>
               <p>Anſwer. I think he did.</p>
               <p>Queſtion by the court at the requeſt of general Small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood. What anſwer did the general make?</p>
               <p>Anſwer. He denied being partial, and declared on his honour that he would have releaſed captain Norwood had he made ſuch conceſſions as were made by captain Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſton.</p>
               <p>Queſtion by the priſoner. Did I accuſe the court of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing guilty of partiality?</p>

               <p>Queſtion by the priſoner. Did general Smallwood ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the court's having proceeded on my trial till their proceedings were read to him?</p>
               <p>Anſwer. I think he did not.</p>

               <head>Tueſday, September 15, 1778.</head>
               <p>Captain Bell depoſes and ſays, That, at Chad's Ford, when captains Norwood and Eccleſton were arreſted by general Smallwood, a court was called for the purpoſe of trying them; the court met at the time appointed, and, after being properly prepared, aſked captains Norwood and Eccleſton, Whether they plead guilty to their charges. They replied in the affirmative. Captain Norwood's wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes were examined, after which he gave in a defence. Captain Eccleſton's defence was the ſame as captain Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood's. Juſt then captain Eccleſton received a note, which he read and preſented to the preſident: he was by that note releaſed from his arreſt; the deponent thinks be then left the room. The court had found captain Norwood guilty of diſobedience of orders, and were proceeding to determine on his puniſhment, when general Smallwood came into the room, and deſired that the proceedings of the court ſhould be read; after hearing them, the general conceived, that what captain Norwood had ſaid reflected on him, and begged leave to offer ſomething in juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of himſelf; this the court granted; general Small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood's evidence and defence were taken down; ſome words paſſed between him and captain Norwood, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent does not recollect them. After this captain Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood ſpoke to the court, and indicated his hopes, that they would not conſider general Smallwood's evidence and defence conjointly with his. General Smallwood was then going out of the room; on hearing what captain Norwood ſaid, he returned, was very angry, and told the court that he would not be <hi>baffled</hi> by them; that it was in his power to diſſolve the court and, ſince he found that they were inclined to <hi>baffle</hi> him, he would diſſolved it and have cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:016334_0052_0F9C26FB43474778"/>
Norwood tried at head quarters. The general added, That he perceived ſome of the court were inclined to act partially, and deſired the preſident to ſignify, by a note to him in the next room, whether they would give their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion on his evidence conjointly with captain Norwood's or not; the court informed him that they would, and thus put an end to the diſpute.</p>
               <p>Queſtion by the court. Were captains Norwood and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſton tried together or ſeparately?</p>
               <p>Anſwer. I think they were tried together.</p>
               <p>Queſtion by the court. Did the court aſk whether they choſe to be tried together or ſeparately?</p>
               <p>Anſwer. I do not recollect that they did.</p>
               <p>Queſtion by the court. Did the gentlemen requeſt to be tried together?</p>
               <p>Anſwer. I do not recollect that they did.</p>
               <p>Queſtion by the court at the requeſt of general Small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood. Did general Smallwood give in a defence to the court?</p>
               <p>Anſwer. He gave the court his reaſons for arreſting captain Norwood, and for ordering captains to be relieved by ſubalterns.</p>
               <p>Queſtion by the court at the requeſt of general Small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood. When captain Norwood indicated his hopes that the court would not conſider the evidences produced by general Smallwood, did any members object to a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the teſtimony offered by the general?</p>
               <p>Anſwer. A diſpute aroſe in court about the propriety of admitting the witneſſes offered by the general.</p>
               <p>Queſtion by the court at the requeſt of general Small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood. Was there a great heat in the court publicly, on that matter?</p>
               <p>Anſwer. There were high diſputes.</p>
               <p>Queſtion by the court at the requeſt of general Small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood. Had general Smallwood any intimation of the court's proceeding on the trials of captains Norwood and Eccleſton before they did proceed?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="unknown:016334_0053_0F9C26FC032B6E90"/>Anſwer. I do not recollect that he had.</p>
               <p>Queſtion by the court at the requeſt of general Small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood. Was there any difference between general Small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood and captain Norwood previous to this trial?</p>
               <p>Anſwer. I think there was.</p>
               <p>Queſtion by the court at the requeſt of general Small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood. What was it?</p>
               <p>Anſwer. While the diviſion lay at Wilmington, one of the officers had touched on the general's character; this occaſioned him to call the officers together at his quarters, where he began to <hi>clear up</hi> the charges which had been ſaid againſt him; in clearing them up, high diſputes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe, particularly between the general and captain Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, concerning the uſage of ſoldiers, and other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Captain Norwood ſaid, that be would <hi>always</hi> make a point of ſtriking any ſoldier who gave him ill language; the general replied, then he would <hi>always</hi> make a point of arreſting him.</p>
               <p>Queſtion by the court at the requeſt of general Small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood. Did the diſpute between general Smallwood and captain Norwood amount to a quarrel, or was it only a difference in ſentiment?</p>
               <p>Anſwer. It was a difference in ſentiment.</p>
               <p>Queſtion by the court. Was this difference of ſentiment carried on with warmth on each ſide?</p>
               <p>Anſwer. They were not very warm, but there was a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of warmth.</p>
               <p>Queſtion by the court. Did you ever hear captain Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, previous to his arreſt at Chad's-Ford, ſay that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Smallwood was a partial man and no gentleman?</p>
               <p>Anſwer. No.</p>
               <p>Queſtion by the priſoner. Did the general give in his <hi>defence</hi> the day that I plead to the charge, or was it the day after?</p>
               <p>Anſwer. I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Queſtion by the priſoner. Did the court meet one or two days?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="unknown:016334_0054_0F9C26FCC31CD060"/>Anſwer. Two days.</p>
               <p>Lieutenant Smith depoſes and ſays, That, when Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains Norwood and Eccleſton were arreſted at Chad's-Ford, they each appeared at a court of which he was a member. Captain Norwood gave in a defence, which captain Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton ſaid was ſufficient for him. At this time captain Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſton gave a note to the preſident, which the court thought ſufficient to releaſe him from his arreſt. They then cleared the room, and proceeded to paſſing ſentence on captain Norwood; they had found him guilty and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him to be reprimanded, but had not entered their determination on their proceedings, when general Small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood came into the room. The deponent informed the general, that the court were then determining on captain Norwood's caſe; he requeſted to hear the proceedings of the court, with captain Norwood's defence; after hearing them, he informed the court, that he had <hi>ſome</hi> evidences to bring in againſt <hi>ſome</hi> reflections thrown out in captain Norwood's defence. Some of the court objected to the propriety of his bringing in witneſſes after they had begun to determine on the caſe. Without coming to any reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the court adjourned till next day. Then general Smallwood inſiſted on introducing his witneſſes, and the court granted his requeſt. After his witneſſes were heard, he harangued the court himſelf, and gave them his reaſons for releaſing captain Eccleſton and not captain Norwood. After this captain Norwood obſerved, that he thought it would be improper to give their opinion on the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the two days <hi>together,</hi> and left the room. The ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral immediately <hi>fell in a paſſion,</hi> and inſiſted on its being done, as he had not been preſent the day before, and had it not in his power to bring in his witneſſes. This occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned much confuſion in the court, in the courſe of which general Smallwood ſaid he did not doubt but ſome of the court were not partial. He likewiſe inſiſted, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident ſhould ſignify, by a note to him in tne next room, whether they would conſider the proceedings of the two
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:016334_0055_0F9C26FD83313AF0"/>
days conjointly. The court gratified him. General Smallwood had called this court, and appointed the hour at which they were to meet; they were to have met about two hours and a half before the general came; it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by ſome of the court, that it was unneceſſary to ſend for the general, as he knew the time the court was to meet, which time was elapſed, and as the gentlemen would plead guilty to the charges againſt them, for which reaſons it was imagined that there was no occaſion for witneſſes.</p>
               <p>Queſtion by the court. When the court knew that cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Norwood had a defence to give in, did they inform general Smallwood of it?</p>
               <p>Anſwer. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Queſtion by the court at the requeſt of general Small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood. Did captain Eccleſton receive the note which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed him from his arreſt in court?</p>
               <p>Anſwer. He received a note which I ſuppoſed to be his releaſement in court, in the midſt of captain Norwood's defence; from the manner of bringing it, the note ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to have been ſent in a hurry?</p>
               <p>Queſtion by the court at the requeſt of general Small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood. Was that note read to the court?</p>
               <p>Anſwer. Yes.</p>
               <p>Queſtion by the court at the requeſt of general Small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood. Had any evidence been offered by captain Norwood when the court proceeded to determine in his caſe?</p>
               <p>Anſwer. Not that I recollect.</p>
               <p>Queſtion by the court at the requeſt of general Small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood. How long had the court ſat before general Small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood came?</p>
               <p>Anſwer. I do not remember, but from the proceedings I imagine they muſt have ſet an hour or an hour and a half.</p>
               <p>Queſtion by the court at the requeſt of general Small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood. Did general Smallwood aſſign any reaſon for his not attending ſooner?</p>
               <p>Anſwer. I believe he did after the proceedings of the court were read to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="unknown:016334_0056_0F9C26FE44D5A008"/>Queſtion by the court at the requeſt of general Small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood. What were thoſe reaſons?</p>
               <p>Anſwer. I think he ſaid there were ſome priſoners in the main guard whom he had to ſend to Lancaſter.</p>
               <p>Queſtion by the priſoner. Were captain Eccleſton and myſelf both arreſted for the ſame crime?</p>
               <p>Anſwer. As well as I can recollect you were.</p>
               <p>Queſtion by the priſoner. Did captain Eccleſton and myſelf both plead guilty to the ſame charge?</p>
               <p>Anſwer. You did.</p>
               <p>Queſtion by the priſoner. Did I give in a juſtification or defence?</p>
               <p>Anſwer. You acknowledged the fact, and gave your reaſons for acting in the manner you had.</p>
               <p>Queſtion by the court at the requeſt of general Small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood. Do you remember the reaſons general Smallwood gave the court for releaſing captain Eccleſton and not cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Norwood?</p>
               <p>Anſwer. He ſaid that captain Eccleſton had acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged his fault; he added, that if captain Eccleſton had not done this, and captain Norwood had, he would have releaſed captain Norwood and would have proſecuted cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Eccleſton.</p>
               <p>The court adjourns till the day after to-morrow 9 o'clock.</p>
               <p>The movements of the army prevented the court from meeting till Saturday, September 19, 1778, when the court met at Salem, and proceeded to a farther inveſtigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the charges exhibited againſt captain Norwood.</p>
               <p>The depoſition of captain Eccleſton, taken by the judge advocate in preſence of general Smallwood and captain Norwood, was read to the court, and admitted as evidence.</p>
               <p>The depoſition was as follows: Captain Eccleſton de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes and ſays, That he has never heard captain Norwood ſay any thing comprehended in the charges for which he is now in arreſt.</p>
               <p>The following queſtions were aſked by general Small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood and captain Norwood.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="unknown:016334_0057_0F9C26FF03525780"/>Queſtion by general Smallwood. Was you arreſted by me for a breach of orders at Chad's-Ford at the ſame time that captain Norwood was?</p>

               <p>Anſwer. Yes.</p>
               <p>Queſtion by general Smallwood. When the ſubaltern who went to take charge of your poſt came, did you ſuffer your guard to march into camp?</p>
               <p>Anſwer. I did.</p>
               <p>Queſtion by general Smallwood. Did you write major Steward a letter on that ſubject?</p>
               <p>Anſwer. I wrote to major Steward requeſting his advice.</p>
               <p>Queſtion by general Smallwood. What converſation had you with colonel Woolford on the ſubject of your arreſt?</p>
               <p>Anſwer. I told colonel Woolford that I was ſorry for what had happened, as it was the firſt time I had ever been arreſted, and as I thought, after taking the advice of ſeveral officers, that I ought to have obeyed the order.</p>
               <p>Queſtion by general Smallwood. Did you requeſt colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel Woolford to ſpeak to me in your favour?</p>
               <p>Anſwer. To the beſt of my knowledge I did not.</p>

               <p>Anſwer. It was.</p>
               <p>Queſtion by general Smallwood. Did that letter require an acknowledgment of your error in writing before you could be releaſed?</p>
               <p>Anſwer. It did.</p>
               <p>Queſtion by general Smallwood. Did you make that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment.</p>
               <p>

                     <p>YOU have been under my command almoſt ever ſince you commenced the ſoldier—Your uniform and conſiſtent conduct, as an officer, hitherto has ſtrongly recommended you to officers of all ranks, as an active, brave officer, and I might add, had excited my eſteem for you; I was not leſs ſurpriſed at your deviation from that line of conduct, than I was embarraſſed when I found myſelf conſtrained, in point of duty, to order an officer, who I entertained ſo

high an opinion of, under an arreſt, and I am perſuaded, had you exerciſed your own judgment, you would not have fallen into the error. Combinations in an army have a dangerous tendency, even when they are concerted on juſt principles, but an officer ſhould be extremely cautious how he enters into them when not juſtly grounded, and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding officer muſt be loſt to all ſenſe of honour and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty who does not check and diſcountenance ſuch meaſures in every inſtance, and more particularly in the firſt. I had no other motive than this and to fix the precedent, and to diſcourage officers in future from being actuated by ſuch a ſpirit of petulancy, and, I might juſtly add, licentiouſneſs. If your judgment is convinced, I am ſatisfied, it will have as good a tendency as ſubjecting you to a trial. This you will ſignify to me in writing. and I ſhall mention in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day's orders that you are convinced you was in an error, which will be a ſufficient apology and juſtification to me to diſcharge you from your arreſt, which ſhall be immediately done. And I remain, reſpectfully, Sir,</p>

The court had determined on the caſe of cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Norwood without hearing the witneſſes to be adduced by general Smallwood, and had adjourned till next day; then the general attended with his witneſſes, inſiſted on

               <p>Queſtion by the court at the requeſt of general Small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood. Did general Smallwood aſſign any reaſon for not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending ſooner?</p>

Soon after the court ſat, captain Eccleſton, who was charged with the ſame facts, received a releaſe from his arreſt. The court then proceeded on the trial of captain Norwood. He was ſentenced to be privately reprimanded by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding officer of the regiment to which he belonged. Previous to this, ſeveral gentlemen, one of whom was the deponent, had applied to general Smallwood in favour of captain Eccleſton; the deponent had requeſted captain Eccleſton to make ſome acknowledgment of his fault, and the captain replied that he would. Colonel Adams aſked the captain, on the firſt day that the court proceeded to buſineſs, whether he ſhould ſpeak to general Smallwood in his favour; the captain requeſted him to do ſo; before the court ſat, he applied to general Smallwood, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, he could do nothing in captain Eccleſton's affair till he ſhould receive an acknowledgment in writing; the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent went to the court; after it had been ſitting about an hour, captain Eccleſton was called out, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately returned with a diſcharge from his arreſt.</p>

               <p>Colonel Ford depoſes and ſays, That the day preceding the trial of captain Eccleſton, he was in converſation with that gentleman, and was aſked by him, what he thought of his affair; colonel Ford replied, that <hi>he</hi> thought he was wrong, that in his opinion, he (captain Eccleſton) ought to have obeyed thoſe orders, captain Eccleſton ſaid he thought ſo too, that he had been informed ſo by others, and that he wiſhed he had obeyed the order; the deponent informed general Smallwood what had paſſed, and requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the releaſement of captain Eccleſton; the general ſaid that all he required was to convince the gentleman of his error, that the ſervice might not be obſtructed by ſimilar conduct in future, he at the ſame time expreſſed his good opinion of captain Eccleſton as an officer; the general likewiſe expreſſed a high opinion of captain Norwood as an officer, and wiſhed that he too had made ſuch applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as he did not deſire to proceed farther than to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them that they were wrong.</p>

Conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman in ſuggeſting publicly that the facts were miſrepreſented which has an implied tendency either to reflect on his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, or the court-martial, or general Smallwood, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I have already noticed to the court captain Eccleſton's diſcharge before his trial—a diſcharge which the general inſiſts wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> made in conſequence of captain Eccleſton's acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment of his error, an acknowledgment which I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to prove was extorted by the general's flattering
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:016334_0071_0F9C26DB052F4D10"/>
letter to captain Eccleſton—a letter which pretty plainly proves the general wiſhed to diſcriminate between us, though we both ſtood charged with the ſame offence; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therways I am at a loſs to know what the general means by ſaying, "I am perſuaded had you exerciſed your own judgment, you would not have fallen into the error; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations in an army have a dangerous tendency," &amp;c. What inference can be drawn from this, but that the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſuppoſed I had biaſſed captain Eccleſton, or at leaſt that I was in a combination againſt him. Charges which he can by no means prove, nor had he a right to infer, without confeſſing his partial conduct merited ſuch combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations. However, the general, paſſing by the expreſſive language of his letter, wiſhes to eſtabliſh the grounds of captain Eccleſton's diſcharge on the application of the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain's friends—a ſhallow pretext at beſt, eſpecially when ſuch application was not made at the inſtance of captain Eccleſton, though the general has attempted to prove, by his artful ſifting and extorting the matter of evidence, the application to him on captain Eccleſton's behalf was at the captain's ſpecial inſtance and prior to his, the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral's, letter. Colonel Adams, it is true, ſwears that captain Eccleſton did apply to him to intercede with the general, but does not ſay it was prior to the general's let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and indeed it appears it was not; for at the time of the converſation, captain Eccleſton told colonel Adams he was going to write to the general, or that he would write, and accordingly did; but it was at the preſſing invitation contained in the general's own letter. With regard to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel Woolford's and major Muir's teſtimonies, I beg leave to be ſilent, becauſe, relying as I muſt do on theſe gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemens honours, the only conſtruction I ſhall venture to put on their teſtimonies is, that probably they have forgot, or were miſtaken, as captain Eccleſton remembers no ſuch application, and it is ſcarcely probable the captain would ungratefully forget the mighty boon the colonel had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for him; and in his own teſtimony, as he would
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:016334_0072_0F9C26DBC386D500"/>
not contradict the colonel, he only modeſtly declares, that he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> me, at the time of his receiving the general's letter, that he had made no application to the general himſelf, nor had he got any perſon to do it for him; nor indeed does it appear he ever intended it, or 'tis highly probable major Steward would have been the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to whom he would have applied for interceſſion, as he was the firſt perſon he had adviſed with in his dilemma Colonel Ford well remembers his converſation with cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Eccleſton, which might have been prior to the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain's receipt of the general's letter. It is true, in that converſation the captain confeſſes he thought himſelf wrong, but expreſſed not the leaſt deſire to uſe colonel Ford's intereſt in his diſcharge, neither did he intimate the ſmalleſt deſire to be releaſed from his arreſt, till he had received the general's letter. Here indeed, were I to make a compariſon between captain Eccleſton's conduct and my own, I might, without partiality, charge him with the higheſt degree of criminality, as he perſiſted in a known error, and I ignorantly perſiſted, in ſpite of pride and oppreſſion, in what I thought was right.—I ſhall now take leave of the evidence adduced in this preſent trial, and once more turn back to remark on the general's conduct in courſe of my three ſeveral arreſts under his perſecution. In the firſt, after he had reſcued captain Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſton from his arreſt, where he was equally expoſed to the artillery of his (the general's) cenſure with myſelf, he appears ſo eager to hunt after my ruin, as, contrary to all precedent and form of good manners, to ruſh into court, and, in an authoritative ſtile, to order the proceedings to be read, though he was informed by the court they had gone through my trial, and juſt cleared the court to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the ſentence; and when he had heard them read inſiſted on being heard in behalf of the United States, though the iſſues were made up; neither was there in the leaſt any evidence neceſſary, as I had plead guilty to the
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:016334_0073_0F9C26DC83753160"/>
charge, and the court was ſitting on the nature of my of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and on the mode of my puniſhment, and finding upon the whole it was moſt probable his malevolent inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions would not be gratified, threatened to diſſolve the court unleſs they would hear him and enter his defence among their proceedings. Whether this harangue had any effect on the court or no, I won't undertake to ſay, but this I may venture to ſay, that general Smallwood is the firſt commander in chief of any department, who has taken on himſelf the peculiar province of deputy judge-advocate, and commenced proſecutor in a court where he ſhould always be reluctantly drawn even as an evidence. On my ſecond trial, and on the ſame charges for which I now ſtand, in ſpite of general Smallwood's wiſh to crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate me on the two firſt articles, the court juſtly acquitted me of intentional guilt, though, as the words might carry the implied tendency, they ſentenced me to a reprimand in general orders; and on the third charge they thought themſelves incompetent to judge. Which ſentence it pleaſed his Excellency to diſapprove, though I have the happineſs to find, by a letter his Excellency did me the honour to write me, that he entirely acquitted me of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentionally reflecting on himſelf.</p>
               <p>On the third court, the one before which I now ſtand, you know yourſelves the eagerneſs with which the general as endeavoured to criminate me, but, conſcious of my truth and integrity, I can rely with the moſt ſettled com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure on your unbiaſſed judgment, from a firm belief, that no gentlemen, convinced as I flatter myſelf you are of the prejudice and ſettled rancour of general Smallwood, will not condemn me for ſpeaking of that prejudice and rancour with ſome degree of aſperity.</p>

that my orders, iſſued through the brigade-major, were regular, and ought to have been obligatory, becauſe the ſervice required it; and theſe gentlemen prove to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, that the duty could be complied with in no other manner than was directed by thoſe orders, without the higheſt injuſtice to both field and ſubaltern officers at that poſt; but captain Norwood not only refuſed to comply with the order, but plead guilty, and ſtrenuouſly urged he could juſtify his conduct, in that caſe there could have been no miſrepreſentation of his conduct, as he ſo ungen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teelly and unjuſtly aſſerts; the court found him guilty of all he was charged with, and ſentenced him to be private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reprimanded by the commanding officer of his regiment, which, with the proceedings, were tranſmitted to general Waſhington for his conſideration, and from the face of the proceedings, his Excellency diſapproved the ſentence, and cenſured captain Norwood in the following terms: "The commander in chief utterly diſapproves the ſentence, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together inadequate to the offence, the mutinous and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous ſpirit which actuated captain Norwood, in his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, merited the moſt exemplary puniſhment." Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſo fragrant a violation of a general order, calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to aid the ſervice, and his obſtinate juſtification of his conduct, captain Norwood is at a loſs to account for the cenſure paſſed on him, unleſs general Smallwood had miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſented facts, and therefore publicly declares, without farther enquiry, or even that reſerve and delicacy which ſhould ever mark the conduct and character of an officer and a gentleman, that he does not regard the cenſure of the commander in chief, becauſe general Smallwood had miſrepreſented facts to him.</p>
               <p>Captain Norwood was charged for refuſing to comply with a general order, iſſued expreſsly for the purpoſe of relieving the troops on piquet, founded in the neceſſity of the caſe, and which at that period could not otherwiſe be remedied, plead guilty to the charge, but urged in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, that the neceſſity comprehended in the latter part of
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:016334_0076_0F9C26DEC36045E8"/>
the charge did not exiſt, notwithſtanding the teſtimony of the above gentlemen proved the fact, and the propriety of this and every part of the charge, to demonſtration, purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant to which the court found him guilty, and ſentenced him; it muſt therefore appear very extraordinary that I could miſrepreſent facts, when the court found him guilty of every fact with which he was charged, and proceeded to ſentence him thereon as above, which the commander in chief utterly diſapproved, as altogether inadequate to the offence; then what other inference could be deduced, but that the fallacy and abſurdity of his aſſertion is too glaring to require a ſolid reply, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This aſſertion of the captain's does not only convey an abſolute reflection on my character, but has an implied tendency to reflect on the commander in chief, as it muſt be inferred, if the captain's words have any meaning at all, that his Excellency decided upon my miſrepreſentation, as he ſtiles it, and not on the proceedings of the court-mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, which would have been a manifeſt deviation from that line of conduct, and love of juſtice, which have ever moſt eminently influenced and diſtinguiſhed his character; but, ſays captain Norwood, I had no intention to reflect on his Excellency, I meant only to reflect on general Small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood; in public aſſertions and declarations of this nature, a man, even of captain Norwood's ſenſe, certainly would not wiſh to place himſelf in the light of an ideot, who has no meaning annexed to his words; but the captain, if he is capable of rational reflection, muſt know it is not his intention, but his expreſſions, which muſt affect and wound characters, therefore it becomes his duty, as an officer and a gentleman, nay, I might add<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as an honeſt citizen, to be more guarded in his expreſſions, for it is thoſe only, in caſes of ſlander (and not his intention) which he is amena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for, and to be criminated by, unleſs he could eſtabliſh his favourite poſition, in that inſtance he might indeed ſtrike at characters at large with impunity.</p>

               <p>Captain Norwood has alſo publicly aſſerted, that I have been guilty of partiality in his caſe, and that I am not a gentleman, and leaſt theſe aſſertions ſhould not have their full force and weight in that inſtance, he farther declares, that he would make it his particular duty to declare pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly in all companies that he ſhould come into, that I was a partial man and no gentleman; theſe aſſertions have been proved by captain Brice and lieutenant Baily, but the captain contending publicly before the preſent and late court, whereof colonel Hazen was preſident, that he could juſtify thoſe charges, renders the proof of theſe officers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary; the charges are high and attrocious, the latter general and indefinite, and of ſuch a nature, if juſtified, as muſt for ever blaſt and ſtamp the blackeſt infamy on the character of an officer, and the charge, if not ſupported, muſt be rendered ſtill more flagrant, by being levelled at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding officer when in the official diſcharge of his duty; then how extremely cautious ſhould the captain have been in thus venturing to ruin for ever the character of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

The latter charge, the moſt infamous and injurious, he has adduced no teſtimony in ſupport of, yet I reſt aſſured the court will conſider its malignancy, and inflict an adequate and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary puniſhment, at preſent it requires no other notice from me but contempt, and the former he endeavours to ſupport by adducing evidence to prove I was partial in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving captain Eccleſton from his arreſt and proſecuting him on the ſame charge, but his witneſſes only tend more clearly to prove his obſtinately perſiſting in an error, and attempting to the laſt to juſtify his refractory conduct, and inſtead of eſtabliſhing, combine more ſtrongly with other teſtimony, to refute and falſify his aſſertions, which when he finds he cannot juſtify, actuated by the ſame principle of injuſtice, and a degree of caſuiſtry peculiar to men of his caſt, attempts to extort from his evidences that I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed the court at Chad's-Ford of partiality, and threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to diſſolve them, as if this procedure was any way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with his unjuſt aſperſions, but colonel Adams, who was preſident of that court, and whoſe duty it was upon ſo ungenteel an accuſation to have reprehended me, and who moſt probably, from that conſideration, muſt have remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered the circumſtance, proves to demonſtration that no ſuch accuſation was made, but on the contrary, that I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on the court to determine on the evidence at large on both ſides, and not partially, which, when captain Norwood objected to, and two members, who are now his principal evidences, abſolutely refuſed to include and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine on, then, and not till then, was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

In juſtification of his aſſertion, and to fit the charge of partiality in this inſtance, he has aſſerted
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:016334_0079_0F9C26E103D5B468"/>
and to the laſt inſiſted on it, that the letter I wrote captain Eccleſton was prior to any application made for and on his behalf, and was concerted to court him to make conceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as he phraſes it, though no ſuch were ever required from either, as will appear from captain Eccleſton's teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and the letter itſelf, and notwithſtanding I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly gave him my word of honour I had no ſuch mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and that I could prove by the teſtimony of colonels Woolford, Adams, Ford, majors Steward and Muir, that ſuch application had been made, previous to my writing that letter, and that I required and received an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment in writing from captain Eccleſton before he could be or was relieved from his arreſt, yet theſe declarations, ſolemn and ſacred as they were, have been diſregarded, and I believe I might juſtly add, diſcredited, till the fact was ſo poſitively proved by theſe gentlemens teſtimonies; but the captain now ſays; I have been deceived, my evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences have not proved what they informed me they could; I readily grant that the captain may have been made a a cat's-paw of, perhaps to ſerve the ſecret purpoſes of more deſigning men, who may have had too much art and low cunning to ſtand forth themſelves, but the captain's want of underſtanding and diſcernment to avoid their ſnares, certainly does not juſtify his unjuſt and illiberal reflections on my conduct and character.</p>
               <p>Does not captain Norwood therefore merit the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary puniſhment, by obſtinately perſiſting in his errors, and being influenced by the aſſertions and perſuaſions of his ſuppoſed friends, after I had repeatedly pledged him my honour that application had been made on behalf and by the requeſt of captain Eccleſton before I wrote him the terms on which he would be releaſed and that before I releaſed him from his arreſt I received his acknowledgment in writing, and further, that had he made an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of his error, and Eccleſton declined it, I would have releaſed him and proſecuted Eccleſton; can the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain then after this plead an excuſe for propagating his

And in that inſtance is not the offence doubly ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated? And will not the moſt diligent and active officers in the ſervice be moſt expoſed to ſuch illiberal attacks? Then may we not bid adieu to good order and diſcipline which is ſo ſalutary, and without which no army can long exiſt?</p>
               <p>But the captain, after he finds he can no longer juſtify his aſſertions, ſurmiſes I have been right, and he now has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to blame me for, but not calling upon him for an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Here I would beg leave to remark, that the captain muſt entertain a high opinion of his own importance, becauſe I would not ſuffer him with impunity to commit a breach of orders, and revile my character, he therefore roundly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, and looks upon my proſecution to obtain juſtice and ſet my reputation in a clear light, to be dictated by malice and a ſpirit of perſecution—his ſtrange inconſiſtency and want of candour muſt appear in a very ſtriking light, from the following certificate under the hand of major Muir, the facts recited in which occurred immediately after the

               <p>After the witneſſes had all appeared, and had all been examined before the court, and a certain time given to captain Norwood to make his defence, in paſſing towards the door with myſelf, he exclaimed, that it was very ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing!—that he believed they had been trying to put the general and himſelf by the ears, and that had it not been for two or three perſons, he believed they would have been friends now. I obſerved he (captain Norwood) had been miſinformed; he ſaid he had, and that his witneſſes had not ſupported what they informed him they could.—I made anſwer, the general was not to blame as to that, for application was made to him by ſeveral before captain Eccleſton was releaſed from his arreſt—he replied, he did not blame the general ſo much now, but from the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation made to him by captain Eccleſton, who informed him that he ever did make conceſſions, acknowledge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in fault, or make application to be releaſed from his arreſt, nor requeſted of any perſon to make application for him, that I, or any judicious or impartial man, would think the general partial, by releaſing Eccleſton and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting him on the ſame charge, and aſked me, if it had been my caſe, whether I ſhould not have thought the ſame? I anſwered him, relying on captain Eccleſton's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation, it's very probable I ſhould, but I was ſorry he did not make farther enquiry, or come to an explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when he mentioned it to the general at Chad's-Ford, and the general gave him his word of honour that applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made to him before he releaſed Eccleſton from his arreſt—he ſaid he did not believe the general, as Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſton had ſo poſitively aſſured him to the contrary, and that from the intimacy ſubſiſting between them, and the good opinion he entertained of him, he could not doubt the truth of what he had aſſerted, but he ſaid he ſhould ever be of opinion that the general had a private pique a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; I aſſured him I did not think ſo, for I had
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:016334_0084_0F9C26E4C38732C0"/>
heard the general ſpeak of him as an officer, as favourably as ever I did of any in the line—Yes, he ſaid, I might as an officer, but—I told him I never heard the general ſay any thing againſt him, more than that he was of a haſty fractious diſpoſition; he ſaid he was conſcious he had a private pique againſt him, and ſhould ever remain of that opinion; upon which our converſation ended.</p>

               <p>The captain attempts to compliment himſelf at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of his judgment and candour, for the principles he lays down here, are as ſubverſive of good order and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, as his conduct has been found to be un-officer-like —through the greater part of his defence, the reader will obſerve, that he and his <hi>accomplices</hi> in the compoſition, content themſelves with low inſinuations and humble ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rility, but here, with <hi>their aid,</hi> he breaks forth into <hi>heroics,</hi> and burſting aſunder all obligations, moral, civil, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary, advances a new, but to him <hi>favourite poſition</hi>—that from the principles of liberty, he had a right to think and ſpeak of men and their characters as he pleaſed.</p>

                  <pb n="87" facs="unknown:016334_0086_0F9C26E644226538"/>It has been a prevailing principle and practice with the captain and his aſſociates, to think of men and their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters as they pleaſed, and to inſinuate their opinions in a particular circle as matters of fact, though with ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and caution, that the authority could not be come at; but the captain in this inſtance having been leſs cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect, was caught wandering out of his tract.</p>
               <p>When a commanding officer becomes obnoxious to men of this caſt, by faithfully diſcharging his duty, and exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that of others for the public good, deſpairing of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring his reputation by manly and open accuſations, this lurking method is adopted, to remove, or at leaſt leſſen the weight of an object ſo diſguſting. The captain and his aſſociates come truly under this deſcription—their ſelf-ſufficiency naturally renders them impatient of controul, blind to qualifications in others, and reſtleſs under any command, as they have imbibed ſo tranſcendent an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of their own importance and capacity—perhaps it would not be very difficult to point out geniuſes of this claſs in our line, who have been reſtleſs and diſſati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This ſecure mode of ſtabbing my character in the dark, was firſt eſſayed, whilſt the Maryland troops under my command garriſoned Wilmington, where I twice called in a public manner for the authors, and challenged them to point out a ſingle inſtance, in which I had acted unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an officer and a gentleman, as will appear from the following certificates; but not a man has ever ſtood forth.</p>

The captain replied he wrote it himſelf, the general begged he would excuſe him, he did not mean to diſtreſs him, but was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain he muſt have had aſſiſtance, obſerving that the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and diction was very different from that uſed in his other writings, and told the captain he ſhould, as a preli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary to a reconciliation, require him, on his moſt ſacred honour, to diſcover his accomplices, declaring that he would not ſuffer him or them, or any ſet of men whatever, to ſport with his character or reputation; the captain pauſed—then ſaid it was ſcarce worth while—he could not ſay but there were ſome words not his own, the general ſaid that was one point he ſhould, inſiſt on, and that the captain ſhould renounce and retract his aſſertions, and the exceptionable parts of his defence; the captain ſaid he was now ſenſible he had been miſinformed, and led into a deception, and he was willing to retract his aſſertions, the general ſaid he would ſend him the terms in writing on which he would conſent to a reconciliation, and when the captain complied with them, he would uſe his influence to have him reſtored to his command; the general then took leave of the captain and returned to the troops.</p>

The rear diviſion of priſoners paſſed the poſt at Cheſter on the 8th of December, and the firſt brigade marched on the ninth in their rear, and arrived at Middle-Brook on the 20th, after croſſing the North river. During this interval I never heard of the captain (he was ſuppoſed to be gone home) until my arrival at Middle-Brook—here I was informed he had been lately for ſome days at Elizabeth-Town (of which he gave me no intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) in company with colonel Hall and Mr. Benedict Hall the colonel's brother.</p>
               <p>On the 20th of December, the following note encloſing the captain's <hi>ſealed letter</hi> was ſent to the quarters marked for me, before I had reached them, which I received on the 21ſt.</p>
               <p>Colonel Williams preſents his compliments to general Smallwood, and encloſes him a letter which was directed to his care by captain Norwood at Elizabeth-Town.</p>

               <p>YOUR propoſitions as a condition of my being rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtated was adding inſult to injury, my reſentment for your ill treatment did not require ſuch a ſtimulus, though my delaying it and writing you a letter, dictated in my ill and enfeebled ſtate by a misjudging friend, might lead you into that erroneous opinion, both which errors ſprung from the ſame grounds, for had not my illneſs prevented, I ſhould have demanded of you ſatisfaction for the injuries you had done me as ſoon as the brigade petition in my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour was rejected by his Excellency, which I conceived it was when I ſaw I was referred to your generoſity; which opinion I am perſuaded any gentleman would be of, who ſhould ſee your conditions for reinſtating me, conditions which would heap infamy on aſſaſſins and pickpockets, by breaking that band of faith which men of honour ought to hold dearer than their lives; it will be in vain for you to hope to bury the infamy ot your propoſitions by deſtroying the paper, the principles of them lives in my memory, and ſhall be faithfully reported; I have waited here theſe ten days with the hopes of ſeeing you, but having juſt learnt that you will be down in Maryland this winter, and being extremely anxious to get home, I have delayed my ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction till you come to Baltimore when I have no doubt you will do me that juſtice your injuries and inſults entitles me to demand.</p>

               <p>Here indeed the captain exhibits a ſingular degree of <hi>modeſty,</hi> and muſt have ſuppoſed me inſpired with a ſpirit of divination; <hi>his modeſty</hi> appears in this, that although he came ſeveral days into our encampment at Fiſh-Kill, and by my marque, where I reſided, yet he never thought proper to give me the leaſt intimation of his deſigns, nor did he ever, until he wrote the above letter at Elizabeth-Town, in which he takes this method of inſinuating his faint and unmeaning challenge, which he muſt have

known I could not receive, nor does it appear he intended I ſhould, until he got into Maryland.</p>
               <p>How he could wait ten days at Elizabeth-Town, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of ſeeing me there, without ſuppoſing me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired, ſeems myſterious, for the plain matter of fact is thus—I was poſted at Cheſter (for the purpoſes above re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited) at leaſt ſixty miles from Elizabeth-Town, which lay entirely out of our rout to Middle-Brook, which poſt he muſt know I could not quit without a breach of the orden of the commander in chief, until the rear diviſion of the priſoners paſſed, which he muſt have been ſenſible could not have happened in leſs than ſix days after he wrote his letter at Elizabeth-Town.</p>
               <p>I would remark, that the captain's effrontery and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of ſeeing me, are equally abſurd—Why did he not make this demand at a time when I could with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety have gratified him, and muſt have made a point of doing it, before he had forfeited his rank as an officer, and his character as a gentleman? The public muſt judge of his <hi>Quixotiſm,</hi> and the propriety of my not taking any farther notice of him. I am now at a theatre, and in the line of my duty, where opportunities of chivalry and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievement, much more conſiſtent with my honour, and conducive to the good of my country, frequently occur.</p>
               <p>The captain's languid attempt to ſave appearances, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually expoſes his ſimplicity and arrogance—he could not have thought me ſo far gone in knight-errantry, to travel all the way to Maryland in queſt of an adventure, and to put myſelf on a level with a man, who had forfeited all pretenſions to be taken ſuch notice of, by any man of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, nor is it all the vain efforts of his coadjutors, in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining brigade petitions, certificates, and collected opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in his favour, can avail to reſtore his character, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſtate him in the favour of his country—and I ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after be paſſive to all the captain <hi>himſelf</hi> may ſay, upon a preſumption his ſlanders can have no weight, force, or effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="105" facs="unknown:016334_0104_0F9C26F3C3460B10"/>Having now traced him through all his <hi>windings and doublings,</hi> and left him in a labyrinth, I ſubmit to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial public to decide on his conduct, and my reputation, which I truſt has ever been unblemiſhed, and it ever has, and I hope ever will be my firſt wiſh, to conduct myſelf in ſuch a manner, as to merit their approbation, therefore I have no apprehenſion that their good opinion and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence will be leſſened by any ſecret machinations of the captain, or his aſſociates; and as he may ſtill be under the influence of his evil genius, I ſhall here leave him, wiſhing he may be enlightened with <hi>juſt ſentiments of honour,</hi> and reſtored again to his <hi>proper ſenſes,</hi> which he has affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have loſt.</p>
