            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>BY <hi>LIBERTY,</hi> I underſtand a Freedom of Spirit to act and ſpeak according to the Light and Conviction received, whether agreeably to the Cuſtom of the Land wherein we live, or not. By <hi>Bondage,</hi> I underſtand a Want of that Liberty, or a ſervile Subjection to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Faſhions of the Times as ſuch, even when either we believe them to be repugnant to Juſtice and Truth, or neglect to enquire whether they be ſo or not, altho' ſtrongly called on ſo to do by the Examples and Precepts of our Forefathers, and the ſingular Education they have given us: And according to this Account, I apprehend that thoſe whom we commonly call <hi>Libertines</hi> in our Society, ought to be ranked among the <hi>Captives.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In theſe Lands, indeed, we are favoured, far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond many of our Neighbours, with the Liberty of worſhipping God according to our reſpective Perſuaſions, and our civil Rights and Liberties are in a great Meaſure ſecured to us, and many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us profeſs great Zeal to maintain and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve theſe inviolable, who yet, in Reality, if they examine themſelves impartially, will be found not
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:008486_0003_102F5B8A4D13E298"/>
a Whit better than <hi>Slaves</hi> to a certain moſt potent Idol, whoſe Sway is more deſpotic and more uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal than that of any Monarch upon Earth; that is to ſay, the <hi>God or Spirit of this World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Addreſs comes from one who has long groaned under the Bondage of this Spirit, and who conſequently is not void of a Sympathy with ſuch as may be under the like Circumſtances, and wiſhes for them the like Redemption and Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of the glorious <hi>Liberty of the Sons of God,</hi> after which he himſelf aſpires.</p>
            <p>Now, in the Language of Scripture, <hi>the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of this World</hi> is placed in Oppoſition to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of GOD, as in theſe Expreſſions of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul:</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ii. 12.</note> 
               <hi>Now we have received not the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of this World, but the Spirit which is of</hi> GOD, <hi>that we might know the Things that are freely given us of</hi> GOD: And again, <note n="†" place="bottom">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> iv 4.</note> 
               <hi>The God of this World blinded the Eyes of thoſe from whom the Light of the glorious Goſpel was hid</hi> formerly; and <hi>the Children of this World</hi> are diſtinguiſhed from the <hi>Children of Light</hi> by the Lip of Truth <note n="‡" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> xvi. 8.</note>.</p>
            <p>The View given in this little Tract of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Faſhions of the Lands we live in, affords to me a ſtrong Evidence of the Corruption of the Heart of Man, and that amidſt all our Boaſts of Liberty and Reformation, the World ſtill lies in Wickedneſs; that many ſtill continue to walk in the broad Way; and that but a Few have learned to walk in that ſtrait Path which leads to Life; and ſo the Advice of the Apoſtle, <note n="§" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> xii. 2.</note>

formed to this World, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your Mind,</hi> remains to be very whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and applicable to us at this Day.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> of old boaſted of their being <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Children, and in Bondage to no Man, but the Lip of Truth pronounced them Slaves to Sin; and indeed, altho' Chriſt our Lord was anointed to preach <hi>Deliverance to the Captives</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> iv.</note>, it is to be doubted that but few who bear his Name have obtained the happy Experience of being entirely ſet at Liberty from a Vaſſalage to the Spirit of this World; on the contrary, that this Spirit hath captivated and blinded Multitudes of thoſe called Chriſtians, is too evident in our daily Converſation, from the enchanting or deluſive Power of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Faſhion of the Times, whereby it gives a falſe Luſtre to many abſurd, hurtful and wicked Practices, and (even as ſome called <hi>Evil good</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Iſaiah</hi> v. 20.</note>, <hi>and Good evil, and put Darkneſs for Light, and Light for Darkneſs,</hi> ſo this) frequently repreſents Wrong for Right, and Right for Wrong, and blinds Men both as to their temporal and ſpiritual Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt; and he that dares to be truly Wiſe and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, in Oppoſition to the Torrent of the Times, is commonly the Object of Scorn; in order to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void which, the Many run down with the Stream.</p>
            <p>To ſhew that this is the Caſe in divers Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces peculiarly affecting our religious Society, is the Deſign of this Addreſs, and to repreſent to thoſe who are proper Objects of this Admonition, the Miſery and Folly of their preſent State and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:008486_0005_102F5B92409CB918"/>
as being inconſiſtent not only with the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of Holy Scripture, but the Maxims of ſound Reaſon, and ſuch as claſh even with their temporal Intereſt, and to convince them that they are not only Slaves, but Fools alſo, even as long as they hug their Chains, and do not ſigh and groan for Deliverance.</p>
            <p>That there is a groſs and palpable Declenſion among the preſent Generation of the People cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Quakers,</hi> from the Spirit and Practices of their Predeceſſors, is abundantly manifeſt in the ſeveral Inſtances to be hereafter minutely ſpecified: Nor indeed to thoſe who know how to trace Effects from their Cauſes, is this at all to be wondered at, theſe Tranſgreſſions being no other than the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Productions of the native Soil, the Heart of Man, that hath not been ſubjected to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of the Holy Croſs.</p>
            <p>To dare to oppoſe the modiſh Inundation of the Follies and Extravagancies of the Times, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a Fortitude not born with us, but ſuch as muſt be acquired by no ſmall Share of ſpiritual Induſtry, and indeed a Power more than human.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I bow the Knee to the God and Father of Spirits, that he who is Omnipotent, Omnipreſent, and infinitely good, may vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe ſo far to co-operate with theſe my feeble En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, as to enlighten the Underſtandings, and bend the Wills of thoſe poor Captives to the World's Spirit and Ways, who dare not do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than run with the Multitude, and that he may influence them to a Way of thinking and acting agreeable to the Examples and Precepts of
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:008486_0006_102F5B93C69B0A40"/>
their Fathers, even by the Operation of the ſame Power and Spirit which animated them in their Chriſtian Conflict, being well aware, that nothing ſhort of the ſame Power which raiſed up, can preſerve us a Society to the Glory of GOD, who hath called us, as he did the primitive Chriſtians formerly, unto <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Gal.</hi> v. 13.</note> 
               <hi>Liberty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time, as I am here treating with meer carnal Men, who are no otherwiſe <hi>Quakers</hi> than by meer Accident, and rather indeed by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance than Choice, who have little or no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh for the ſublime Truths of the Goſpel, who vainly flatter themſelves with the Conceit of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, good Senſe, the free Exerciſe of their ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Faculties, and juſt Apprehenſions of their own temporal Intereſt and Honour, I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to reaſon with them upon their own Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, even as Babes are to be fed with Milk, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unable to bear ſtronger Meat: For indeed, if one were to ſpeak to ſuch meerly of Self-denial and Mortification, or of the glorious Privileges of the <hi>free</hi> Citizens of the <hi>New-Jeruſalem,</hi> or of the Vanity of all worldly Enjoyments, or of the Joys of Heaven, reſerved for thoſe who bear the Croſs here; or were one to affirm, with great Truth, that this People with whom they profeſs Fellowſhip, are ſignalized by two ſpecial Marks of the Favour of Divine Providence, <hi>viz.</hi> in the raiſing up a Miniſtry agreeable to Chriſt's own Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, and in eſtabliſhing Chriſtian Diſcipline among us, it is very probable he might meet with no better Treatment than that which <hi>Felix</hi> the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:008486_0007_102F5B9557304B68"/>
Governor gave <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle, in theſe Words, <hi>Go thy Way,</hi>

               <hi>and when I have a convenient Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, I will call for thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if one ſpeak to them, of Liberty, and of temporal Honour and Intereſt, and of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency of their Conduct with ſound Reaſon and good Senſe, they may, perhaps, vouchſafe to lend an Ear; for which Reaſon the chief Tendency of this Work is to ſhew them that their Conduct is neither conſiſtent with Liberty, ſound Policy and good Senſe, nor with their own temporal Honour and Intereſt; and if once the ſandy Foundation upon which they have been building comes to be ſhaken, they may poſſibly think of digging deeper for a better, which is what hath been very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, earneſtly and juſtly recommended to them by our Brethren of the Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>And indeed it muſt be owned, that a meer Conformity to the Traditions of the Elders in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior Matters, is far from entitling any Man to the Kingdom of Heaven, and ſo is every Thing ſhort of <hi>Regeneration</hi>

            <p>But before I proceed to the Work itſelf, it ſeems neceſſary to obviate one Objection that I am well aware will be made againſt the whole Tenor of it, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> Here is a great Pother about exterior Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, in all which it is very poſſible for a Man to be exact, even to a Tittle, and yet have no Right to the Kingdom of Heaven: And this is begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at the wrong End, the Outſide inſtead of the Inſide: regulate this laſt, and a Regulation of
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:008486_0016_102F5BAE96C281F0"/>
the other will immediately follow. I anſwer firſt, that I freely grant that nothing ſhort of Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration can give Admittance into the Kingdom of GOD; and that altho' I have ſaid many Things to evince that the Spirit of the World is a Spirit of Error and Deluſion, yet I muſt own, in the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the beloved Diſciple <note n="‡" place="bottom">1 <hi>John</hi> v.</note>, that "What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever (and indeed nothing but what) is born of GOD overcometh the <hi>World,</hi> and that this is the Victory that overcometh the <hi>World,</hi> even our Faith," which is <hi>the Gift of God</hi> 
               <note n="§" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Eph.</hi> ii. 8.</note>.</p>
            <p>But, in the mean time, I do not apprehend that this diſcharges either Parents from a Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance over their Children, or Elders from an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſight of the Flock, in reſpect to theſe exterior Matters.</p>
            <p>As to the New Birth, and the Gift of Faith, it is not in the Power of the Parent to convey theſe to his Children, but yet this ſhould not hinder him from conveying to them what he can.</p>
            <p>Now here is, in the Suppoſition implied in the Objection, a Parent who hath himſelf happily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced the Advantages of a Life and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation conducted in the Ways of Truth and Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, Temperance, Sobriety and Frugality, and of an Education exempting him from many Snares and Temptations to Vice, to which many others are expoſed.</p>
            <p>Shall a Parent thus ſituated abandon his Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring during a State of Minority, Ignorance and Weakneſs, to Nature, or to corrupt Company, and if viciouſly inclined (as indeed the Seeds of
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:008486_0017_102F5BB17B321938"/>
Evil ſoon appear even in Children) put no Yoke, or lay no Reſtraint, and exerciſe no Diſcipline on him in his Youth? This would be a Neglect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by all wiſe Nations; and, on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, it is allowed to be the indiſpenſible Duty of Parents to train up their Children in the Way wherein they ought hereafter to walk, to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to them the Sweetneſs of Virtue, and keep them out of the Road to Vice as much as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, by Inſtructions, by Example, by Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Reſtraints properly exerciſed: By this Means, in the more tractable Diſpoſitions, the Practice of Virtue will become familiar, or at leaſt good Habits will be contracted, and our Youth will be kept out of the Way of thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Temptations which daily captivate the giddy Multitude, and they will be more capable of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and higher Impreſſions, than if, by an early Indulgence of a Conformity to the modiſh Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of a degenerate Age, evil Habits had been contracted, very difficult to be afterwards o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome.</p>
            <p>Now if ſuch be the Duty of Parents with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to their Offspring, undoubtedly Miniſters and Elders ought to countenance and co-operate with theſe Endeavours, thoſe eſpecially whom the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt</hi> hath now, as formerly, made <hi>Overſeers,</hi> not neglecting to recommend higher and nobler Principles of Action than meer Education and Tradition; and when the Religion of our Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation becomes the Religion of our Judgment and Choice; when we, and thoſe of the ſucceeding Ages, become thoroughly convinced that a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

Ends; but if Men will not be content with the bountiful Proviſion of GOD in Nature, nor know how to prize any Thing but what comes from far, and coſts them dear; and if ſuch be the prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Taſte and Mode of a Country ſet up by the Rich and Great, thoſe of middle and inferior Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whoſe Wills have not been ſubdued by the Diſcipline of the holy Croſs, ſo far as to enable them to reject and deny, but who on the contrary are embracing that Maxim, that it were <hi>better to be out of the World than out of the Faſhion,</hi> will of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten find Difficulties enough in procuring to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves what they may vainly imagine to be the Conveniencies of Life, or, in other Terms, to eat, drink and dreſs, as others do.</p>
               <p>And indeed ſuch, at this preſent Time, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly the Caſe of theſe Countries, where even the lower Claſs of the People will not ſit down to their Breakfaſt without Supplies from both the <hi>Indies,</hi> and where the Drink, deſigned by Nature chiefly as a Vehicle for our Food, often coſts more than the Meat, and muſt, in a great Meaſure, be imported from Abroad, as alſo no ſmall Part of the Cloathing of the Body, and Furniture of our Houſes.</p>

               <p>And here it would ſeem utterly inexcuſable to paſs by in Silence, a certain lately introduced, and now greatly prevailing Faſhion, <hi>viz.</hi> that of drinking <hi>ſpirituous Liquors,</hi> in Behalf of which whatever may be alledged of their Uſe as a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, it is moſt certain, that the ordinary Uſe of them, challenges the firſt Rank among Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities, in drinking, to be condemned, as being highly injurious to our Bodies, Souls and Eſtates: And were we as a People thoroughly poſſeſſed of the true Spirit of Chriſtian Moderation, we ſhould
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:008486_0026_102F5BCA28182518"/>
be no leſs diſtinguiſhed, by a peculiar Self-denial and Abſtinence, in this, than in other Reſpects; and I obſerve with Pleaſure, among the many ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Counſels from Time to Time tranſmitted to us by that Honourable Aſſembly, the yearly Meeting of <hi>London,</hi> we have a particular Caution againſt this growing and dangerous Evil, in the Year 1754.</p>
               <p>It appears from the Writings of our Elders, that <hi>Faſting</hi> was not unfrequently practiſed by them as they were occaſionally and voluntarily led there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into, by the heavenly Wiſdom; a Practice alſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in the primitive Church, and on many Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions highly conducive to the Health of both Body and Mind, tho' it ſeems, of late Years, to be much out of Uſe; nor indeed hath the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance and Moderation ſuitable to our Profeſſion always manifeſted itſelf in the ſpreading of our Tables, but Pomp and Orientation too frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been conſulted on this Occaſion; of which it ſeems not unneceſſary to ſpecify one ſignal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, becauſe many are Sufferers by it, <hi>viz.</hi> that altho' by Virtue of our Education we enjoy an Exemption from the vain and ſuperfluous Expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces attending Births and Burials, yet at <hi>Marriages</hi> many of us, notwithſtanding the reiterated Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts given forth to the contrary, are remarkably more profuſe than our Neighbours, and many of the poorer Sort are led on blindly, in this, as in other Caſes, by the Example of the Rich and Great, to ſuch Exceſſes as are not only inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with our Chriſtian Teſtimony, but very hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to their temporal Intereſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="unknown:008486_0027_102F5BCEEED44800"/>Beſide this, there is a certain particular Inſtance, both of Superfluity and Unſeaſonableneſs, with regard to Eating and Drinking, which ſeems not unworthy of ſome Animadverſion in this Place.</p>
               <p>It was a Statute enjoined by GOD himſelf to <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons, and to remain in Force for ever throughout their Generations, <hi>Ye</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Levit.</hi> x. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>ſhall not drink Wine nor ſtrong Drink, when ye go into the Tabernacle of the Congregation, leſt ye die;</hi> and the Reaſon ſubjoined in the following Verſes, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>they might put Difference between holy and unholy, between clean and unlean,</hi> and might <hi>teach the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>all the Statutes which the Lord had ſpoken,</hi> is applicable alſo in Chriſtian Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, and to all Intemperance in Eating and Drinking on ſuch Occaſions; nor is a calm Sere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Mind, undiſturbed by the Fumes of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digeſtion and Exceſs, leſs neceſſary to thoſe who are to learn divine Truths, than to thoſe who are to teach them.</p>
               <p>Upon this Principle, it was an ancient Cuſtom to eat and drink ſparingly before a Meeting for divine Worſhip, a Cuſtom from which I obſerve with Concern too many to deviate to their own private Hurt, as well as that of their Families, and particularly of their Servants, who by Reaſon of the Proviſion they muſt make for their Maſters Bellies, are obliged to ſtay at Home; and this I take to be one Cauſe of the Irreligion and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluteneſs of Servants, greatly complained of; and if ſome of the Servants of our Community, ſhould more peculiarly ſuffer on this Account, it
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:008486_0028_102F5BD075649440"/>
were not to be wondered at, becauſe theſe (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding divers wholeſome Advices to the contrary) are too much deprived of thoſe Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities for ſpiritual Improvement, and it is to be doubted have but rarely any other <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>Some worthy Elders have placed the Uſe of Tobacco, among <hi>Superfluities,</hi> and indeed the ordinary Uſe of it, has no better Authority for its Support than ſeveral other Things here ſpoken of, <hi>viz. Faſhion.</hi> It is far more frequently injurious than condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive to Health, and the intemperate and unſeaſonable Uſe of that as well as every other Gift of Nature, is to be condemned; and ſuch undoubtedly is the Introduction of it in the Uſe of Snuff without Neceſſity into our Meetings for Worſhip, as interrupting the awful Solemnity proper to that Occaſion.</p>
                     <p>This indeed is one of thoſe Things, which ſome Men call little, but when it comes in Competition with our Duty to God, and our Souls, it ceaſes to be ſuch in the View of enlightened and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livened Minds.</p>
                  </note>.</p>
               <p>There is moreover one Practice extremely fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in theſe Countries which has ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion with Superfluity in Drinking, as to be a great Provocative to it, and from which the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege we enjoy of a happy Exemption, by Virtue of our Education, is undoubtedly high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be valued; that is to ſay, what is called <hi>Drinking of Healths,</hi> by as great a Soleciſm in Speech, as it is an Abſurdity in Practice; and as it ſometimes happens, that ſome weak Brethren are betrayed into mean Compliances in this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, I ſhall particularly conſider it.</p>
               <p>About the Time of the Reſtoration, <hi>George Fox</hi> met with a good Deal of Trouble for declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to drink, even the King's Health, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then commonly urged as a Teſt of Loyalty, he as wiſely, as meekly, anſwered, that <hi>Men ought to drink for their own Healths:</hi> But our Countrymen, of late, have made much farther
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:008486_0029_102F5BD204D8B130"/>
Advances in this Affair, by a Contrivance of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Words, expreſſive of ſeveral of their Wiſhes, as of Proſperity, or Succeſs, to this, that, and the other Perſon, or Undertaking, to be pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced over each Glaſs, and theſe ſometimes greatly multiplied, whereby they allure both themſelves and others to drinking to Exceſs, more effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than the meer Liquor, without this Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment annexed to it, were able to do; I ſay, drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Exceſs, a Vice which need not be promot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by theſe ſtudied Arts, being the reigning Sin of theſe Nations, which is daily ſpreading its doleful Ravages over the Souls, Bodies, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates of Men of all Stations; and hence ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Quarrels enſue, beſides the Abuſe of GOD's good Gifts; and ſome of thoſe, who are herein concerned, ſometimes prove a Kind of Martyrs to <hi>Belial,</hi> even drinking what they call other Mens Health and Proſperity, at the Loſs and Deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their own.</p>
               <p>Now it is a peculiar Happineſs to thoſe of our Profeſſion, that by an eſtabliſhed Rule, this Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice is utterly declined among us. It is true, we are hereby rendered very unfit Aſſociates for theſe Men, and in ſome Meaſure, excluded from much of that Society, which a corrupt Age calls <hi>Good-Fellowſhip;</hi> but this, in the View of wiſe Men, is ſo far from being a Loſs, that it is a Means of conſiderable Gain to them, with Reſpect to the Preſervation of the Health of Body and Mind, and the Saving of Time and outward Treaſure, all which are ſhamefully, not to ſay, wickedly, ſquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered away on this Occaſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="unknown:008486_0030_102F5BD4A2E54DC8"/>As to <hi>Superfluities in Apparel,</hi> the like Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations that have been made with reſpect to eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drinking, may alſo juſtly be applied to an inordinate Curioſity with reſpect to what we ſhall put on, as being not only an expreſs Breach of the above mentioned Precept of our Lord, <hi>Take no Thought what ye ſhall eat, what ye ſhall drink, or wherewithal ye ſhall be clothed,</hi> but in a People who have ſet out with a Profeſſion of regarding only the juſt and lawful Ends of Cloathing, the Uſe and real Service, and not the Pomp and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtentation annexed hereunto, and of being at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty from a ſervile Compliance with the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleeting Faſhions of the Times; in ſuch a People I ſay, an inordinate Curioſity in Apparel, and much more an awkward and affected Mimickry of the meer prevailing Faſhion, as ſuch, is not only a ridiculous Inconſiſtency, and an Argument of a ſervile Subjection to the <hi>Spirit of this World,</hi> but is alſo attended with no ſmall Profuſion of Expence, beſides Care and precious Time, very capable of being better applied, all which they are intitled to an Exemption from, both by the Precepts and Examples of their Predeceſſors.</p>
               <p>We are indeed ſtill diſtinguiſhed from our Neighbours by a peculiar Simplicity in our Garb, but notwithſtanding all the Precepts that have been given forth to the contrary, an Affectation of the Ways of the World frequently betrays itſelf among many of our Profeſſion: It is true, Gold and Silver Lace have not as yet found Admittance, but the ſame Thing cannot be affirmed of ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Ribbons, and ſome other Things, which of
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:008486_0031_102F5BD62B801BC0"/>
late frequently diſgrace our religious Aſſemblies, the Introduction of which, however, impartially examined, will appear to proceed from the ſame Spirit and Origin as the other, being calculated neither to anſwer the lawful Deſign of Apparel, nor the awful Ends of religious Meetings, but for Oſtentation.</p>
               <p>Before I diſmiſs the Conſideration of Superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity in Apparel, I ſhall conſider one groſs and pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable Inſtance thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> that Diſtinction of Habit which is uſed by ſome as a Token of <hi>Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Dead,</hi> a Cuſtom of no more Uſe to the Dead, than thoſe Garlands with which ſome affect to adorn their Graves, and a ſuperfluous Expence and Burthen on the Living, even on ſuch who dare not do otherwiſe than ſubmit to the Ordinances of that Idol, Faſhion, although many of the thinking Part of them, would be very glad of ſuch a Privilege of an Exemption from it as we by Virtue of our Education enjoy.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, that any under our Profeſſion ſhould manifeſt a ſtrong Diſpoſition to creep into this Practice; betrays both great Stupidity, and want of a Senſe of the Value of the Liberty purchaſed for them by their Anceſtors, and at the ſame time a ſlaviſh Subjection to the Spirit of the World, the Folly of which is peculiarly aggravated by its being voluntary, and of their own chooſing.</p>
               <p>Such, who fall into this mean Compliance, dare not ſay, that it proceeds from a greater De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Affection they have for their deceaſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, than theſe had for theirs, whilſt they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wore this Mark of Sorrow: And if it be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:008486_0032_102F5BDB265FF1B0"/>
that the Deceaſed have made a happy Change, it is contrary to the Advice of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>to be ſorry as thoſe who have no Hope</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> iv. 13.</note>; but if otherwiſe, they dare not ſay, that the wearing of black Veſtures will influence the righteous Judge of Heaven and Earth, to reverſe his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree; wherefore this Appearance reſults in, and appears to be no other than, an affected Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to <hi>Faſhion,</hi> as ſuch.</p>
               <p>It is, moreover, an Appearance at this Juncture particularly unſeaſonable, even when judicious Perſons of other Societies are groaning under, and ſome of them ridiculing the vain and ſuperfluous Pomps attending Funerals, and tends to eraſe and deſtroy the good Impreſſions which, by our Means, might otherwiſe be made on the more thinking and impartial Obſervers, ſo that ſuch, who thus deviate from the Simplicity proper to their Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in this Reſpect, may be deemed a Kind of dark Lanthorns, tending to ſtop the Progreſs of the Light of Reformation: And this alſo, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with many other Inſtances of Degeneracy from the primitive Example, tends to outward Poverty; and theſe Conſequences are chargeable chiefly on the Rich and Great, as Faſhion-mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, whom the lower Ranks are very prone blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to follow, tho' in Oppoſition to their own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt.</p>
               <p>Theſe Obſervations may alſo be applied to the <hi>Furniture of Houſes,</hi> which, according to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh, luxurious Taſte of the preſent Times, proves a heavy Piece of Drudgery to ſome poor Men,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:008486_0033_102F5BDDCADBADA8"/>
who dare not do otherwiſe than ſubmit their Necks to the Yoke of the aforeſaid Tyrant; Faſhion; but that ſuch, who in ſome Inſtances profeſs themſelves to be called out of the Corruptions of the World, and who, by Virtue of their Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are intitled to the Privilege of an Exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from a Conformity of this Sort, ſhould ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt a ſtrong Affectation of, and be voluntarily led into, ſome of the moſt pompous and expenſive Parts of Furniture, ſuch as large Looking-glaſſes, curious Tables; Pictures, Prints, Portraitures or other Repreſentations hung up, not for real Service, but meer Oſtentation, is, in my View, a ſtrong E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence; how far the God or Spirit of this World is able to blind Men, both with regard to a juſt Senſe of the true Honour due to an uniform, conſiſtent Character and Conduct, and of their own temporal Intereſt.</p>

               <p>IT hath been inſinuated by ſome critical Obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, not much to the Credit of our People, that altho' we are diſtinguiſhed from our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, by retrenching ſome particular Superflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in Garb and Furniture, yet that in Point of the Purſuit of Riches, we are not diſtinguiſhed by a correſpondent Moderation, but are as inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate, and not a Whit leſs covetous than others: And indeed, to vindicate all who conform to our
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:008486_0034_102F5BDF525D6E68"/>
Rules, in Point of Garb, and external Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, from this Charge, were a Taſk I would not undertake; and moreover, as Covetouſneſs is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily diſguiſed by the ſpecious Cloaks of Induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and Frugality, it becomes leſs obvious to that clear Diſcovery, and juſt Cenſure, to which other Vices are expoſed.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, I am aſſured, from a diligent Search into the Records of the Senſe and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Elders, particularly thoſe of this Nation, that they were ever ſteady, not only in the Perſuaſion that Superfluity in Trading and Farming was equally dangerous and entangling, or rather more peculiarly ſo, to the Chriſtian Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier <note n="*" place="bottom">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> ii. 4.</note>, than the Superfluities above mentioned; but, moreover, that in their Meetings of Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence they did not neglect to enquire how far their Brethren did maintain the Chriſtian Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony GOD had called them to bear, in this as well as in other Reſpects, declaring, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Purſuit of worldly Riches and Grandeur, tended to darken the Minds, and alienate the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of Men from the ſpiritual Riches; and that the Cares and Incumbrances of this Life, choaked the good Seed, and hindered it from bringing forth Fruit, and admoniſhing ſuch as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be overwhelmed therewith) and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed with a great Deal of Reaſon.</p>
               <p>For our peculiar Profeſſion entitles us to an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption from thoſe Occaſions of Expence above mentioned, conſiſting in divers Superfluities in Meats, Drinks, Apparel, Furniture, and Recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:008486_0035_102F5BE0DB8C2790"/>
which captivate others, from a blind De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion to that Idol, <hi>Faſhion,</hi> to whoſe Yoke they dare not but ſubmit their Necks; but, to a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple thus profeſſing and maintaining a Conduct a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to ſuch a Profeſſion, large Trades and Farms, and great Multiplicity of Buſineſs, were quite unneceſſary, and indeed among ſuch a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, could naturally have no other Effect, than to accumulate Wealth, without having the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Opportunities of ſpending it, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to lay a ſtrong Temptation before an Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring, who, in a State of Nature, are no better than the meer Sons of fallen <hi>Adam,</hi> to ſhake off their religious Profeſſion, in order, with the leſs Reſtraint, to gratify their carnal Appetites, according to the vain Spirit, and Courſe of this World and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly this has been the Door at which great Numbers, not to ſay the greater Part of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendants of the Rich and Great, have gone <note n="*" place="bottom">The divine Wiſdom clearly pointed out the like Danger at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending his choſen People <hi>Iſrael,</hi> formerly, who when they ſhould be poſſeſſed of Vineyards and Olive-trees, which they planted not, and ſhould have eaten and be full, then (ſaith God by his Servant <hi>Moſes) beware leſt thou forget the Lord, which brought thee forth out of the Land of Egypt, from the Houſe of Bondage.</hi>

                  <hi>SECT. IV.</hi> Of the vain Honours of this World.</head>
               <p>HAVING ſo far conſidered the Self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of our Forefathers, in Relation to the Pleaſures and Profits, I ſhall next conſider the ſame Thing, in Reference to the Honours of this World.</p>
               <p>Previous to this, it ſeems worth remarking, that if we be able to make a proper Eſtimate with regard to the ſpiritual Life, it will appear to us a peculiarly happy Circumſtance, that, by our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Profeſſion, we are excluded from all thoſe Poſts of Honour and Profit under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which afford ample Proviſion for many others, ſince by this Excluſion many of us are neceſſitated to exerciſe the Arts of Induſtry, in order to the Support of our Families, and ſo put in a Way of being preſerved from, Idleneſs, the
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:008486_0040_102F5BF085B3BB68"/>
Mother of Vice; and altho', in Conſequence here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, we may not ſuddenly grow rich, yet we have generally enough to ſupply our real Wants, and enable us to live conſiſtently with our Profeſſion, of renouncing Superfluities of all Kinds, which if we do, many Snares and Temptations attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Affluence are cut off, and we have the more Leiſure and Opportunity for Meditation, and other ſpiritual Exerciſes, and laying up Treaſure in Heaven.</p>
               <p>And as, in Conſequence of our Profeſſion, we are in a great Meaſure excluded from receiving the Honours of this World, ſo likewiſe are we, by the ſame Profeſſion, reſtrained from giving the ſame to others.</p>
               <p>Now the Objects of worldly Honour, are ſplendid Apparel and Equipage, empty Titles, and large Revenues, theſe being the Things which, as <hi>William Penn</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">No Croſs, No Crown.</note> obſerves, the Children of the <hi>World</hi> worſhip; and indeed ſo inordinate is the Veneration paid to Men on Account of theſe Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications, that many downright Lies are daily told, the Rules of Grammar and good Senſe are violated, and thoſe Marks of Reſpect, which are proper to Almighty GOD, are given to mortal Men like ourſelves; Practices which, how much ſoever they may have received a Sanction from Cuſtom, are in our View by no Means to be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, which nevertheleſs, becauſe ſome of this Profeſſion have ſometimes been ſhamed into, I ſhall proceed minutely to conſider, in order to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict them, in this Caſe alſo, of a ſervile Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

to the Spirit and Maxims of this Worlds in Oppoſition to the Examples and Precepts of holy Men, recorded in Scripture.</p>
               <p>The firſt Inſtance of worldly Honour I ſhall conſider, which we conſcientiouſly deny to give, is in the Uſe of <hi>flattering Titles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The above mentioned Author reprehends the modern Profeſſors of Chriſtianity, as widely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viating from the Simplicity of the more early Ages, both among Jews, Heathens and Chriſtians, who were never wont to diſtinguiſh their Saints and Heroes by the Title of Lord, as Lord <hi>Noah,</hi> Lord <hi>Daniel,</hi> Lord <hi>Peter,</hi> Lord <hi>Paul,</hi> Lord <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> Lord <hi>Cato, &amp;c.</hi> whilſt we are very laviſh in beſtowing not only theſe, but many other ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Epithets, ſuch as <hi>your Excellency,</hi> your <hi>Grace, Honourable,</hi> and <hi>Right Honourable, Worſhipful, &amp;c.</hi> reſpectively appropriated to certain Perſons among us by a licentious Uſe of Speech, from no better Authority than that of the Cuſtom of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, without conſidering whether theſe Titles be juſtly given or no, or whether to Perſons real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſſeſſed of the Qualities aſcribed to them, or not: And he that refuſeth to give theſe Titles is deemed ſqueamiſh or ſuperſtitious, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the inviolable Rules of ſound Morality, as well as the Precepts of Scripture <note n="*" place="bottom">

               </p>
               <p>Next, as the Honour of the <hi>Hat</hi> and <hi>Knee,</hi> certain mean and pitiful Compliances, that are beginning to creep in among us, not only the

Men, with reſpect to the Hat, but even among ſome of the female Sex, who, tho' they have leſs Temptation to ſuch a Deviation, have learned to bend the Knee; I ſay, theſe mean and pitiful Compliances, altho' inconſiſtent, and ſelf-contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory in many of thoſe who fall into them, who ſometimes give, and ſometimes refuſe theſe Marks of Reverence to mortal Men, which by their Anceſtors were ever deemed proper to Almighty GOD only, ſeem to render it not unſeaſonable to enter into a ſomewhat minute Conſideration here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>In theſe Countries, indeed, Kings, and even Biſhops, muſt be approached on the Knee, which is no better than a confounding, or making no Difference between, the outward Marks of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence paid unto mortal Man, and which were ever, both under the Old and New Teſtament, paid unto Almighty GOD, and who indeed hath expreſly appropriated this outward Mark of Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Submiſſion to himſelf, in the following Texts: <hi>Unto me every Knee ſhall bow</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And we find that <hi>Peter,</hi> the Apoſtle, refuſed to accept of this Mark of Reſpect paid him by <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius;</hi> for <note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>If any ſhould here alledge, we do not bend the Knee with an Intent to worſhip Men, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip being proper to Almighty GOD only; then let them reject the Word <hi>Worſhipful</hi> from among the Titles they give to mortal Men, and, when they have done that, let them conſider how far it is fit to give to mortal Man that which, both by the Writings of the Old and New Teſtament, and the Practice of all Ages, is allowed to be a proper Mark of Adoration.</p>
               <p>The like may be ſaid concerning <hi>uncovering the Head,</hi> in Teſtimony of Reſpect to mortal Man, an Appearance ever deemed proper to the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of public divine Worſhip, or of the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Gifts of Praying, [and Propheſying or Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Church] even from the Days of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> 
                  <note n="‡" place="bottom">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xi.</note> unto this Time.</p>
               <p>Such are the Grounds of our Sentiments and Practice in theſe Caſes; and our Elders, for the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:008486_0044_102F5BFCD4AC05D0"/>
of their Conduct, in conſcientiouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to uncover their Heads, in Token of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to mortal Men, were ſometimes fined and impriſoned; a Singularity ſupported by weighty Reaſons, the Validity whereof appeared by the Teſt it proved, and by the Diſcovery it made, of the Pride and Rage of vain Man, who would not be content with leſs Tokens of Honour, than thoſe which we apprehend to be proper to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty GOD only.</p>
               <p>And ſince our Forefathers, by their Conſtancy and Perſeverance in this Inſtance of Self-denial, have ſo far wearied out the Spirit of Oppoſition and Perſecution, which had been raiſed on theſe Occaſions, as to have rendered the ſame Sort of Conduct eaſy to us their Succeſſors, what but a ſlaviſh Subjection to the ill grounded Maxims and Spirit of this World, is the Cauſe that induces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny under our Denomination, who have been ſo taught, and ſo believed, to mean Compliances in theſe Reſpects?</p>
               <p>But, to return to the Uſe of <hi>flattering Titles;</hi> it ſeems abſolutely neceſſary to take Notice of one of thoſe which is the moſt common, and ſuch as moſt frequently occurs in the daily Addreſſes of almoſt all Mankind to one another in theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, where Cuſtom has ordained that we muſt not ordinarily accoſt, nor ſpeak of, or to, any one, whether he be our Superior, or our Equal, or perhaps our Inferior, by his diſtinguiſhing Name of <hi>John, Thomas, &amp;c.</hi> without annexing to it ſome Title of Maſterſhip, Dominion or Lordſhip, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe of <hi>Maſter, Miſtreſs, Sir,</hi> or <hi>Madam,</hi>
                  <pb n="47" facs="unknown:008486_0045_102F5BFE5AEEDA08"/>
or rather <hi>Ma Dame, i. e.</hi> My Lady, this laſt Term being borrowed from the <hi>French</hi> (a Nation far more diſtinguiſhed by their Affectation of Compliments, than by their Sincerity) whom we are too fond of imitating; nor in Writing, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude our Letters, without ſubſcribing ourſelves <hi>Humble Servants</hi> to the Perſon to whom we write; and indeed ſuch is the enchanting Power of the Spirit of this World in this Caſe, that it frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proves, in common Converſation, no ſmall De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Self-denial, to adhere to the Simplicity of calling every one by their diſtinguiſhing Name, without annexing one of theſe flattering Epithets to it; and accordingly great Numbers of thoſe who bear our Name are daily, in this Inſtance al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, betrayed and ſhamed into mean Compliances; or, in other Terms, a ſervile Subjection to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Maxims of a depraved Age.</p>
               <p>For indeed, how minute and trivial ſoever this Affair may appear to ſome, and how much ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver long eſtabliſhed Cuſtom may ſeem to have given a Sanction to this Licentiouſneſs in Speech, Cuſtom can never alter the Nature of Things, or render that to be Truth which is Falſhood, or make it juſt to call him Maſter, who is not ſuch.</p>

               <p>The Concluſion therefore is clear, that when any of us (who are thus convinced, not by meer Tradition, but by the Reaſons on which the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is founded) fall into the Practice of the World in this Caſe, it is an Evidence that our Souls are yet in Bondage to the Spirit of this World, whoſe falſe Maxims we want Courage and Honeſty to contradict.</p>
               <p>Another ſtrong Inſtance of the deſpotic Sway of that Idol, <hi>Faſhion,</hi> and than which a ſtronger can hardly be given, is that abſurd Innovation in our Language, which now almoſt univerſally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails, <hi>viz.</hi> that no ſingle Perſon muſt be accoſted but by a Term originally and properly expreſſive of more than One; ſo that, as the Edicts of Princes are commonly given forth in the firſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon plural, in the Terms, <hi>We</hi> command, and <hi>Our</hi> royal Pleaſure is, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the like Air of Grandeur muſt alſo be transferred to private Perſons, in the
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:008486_0047_102F5C0165712CB0"/>
Uſe of the ſecond Perſon plural, inſtead of the ſecond Perſon ſingular; and ſo far eſtabliſhed is this Cuſtom, in this Age of boaſted Potiteneſs, that he who dares to decline it, is liable to be deemed either a meer Clown, or ridiculouſly ſqueamiſh and ſuperſtitious.</p>
               <p>And, indeed, I make no Scruple of acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging, that the Cuſtom of the Country we live in, where it neither claſhes with the Rules of good Senſe, nor Virtue, ought ſcarcely to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from, and that affected Singularities, in Speech or Manners, are rather an Evidence of Pride, than of Chriſtian Virtue; but if the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom be ſuch as does not anſwer the juſt Ends of Speech, but tends to introduce Ambiguity or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion into our Language, or if it has been not only originally introduced, but is ſtill ſupported by the Pride and Vanity of Man, then the declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſuch a Cuſtom, from ſuch a Perſuaſion, becomes an Inſtance of Self-denial and Chriſtian Courage, even in daring to oppoſe the eſtabliſhed Faſhion of a miſtaken and depraved Age.</p>
               <p>Now, that this is really the Caſe with reſpect to the Uſe of the Word <hi>You,</hi> as applied to a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Perſon, is evident from the Confuſion of the ſingular and plural Number thereby made, and its Tendency to rob our Language of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouns <hi>Thou</hi> and <hi>Thee,</hi> peculiarly and diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly expreſſive of the ſingular Number, whilſt the Word <hi>You</hi> is equivocal, and, according to the modern Corruption, equally applicable to <hi>One,</hi> and to more than one, a Licentiouſneſs of Speech, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the Deſign thereof.</p>

                  <pb n="50" facs="unknown:008486_0048_102F5C06475F67C8"/>And moreover, that this Corruption of Speech hath been ſupported by the Pride of vain Man, appears from the rough and harm Treatment our Forefathers at firſt met with, on Account of their Adherence to the Uſe of the Words <hi>Thou</hi> and <hi>Thee,</hi> whilſt at the ſame time it was univerſally acknowledged, that the Uſe of thoſe Words was moſt conſiſtent with the awful Solemnity and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence proper to our Addreſſes to Almighty GOD; and accordingly they are retained in the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Forms of Prayer; and yet an Inferior, or a Beggar might be, and ſtill is, frequently thus ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſted, but the accoſting of an Equal or Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or in this Manner, was, and ſtill is, by many deemed Rudeneſs, and accordingly was frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwered by contemptuous Speeches and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, a ſure Teſt of that Pride and Vanity which ought not to be gratified, but humbled, and than which indeed ſcarce any Thing can be more abſurd, even that Men ſhould reſent, as an Indignity, their being addreſſed in that very Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, in which they themſelves addreſs the great Sovereign of the Univerſe.</p>
               <p>Such were and are the Sentiments and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour of our Anceſtors, and all their faithful Succeſſors; and ſuch are the Grounds of our Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity in this Caſe: Wherefore, the mean Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliances which of later Days have greatly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed among thoſe who otherwiſe profeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be of our Community, who vary their Language according to their Company, and are aſhamed to accoſt Strangers according to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Simplicity; are Evidences of a Servility

and Bondage to the Spirit of this World, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray a Want of that Chriſtian Fortitude, which did and would ſupport under popular Contempt and Reproaches <note n="*" place="bottom">I am Informed that this Corruption of Speech was firſt intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in the declining State of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and that the firſt notable Inſtance of it occurs about the fourth Century, in the Reign of the Emperors <hi>Valentinian</hi> and <hi>Valens,</hi> when <hi>Valens</hi> was addreſſed in theſe Term: <hi>"Domino Valenti Gothico, maximo, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuo &amp; auguſto"</hi> "To the Lord <hi>Valens,</hi> moſt great, perpetual and auguſt;" as may be ſeen in <hi>Eutropius</hi>'s Abridgment of the <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtory, where alſo (Chap. xii. Book 1.) the Words <hi>Tranquilitas veſtra</hi> are applied to the Emperor, the Titles of <hi>Manſuetudo</hi> (Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency) and ſeveral others, having (as the learned Annotator, tho' not of our Community, obſerves) been applied to the Emperors, as <hi>his Majeſty</hi> is now a Days to Kings and that theſe Titles were introduced not long before theſe Times, by the ſordid Flattery of the People, and the Want of Senſe and Modeſty in the Emperors, who tamely ſuffered themſelves to be addreſſed in ſuch Kind of Language, as was proper only to the Deity; the old <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> (as the ſame Author obſerves) having been wholly Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to any Thing of this Kind: Upon which it is obvious to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, that thoſe of our Society who in theſe Inſtances fail into mean Compliances, whilſt they profeſs themſelves to be of the ſtricteſt Chriſtians, do herein follow no better an Example than that of the moſt corrupt and degenerate Heathens.</note>.</p>
               <p>But before I diſmiſs this Article, it ſeems to me abſolutely neceſſary to take Notice of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain culpable Piece of Delicacy, or Inconſiſtency, peculiar to ourſelves, and the rather becauſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is what but very few of us are entirely clear of; an Inconſiſtency that ſhews we are not gone above half Way in our profeſſed Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Corruption of Speech we complain of, I mean in the Uſe of the Word <hi>Thee</hi> for <hi>Thou.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true, in thus ſpeaking we are right as to <hi>Number,</hi> but quite erroneous and ungrammatical as to <hi>Caſe, viz.</hi> in putting the Accuſative for the
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:008486_0050_102F5C0B1B13BB70"/>
Nominative, and therefore ſuch who are guilty of this Inconſiſtency, have no Right to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by the Argument of Propriety of Speech.</p>
               <p>Some, in Excuſe for the Prevalence of this Impropriety in Speech, have alledged, that it has been ſo long eſtabliſhed by Cuſtom, and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of their Parents and Aſſociates, that ſome may be ſuppoſed not to know the Difference, which indeed is an Argument that a long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Cuſtom may eſtabliſh a Corruption in Speech; but that it ought ſo to do, is utterly contrary to the whole Tenour of our Profeſſion, in other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Inſtances, as well as what we condemn in our Neighbours, in their Uſe of the Word <hi>You,</hi> who therefore have accordingly retorted our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument upon us, <hi>viz.</hi> that we ourſelves alſo are guilty of an equal Impropriety, in ſubſtituting <hi>Thee</hi> for <hi>Thou,</hi> and from the ſame Principle which we condemn in them, <hi>viz.</hi> an imaginary ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or Softneſs of the Term <hi>Thee;</hi> and indeed I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, I know of no effectual Anſwer to this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, but mending our Conduct accordingly.</p>
               <p>But I cannot yet be perſuaded, that meer Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance is the Cauſe of this Inconſiſtency of Speech peculiar to us; for even our Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians and Scholars (to their peculiar Shame be it ſaid) are frequently as guilty of it, as thoſe who are ignorant of the Rules of Grammar; and, moreover, it is obſervable, that divers of thoſe, who decline the Uſe of the Word <hi>Thou</hi> in their Converſation, do yet in their Letters and Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings (where there is more Room for Delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and leſs Shame of the Croſs, than in Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation)
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:008486_0051_102F5C0CA3CEC368"/>
take Care to inſert it in its proper Place. And laſtly, that an Acquaintance with the Rules of Grammar, is not eſſential to the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reſpective proper Uſe of the Words <hi>Thou</hi> and <hi>Thee,</hi> is evident from the Practice of thoſe Country People, who not having been corrupted by this Piece of falſe Politeneſs, do yet in their daily Converſations make Uſe of them reſpective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with the utmoſt Propriety.</p>

               <hi>APPENDIX.</hi> Concerning the Denomination of the Days of the Week and Months.</head>
            <p>I SHALL, here ſubjoin a few Remarks on another Peculiarity of Language, which our Anceſtors did, and all their faithful Succeſſors ſtill do, hold themſelves conſcientiouſly engaged to maintain, which I apprehend will ſtand the Teſt of the ſevereſt Examination among, all that are Chriſtians in Sincerity: I mean their Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the Days of the Week, and of the Months, according to the numerical Order of Firſt, Second, Third, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> agreeable to the Style of the Holy Scriptures, and not from the heathen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Idols, a Practice, which how far it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with a ſerious Profeſſion of Chriſtianity, deſerves to be conſidered.</p>
            <p>For, indeed, the very Dedication of the Days of the Week to heatheniſh Idols, is, in Effect, allowing the Exiſtence of, and paying a tacit Homage to, ſuch imaginary Being, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently an implicit Denying of the only one true GOD: And many of the Months have alſo their Names from the ſame Kind of Idols; and the Appellations of <hi>July</hi> and <hi>Auguſt,</hi> from the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> and <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> are ſcarce a Whit more defenſible than thoſe of <hi>January, March, May,</hi> &amp;c. for <hi>July</hi> and <hi>Auguſt</hi> were not the eſtabliſhed Denominations of the two firſt-mentioned
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:008486_0053_102F5C140084D7D0"/>
Months, but <hi>Quintilis</hi> and <hi>Sextilis,</hi> or the fifth and ſixth Months, until the Heathens began to pay an extravagant, even an idolatrous Reſpect to their Emperors (as it is certain from ſeveral Paſſages in <hi>Horace,</hi> and other Heathen Authors, they did) and then they denominated theſe two Months from their new-coined Deities, as they had done the other from their old Ones <note n="*" place="bottom">For further Satisfaction in this Point, ſee an Epiſtle from the Meeting for Sufferings in <hi>London,</hi> publiſhed in 1751.</note>.</p>
            <p>And as to the four laſt Months of the Year, according to the New Style, eſtabliſhed by Act of Parliament, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe called <hi>September, October, November</hi> and <hi>December,</hi> we have now more Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon than ever to perſevere in diſtinguiſhing theſe, as well as the reſt of the Months, according to their numerical Order; for altho' the Legiſlature hath not thought fit to change the Names of the Months laſt mentioned, yet whether to call that which, in Reality, is the Ninth [in Succeſſion from the firſt Month in the Year called <hi>January</hi>] by the <hi>Latin</hi> Name of <hi>September,</hi> indicating the Seventh, and the Tenth by the Name of <hi>October,</hi> indicating the Eighth, the Eleventh by the Name of <hi>November,</hi> indicating the Ninth, and the Twelfth by the Name of <hi>December,</hi> indicating the Tenth; or whether to call thoſe Months reſpectively and ſimply, the Ninth, Tenth, Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth and Twelfth, be moſt conſiſtent with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Senſe, and Propriety of Language, let all Men judge.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, as long as it remains to be a Truth, that heatheniſh Idolatry ought to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenanced
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:008486_0054_102F5C1587703878"/>
and denied among Chriſtians, and as long as Truth and Simplicity, and the Ends of Speech are beſt maintained, by giving the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations to the Months and Days of the Week, according to their numerical Order of Firſt, Second, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo long ought we not to be aſhamed of, but adhere to, the Tradition of our Elders in this Caſe; a Tradition ſo highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent both with Reaſon, and a ſincere Profeſſion of Chriſtianity, that it will be no Raſhneſs to affirm, that ſuch who have been thus wholeſomely taught and inſtructed, and yet daily, in their Converſation and Writings, deviate from the Example of their Forefathers, do, in this Inſtance, as well as the others above enumerated, manifeſt a ſervile Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Mind, and a mean Obſequiouſneſs to the prevailing Faſhion of the Times, or the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Uſages of heathenizing Chriſtians in this Caſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>N. B.</hi> I am not unaware, that with reſpect to the ſeveral Articles of Language and outward Demeanor above ſpecified, many will object, that here is too great a Streſs laid upon <hi>ſmall Matters,</hi> and that Words are of no Signification, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Ideas affixed to them by Cuſtom; to which I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>ſt,</hi> By denying the Charge, having already expreſly acknowledged, that a meer Conformity to the Traditions of the Elders, in exterior Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, is far from entitling a Man to the Kingdom of Heaven, or indeed any Thing ſhort of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, or a Renovation of Mind, which,
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:008486_0055_102F27C51AC758C0"/>
undoubtedly is the beſt Baſis whereon to build an outward Regularity of Conduct, and which is, above all other Things, to be recommended, as it frequently is by our worthy Brethren of the Miniſtry; but the principal Deſign of this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs from a Perſon in a lower Station is, to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with thoſe called Libertines upon their own Principles, and beat them out of their preſent ſtrong Holds, in order, and with an earneſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, that they may lie open to better and higher Impreſſions, which undoubtedly the preſent Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration greatly wants.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> That the Inſtances of Conformity to the World here cenſured, are abſolutely Matters of ſmall Importance, is denied; for whatever they may be to ſuch as have never conſidered them, to thoſe who have duly conſidered them, and are convinced that they are repugnant to Truth and ſound Reaſon, they ceaſe to be ſmall Matters. Now in a People who, in the ſeveral Particulars above mentioned, are diſtinguiſhed from the reſt of the World, not to have conſidered the true Grounds on which ſuch Diſtinction is founded, is both a culpable Piece of Negligence, and an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of great Stupidity; but in many others, not to ſay the Greater Part of thoſe who conform to the World in theſe Reſpects, the true Origin of ſuch Conformity ſeems to be a Corruption rather of the Heart than of the Head, <hi>viz.</hi> a Mind that dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not to proceed in the right Way, when it is contrary to the Ways of the World; a Mind not fortified to undergo the Contradictions and Contempt of Scoffers, in which View theſe mean

Compliances are no longer to be deemed Matters of ſmall Importance, ſince a Demeanour oppoſite to Conviction, never can be ſo.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> As the Practices here cenſured are of a corrupt Original, ſo are they of an evil Tendency, even to reconcile to that Friendſhip which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>James</hi> ſaith, is Enmity with GOD; and ſuch who indulge themſelves therein, may do well to remember the Saying of the wiſe Man: <hi>He that, deſpiſeth ſmall Things, ſhall fall by Little and Little.</hi> Eccleſiaſticus xix. 1.</p>

               <p>THE preſent Conduct of ſome under this Profeſſion, ſeems to render it neceſſary to add a few Remarks on this Head, even as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtrong Inſtance of the little Senſe that poſſeſſes their Minds, of the Dignity of their religious E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation, and its Tendency to eſtabliſh them in the Enjoyment of Chriſtian Liberty.</p>
               <p>It is no ſmall temporal Privilege to us, as a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, that both our Law and our Goſpel are free. As to the firſt, it is well known that moſt of our Differences are to be determined among ourſelves, agreeably to the Senſe of the Apoſtle <note n="*" place="bottom">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> vi.</note>, who ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly condemns one <hi>Brother going to Law with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother;</hi> that the Proſecution of Law-ſuits, even with Strangers, without great Neceſſity, is a

Breach of one of our wholeſome Precepts. And as to the ſecond, that the Taxation of the People by Tythes, is no other than a <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Yoke of Bondage, as being a Part of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Law, aboliſhed by the coming of CHRIST, and his Death on the Croſs; and conſequently, that the Paying of them for the Support of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Chriſtian Miniſtry, is in Effect to deny the coming and ſuffering (or which amounts to the ſame Thing, to deny the Efficacy of the coming and ſuffering) of CHRIST in the Fleſh, hath been the declared Senſe of this People from the Beginning; as alſo, that to contribute to the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of a Hireling Miniſtry, eſtabliſhed upon a human and worldly Foundation, is in Effect an Acknowledgment of the Validity of their Call and Authority, which we deny; and theſe were the Grounds of the Refuſal of our Anceſtors to pay Tythes, or Prieſts Wages, in theſe Goſpel-times, which was therefore called their Chriſtian Teſtimony <note n="*" place="bottom">For further Satisfaction in this Point, the Reader may have Recourſe to <hi>Anthony Pearſon</hi>'s Great <hi>Caſe</hi> of Tithes, lately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publiſhed with ſome important Additions.</note>, which both they did, and all their faithful Succeſſors ſtill do, deem themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiouſly engaged to bear, and inviolably ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here unto, whatever outward Sufferings might or may attend on this Account, which indeed were very ſevere in the Beginning; nevertheleſs, they deemed this their Chriſtian Teſtimony, this hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth a Light to an Age of profeſſed Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who had deviated from the Simplicity and Liberty of the Goſpel, to be of more real Value

and Importance, than outward Riches, Liberty, or even Life itſelf, having ſometimes been depriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of all three, rather than decline to maintain this Teſtimony, by paying Tythes, as may be ſeen in <hi>Joſeph Beſſe</hi>'s Account of their early Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.</p>
               <p>But indeed ſuch a Conduct as this is not at all agreeable to the carnal Mind, which having no Reliſh of the Beauty and Importance of this Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, prefers outward Eaſe, and leads into mean Compliances, and Connivances at others in paying for them, contrary to the Advice and Judgment of the Body; not indeed from a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of the Juſtneſs of the Demand, but to decline the greater Expence and Trouble of a Diſtreſs, or ſpoiling of their Goods, and much more a Priſon: And this ſeems to be the true Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin of the Unfaithfulneſs of many on this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, as want of Conſideration may be in others.</p>
               <p>Now, it is manifeſt that the Liberty which ſuch ſeek, is that of the Fleſh, and not of the Spirit, and the Tendency of their Conduct is not only to injure the Chriſtian Reputation of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and weaken the Teſtimony of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but to continue and perpetuate Slavery on themſelves and their Poſterity.</p>
               <p>And moreover, ſuch a Declenſion from the Footſteps of our Anceſtors, is very unſeaſonable at this preſent Juncture, when Light and Liberty are beginning to appear <note n="*" place="bottom">"In <hi>New-England,</hi> where our Friends formerly underwent grievous, Sufferings, a Law is lately made, exempting Friends from paying either to the eſtabliſhed Miniſters, or to the repairing of their Worſhip houſes." <hi>Yearly Meeting Epiſtle,</hi> A D. 1<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

               <p>At ſuch a Time then, how unſeaſonable, how diſhonourable is it, and how little Zeal for carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Work of Reformation does it ſhew, that any of us ſhould, by a mean Compliance, or Connivance, weaken that Chriſtian Teſtimony our faithful Elders were conſcientiouſly engaged to bear in this Reſpect, even when other People are beginning to manifeſt a Diſpoſition to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Expediency and Reaſonableneſs of their Conduct, on theſe Occaſions?</p>

               <p>Now an Exemption from Practices of this Sort, is another of the Privileges of our Society; for which Reaſon, a Compliance with the Cuſtom on theſe Occaſions, in any of our Profeſſion, is not only a Mark of that ſame Servility of Spirit, which hath been above traced in other Inſtances, but is alſo more peculiarly condemnable in ſuch, as it tends to expoſe, and, in ſome late Inſtances, actually has expoſed thoſe who ſtand their Ground in a faithful Adherence to our Chriſtian Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, in this Reſpect, to the greater Sufferings from the Outrages of a licentious Rabble; and whereas Unity is the Strength of Society, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of theſe tends to weaken the Teſtimony of the Faithful, and repreſent as as a Houſe divided againſt itſelf, ſo that ſuch deſerve no better Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter than that of falſe Brethren.</p>
