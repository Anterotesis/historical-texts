            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     <hi>1 SAMUEL, VIII.22.</hi>
                  </bibl>
                  <p>And the Lord ſaid to <hi>Samuel,</hi> Hearken unto their voice, and make them a King. And <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaid unto the men of Iſrael, Go ye every man unto his city.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEN good Samuel, the prophet of the Lord, who had long judged Iſrael well, was grown old, and by reaſon of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of age was rendered very inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the important truſt, and could no longer judge and govern the people, he made his ſons Joel and Abiah judges over Iſrael. But Iſrael ſoon growing uneaſy under the government and preſidency of his ſons, by reaſon of their evil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and male-adminiſtration, for they walked not in the ſteps of Samuel their father, it occaſioned great mutinies and contentions: till finally, the uneaſineſs of the people grew ſo great, and they were ſo highly diſguſted at the adminiſtrations of his ſons, all the elders of Iſrael ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered themſelves together, and came unto Samuel, to Ramah, and told him, what he was well ſenſible of, of
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:014036_0004_0F92ACC51C592420"/>
his own incapacity to judge and govern them as he had done, and complained to him aloud of the ill-manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his ſons—that they had left the right way of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning which he had ſo happily purſued, and rendered themſelves extremely odious on that account, and even intolerable to the people. And now they manifeſt their deſire of a King, one who ſhould rule according to right and equity; and pray his aſſiſtance to conſtitute and ſet one over them, to judge, rule and govern them, as was cuſtomary in all other nations.</p>
            <p>SAMUEL intimates his diſpleaſure at their requeſt of a King; fearing they did not pay that reſpect to Jehovah which they ought; and from the Lord he ſhews them the manner of the King who ſhould reign over them; how he would conduct with them, their families and inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances, and what would be the maxims of that govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which he would exerciſe over the people, in the courſe of his reign. Notwithſtanding all this, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple perſiſted in their requeſt of a King, and ſtill continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their petition. And though perhaps the circumſtances attending Iſrael's requeſt at this time, and their obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in it, after the prophets remonſtrances againſt it, were not to be commended, the Lord ſo far overlooked this, that he commanded Samuel to hearken to, and gratify the people, by accompliſhing their deſire in conſtituting a King to rule and govern them.</p>
            <p>THEN Samuel ſays to the men of Iſrael, be contented and eaſy in your minds, go every man unto his city, and patiently wait until I ſhall be inſtructed further concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a King, and the method of his being conſtituted over you, and placed in his royal dignity and government.</p>
            <p>FROM the words now read unto you, and thus intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, I ſhall propoſe the following things to be diſcourſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon, viz.
<list>
                  <item>I. THAT a people have a natural and inherent right to appoint and conſtitute a King ſupreme, and all ſubordinate civil officers and rulers over them, for their civil good, liberty, protection, peace and ſafety.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="5" facs="unknown:014036_0005_0F92ACC89DB32E10"/>II. I SHALL undertake to ſhew what are the duties and obligations of a King thus erected by the people, and of all ſubordinate rulers and civil officers.</item>
                  <item>III. WHAT are the duties and obligations of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in civil ſtate, to their civil rulers, both ſupreme and ſubordinate, whilſt they fulfil their truſt, and anſwer their obligations to them.</item>
                  <item>IV. I SHALL endeavour to prove that the people have right and authority to dethrone their King, and put down all other civil officers and rulers of ſubordinate degree, whenever they ſhall counteract their obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, and ceaſe to anſwer the ends of their conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution and appointment to places of civil truſt and power.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I SHALL not undertake very ſcrupulouſly to enquire whether all theſe propoſitions have a real foundation, and in being in the words of my text, and may be clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted from them, or not; it ſhall ſuffice for me, if they are true, and capable of ſubſtantial proof and vindication, which I ſhall endeavour to ſhew them to be. I begin with the firſt, viz.</p>
            <p n="1">I. THAT a people have a natural and inherent right to appoint and conſtitute a King ſupreme, and all ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate civil officers and rulers over them, for their civil good, liberty, protection, peace and ſafety.</p>
            <p>HOWEVER true, and capable of clear proof from reaſon and the nature of things, this propoſition may appear to unprejudiced and thinking men, yet it is denied by ſome, whoſe minds are full of prejudiced notions, and who are leſs capable of reaſoning cloſely and judging right.</p>
            <p>SOME of the greateſt men that ever wrote on politics, have aſſerted and maintained that all civil powers and authority originates from the people: with whom I hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily agree. Others whoſe learning and judgment in other things ought not to be impeached, have aſſerted and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to maintain that King's derive their power and authority to reign over the people from God only: with whom I cannot agree.</p>
            <p>HOWEVER, not regarding ſo much what any men have
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:014036_0006_0F92ACC8D6EF75C0"/>
ſaid or wrote, for or againſt the preſent propoſition, my buſineſs is to prove and vindicate its truth; which I ſhall endeavour to do in the ſubſequent propoſitions, reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and concluſions.</p>
            <p>EVERY ſingle man in a ſtate of nature, and before any thing is given up by him, to a civil State, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, for the general good, utility and happineſs of ſuch State or Community, by voluntary and ſolemn league, covenant and compact, hath a principle of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuation; <hi>i. e.</hi> he hath ſuch natural and undoubted right to, and property in ſome things, as no other man upon earth has: He has ſomething he may juſtly call his own, and may appropriate it to himſelf, in ſuch a ſenſe as no other man may call it his, or appropriate it to himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A,</hi> HATH a right to, and property in, his hand, in ſuch a ſenſe as <hi>B</hi> hath not, nor can have; he may with great juſtice call his hand his own, and he hath an indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual and entire right to, and property in his hand, which <hi>B</hi> cannot have. And it would be a manifeſt and intolerable invaſion of <hi>A</hi>'s right and property, if <hi>B</hi> ſhould pretend to lay claim to his hand, or preſume to uſe it as though it were his own, and as though he had a juſt right to, and property in it. This pretence, and this conduct in <hi>B,</hi> would be downright injuſtice, a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and action plainly contradictory to truth, which is always unjuſt. If <hi>A</hi> hath ſuch right to, and property in his hand, as he is now ſaid to have, it follows, that he hath a right to make uſe of his hand, for his own ends and purpoſes, and according as he ſhall pleaſe: and <hi>B</hi> can have no right or authority to riſe up and forbid <hi>A</hi> the uſe of his hand, or to diſpute with him his liberty and authority to uſe it according to his own pleaſure. For ſuch conduct would evidently declare that <hi>B</hi> has ſome right to <hi>A</hi>'s hand, evidently contrary to truth, for he has none: for if <hi>B</hi> has no right to <hi>A</hi>'s hand, according to the ſuppoſition, then certainly he can have no juſt right or authority to forbid <hi>A</hi> that uſe of it he ſhall pleaſe to put it to: For all authority and dominion are founded in right and property.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:014036_0007_0F92ACC9F815A2B0"/>LET <hi>A</hi> then uſe his hand as he pleaſes, he is not, in ſo doing, abuſing any property, or invading any right of <hi>B</hi>; therefore <hi>B</hi> has no juſt cauſe to complain, or any authority to command or direct <hi>A,</hi> concerning the uſe of his hand, uſe it as he will.</p>
            <p>NOW, if <hi>A</hi> hath ſuch an individual, uncontroulable right to his hand, to one hand, he hath, to all intents and purpoſes, the ſame right alſo to the other; and if he hath ſuch right to, and property in his hands, he hath alſo in his feet; and if ſo, then he hath the ſame, or an individual right, to his head and heart, and his whole body: for it would puzzle any one to aſcertain what property <hi>A</hi> hath to any one part of his body, that he hath not to any other part of it, or to ſhew that he hath not the ſame property in one part as in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for all his own purpoſes and deſigns. <hi>A</hi> hath then an individual right to his whole body. <hi>A</hi> hath ſuch a right to, and property in his whole body as <hi>B</hi> hath not, nor can pretend to have, without great and intolerable injury and injuſtice: So that <hi>A</hi> hath an individual and undiſputable right to himſelf.</p>
            <p>NOW, <hi>A</hi> having ſuch right to, and property in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to all the limbs, powers and faculties of his body, may uſe himſelf, and theſe powers and faculties of his, as he ſhall judge it convenient, and for his own intereſt, and purpoſes of life.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, <hi>A</hi> labours with his hands, uſes them in various ſecular employments, and is induſtrious in his buſineſs, for his ſupport and maintenance. We will ſuppoſe for the ſake of clearneſs and conviction, that <hi>A</hi> takes a piece of unoccupied land, which is claimed by no inhabitant of the earth; upon this ground he ſettles and builds, brings on cattle, ſo ſoon as prepared for them, and other living creatures, for his ſupport and conveniency. Here he lives a number of years, manages his buſineſs alone, and ſeperate from all near ſociety with any other rational beings, and gains a conſiderable eſtate. Now <hi>A</hi> while he dwells here alone, hath an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:014036_0008_0F92ACCC144986F8"/>
right to his land, and all that he hath brought upon it, and the effects of his own labour and toil upon it; to the Land he hath the right of prime occupancy, a very juſt and good right; and to all the fruits and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of his labours, he hath juſt as good a right, as he hath to his hands, with which he laboured. But he meets with many difficulties and inconveniencies in his lonely ſituation; till at length, the difficulties of his dwelling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and the great and many hardſhips he endures in this ſtate, ſo ſeperate and ſolitary, convince him ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually of the truth of what the God of nature long ſince obſerved, that
<q>it is not good that men ſhould be alone.</q>
He now finds an inclination to ſociety, and communion with ſome of his fellow rational crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Therefore he comes forth of his long ſecluſion and confinement from ſociety, and gets among mankind. He cultivates an acquaintance with a lady, whom he, in proper time, takes to wife and with this very agreeable companion, he returns to his former habitation and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements; where they each labour with a joint deſign, and for a joint intereſt. Not to be tedious here, he has by Heaven's kind indulgence and bleſſing, a family which he educates and brings up as well as his circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances will admit.</p>
            <p>NOW, this man and his family, when conſidered with reference to mankind, have an abſolute and individual right to, and property in all they have earned by their labours, induſtry and frugality: Such right and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty as no others can pretend to have, without great wrong and injuſtice. They may call their eſtate their own, and have full power and authority to uſe it as their own; <hi>i. e.</hi> as they ſhall judge beſt, to anſwer their own deſigns and intentions.</p>
            <p>No man, or number of men have a right to diſturb <hi>A</hi> in the enjoyment of his family and eſtate, or property: For to ſuppoſe them to have ſuch right, would be to ſuppoſe them to have ſome property in <hi>A</hi>'s family and eſtate; for if they have no ſuch property, the ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that they have right to moleſt or diſturb <hi>A</hi> in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:014036_0009_0F92ACCCB9687110"/>
of his family, and the poſſeſſion of his eſtate, is impoſſible: for if one man has no property in the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions of another, he certainly can have no right to give any moleſtation to this other man in the enjoyment of them: which is a very plain caſe to every one, who thinks ever ſo little. If <hi>B</hi> has no right to begin to give mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtation to <hi>A,</hi> who is quietly and peaceably enjoying his own eſtate, then neither has <hi>C, D</hi> or <hi>E,</hi> or any other; for <hi>E</hi> has as much right to <hi>A</hi>'s eſtate as <hi>B</hi> has, that is, none at all; and ſo it is with <hi>C, D,</hi> and all the reſt. For what any one man hath as juſt a right to, as any other, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man in the world, or all men, have as juſt a right to; but what every man hath a juſt right to, one as much as any other, none of them all has any juſt right to; for in ſuch caſe, an equal right among all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, cannot be accounted any right at all. So that no man upon earth hath any juſt right to begin to diſturb <hi>A</hi> in the enjoyment of his family and eſtate.</p>
            <p>BUT yet, tho' <hi>B</hi> has no juſt right to give diſturbance or moleſtation to <hi>A,</hi> who is quiet in the enjoyment of his eſtate, or to begin to make him unhappy, <hi>A</hi> hath an undoubted right to reſiſt and repel every attempt of <hi>B</hi> to invade his property, and to make him unquiet: Elſe, we muſt inevitably deny <hi>A</hi>'s property in his eſtate, which we have above proved him to have. For he that hath no right to defend his property, hath no property at all: for to defend any thing from invaſions, and to ſecure to one's ſelf, the enjoyment of it, are the ſame thing with uſing it as our own; but in any thing, which we have not a right to uſe as our own, we can never be ſaid to have the ſole property: therefore, if we have not a right to defend our eſtates, and to ſecure the enjoyment of them to ourſelves, we have not the ſole property in them: If <hi>A</hi> has not a right to defend his eſtate, and to ſecure the enjoyment of it to himſelf, againſt all the invaſions of <hi>B, C, D, E,</hi> &amp;c. he hath not the ſole property in it: but that <hi>A</hi> hath an individual and independent right and property in his eſtate, is according to the ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:014036_0010_0F92ACCD670808F0"/>
therefore <hi>A</hi> hath an undoubted right to defend his eſtate from all invaſions of <hi>B,</hi> or any other, and to ſecure to himſelf the enjoyment of it.</p>
            <p>THUS we muſt conclude, that <hi>A,</hi> or any man, hath an undoubted right, in a ſtate of nature, which is all along the ſuppoſition, to defend his eſtate, yea, and moſt certainly his perſon too, from all unjuſt attempts upon them, or invaſions of them from any quarter whatſoever. No man will diſpute any one's right to defend and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his perſon from all aſſaults and injuries, if he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows him to have right to defend and ſecure his eſtate; for he had a property in his perſon which no other man could pretend to, without great injuſtice and violation of truth, before he acquired his eſtate: And it was done by the labours he himſelf beſtowed, and the uſe of his own limbs, that he gained his eſtate. <hi>A</hi> then hath an indiſputable right to defend his perſon and property from all attempts, come whence, or from whom they may, and to ſecure the enjoyment of them to himſelf.</p>
            <p>THIS reaſoning may be carried yet farther, for if this be the caſe, if <hi>A</hi> hath ſuch an indiſputed right to defend his perſon and property from all injuries and aſſaults whatſoever, and to ſecure to himſelf the quiet enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them, then he hath moſt certainly a right to make repriſals in caſe his perſon be injured, and his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty be taken out of his poſſeſſion and enjoyment, upon that man who ſhall be ſo intolerably unjuſt, and have ſo little regard to truth, as to commit ſuch injury upon his perſon, and make ſuch invaſion of his property. For if <hi>A</hi> hath an indiſputable and individual right to his perſon and property, and to defend them from all aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults, and ſecure to himſelf the enjoyment of them, then, if his perſon chance to be injured, and his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty ſeized and uſed by another, he hath juſt as good a right to an equivalent to the injury done his perſon, and to the eſtate which was ſeized and taken from him, as he has to his perſon and eſtate, or property. For to ſay a man has an indiſputable and individual right to his
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:014036_0011_0F92ACCE273965A8"/>
perſon and property, and to defend and ſecure to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the enjoyment of them, againſt all invaſions and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults that may be made upon them, and yet, that he hath not a right, if his perſon be injuriouſly treated, and his property ſeized and uſed by another, without his conſent, to an equivalent for the injury done to his perſon and property in the aſſault and ſeizure, is a flat contradiction. For to have an individual right to any thing, and a right to an equivalent to that thing, if the thing be taken away, and he who had the individual right, be now deprived of the enjoyment of the thing, are the ſame. He therefore who hath an individual right to his perſon and property, and to defend and ſecure to himſelf the enjoyment of them againſt all aſſaults and invaſions whatſoever, hath a right to an equivalent to any injury that ſhall be done his perſon, or ſeizure of his property; <hi>i. e.</hi> he hath a right to make repriſals up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any man who ſhall injure his perſon, or invade his property, whenſoever opportunity ſhall preſent for this purpoſe.</p>
            <p>I THEREFORE conclude, that every man in a ſtate of nature, or where no civil government is yet erected, hath an individual and moſt juſt right to an equivalent to any injury that ſhall be done his perſon, or any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion and ſeizure of his property; and that whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he ſhall find it, in the poſſeſſion of him who did the wrong, and whenſoever he ſhall have an opportunity, to take it to himſelf. And all the miſchief and blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, if there ſhould be any, while the injured man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends his perſon, or is taking to himſelf his equivalent for the ſeizure of his eſtate or property, muſt forever lye at the door of him who did the injury.</p>
            <p>BUT who is not appriſed of the terrible conteſts, the horrid and ſpreading miſchiefs, the bloodſhed and the death, which will inevitably follow and take place, if every man muſt defend and ſecure his own perſon and property againſt the aſſaults and ravages of all others, who ſhall from time to time injure his perſon, or invade his property: If he muſt alſo, as he hath an undoubted
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:014036_0012_0F92ACD032A7CDD0"/>
right to do, in reaſon and conſcience, make repriſals whenſoever his perſon is injured, or his property invaded and ſeized? He that is ſo unjuſt, and pays ſo little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to truth, as to injure another perſon, or invade and ſeize his property, when he hath a convenient opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity for ſuch black deſigns, will certainly, if he be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued by the injured man, and preſſed upon by him who is engaged to obtain his right, or an equivalent, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend himſelf at all adventures; even though he ſhould be the death of him whom he hath ſo villainouſly injured already: For he who ſhall prove the ſtrongeſt and moſt powerful in this ſorry conteſt will get the victory, tho' he ſhould hazard the other's life and fortune all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>BUT if we ſuppoſe that ſeveral, or ever ſo large a number of families, have ſettled in the neighbourhood of <hi>A,</hi> whom we have ſuppoſed hitherto to be alone, with only his own family; ſtill the ſame truths may be aſſerted of them all. Every individual of ever ſo large a ſociety, whilſt they remain in a ſtate of nature, has an individual right to his perſon and property, and very juſt authority to defend them from all aſſaults and inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions whatſoever, and to ſecure the enjoyment of them to himſelf.</p>
            <p>YET in ſuch a degenerate, unjuſt and diſingenuous world as we live in, 'tis very poſſible that many may league, aſſociate, and combine together to give diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbance to ſome one man in the enjoyment of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and property: they may agree to injure and abuſe his perſon, and to ſeize upon his property and eſtate, and to take and uſe them as their own, contrary to his will, and without any conſent of his.</p>
            <p>THUS injury and rapine may be committed upon the perſon and property of any individual; and he, tho' he has a natural, inherent and indiſputable right to his perſon and property, and to defend and ſecure them, what can he do in ſuch caſe? how ſhall he go about to aſſert his right, and defend his perſon and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate from the injury, rapine and ravages of this lawleſs
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:014036_0013_0F92ACD06D4FC310"/>
and unnatural combination? how ſhall he now ſecure to himſelf the quiet and undiſturbed enjoyment of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and property? To pretend to riſe up in oppoſition to this riotous, injurious and rapacious rout alone, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to aſſert &amp; defend his right againſt them, will moſt certainly prove an inſignificant attempt; and will ſerve no other purpoſe than to convince him of the impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of it. But ſhall the man ſuffer any injuries upon his perſon, and ſeizure of his property, which this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned crew ſhall pleaſe, and be quiet? O Heavens! does not every ſpark of humanity and pity catch fire, and quick enkindle in every generous breaſt at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thought of ſuch cruelty and injuſtice! certainly this is moſt diſagreeable to all principles of natural juſtice, righteouſneſs and equity, if there be any ſuch thing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting any where. But how can the man prevent his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering in ſuch ſort? to pretend a redreſs, or to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſals alone, we ſee will not be ſignificant of any thing but folly and madneſs. And if he ſhould by a pathetic expoſition of his caſe to others, by prayers and tears, and the moſt powerful perſuaſions and entreaties he can uſe, gain ſome aſſiſtance from his neighbours; if this ſhould prove inſufficient and unavailable, he will certainly be left in as bad, likely a worſe ſituation than he was in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: Perhaps he will ſo enrage the injurious and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate multitude, as will excite them to commit ſtill greater injuries and miſchiefs. If he ſhould gain a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſufficient to reſiſt and repel all the aſſaults and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſions of theſe unjuſt wretches, or to make juſt repriſals for the injuries and rapines already commited, who does not ſee that this will preſently iſſue in the total deſtruction and extirpation of all the people?</p>
            <p>I NEED to ſay no more, one would think, to convince every intelligent and conſiderate man of this great truth, a people cannot live in ſociety without civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſome kind and form or other. It is not at all to the preſent purpoſe, to enquire what kind or form of civil government, whether Ariſtocratical, Democratical, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchial, Republican, or any other particular kind,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:014036_0014_0F92ACD11CF1CA40"/>
be beſt, or even good to be erected among a people, Some kind or form of civil government there muſt be, or no man will be quiet and ſecure in the enjoyment of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his perſon or his property.</p>
            <p>AND in a civil ſtate, 'tis evident to every one, there muſt be ſome appointed to make laws, others to execute them; and for this end and others, there muſt be a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination of rulers, both in legiſlative and executive truſt; ſome ſuperior, and others inferior: And if there be one ſupreme, one who ſhall hold the balance of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, for 'tis evident it muſt be held ſomewhere, and if this be agreed upon, this is perhaps the beſt. Power to make and execute laws for the general utility and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molument of the ſtate, muſt be put in the hands of ſome men, of rulers and officers in ſubordination as above, For 'tis for the good of the ſtate and people, that every one and the whole community, may enjoy their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and properties free of all moleſtations, invaſions, rapines and invaſions whatſoever, that civil government is erected; and theſe great ends muſt be kept in ſight and direct.</p>
            <p>THE great enquiry here is, who ſhall ſet up this ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil government? who ſhall make rulers ſupreme and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate? and inveſt them with power and authority to make and execute laws for the good of the people? Our propoſition aſſerts that a people have a natural and inherent right to appoint and conſtitute a king ſupreme and all ſubordinate civil officers and rulers over them, for their civil good, liberty, protection, peace and ſafety. And this is my reply, the people have right to ſet up a civil government, the people have right to make rulers ſupreme and ſubordinate, and the people have right to inveſt them with power and authority to make and execute laws, ſuch as ſhall be promotive of their good, liberty, protection, peace, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>IF the preliminary obſervations which have been made above be true and juſt, and be now adverted to, and carefully conſidered, every one may ſee the proof of this propoſition to be very plain and eaſy, almoſt at firſt view.
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:014036_0015_0F92ACD1E3D9BFE8"/>
But that I may not be wanting in the full and complete proof of this point; let us ſuppoſe A, B, C, D, E, F, G, &amp;c. a large number of men, yet in a ſtate of nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and without any civil government. Now 'tis very plain to every one, from what hath been ſaid already, that each of theſe, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, &amp;c. has an inherent, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual right to his own perſon and perſonal properties, and to all his eſtate and acquiſitions, and to defend and ſecure to himſelf the enjoyment of them, free from all moleſtations and diſquiet. It hath juſt been proved that this cannot be done without civil government. Here it would be very vain and futile to plead, that the power and authority which God and nature have given to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and maſters will anſwer all the ends of civil go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, or ſerve to ſecure each individual in the quiet enjoyment of his own perſon and property. Juſt as fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile would it be to mention the Adamic, Noachal, patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archal, Abrahamic, &amp;c. powers and authorities, whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they were, or over whom, or after what manner ſoever they were exerciſed, which I ſhall not here ſpend time to aſcertain—I ſay, juſt as futile would it be to mention theſe as any argument to prove that the whole ſociety in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, or that each individual in particular, has not an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual right to his perſon and property, and ſo a right to defend them, and ſecure to himſelf the enjoyment of them, and conſequently a right to be active in erecting a civil government, as I ſhall immediately ſhew that he has.</p>
            <p>NOW, if theſe things be ſo, if every individual, in a ſtate of nature, has an individual right to his perſon and property, and to defend and ſecure to himſelf the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them, as hath been abundantly proved; then B has no right to A's perſon or property; and then he has no right to command or controul him in the uſe of his perſon or property; then ſurely he has no right to ſet up himſelf for a judge or ruler over A; or to place himſelf in any the leaſt authority over him. For if it could be ſuppoſed that B has a right to place himſelf in authority over A, and to command and controul him in the uſe of his perſon and property, and to make laws by which A
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:014036_0016_0F92ACD2ABCE85F8"/>
ſhall be governed in the enjoyment of his own perſon and property, this would be to give B a right to A's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and property: for to exerciſe authority and dominion, to make and execute laws for the government of others, ſuppoſeth him who doth this, to have a very great right, both to the perſons and properties of thoſe for whom he doth it. For all right of dominion and authority is founded in property; this is an eternal verity. But to ſuppoſe B to have any right to A's perſon or property is directly contrary to our prime ſuppoſition, and to what hath been ſufficiently proved already. B has then no right to command or controul A in the uſe of his perſon and property, or to exerciſe any, the leaſt authority over him imaginable, or to put himſelf into any place of power or government with reſpect to A. And what is true of B, is ſo of C, D, or any other; none of them have any right to the perſon or property of A, or A of any of them; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently neither of them has any right to exerciſe any power or authority over, or to command or controul ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the uſe of his perſon or property.</p>
            <p>A, B, C, D, E, F, G, &amp;c. can neither of them be in civil truſt, power and authority over any other, in the whole ſeries, of natural ſociety: They muſt eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally remain in a ſtate of nature, each one <hi>ſui juris</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs by mutual conſent, covenant and compact, they raiſe ſome of their number, into places of public truſt, power and authority, and ſo make them rulers ſupreme and ſubordinate. No man, or number of men under Heaven, has right to diſpute the power of A, B, C, D, E, F, G, &amp;c. to make them rulers, and ſet up a civil government, if they pleaſe, how they pleaſe, and when they pleaſe; or their power to inveſt their rulers with ſuch authorities legiſlative and executive as they pleaſe. For this would be to give this man or number of men a right to the perſons of A, B, C, D, E, F, G, &amp;c. and to their properties too; contrary to our ſuppoſition and the truth.</p>
            <p>THE people then, in every natural ſociety, and they only, have right natural and inherent, to ſet up a civil
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:014036_0017_0F92ACD4D24CDC38"/>
Government. And this is the inherent and natural right of every tribe nation and people under heaven; they, the people only, can make a civil government, ſet up rulers ſupreme and ſubordinate, determine what laws they will be governed by, and what mode of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ſhall take place, even that which upon tryal proves the beſt; to promiſe the moſt liberty, protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, peace and ſafety to the people. If there be any people or nation upon this globe, (and I ſhall not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute but there is) that have not and do not exerciſe ſuch right as this, this is evidently preternatural, and mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accidental, or rather tyrannic and deſpotic, contrary to reaſon and juſtice, and abhorent from all principles of natural righteouſneſs and equity, dreadful and into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable to any people, who are awake and ſenſible of thoſe natural rights which God hath given to all people, without any exception.</p>
            <p>THESE rights of the people have been eſpouſed, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted and vindicated in all ages of the world, as might be abundantly ſhewn from hiſtory, both ſacred and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane, and the contrary principles as warmly denied and diſproved.</p>
            <p>THE Hebrew government, as ordained of God, ſeems to have conſiſted of three parts or branches. For all Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael were very antiently divided into tribes, and each tribe had its own civil, as well as military officers; for there were heads of families, princes, rulers, elders and courts within each tribe. There was alſo a number of choſen men, of chief wiſdom and integrity, conſiſting of about ſeventy perſons. And laſtly, there was a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme magiſtrate, in both civil and military affairs, only ſubordinate to Jehovah, who was called judge, captain, &amp;c. ſuch we find were Joſhua, Gideon, Sampſon, Jeph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha, &amp;c. Now theſe officers, heads of families, elders, &amp;c. together with the whole aſſembly or congregation of all Iſrael, ever choſe and raiſed to power and authority their chief ruler, judge or Captain; never was one elected without the conſent of all the people.</p>
            <p>WE muſt note by the way, that no judge, ruler or
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:014036_0018_0F92ACD50D7C1278"/>
king, nor all the congregation of Iſrael, had a proper power or authority of legiſlation, or making of laws, or of annulling any already made; this was a power en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely in the hands of Jehovah, who was Iſrael's ſupreme King and Legiſlator.</p>
            <p>BUT even Jehovah himſelf, the ſovereign Lord of all worlds, the great proprietor of univerſal nature, did not ſee it fit to aſſume to himſelf the regency and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme civil government of Iſrael without their conſent and election of him. An everlaſting convincing evidence of the truth of what I have above obſerved, concerning the rights of the people. Exod. xix. 3,—9. And Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes went up unto God, and Jehovah called unto him out of the mountain, ſaying, thus ſhalt thou ſay to the houſe of Jacob, and tell the children of Iſrael, ye have ſeen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles wings, and brought you unto myſelf. Now therefore if you will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then you ſhall be a peculiar trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure unto me above all people: For all the earth is mine. And ye ſhall be unto me a KINGDOM of prieſts, and an holy NATION. Theſe are the words which thou ſhalt ſpeak unto the children of Iſrael. Thus Jehovah himſelf, when he was about to make a kingdom of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, and aſſume the regency over it, in his own infinite perſon, propounds to them the form of the kingdom, and what they ſhould ſwear to be, and perform, as his loyal ſubjects, upon their choice of him for their poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic head and ſovereign.</p>
            <p>ACCORDINGLY, Moſes came and called for all the elders of Iſrael, and laid before their faces all theſe words which Jehovah commanded him. Here Moſes ſummonſes a parliament of all Iſrael, calls all the princ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the tribes, head of families, and captains, or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary officers, and the whole repreſentative body of the Hebrew nation, and lays before them the oath of allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; and here all Iſrael thus repreſented, ſwore fealty to Jehovah, as their lawful ſovereign; as it follows in the next words:
<q>And all the people anſwered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:014036_0019_0F92ACD62D15CF20"/>
and ſaid, all that Jehovah hath ſpoken we will do. And Moſes returned the words of the people unto Jehovah.</q>

            <p>IN the government of Athens there was an aſſembly very like this of the Hebrews, which was uſually called Eccleſia; in which all matters of importance concerning the ſtate, were propoſed for their conſideration and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation or diſapprobation, when they were lawfully ſummoned, as were the Hebrews here by Moſes. <note n="*" place="bottom">Eſt autem conſcio populi conventus legitime advocatus, rei alicujus publicoe cauſa, ſuffragio ſuo, aut jubendae, aut ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>THE Lacedemonians alſo had a like aſſembly or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, for like purpoſes, and called by the ſame name, Eccleſia; in diſtinction from a leſſer congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, conſiſting of thoſe whoſe habitations was in the city of Sparta, (called Mikra Eccleſia.)</p>
            <p>SUCH were alſo the rights and privileges of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in congregation, in Africa; particularly in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of the people who went from Tyre and ſettled in Carthage. We may therefore very reaſonably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture that the government of the ancient Carthageni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans was after the Tyrian modle.</p>
            <p>ALL theſe governments of antient Greece, Italy, Africa, and Aſia too, may very much aſſiſt us to gain a right and true notion of theſe Hebrew aſſemblies or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations; which we find had exiſtence in the old ſtate of that nation, as it was modled by Moſes, at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Jehovah.</p>
            <p>WHEN Joſhua was to be appointed to ſucceed Moſes, God commanded Moſes to take Joſhua and ſet him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the people, before Eleazer the prieſt, and the whole congregation, the whole repreſentative of the Hebrew nation, for their approbation and election. Num. xxviii, 18. And after Moſes had thus propoſed the matter to a legitimate aſſembly of all Iſrael, they give their conſent that Joſhua ſhould be their Judge or Captain; and when they beheld that he was poſſeſſed of a like ſpirit with Moſes, and therefore that he was a fit and proper per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:014036_0020_0F92ACD690011B60"/>
to take upon him the government of Iſrael, in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination to Jehovah their ſupreme Magiſtrate, and in the ſtead of Moſes. Deut. xxxiv.9. And Joſhua the ſon of Nun was full of the ſpirit of Wiſdom: and the children of Iſrael hearkened unto him, and did as the Lord commanded Moſes.</p>
            <p>SOME great men have ſuppoſed, and perhaps not without good reaſon, that Saul the firſt King of Iſrael was choſen by a ballot. But be that as it may, 'tis plain to every one, that Saul was made King at the free e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of the people. For when Samuel ſet him before the people, and ſaid, ſee ye him whom Jehovah hath choſen, they all ſhouted aloud and ſaid, God ſave the King. I. Sam. x.24. When ſome of the people ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed a little uneaſineſs at Saul's election, and ſaid, how ſhall this man ſave us? Samuel warns an aſſembly of all Iſrael, to be holden at Gilgal, to ſee if the people could not be eaſed. And the people met ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to warning at Gilgal, and there they made Saul King before the Lord. I. Sam. x.27.xi.14, 15.</p>
            <p>SOLOMON was anointed King by Zadoch the prieſt, and Nathan the prophet, at Gihon by the order of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid his father. Yet notwithſtanding this, Solomon muſt be choſen and proclaimed King by the people, and therefore he is propoſed to them:
<q>And they made So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon the ſon of David King the ſecond time, and anointed him unto the Lord to be the chief Governor: And ſo Solomon ſat on the throne of the Lord as King inſtead of David his father, and proſpered, and all Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael obeyed him: And all the princes and the mighty men, and all the ſons alſo of King David ſubmitted themſelves unto Solomon the King. I. Chron. xxix.22, 23, 24.</q>
            </p>
            <p>HOW directly contrary to truth and fact, do theſe men talk, who ſay, that Kings derive their authority from God only! I aſſert, there never was one King upon this Globe, that derived his authority from God only. Let thoſe who aſſert that Kings derive their authority from God only, be ſo ingenious as to prove
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:014036_0021_0F92ACD7411E50E0"/>
that there ever was any one upon earth that did ſo: Let them tell us who he was, and where he reigned. When this ſhall be done, I will ingeniouſly retract what I have ſaid; but I muſt beg leave to maintain my integrity until that time.</p>
            <p>TIS true, Saul and David were nominated to the kingdom, and Joſhua ſucceſſor to Moſes, to be Judge over Iſrael by God: But Joſhua as we have ſhown, was choſen by the people. And we have not the leaſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to think that either Saul or David would have reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over Iſrael, had they not been elected by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. For tho' Saul had been nominated by Jehovah, to be King, and anointed by Samuel to be Captain over God's inheritance, the people of Iſrael; yet he muſt be acknowledged to be king, and proclaimed by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and was ſo at Mizpeh. But ſtill, as there ſeemed to be ſome little uneaſineſs among ſome of the people, Saul could not be ſettled upon the throne of Iſrael until this uneaſineſs ſubſided, and all the people were made quiet. Samuel therefore, who well underſtood the rights of the people, muſt have all Iſrael together at Gilgal, that there might be a mutual and univerſal conſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people, and a perfect acquieſcence in Saul as King.</p>
            <p>AND all the people made Saul King themſelves, and they and he came to a mutual agreement, that he ſhould be their King, and they his Subjects; and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced heartily together. Had it not been for this mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual agreement between Saul and the people, Saul might have fed his fathers aſſes to the day of his death, for any thing we know to the contrary.</p>
            <p>And David tho' he was anointed to be King by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel at God's command, at Bethlehem, muſt be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed again, and acknowledged to be King by the people. There muſt be a covenant made between Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid and the people, before he could mount the throne. So all the Elders of Iſrael came to the King to Hebron; and King David made a league with them in Hebron
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:014036_0022_0F92ACD7E1632268"/>
before the Lord. And they anointed David King over Iſrael. II. Sam. v.3.</p>
            <p>THUS, there have been ſome Kings of Iſrael made ſo both by God and the people, yet never one by God only. And in all the nations of the earth, Kings have ever been made ſo by the people only. Nor does God ever make a King over any people, any other ways than he does all things that are done in the univerſe. Juſt ſo far from truth is it to ſay that Kings derive their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from God only, as to aſſert a thing to have cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly been, which certainly never had exiſtence.</p>
            <p>THAT all nations have ever looked upon themſelves to have a natural and undoubted right to make their own Kings, is evident from theſe two things, that they have ever aſſerted and claimed ſuch right; and becauſe they always groaned and uttered bitter complaints when they could not enjoy and exerciſe ſuch right.</p>
            <p>CICERO de Offic. l. 2. as I find, is thus tranſlated by Sir Roger L'Eſtrange, p. 101, 102. Heroclotus tells us, that the Medians choſe their Kings originally for the probity of their manners, and in hopes of enjoying the benefits of common juſtice.</p>
            <p>IN the kingdom of Perſia, after the junction of the kingdoms of Media and Perſia, which was as much of a monarchy as any almoſt in thoſe times, the Nobility and Governors of provinces, the repreſentative body of that nation, ſuppoſed themſelves to have right to make their Kings, change ſucceſſions, raiſe up whom they would to royal dignity, &amp;c. &amp;c. did actually exerciſe ſuch powers when the ſucceſſion to the throne did not pleaſe them, or was not for the good and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the kingdom. This is evident from many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in the hiſtory of that kingdom. To cite but one at this time. After the death of Artaxerxes, the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Governors of provinces, who were diſguſted exceedingly with the cruelty and wretched management of Sogdianus, revolted from him, and went over to Ochus, and having put the royal liara upon his head,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:014036_0023_0F92ACD89C3947E0"/>
declared him King. <note n="†" place="bottom">Prid. Connect. Vol. II. <hi>580.</hi> to this effect.</note> This did the Nobility and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors of Provinces, for the good of the kingdom of Perſia.</p>
            <p>THERE was a general council gathered in all the ſtates and free cities of Greece, in which was lodged a power of chooſing their own Kings, as well as command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in war, as any one may find if he will. This is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from what Alexander did after the death of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Philip, for he ſummoned this very council, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured to be choſen by them, the ſucceſſor to his father in the ſame command.</p>
            <p>EVERY one that knows ever ſo little about their hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, knows that all the civil and military officers, both ſupreme and ſubordinate, in the Roman ſtate, were cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen by the ſuffrages of the ſenate and people of Rome, and the army.</p>
            <p>CAESAR and Tacitus deſcribe the antient Britons to have been a fierce people; zealous of liberty: a free people; not like the Gauls, governed by laws made by great men; but by the people. In Caeſar's time they choſe Capivallaunces, and afterwards Caraſtacus, Arvira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus, Galgacus, and others, to command them in their wars, but they retained the government in themſelves.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Lord Sommers, <hi>45.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>IN the beginning of the 5th century, when the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror Honorius reigned, the Romans withdrew from the iſland of Britain, and left it, carrying away with them all the forces, and leaving the kingdom open to the invaſions and ravages of the Picts and Scots; upon which the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons elected ſeveral Kings one after another, who were depoſed almoſt as ſoon as choſen; till finally they choſe Vortigern, who reigned a long time. Such was their zeal for liberty, and ſo tenacious were the worthy anceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the preſent Britons of their darling rights and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, that when the Saxons who had been invited over by them, found means to quarrel with them, and made an entire conqueſt of the whole kingdom, except Wales and Cornwall, they fled thither for <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="4 letters">

               </gap>ty, and would not
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:014036_0024_0F92ACD95863F520"/>
be ſubjected, as to the main part of them, to tyrannic and deſpotic power.</p>
            <p>MONSIEUR Meveray, as I find him quoted, gives this account of the manners and powers of the ancient Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans. There were, if I miſtake not, three ſorts of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment among the Germans. In ſome places the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had the principal authority, and yet they often elected a Prince or a King; ſometimes a General whom we call Duke, from the Latin word <hi>Dux.</hi> But the power of theſe chiefs deſcended entirely on the community, or people; ſo that it was always a mixed democracy. In other parts, among the Gothones, the King's reigned with more power; yet not to the detriment of liberty; their royalty was limited by laws and the reaſon of things. As for li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, no people were ever ſo jealous of it, or ever defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it ſo long, and ſo ſucceſsfully as the Germans,</p>
            <p>IT may indeed be ſaid, that liberty, being driven out of the beſt part of the world by the Roman arms, took refuge on the further ſide of the Rhine; where ſhe had for her companions and guards, poverty, innocence, fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality and modeſty; and where, in the faſtneſſes of woods and moraſſes, ſometimes on the defenſive, and ſometimes making couragious ſallies, ſhe combatted five hundred years together, againſt tyranny and all her train; I mean ambition, luxury, voluptuouſneſs, flattery, corruption and diviſions; the inſtruments which that cruel enemy of the human race employs to forge manacles and fetters.</p>
            <p>THUS in ancient Paleſtine, Media, Perſia, Tyre, Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, Greece, Rome, Briton and Germany, the people con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered themſelves as poſſeſſed of the rights and privileges of chooſing their own rulers and officers ſupreme and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate, civil and military. Theſe great and ineſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble rights they viewed as the free donation of God and nature, and uſed them in the general: and when they were not prevented by tyrannic and deſpotic powers, by invaſions and conqueſts, which they could not avoid, and under which they ſuffered and mourned ſo long as they laſted. And thus we find that hiſtory both ſacred and profane eſtabliſhes this truth, that thoſe principles have
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:014036_0025_0F92ACDA191CD540"/>
generally been wrought into practice in the kingdoms and nations of the earth, which nature and her God have ſo deeply laid, and on which the darling rights and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of the people depend, and by which they are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported.</p>
            <p>'TIS very true, Jehovah is the intelligent and glorious author of nature, and the natural governor of the univerſe, and none can diſpute his authority to deal with kingdoms and their Kings as he ſhall pleaſe; he may ſet up one, and pull down on other at his will; he may raiſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal dignity and honour the men whom he chuſes, and dethrone others at his ſupreme good pleaſure. But 'tis as true, that he never yet ſaw fit, in his infinite wiſdom and counſels, to uſe this his undoubted power: he never hath, in all the ages and generations of men upon the earth, ſet up one King over any people or nation of his own entire authority, and without the voluntary election of that people or nation. He hath, both in his word and his providence, always allowed the people a voice in all elections of their civil and military officers and rulers. This liberty he allowed to that people whom he choſe in a peculiar ſenſe, to be their God, and alſo their Saviour and Deliverer. Nor would he himſelf aſſume the regen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and government of that favoured people, without their conſent and free election. For when he was about to take upon himſelf the kingly office, and to preſide over Iſrael as their politic head and legiſlator he gave com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment to Moſes to lay the matter before the people, and to acquaint them with his deſign; to ſhew them the terms of the covenant, or political league which they were to make, for their future government under his ſupreme authority. Iſrael in full parliament aſſembled ſolemnly declare their conſent to theſe terms, and ſwear allegiance to Jehovah as their King, and thus he became ſeated upon the throne of Iſrael. And this ſame Jehovah who was thus choſen himſelf, and ſeated upon the throne of Iſrael by the people, hath ordered it ſo in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, that people and nations have generally enjoyed their natural rights in this reſpect, that they have made
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:014036_0026_0F92ACDB1300D288"/>
their own Kings, tho' he hath ſometimes for wiſe and holy ends, permitted tyranny and oppreſſion to rivet their hateful and galling chains upon the necks of the people, to the detriment of theſe natural rights and privileges.</p>
            <p>THOSE men who can plead that Kings derive their authority and right to reign over the people from God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, are either groſsly ignorant, and ſo ought not to ſay any thing about this matter; or they can plead for any thing, juſt as it ſhall coincide with their particular hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, or their deſpotic principles; and ſo are not worthy to be heard, tho' they ſay ever ſo much, by any man who has a ſacred regard to truth and righteouſneſs, natural juſtice and equity.</p>
            <p>WE may, I humbly think, conclude that our propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is true, and that a people have a natural and inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent right to appoint and conſtitute a King ſupreme, and all ſubordinate civil officers and rulers over them, for their civil good, liberty, protection, peace and ſafety.</p>
            <p>THUS having ſhewn the people's powers and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges in entering into civil ſtate, in conſtituting a King a ſupreme ruler, and all in ſubordination to him in civil truſt and power: I paſs,</p>
            <p n="2">II. TO SHEW what are the duties and obligations of a King erected by the people, as he ought to be, and of all ſubordinate civil rulers and officers.</p>
            <p>KINGS and people, rulers and ruled, are co-relatives, and the relation ſubſiſting between them, neceſſarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, or ſuppoſes ſeveral duties mutually incumbent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them: Duties incumbent upon Kings and rulers to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the people, and thoſe over whom and for whom they rule; and likewiſe duties incumbent upon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, thoſe who are ruled, towards their Kings, and all who rule over them. My immediate buſineſs is, to ſhew what are the ſeveral duties incumbent upon the Kings and all civil rulers towards the people, and thoſe over whom and for whom they rule. And here I ſhall not preſume to mention all the duties and obligations lying upon Kings and all civil rulers towards the people, but
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:014036_0027_0F92ACDF5C248760"/>
ſhall content myſelf with mentioning ſome of the more important and obvious of them.</p>
            <p>THESE more important and obvious duties and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations lying upon Kings and all civil rulers and officers, you have in the following propoſitions and reaſonings.</p>
            <p n="1">I. KINGS and all civil rulers and officers are obliged and bound to uſe their utmoſt endeavours in the due ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion of that power, and the fulfilment of that truſt repoſited with them, to defend and ſecure to the people the quiet and peaceable enjoyment of their perſons and properties.</p>
            <p>BY properties of the people I mean, all thoſe worldly goods, eſtates and chattles which they have gotten by their honeſt labour, induſtry and frugality; together with all thoſe juſt privileges and advantages they have to acquire more by labour, induſtry, trade, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, manufactures, &amp;c. Now, that Kings and all ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil rulers and officers are obliged and bound to defend and ſecure to the people the quiet and unmoleſted en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of their perſons, and theſe properties is a plain truth, and very eaſily made evident to every one.</p>
            <p>THIS is a plain truth, becauſe this is the very end and deſign, or at lead one very principal end and deſign, of their being, as civil rulers. The people really deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when they raiſed them to places of public truſt and authority, that they ſhould exert all that power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority they gave them, to defend and ſecure to them the quiet and peaceable enjoyment of their perſons and properties; <hi>i. e.</hi> of their perſons and all their worldly goods, eſtates and chattles, which they had gotten by fatigue, labour and induſtry; and alſo of all thoſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges and advantages which they juſtly had to get more worldly goods, and greater eſtates; ſuch as labour, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, trade, commerce, &amp;c. This I ſay was one ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry principal deſign the people had in view, when they raiſed ſome men to places of public truſt and authority, and entered into civil eſtate, and civil, mutual covenants, compacts and aſſociations. 'Tis very plain in reaſon, and even in common ſenſe, that this muſt be one main
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:014036_0028_0F92ACE15931AD30"/>
end, one principal deſign at leaſt, (for I ſhall preſently ſhew they muſt have had others) which the people had a view to, when they entered into civil ſtate, and made them civil rulers, and gave them the civil ſword, with proper power and authority to wield it. And this may appear moſt evidently thus. Suppoſe A, B, C, D, E, F, G, &amp;c. a large number of people in neighbourhood together, in ſome part of this globe; and to have acquired by honeſt labour, induſtry, frugality and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with one another, very conſiderable eſtates; and to be under very good advantages to get more eſtate and worldly goods, if they could live quietly and peaceably in the enjoyment of their perſons and preſent acquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and of thoſe advantages they are now under to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire more. But the injury and violence offered their perſons, and the continual ravages and depredations made upon their eſtates, by neighbouring nations and people dwelling upon the continent, and even beyond the ſeas, prevent them both from the enjoyment of their perſons in peace and quiet, and what acquiſitions they have already made, and alſo from thoſe future ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions which an unmoleſted enjoyment of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages would aſſiſt them to make.</p>
            <p>They find themſelves under fatal neceſſity of ſuffering the like injuries and depredations for the future, in the circumſtances they are now in, being in a ſtate of nature, and having no one, or more, of ſuperior power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority among them, to counſel and adviſe to meaſures proper to be taken by them, and to lead forth their united force, by his or their command, to oppoſe and ſuppreſs ſuch troublers of their peace and quiet, and injurers of their perſons and properties; to prevent their making ſuch ravages, and committing ſuch injuries for the future or to make repriſals for thoſe already committed. And thus they become very ſenſible of the impoſſibility of their living together in ſuch a ſituation with any tolerably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of quiet, ſafety or ſecurity, either to their perſons or properties; and of the neceſſity of making an eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al alteration in their mode of living. They are now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:014036_0029_0F92ACE365634DE8"/>
that they muſt chooſe ſome perſons from among their numbers, and raiſe them to places of ſuperior truſt and authority, and inveſt them with powers, ſuch as ſhall tend to their benefit, to the effectual ſecurity, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and protection of their perſons and properties, from all ſuch injuries, foreign invaſions, and depredations, as they have too ſenſibly ſuffered.</p>
            <p>ACCORDINGLY, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, &amp;c. meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in a general aſſembly, confer upon their preſent great unhappineſs in ſuch a ſituation; and the probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity that it will ſtill continue or grow greater, if they ſhould remain thus. They finally unanimouſly agree to an alteration of their preſent manner of living, and to the election of a civil ſtate and government, and the mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing civil compacts and leagues, and effectually entering into a politic ſociety; and theſe for their civil good, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, protection, peace and ſafety, in the enjoyment of their perſons and properties without injury and ruptures. To effect which ſalutary purpoſes and deſigns, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, &amp;c. take out of their number, by general votes, or ſuffrages, L, M, N, O, P, &amp;c. ſuch as they judge to be eminently poſſeſſed of wiſdom, equity, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bity, and public ſpirit, qualifying them for the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant and intereſting buſineſs of legiſlation and execution, and all the great and weighty affairs of civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Of theſe men they make rulers and officers of ſupreme and ſubordinate authority, and to theſe they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legate a power to make and execute, from time to time, all ſuch laws, orders and ſtatutes, as ſhall be, in their beſt judgment, and upon proper experiment of them, the moſt proper and fit to promote the general good and utility; and to ſettle and maintain them in the quiet and juſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of their perſons and properties. Always pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they retain a right and power to chooſe a ſufficient number from among themſelves, to be a repreſentative body of the whole people, to ſit in council with thoſe they now elect into places of public truſt and authority; and to have a voice in the making all ſuch laws, as above,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:014036_0030_0F92ACE483078B10"/>
and in the management of all the moſt weighty concerns of the ſtate.</p>
            <p>MANY and powerful reaſons might eaſily be given, if it were required in this place, why any people have right and why it is a point of conſummate wiſdom and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for them, always to have ſuch a repreſentative bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy from among the commons, to ſit in council with their rulers, and to have a voice in legiſlation. But as it is not required in this place, and is not itſelf a matter of the greateſt conteſt or difference, I ſhall not make uſe of this time to give the reaſons for it, but ſhall willingly paſs it in ſilence.</p>
            <p>Now I aſk, are not L, M, N, O, P, &amp;c. thus elected by the people, and raiſed by A, B, C, D, E, F, G, &amp;c. to places of public truſt and power, ſolemnly bound and obliged, on ſuppoſition they accept of theſe places and this civil truſt and authority, to defend and ſecure A, B, C, D, E, F, G, &amp;c. and every individual member of this ſociety, now a body politic, in the enjoyment of their perſons and properties in peace and quiet? are they not obliged to defend and ſecure the people in the unmoleſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed enjoyment of their rights, privileges, advantages and emoluments which God and nature have given them? I freely appeal to reaſon and the nature of things; I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to common ſenſe; I appeal moſt heartily to every one who is capable to read and underſtand what I write, whether this be not ſo.</p>
            <p>CERTAINLY every man muſt be conſidered as under obligations to do what he moſt voluntarily covenants and engages to do; but every King, every civil ruler, when they conſent to be ſuch, in conſequence of the free elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſuffrage of the people, do, <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> engage and covenant to uſe their ſuperior power and authority to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the people's good, peace and happineſs, and to do their utmoſt to ſecure and defend their perſons and properties.</p>
            <p>'Tis a well known practice, in all countries, and among all nations, where King's are elective, to uſe ſome ſolemn form of inauguration, in which the King ſwears to rule
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:014036_0031_0F92ACE4B9A63590"/>
the people by wholeſome laws; and to abide by the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute laws, and the Magna Charta of the kingdom, in all thoſe laws to which he ſhall give his royal aſſent. I have no objection to make againſt this. But I really ſuppoſe that a King, when he accepts of the regency, upon his election to it by the people, does, by this very acceptance, lay himſelf under ſolemn obligations to rule the people by wholeſome laws, and to do all in his power to make them happy. For he knows that their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is the deſign they have in view, in electing him into place of royal dignity and authority. How groſs and deteſtable would be his hypocriſy, if he ſhould accept of regal power and place, upon the voluntary election of the people, and yet not ſincerely deſign to promote their good and happineſs, in ſuch exalted ſtations of life and actions! every King is bound to make the people's good his Magna Charta, in all his adminiſtrations.</p>
            <p n="2">2. KINGS, and all civil rulers, are under obligations to defend and ſecure the people in the worſhip of the Deity, and the due obſervation of religion in publick; and even to exert their power and authority to oblige the people to attend upon the public worſhip of God.</p>
            <p>I am writing and ſpeaking in a land where the true God is known and revered, and the religion of Chriſt Jeſus the Meſſias is generally acknowledged.</p>
            <p>L, M, N, O P, &amp;c. are not only under obligations to defend and ſecure the people in the quiet and peaceable enjoyment of their perſons and properties, i. e. their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and wordly goods and eſtates, &amp;c. together with all their juſt advantages and opportunies of getting more worldly goods, eſtates, &amp;c. by labour, induſtry, trade, manufactures, &amp;c. but they are alſo under obligations to protect and ſecure the people in the worſhip of the Deity; and even to exert their power and authority to oblige the people to attend upon the public worſhip of God with conſtancy and all becoming decency.</p>
            <p>CIVIL magiſtrates ought to conſider that the people have ſouls as well as bodies, immortal as well as tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral intereſts: and that they expect that thoſe men whom
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:014036_0032_0F92ACE55AB96288"/>
they elevate into places of diſtinction, truſt and dignity, ſhould have ſome regard to their ſuperior intereſt as well as to their inferior, to their eternal as well as temporal concerns. They moſt juſtly expect that their rulers fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, cheriſh, protect and defend them, at leaſt whilſt they worſhip the divinity, and attend upon religion in ſuch manner, as is no wiſe detrimental, but greatly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial to the civil ſtate; and certainly for the promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their everlaſting account with God.</p>
            <p>I do not mean that the civil magiſtrate, as ſuch, or purely becauſe he is elevated above the people in his civil capacity, ſhould therefore exert himſelf in the church, or have a chief care in managing the affairs of Chriſt's houſe: by no means does this belong to his character as a civil magiſtrate. The ſuperior character and authority of a civil magiſtrate, in the politic ſtate, give him no ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior power or authority in the eccleſiaſtical ſtate. But I do really mean that the civil magiſtrate, as a man, as one bound for immortality, and even as a man elevated, and in honor and dignity, and one who is truely concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the eternal welfare of the people, is under very great obligations to promote, nouriſh, defend and ſecure all reverential worſhip of God, and decent obſervation of religion, both natural and revealed. Thus much I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the civil magiſtrate is obliged to do, in order to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the worſhip of the Deity, &amp; for the due encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of religion in general. But I ſay further, the civil magiſtrate, as ſuch, or purely becauſe he is in the magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy is under obligations to exert his power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to oblige the people to a due and regular and conſtant attendance upon the public worſhip of the church.</p>
            <p>If the civil magiſtrate be under obligations to defend and ſecure to the people the enjoyment of their perſons and properties, in peace and quietneſs, which every one will readily grant, then he is under obligations to do thoſe things which have a direct &amp; natural tendency to promote this their enjoyment; and indeed theſe are very nearly the ſame thing. For to bring any thing into effect, and to do thoſe things which have a natural and direct tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:014036_0033_0F92ACE6398AD1D8"/>
to ſuch effect, are very nearly the ſame thing: cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly there is as much relation between them, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the means and the end effected by thoſe means. And it may be the caſe, that civil magiſtrates may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable to do any more, than to uſe the beſt and moſt likely means to make the ſtate flouriſh, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple happy. But ſurely, in all chriſtian countries, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, due and regular attendance upon the worſhip in public aſſemblies, where the great fundamental princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples truths and duties of natural religion are ſkilfully taught and inculcated upon the people, and where the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of Meſſias, in its genuine purity and ſimplicity, is preached, and its vaſt importance clearly and wiſely ſhewn, I ſay, a conſtant and regular attendance upon this worſhip and ſervice is for the civil good of the people, and an unſpeakable advantage to every politic ſtate. For in the church the people are taught their duty to God and the king, and there the moſt powerful arguments and motives are preſented to their minds, to prevail with and perſuade them to a ſuitable conduct towards both. More powerful and weighty arguments and motives may people receive from the deſk than from the bench or the bar, the priſon or the gallows, to perſuade them to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all becoming obedience to civil magiſtrates. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps one orthodox or faithful preacher of religion may do more real ſervice, even to the civil ſtate, than two faithful juſtices of the peace, in each particular ſociety or pariſh. For if the arguments fetched from the unſeen ſtate, if the eternal joys and everlaſting torments of an heaven and a hell, when prudently handled, and ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally repreſented to the people, will not prevail with them to render due honours and worſhip to the great God, and his eternal ſon, or to pay proper obedience and meet ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to kings and civil magiſtrates; 'tis very improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that any thing which they can do will be effectual to perſuade them to behave well in the civil ſtate. If all preachers of religion ſhould be diſcountenanced, and all public aſſemblies for the worſhip of the Deity ceaſe, in any chriſtian country, there would be no ſuch thing as
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:014036_0034_0F92ACE6D58CC4F8"/>
holding the people together in civil ſociety, and all civil government would preſently be diſſolved; and anarchy and confuſion, atheiſm and barbarity, and a diſmal train of evils would ſoon make inroads upon the people, to their certain ruin.</p>
            <p>MAGISTRATES are therefore obliged on politic princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, to defend &amp; maintain the public worſhip of the Deity, and a conſtant and regular obſervation of religion in public. Yea, the very ſame arguments that may be uſed to prove that civil magiſtrates are bound to defend and ſecure to the people the enjoyment of their perſons and properties, as one great deſign and end of their being, as civil magiſtrates may be alſo uſed to prove that they are obliged and bound to defend and maintain the public worſhip of the Deity, and a due obſervation of religion among the people. Therefore, if any one aſk me, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I would have the magiſtrate make uſe of the civil ſword, in order to oblige the people to attend conſtantly and regularly upon public worſhip, if nothing elſe will do this? I readily anſwer, I would, by all means. I really look upon the civil magiſtrate to be under as great obligations to uſe the civil ſword, or to exert his authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to oblige the people to pay a conſtant attendance upon public worſhip, as he is to uſe the civil ſword, or to exert his authority, to oblige the people to do any thing elſe, that can poſſibly be named, of equal advantage to the civil ſtate.</p>
            <p>THUS 'tis proved that civil magiſtrates are under obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to defend and ſecure the people in the worſhip of the Deity; and even to uſe the civil ſword, or exert their authority, to maintain a public obſervation of religion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. KINGS, and all civil magiſtrates are moſt ſolemnly and forever bound to make all their laws agreeing with truth and reaſon, the laws of God and the nature of things.</p>
            <p>THOUGH L, M, N, O, P, &amp;c. are ever ſo ſolemnly bound and obliged to defend and ſecure A, B, C, D, E, F, G, &amp;c. in the quiet and unmoleſted enjoyment of their perſons and properties, and all their natural and juſt
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:014036_0035_0F92ACE79E7AB048"/>
rights and privileges; and alſo to maintain the worſhip of the Deity, and the public obſervation of religion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them: yet they cannot be ſuppoſed obliged to make or execute any one law, for theſe or any other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of the ſtate, which contradicts truth, or counteracts any of the maxims and laws of reaſon and the nature of things, which are the laws of God. For 'tis abſolutely impoſſible that any ſuch laws can be binding upon the people, if made. And A, B, C, D, E, F, G, &amp;c. when they entered into civil ſtate, and chooſe ſome of their number to be their civil rulers, did not oblige thoſe whom they thus elected into places of truſt and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to make or execute any laws which did not tend to promote, or had a tendency to obſtruct the enjoyment of their perſons and properties and religion; nor did thoſe conſequently, who conſented to be civil magiſtrates upon the election of the people, oblige themſelves to any ſuch thing. For to ſuppoſe either of theſe would be the groſſeſt abſurdity and contradiction. But it is now, ever hath been, and will continue to be a t<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>th, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation of all things, that for civil magiſtrates to make or execute any laws repugnant to truth and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to the laws of God and the nature of things, will not only be no furtherence but the greateſt detriment to all civil ſtates whatſoever. It cannot be otherwiſe therefore, than that all civil magiſtrates are ſolemnly and forever obliged and bound to make and execute ſuch laws only as are agreeable with their truſt and reaſon, the laws of God and the nature of things; for ſuch only will tend to the peace and happineſs of all civil ſtates.</p>
            <p>WHEN I ſay that civil magiſtrates are obliged to make and execute laws agreeing with the laws of God, I do not mean to maintain or even to ſuggeſt, that they are ſcrupulouſly to abide by the declarations of the bible, in all the laws they make; nor do I ſuppoſe that the bible was deſigned by God for a code of civil laws, or to be the magna charta of any nation under heaven. 'Tis true the civil laws of the Jewiſh nation are principally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the writings of Moſes, and in the old teſtament.
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:014036_0036_0F92ACE88C275018"/>
But it muſt be obſerved that even theſe did not continue to bind the Hebrews, any longer than while Jehovah was their politic head and ſovereign; and that they do not, nor ever did, bind any other nation, any further than the reaſon of them is founded in nature, and ſo renders them of eternal obligation to all mankind who are acquainted with them. But what I mean is, that no laws are to be made, or enforced, which are contradictory to laws, inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, and plain declarations of the bible which are of natural and eternal obligation.</p>
            <p>Ex. Gr. laws to endemnify murderers, banditti, thieves, traitors, ſacriligious perſons, &amp;c. ſuch laws would be contradictory to truth, which requires that every perſon &amp; thing be treated according to what it really is. Diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing with reaſon, which ever coincides with truth, and even impolitic, as tending to the ſpeedy everſion and ruin of all civil government and authority whatſoever. Repugnant to God's laws in his bible, to thoſe of them which are of natural, and ſo conſequently of eternal obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. And contrary to the nature of the thing's taking place in every civil ſtate, as well as in the great world of nature and providence; which requires that civil puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhould be inflicted on tranſgreſſors againſt the civil ſtate, bearing proportion to their crimes; and that no delinquent, ever eſcape unpuniſhed.</p>
            <p>THUS civil magiſtrates who would conſult and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the peace and happineſs of the ſtate are ſolemnly and forever bound to make truth and reaſon, the laws of God and the nature of things, their ſtandards in making civil laws, and very ſcrupulouſly to abide by them.</p>
            <p>Theſe now mentioned are ſome of thoſe many and great obligations and duties which are incumbent upon kings and all civil magiſtrates of ſupreme and ſubordinate rank.</p>
            <p n="3">III. I SHALL now paſs to ſhew what are the duties and obligations of the people in this civil ſtate, to their civil rulers both ſupreme and ſubordinate, whilſt they fulfil their truſt, and anſwer their obligations to them.</p>
            <p>WHILST L, M, N, O, P, &amp;c. fulfil the truſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:014036_0037_0F92ACEC510CC2E8"/>
in them by A, B, C, D, E, F, G, &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and exert their ſuperior power and authority, wiſdom and public ſpirit, to defend and ſecure them in the quiet and peaceable enjoyment of their perſons and properties, natural and acquired rights, priviledges and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages; and whilſt they do all that in them lies, to promote and encourage the worſhip of the Deity, and to maintain the public obſervation of religion; and make all their laws for the ſupport of the civil ſtate, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing with truth and reaſon, the laws of God, and the nature of things; I ſay, while civil rulers conduct themſelves, and the affairs of the ſtate thus agreeably to the great ends and purpoſes of their being elected and inſtated in their ſeveral offices and places of power and truſt, there are many obligations and duties incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent upon the people towards them.</p>
            <p>WHILST kings, and civil rulers of all degrees of power and importance, fulfil their truſt, and act a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to their obligations to the people, there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny obligations and duties lying upon the people, which they are ſolemnly bound to obſerve and fulfil, with all care and fidelity to their rulers.</p>
            <p>WHAT ſome of the more important of theſe duties and obligations of the people in civil ſtate are, towards their civil rulers, whilſt they fulfil their truſt and anſwer their obligations to them, you may take in the following propoſitions and concluſions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THE people are bound in duty and intereſt to yield all due obedience to their civil rulers, both ſupreme and ſubordinate, whilſt they are endeavouring to promote their good.</p>
            <p>IT was the very deſign of A, B, C, D, E, F, G, &amp;c. in entering into civil ſtate, and making them ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil rulers, in chooſing men from their number, who were famed for wiſdom, probity and public ſpirit, to promote, defend and ſecure the public peace, tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and happineſs, by the exerciſe of their ſuperior wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, power and authority. Their wiſdom to contrive, and their power and authority to put in execution, all
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:014036_0038_0F92ACEE524A9A18"/>
their noiſe, and judicious projections and plans for theſe noble and generous purpoſes and deſigns. But civil rulers may rack their inventions, and exerciſe their wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ever ſo much, and lay the happieſt projects and ſchemes for the general utility, peace and proſperity of the people; yet if the people will not aſſiſt their rulers and legiſlators in the execution of theſe projects and ſchemes, by yielding a ready and chearful obedience to their directions and commands, the ends and deſigns of the people and the rulers in theſe projections, cannot be accompliſhed. The general good, peace and happineſs of the people, intended by them and their rulers too, can never be attained. For it is by the aſſiſtance of the people that civil rulers bring into effect their wiſe plans of government; and ſo, if they be virtuous, wiſe and good rulers, as is the preſent ſuppoſition, effectuate the deſigns and purpoſes of the people in entering into civil ſtate and combination, even the general emolument, liberty and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity. Therefore if the people will not aſſiſt their rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and legiſlators, by yielding a ready and chearful o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to their commands and requirements, in order that government may be maintained, by bringing into execution thoſe plans and projections which proceeded from the ſuperior wiſdom, integrity and public ſpirit of the magiſtrates and law-givers, and which tend to effect the public tranquility, and to promote the liberty, peace and happineſs of the ſtate; they certainly counteract their own purpoſes and deſigns, and hinder thoſe things from taking effect, which they determined with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſhould take effect, when they entered into civil ſtate, and conſtituted civil rulers and officers in it. So that it is very plain, that duty and intereſt both oblige the people to yield a ready and chearful obedience to all the wiſe and wholeſome laws directions and commands of their civil rulers and officers.</p>
            <p>CIVIL officers and executors of the laws of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy, are ſolemnly bound to exert themſelves to the utmoſt within their ſeveral ſpheres of action, to put all ſuch laws as are calculated for the general good and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:014036_0039_0F92ACEE8DB92F00"/>
of the ſtate, into execution. They ſhould ſee to it with care, that they fulfil this truſt, and do what in them is, what really belongs to their ſeveral depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to promote the general utility, peace and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the whole. And the people are alſo obliged to give their aſſiſtance to the executors of laws, and to forward them in bringing into execution the laws and orders of the magiſtrates and legiſlators for the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal intereſt of the civil ſtate.</p>
            <p>THUS, if legiſlators and magiſtrates make wiſe and wholeſome laws, which tend to the general good and happineſs; and if the officers and executors of theſe laws fulfil, with great care and fidelity, their truſt, by endeavouring to bring theſe laws into execution; and finally, if the people chearfully give their aſſiſtance, to theſe officers and executors of laws, and thus yield a ready obedience to their civil rulers; the ſtate will certainly flouriſh; peace, tranquility and happineſs will enſue, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one will, moſt likely, enjoy his perſon, property and religion in undiſturbed quiet; and a univerſal joy and gladneſs will reign throughout the whole community, and all will experience the ſalutary effects of civil ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety and combination. But if otherwiſe, an obſtruction of the progeſs of juſtice and righteouſneſs will follow, to the inevitable ruin of the ſtate.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE people are bound to pay a ſuitable reſpect to their civil rulers, and to maintain their honour, dignity and reputation in the ſtate, and among all their ſubjects.</p>
            <p>EVERY one may eaſily imagine that honour, dignity and reputation will have a mighty influence upon the people, whoſe civil rulers ſhare largely in them. No people will very much regard thoſe rulers who have little or no reputation among them, but are had in very low eſteem. Love and reſpect for civil rulers will do more to gain them obedience from the people, than the power of the ſword can poſſibly do. The ſword and the power civil rulers have to wield it may deſtroy, maim, and take away the lives of ſubjects; but they will never gain the love and cordial affections of the people, like honour and
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:014036_0040_0F92ABC7976AB488"/>
eſteem, and conſequently not their ready and chearful obedience. The former may, and undoubtedly do, make a great many political hypocrites, but few cordial and loyal ſubjects. It will be hard work, and a forbidding taſk, for civil rulers to preſs their way through, and gain obedience to their laws and mandates, from a people whoſe hearts and hands are no further with them, than mere force and conſtraint, the power of the ſword, and the awful dread of the whip, the priſon and the gallows compel them. But love, eſteem, and veneration for ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil rulers will ſweetly conſtrain the people to yield a dutiful compliance with all thoſe laws and injunctions of the magiſtrates, which are calculated for the general benefit of the ſtate.</p>
            <p>IT muſt then be the incumbent duty of all the people, to endeavour that the honour and reputation of civil rulers and magiſtrates be maintained among the ſubjects. For we have obſerved before, that it is for the general good, peace, ſafety, liberty and happineſs of the community, that civil government is ever ſet up among a people, and civil leagues, compacts and combinations entered into by them. But theſe things can never be effected, the good, peace, ſafety, &amp;c. of the community will never be brought about, unleſs there be a free and impartial exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of juſtice and righteouſneſs among the people. And this cannot be; a free and impartial exerciſe of juſtice and righteouſneſs can never take place, unleſs good and wholeſome laws for this purpoſe can be brought into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution among the people. Nor can this be done; laws, though ever ſo wiſely calculated for the univerſal good, peace, &amp;c. of the community, can never be put in due execution, unleſs the people in general have their hearts and hands with the magiſtrates, and will join with them in putting their laws in execution. But neither will this be unleſs the people honour and revere the magiſtrates, and have them in ſuitable eſteem and veneration. That magiſtrates and civil rulers, both ſupreme and ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, be honourable and reputable among the people, muſt be concluded to be for the general utility and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:014036_0041_0F92ABCBA3D7F2F8"/>
of the ſtate; if they are wiſe, prudent and faithful men. Every lover of his county, and of it's liberty, peace and proſperity, will do his endeavour to maintain the honour and reputation of all good civil rulers and magiſtrates.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THE people are under obligations to give their ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and civil magiſtrates a valuable reward for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and work which they do for the ſtate.</p>
            <p>THE reaſon and nature of things, the univerſal cuſtom and practice of all nations, and the word of God, moſt plainly ſhew it to be juſt that tribute ſhould be paid to Caeſar: that King's, and all civil rulers and magiſtrates ſhould have a reaſonable reward for their faithful ſervice for the people. For when a people enter into civil ſtate, and make choice of ſome of their number qualified to rule, and put them into places of public truſt and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, give them power to make and execute laws for their good and advantage, for their ſecurity, peace and protection in the enjoyment of their perſons and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and religion; they very juſtly expect that theſe men, whom they have made their rulers and legiſlators, guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians and protectors, ſhould ſpend a conſiderable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of their time to conſult the intereſt of the ſtate, to make and execute laws, to concert and proſecute the wiſeſt and beſt methods and plans of government, to ſend and receive embaſſies, to determine concerning peace and war with other powers and ſtates, to ſettle and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate trade and commerce, &amp;c. The people, I ſay, do expect and really look upon it as neceſſary, that their rulers ſhould ſpend a great part of their time, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe their wiſdom and ſkill, in theſe ſervices for the ſtate for them.</p>
            <p>NOW, if rulers and legiſlators are faithful to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, their conſtituents, and improve their time and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities for the good of the ſtate; it is certainly highly rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable they ſhould have a valuable conſideration for it, made them by the people for whom they ſerve. The people are continually receiving benefits, and reaping innumerable profits and emoluments, whilſt their rulers
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:014036_0042_0F92ABCDA76C3190"/>
and magiſtrates are diligently and faithfully employing their time and talents to protect, defend and make them happy, in the quiet and unmoleſted enjoyment of their perſons and properties, their liberties and privileges both natural and acquired. Surely they will not think it hard and unreaſonable, that their rulers and magiſtrates ſhould reap ſome of theſe profits, and taſte ſome of theſe ſweets of ſociety with them! yea, it would be directly contrary to truth, to reaſon and juſtice, if they ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny them a handſome maintenance and ſupport for their ſervices.</p>
            <p>'TIS impoſſible any men ſhould be made civil rulers and magiſtrates without their own conſent and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and it is altogether improbable that any number of men ſhould conſent to improve their time and talents for the advantage and in the ſervice of others, for no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable reward at all: and if they ſhould, it is very manifeſtly unreaſonable, that the people ſhould receive their ſervices and labours, and reap unknown advantages and benefits by them, and in return, make them no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable conſideration.</p>
            <p>For one man to uſe the time and talents of another as his own, or in his own ſervice, and for his own purpoſes and deſigns, when they are not his own would be a plain and palpable contradiction to truth. For his actions would moſt evidently declare that the time and talents of another man were his own, when indeed they were not: a groſs violation of ſacred truth! ſo that it is a plain and open contradiction of truth, for any people to elect men into places of public truſt and authority, and uſe them as rulers, legiſlators and executors, except they give them a valuable conſideration for their ſervices. This would contradict truth alſo another way; for it would be a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic declaration that the time and talents of thoſe men, whom they ſhould elect, &amp;c. were not their own, when they really are, in nature and reaſon.</p>
            <p>AND if any number of men ſhould conſent that their time, talents and abilities ſhould be improved for the ſervice of the ſtate, it is a plain caſe to every one, that it
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:014036_0043_0F92ABCEB84BE550"/>
would be unreaſonable in the ſtate to employ them for nothing. For every man, by the laws of nature and reaſon, is juſtly entitled to the uſe and improvement of his own: if therefore he uſe his own powers and abilities, time and talents in the ſervice, and for the advantage of others, it muſt be reaſonable that he have a reward, of thoſe men for whom he uſes them. 'Tis therefore the duty of the people, and what they are under obligations to do, to give their kings and all ſupreme and ſubordinate civil rulers, a valuable reward for their ſervices to the ſtate.</p>
            <p>IF any one ſhould aſk me, how much a king, or any other civil magiſtrate, ought to have of the people? I would tell him, that I ſhall be under better advantages to anſwer him, when he ſhall tell me, who is the man, he would have made a king, what are his talents of mind, what his natural and acquired abilities, what are his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and ſkill in the affairs of government, of what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, faithfulneſs, probity and public ſpirit he is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd of, and what are all the circumſtances of his perſon and family, and all thoſe of the whole kingdom, over which he is to rule, and what are their expectations from him, &amp;c. Until all this, and perhaps much more, be done, I ſhall freely tell ſuch an enquirer, I am incapable to ſolve his queſtion: nor can I give him much encouragement that I ſhall be able to anſwer him, when he ſhall have taken pains to give me all this information.</p>
            <p>IT is evident to any man, who thinks ever ſo little of the matter, that a great number of particulars muſt be taken into conſideration, in order to determine how large a king's, or magiſtrates ſalary ought to be. If he be a man of a capacious mind, of ſurpriſing natural and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired abilities, of great ſkill and wiſdom in the laws of nature and nations, if he be poſſeſſed of eminent piety and virtue, of great integrity, faithfulneſs, probity and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence, it is apparently reaſonable, that this man, if he would be perſuaded to undertake the important and intereſting truſt of governing, and to exerciſe his abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to uſe his time and talents for the good and benefit of the public, ought to receive a very valuable conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:014036_0044_0F92ABCF35266A30"/>
of the people. Becauſe there is the greateſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to expect he will govern well, and make the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity eaſy and quiet, peaceable and happy, in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of their perſons, properties and religion, and all their natural rights, privileges and endowments. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as a man of leſs abilities, emoluments and qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for government, may very reaſonably be contented with a leſs ſalary of the people: becauſe there is not the like probability that he will equally promote the intereſt of the civil community, by his ſervice.</p>
            <p>BUT I ſhall very willingly let this matter reſt here, without any poſitive deciſion of mine, it being a little foreign from my preſent deſign; and proceed in what is more agreeable to it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. 'TIS a duty incumbent upon the people to pray for their civil rulers, that the great ruler and governor of univerſal exiſtence, would be pleaſed to bleſs them with piety and virtue, wiſdom and benevolence; and crown all their labours for the public utility with abundant ſucceſs; and they ought to bleſs God for good rulers.</p>
            <p>ANY people who conſult their own beſt intereſt, and deſire that the civil ſtate may flouriſh and be happy; and who pay any religious regard to Jehovah, whoſe dominion is an everlaſting dominion, and of whoſe king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom there is no end, and who ruleth over all with right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and uncontroulable empire; will direct their warm and pathetic addreſſes to him, that he would look with favouring and propitious eye upon their rulers, and their ſtate. That he would grant to thoſe, whom they have dignified by electing them into places of public truſt and authority and devolving upon them the chief management of the moſt important affairs of the ſtate, abundant meaſures of piety and virtue, wiſdom and ſkill to rule, poſſeſs them with great probity, benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and public ſpirit, with a becoming zeal for his glory, and for the beſt civil and ſacred intereſts of the community: And that he would bleſs and favour all their endeavours to promote the peace, happineſs, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and tranquility of the civil ſtate.</p>
            <p>MOST ſurely ſuch religious addreſſes as theſe to the
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:014036_0045_0F92ABCFF7B59CA8"/>
Divinity, the great eternal and glorious author of nature, and the natural governor of the world, are not unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any people, who believe his being and attributes, and look upon his bleſſing as neceſſary to the proſperity and happineſs of any community.</p>
            <p>IF any people therefore wiſh for the proſperity of the civil ſtate, and deſire that the eaſe and pains, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and ſervices, of the civil rulers, may be ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful for this purpoſe, let them ſee to it, that they ſincerely and faithfully perform their duty to their rulers, and pray with all becoming decency, reverence and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, for Jehovah's bleſſing upon them.</p>
            <p>THIS is not only a duty of natural light and religion, which is enough to induce an obligation for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of it, upon every ſerious and virtuous man: But chriſtians muſt conſider, that it is an expreſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of inſpiration, and found in the law of Meſſias, that they pray for Kings, and all in authority, that, under their wiſe and faithful adminiſtrations, they may lead quiet and peaceable lives, in all godlineſs and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty. Chriſtians are then under double obligations to perform this duty to civil magiſtrates; obligations ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the law and light of nature and reaſon, and receiving additional force and authority from ſacred re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation. One would be apt to think it an eaſy matter to perſuade a chriſtian people of this great obligation ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon them, to pray for Kings and all in authority.</p>
            <p>BUT a people ought alſo to bleſs God for all good ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil rulers, ſuch as conſult his glory, and their beſt good and happineſs, and endeavour by all reaſonable and righteous methods of adminiſtration, to promote the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil felicity.</p>
            <p>I DO not mean that a people are obligated to bleſs God for good rulers, as tho' they were appointed to preſide over them, and inſtated in their offices and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties by his ſole authority: for I do not believe there ever was, yea, I know there never was, any one King, or civil ruler, appointed and inſtated in civil power, over any people under heaven, by God's ſole authority. And I moſt firmly believe it to be contrary to reaſon
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:014036_0046_0F92ABD0A28D1F90"/>
and the nature of things, I know it to be contrary to the law of nature and nations, to ſacred and profane hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, to believe or hold any ſuch opinion, that Kings derive their authority to reign over the people from God only. I ſhall not therefore direct any people to offer praiſe and thankſgiving to God, under any ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration as this. But as God's providence directs the affairs of univerſal exiſtence, concerns itſelf for the good and happineſs of kingdoms and ſtates, as it ſuperintends all the greater and meaner events that take place in the whole ſyſtem of beings, ſo that not ſo inſignificant a thing as a ſparrow, or even an hair of our heads, falls to the ground, without his knowledge and inſpection; when he, in his good and ſuperintending providence, permits and directs to the election of wiſe and good Kings and civil rulers, it very highly becomes the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſuitably to acknowledge his hand, and to pay pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per reſpect to the power that rules above, and governs in this lower world, that he hath directed them to the choice of good and faithful kings, of wiſe and righteous magiſtrates. Thus much I can heartily and patheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally recommend to all civil communities of people, who are thus favoured in God's holy and good provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in this intereſting regard.</p>
            <p>I WOULD therefore, with all due engagedneſs, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs and fervour, recommend it to all people who have wiſe and faithful rulers, that they devoutly pay to the great ruler of the world, ſuitable acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for his care of, and goodneſs to them: and that they pray to this great being, for his bleſſing upon them, that they may be poſſeſſed of real piety and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, wiſdom and probity, and every magiſterial qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification: and that he would crown all their labours and endeavours for the public weal with abundant ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs: that ſo, they may be a rich and laſting bleſſing to the people over whom they rule; and the ſtate be happy, enjoying the ſweets of civil combination, and reliſhing the benefits of Heaven's indulgence. Having now fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed three of thoſe things at firſt propounded to be diſcuſſed, I ſhall directly paſs to the conſideration of the fourth and laſt propoſition, viz.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="47" facs="unknown:014036_0047_0F92ABD16006FD68"/>IV. TO PROVE that the people have right and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to dethrone their king, and put down all other civil officers and rulers, of ſubordinate degree, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they ſhall counteract their obligations, and ceaſe to anſwer the ends of their conſtitution and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to places of civil truſt and power.</p>
            <p>THIS is a propoſition, the truth of which is very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily proved and made evident, and which, it ſeems, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man who is capable, and does ſeriouſly and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially weigh the natural rights and privileges of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, the truth, juſtice and reaſon of things, would rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily acknowledge.</p>
            <p>BUT as this is a matter of very great importance, which labours in the minds of ſome of the leſs thinking part of men, and is denied to be truth by others, tho' as I think, in the very face of reaſon, and at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of truth, juſtice, natural righteouſneſs and equity; I ſhall endeavour to ſet the truth of our propoſition in a moſt clear and evident point of light, before the minds of all who are diſpoſed to receive truth, and impartially to attend to evidence.</p>
            <p>AS another leading truth, and what may help us in the clear proof of our preſent propoſition, we may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire in this place, what that is which a people give up, or how much (if any thing) of their natural rights and privileges they part with, when they enter into civil ſtate, and make them rulers and officers, of ſupreme and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate degree and authority.</p>
            <p>HERE I ſhall firſt ſhew negatively, what a people do not give up, or part with, for the ſake of civil ſociety and government. 2dly I ſhall ſhew what they do really part with, of their natural rights and privileges, when they enter into civil ſtate, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>AND here let it be obſerved, that a people do not give up, or part with their rights to the enjoyment of their perſons and properties, free of all moleſtations, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, invaſions and ſeizures whatever: no ſuch right do the people part with, when they enter into civil ſtate and combination, and make them rulers ſupreme and ſubordinate for its well being.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="unknown:014036_0048_0F92ABD21D5765F8"/>FOR, that they may enjoy their perſons and properties thus free and unmoleſted, is one principal end of their entering into civil ſtate; and they never can be ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to give up and relinquiſh their right and title to the enjoyment of thoſe things, when they enter into civil ſtate, for the quiet and unmoleſted enjoyment of which things, as one main end in view, they entered into a civil ſtate. For this would be to ſuppoſe a people to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to civil ſtate and combination, for the enjoyment of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain things in peace and quiet, the enjoyment of which things, they give up all claim and title to, when they enter into civil ſtate and combination. Which would evidently be again, to ſuppoſe a people to have a certain main end in view, in entering into civil ſtate and ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which main end they have no reference to at all, in entering into a civil ſtate and ſociety. A moſt groſsly contradictious and abſurd ſuppoſition!</p>
            <p>WE have already ſufficiently proved, if it really want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any proof, that one principal end and deſign A, B, C, D, E, F, G, &amp;c. had in mind, when they entered into civil ſtate, was that they might enjoy their perſons and properties free from all injuries and invaſions; we muſt not therefore now ſuppoſe them to have given up, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſhed, their right to the enjoyment of their perſons and properties, free of all injuries and invaſions; leaſt we fall upon groſs and ſhameful abſurdities, and the moſt palpable contradictions.</p>
            <p>A people then, do always retain their right and title to the quiet and unmoleſted enjoyment of their perſons and properties, though they have entered into civil ſtate and combination,</p>
            <p>AGAIN, a people do not give up their right to have a voice in all public deciſions concerning peace and war with other ſtates; making alliances with other powers; ſending and receiving embaſſies; entering into national leagues and compacts; ſettling and regulating trade and commerce, &amp;c. &amp;c. I do not pretend to determine how a people ought to have a voice in all theſe matters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſonally, or by a repreſentation; though perhaps it is no hard matter to determine.—But a voice they
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:014036_0049_0F92ABD2EA629218"/>
muſt have. And that every people have a natural and unalienable right to a voice in ſuch deciſions, wants no proof: and therefore that they cannot be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to give up, or even to be capable to give up, ſuch right, when they enter into civil ſtate, is equally certain. When kingdoms levy war, or make peace with other ſtates; when they make alliances with foreign powers; ſend and receive embaſſies; enter into national leagues and compacts; ſettle and regulate trade and commerce, &amp;c. who is not very ſenſible, that all theſe things have reſpect to the people, and tend exceedingly, either to make them eaſy and quiet, or uneaſy and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet in the enjoyment of their perſons and properties, their natural and unalienable rights and priviledges? Pride and avarice many times may excite kings to levy war with foreign ſtates, and carry them on, tho' ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding prejudicial to the people; draining them of money and men, and many other things neceſſary to carry on the war. And ſo on the other hand, timidity and an unſeaſonable fearfulneſs, ſelf-intereſt, &amp;c. may prevail with them to make peace with other ſtates, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to their diſhonour and detriment of their own. Kings may enter into alliances with other powers, ſuch as are very unſafe and dangerous to the people. They may ſend and receive embaſſies moſt unhappy for their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and themſelves too; as has often been the caſe. Such national leagues and compacts may be made by princes, as will expoſe their own kingdoms to ravages and depredations, in an unlucky time. They may ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and regulate trade and commerce with their own or other countries, upon ſuch bottoms, and in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as may be very pernicious to the people.</p>
            <p>Now as all theſe things ſo evidently reſpect the people, and tend ſo directly to their good or ill, to their enjoyment, or non-enjoyment of their perſons and properties in peace and quiet; we muſt never conclude that the people do, or can, give up their natural right to a voice in public deciſions about all ſuch matters, when they enter into civil ſtate, with a deſign to promote their beſt intereſt: Unleſs we mean
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:014036_0050_0F92ABD39B5A51C0"/>
to go into the former groſs abſurdity; and to maintain, that people have a great regard to the quiet and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able enjoyment of their perſons and properties, in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into civil ſtate; and yet that they have no regard to theſe at all, but ſet this matter entirely aſide, when they enter in civil ſtate!</p>
            <p>WAR can never be levied, peace never made, with foreign ſtates, without the voice of the people: Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances can never be ſettled, nor embaſſies ſent and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, national leagues and compacts cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, trade and commerce never founded and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, but with the conſenting voice and ſuffrage of the people perſonally, or by repreſentation. Let this be ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſettled point, that a people do not give up their right to have a voice in all public deciſions concerning peace &amp; war with other ſtates; making alliances with foreign powers; entering into leagues and compacts; ſending and receiving embaſſies; ſettling and regulating trade and commerce, &amp;c. when they enter into civil ſtate, for their civil good, liberty, protection, peace and ſafety.</p>
            <p>FURTHERMORE, the people do not give up their right of judging and determining in matters of religion; or their right to protection in the public worſhip of the Deity, in ſuch manner as they pleaſe, or ſhall judge beſt, not injurious to the civil ſtate.</p>
            <p>WE have proved, that the people have a ſpecial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to their protection and ſecurity in the public wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, when they enter into civil ſtate, and make them rulers ſupreme and ſubordinate: and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it is a main part of the truſt which is repoſited with them, to defend and protect the people, while they pay public honours to the divinity, in any manner not prejudicial to the civil ſtate. Now, if the people do not give up their right of protection and defence, in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic worſhip of God, in what manner they pleaſe, not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimental to the civil ſtate, then certainly they ſtill hold this natural right to determine and judge in religious matters for themſelves, and in what manner they will worſhip God in public; if ſo be they do not prejudice
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:014036_0051_0F92ABD490C67AB8"/>
the ſtate: i. e. if they perform public worſhip with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, propriety and regularity, according to reaſon and ſacred revelation.</p>
            <p>EVERY man has an unalienable right of private judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in all matters of a religious nature. Nor is it in his power to give up this right into the hands of any man, or number of men upon earth. For if one man ſhould conſtitute another his judge in matters of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and ſhould put the deciſion of all his articles of religious creed into his hands; this would be the ſame thing, as tho' he ſhould delegate a power to another man to go to Heaven for him, and be happy for him, in the favour and enjoyment of God. For the religion of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and of her God too, requires the judgment of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very individual man, as well as his love and affections<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Unleſs therefore, one man can delegate to another, a power to love and ſerve God, with all fidelity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience for him, and ſo to be happy for him, he cannot give him a power to judge for him in matters of a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious nature. But whoever tries the experiment, to find whether he can be happy in the happineſs of another, when the inſtruments of miſery, and the engines of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and death are perpetually playing upon him, will be effectually convinced of his error and folly, by a ſenſible argument very undeſirable and painful. Juſt as abſurd and impoſſible is it then, for one man to give up his right of judgment in religious matters to another, as it is for him to make himſelf happy in the happineſs of another, or to go to Heaven upon anothers merits.</p>
            <p>THIS doctrine is better calculated to ſuit a Roman climate and conſtitution, than an American: Tho' it will one great day be found not to have been agreeable to either, when every man will be rewarded or puniſhed for his own judgment, faith and practice, and not for thoſe of another. Men do no not therefore give up their right to judge for themſelves in the great affairs of religion, to civil magiſtrates; nor have civil ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates any power or authority given them by God or men, to judge for the people in theſe matters. But as every man muſt be happy or miſerable for himſelf, in
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:014036_0052_0F92ABD526F822A0"/>
another world, ſo every man muſt judge, and believe, and practice for himſelf in this world.</p>
            <p>IF men have a right and it is their indiſpenſable duty, to judge for themſelves in matters of religion, as hath now been proved; then certainly they have a right to practice agreeable to their judgments, and conſcientious ſentiments, both in public and private; always provided they do not prejudice the civil ſtate. I do not ſay that men are infallible, or that they cannot judge amiſs, and practiſe wrong: or that their faith and practice may not be ſuch as will expoſe them to the cenſure of Chriſt, in his church. This is very poſſible. But what I ſay is, that their faith and practice cannot expoſe them to the cenſure of the civil law, unleſs they are detrimental to the civil ſtate. The laws and power of a civil magiſtate are forever limited and determined by the civil peace and welfare of the people, or the ſafety and happineſs of the civil ſtate. Whenever any man's faith and practice in religious matters, are detrimental to the civil ſtate, they properly fall under the cognizance of the civil magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate: when they are not, let them be what they may, or ever ſo wrong in other reſpects, they are not cogniza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by the civil magiſtrate. Tho' it may be accounted a certain maxim, that when any man's faith and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, in religious matters, are diſadvantageous to the civil ſtate, they are wrong in theory, wrong in reaſon and revelation both. For it is inconceivable that any religious ſentiments or practices, which are founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on reaſon and ſacred revelation, ſhould be unfavourable to the civil intereſts and well-being of any people.</p>
            <p>BUT leſt ſome ſhould ſuſpect that I here contradict what I have ſaid elſewhere, viz. that civil magiſtrates are bound to defend and protect and maintain the public worſhip of God, and even to uſe the civil ſword, if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe will do, to maintain it. Let them obſerve that in the very place where I ſaid this, I proved, that the public worſhip of God, and obſervation of religion, were very greatly advantageous to the civil ſtate. This is nothing contradictory to what I now ſay, but exactly coincident with it. For I do not ſay that civil magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:014036_0053_0F92ABD72EA8F240"/>
are under any obligations to nouriſh and cheriſh ſuch worſhip of the Deity, and practice of religion, as is not founded in reaſon, and ſacred revelation; or to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſuch as is detrimental to the civil ſtate.</p>
            <p>SO LONG as men believe and practice no doctrines in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the peace and felicity of the ſtate, they muſt be protected by the ſtate.</p>
            <p>THIS then may be another determined point, that a people do not give up their right of private judgment, in matters of religion, or their conſciences, when they enter into civil ſtate; nor their right to actual protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the public worſhip of the Deity, in ſuch manner as is not prejudicial to the civil ſtate.</p>
            <p>BUT thus much may ſuffice to have ſaid upon the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative ſide of this queſtion: though it may be that I have not mentioned every thing that the people do not give up for the ſake of a civil ſtate, and perhaps ſome may think I have mentioned too many.</p>
            <p>I would ſay poſitively, a people do give up their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal right to defend and ſecure their perſons and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, in all ordinary caſes.</p>
            <p>IN a ſtate of nature, each individual man hath a juſt right to defend his own perſon againſt all aſſaults, and to repel force with force, and to ſecure his perſon from any injury that may be offered to it. But a civil ſtate being entered into, and civil rulers choſen, and inveſted with power and authority to make and execute laws for the defence and ſecurity of every man's perſon who belongs to the ſtate; each indivdual man has no longer a right inherent and perſonal, to defend his own perſon, and to reſiſt force with force, when he ſhall be aſſaulted and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence offered to his perſon. This right to defend his own perſon, which he before had, while he lived in a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſtate, he hath given up to the civil ſtate, and it is now the duty and buſineſs of the ſtate to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend and protect the perſon of each individual in in it. Yea, it would be directly to counteract the deſign, as one principal deſign, of entering into a civil ſtate, if each individual in it ſhould ſtill retain and exerciſe a right to defend his own perſon. This would be to take the buſineſs, which properly belongs to the civil ſtate,
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:014036_0054_0F92ABD76BDAEDC0"/>
out of their hands and to put it back again into the hands of individuals, in whoſe hands it truly was in the natural ſtate; and ſo it would be to evert the very foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the civil ſtate. So that it is moſt apparent, that each individual in a civil ſtate, has not a right in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary caſes, (for I ſhall immediately ſhew that individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als may have a right, in ſome caſes, to defend their own perſons, themſelves) to defend his own perſon from inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and that he hath given up this right into the hands of the civil ſtate.</p>
            <p>NOW let me ſay, that in ſome exempt caſes, it may be the duty of individuals to defend and ſecure their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, even in a civil ſtate. For, though it be the duty and buſineſs of a civil ſtate, to defend and protect the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of individuals; yet civil rulers and officers cannot be every where, and in all places, at the ſame time, for they are not ſuppoſed to be omni-preſent; and therefore they cannot always prevent injuries being offered to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals. And it may happen that individuals may be aſſaulted by ruffians, robbers, banditti and lawleſs wretches, and their lives endangered; when no aſſiſtance or relief can be had from civil authority: in ſuch caſe, individuals have a right to defend themſelves, and to prevent, if poſſible, injuries being committed upon them. And they muſt be conſidered to be in ſome ſenſe, in a ſtate of nature, whilſt they do thus. To defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſuch a caſe, would be a duty owing to their own perſons, by the great laws of nature and ſelf-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.</p>
            <p>SO alſo with regard to individuals having a right to defend their properties: in all ordinary caſes, they may not defend and ſecure their properties, by their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal exertions, and without any directions ſo to do from civil authority; but muſt refer the defence and ſecurity of them to the civil ſtate. Yet in ſome extraordinary caſes it may be very warrantable and juſt for individuals to defend and ſecure their properties, as well as their perſons, themſelves.</p>
            <p>IT is ſo alſo with reſpect to the protection of individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als in the public worſhip of the Deity. Every man, in a
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:014036_0055_0F92ABD81A67E728"/>
ſtate of nature, has a right to protect himſelf, in all his obſervation of religion and worſhip of God: but in a civil ſtate he has not. He hath given up his perſonal right to protect himſelf in the worſhip of God, into the hands of the civil magiſtrate; and it is now become the duty of the ſtate, and what every one expects of them, to ſee to it that all individuals are protected and ſecured, when they worſhip God, in any way, not prejudicial to the civil good and welfare.</p>
            <p>A people alſo give up ſo much of their private pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, or eſtate, as is neceſſary to ſupport their civil ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates and the ſtate with honour and dignity, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray all the charges and expences of the common wealth.</p>
            <p>I have ſhewn that the people are under obligations to give their civil rulers an honourable reward for their ſervices to the ſtate.</p>
            <p>THE people muſt alſo bear the charges of war, when that is neceſſary; the expences of ambaſſadors, &amp;c. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they muſt give up ſo much of their properties and eſtates, as is required for the good and well being of the civil ſtate: that ſo they may enjoy themſelves and the reſt of their properties in peace and proſperity.</p>
            <p>I think I have now finiſhed what I intended, before I ſhould enter upon the direct proof of the propoſition now under conſideration: which aſſerts, that the people have right and authority to dethrone their King, and put down all other inferior officers, when they ſhall counteract their obligations to them, and ceaſe to anſwer the ends of their appointment, and conſtitution in places of public truſt &amp; authority,</p>
            <p>HERE we muſt make ſome recollections, and lay mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters together in a true and clear point of light, that ſo we may be under better circumſtances to form a good judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to reaſon right, and come at the truth of the caſe.</p>
            <p>IT hath been clearly ſhewn under the firſt propoſition, that the people, and they only, have right to erect a civil ſtate, to appoint and conſtitute a king ſupreme, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate civil rulers and officers. As to the ends and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of the people entering into civil ſtate it hath been ſhewn under the ſecond propoſition, that they were theſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> viz.</p>

               <pb n="56" facs="unknown:014036_0056_0F92ABD9C91F6748"/>THAT they (the people) might enjoy their perſons and properties free of all moleſtations and injuries, in peace and ſafety: that they might be protected and ſecured in the worſhip of the Deity, and public obſervation of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and that ſuch public obſervation of religion might be maintained and kept up among all the people. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the people really deſigned to be protected and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured in the enjoyment of their perſons and properties, their natural and acquired rights, their privileges and advantages of a temporal and eternal nature, pertaining to the preſent and an everlaſting ſtate of being.</p>
            <p>THE people enter into civil ſtate, the people make kings, and all other civil rulers, and theſe now menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned are ſome of the principal ends and deſigns they had in view, when they made them.</p>
            <p>NOW, if kings and civil rulers, in all their ſeveral places and ſpheres of action, will not exert themſelves to defend and ſecure the people in the quiet and unmoleſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed enjoyment of their perſons and properties; i. e. their perſons and all their worldly goods, eſtates and chattles which they have gotten by their honeſt labour, toil, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry and frugality; together with all thoſe juſt privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges and advantages they have to gain more worldly goods, eſtates and chattles, ſuch as labour, induſtry, fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality, trade, commerce, manufactures, &amp;c. If kings and rulers will not defend the perſons and theſe proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the people: if they will not defend and protect the peole while they attend, with decency and regulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, upon the public obſervation of religion, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain among them the public worſhip of God, in ſuch manner as the people chooſe, not injurious to the ſtate: if they do not make truth and righteouſneſs, the laws of God, and the reaſon and nature of things, their ſtandards in making civil laws: but if, inſtead of behaving thus, ſo agreeable to their obligations both to God and the people, they ſhould deprive the people of their juſt rights and privileges; deny them a voice in all public deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions concerning peace and war with other ſtates; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king alliances with foreign powers; ſending and receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing embaſſies; entering into leagues and compacts; ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling

and regulating trade and commerce, &amp;c. If they eſtabliſh by laws ſuch modes and forms of religion and public worſhip, as are very pernicious to the ſtate, as well as contrary to reaſon and the laws of God: I ſay, if kings and civil rulers thus concern not themſelves for the temporal nor eternal intereſts of the people; but being poſſeſſed of tyrannic and deſpotic principles, obſtinately proceed according to their own minds and views of kings, and perſiſt to proſecute ſuch meaſures of adminiſtration, to make and execute ſuch laws as are detrimental to the ſtate, and deſtructive of the liberties, peace, happineſs and tranquility of the people, and tending directly and naturally to the total ruin of the whole body politic; and if they will not, by all the gentle and humane mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures that the people can uſe with them, be reclaimed from their deſpotic and deſtructive proceedure; the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have juſt right and authority to exert themſelves more vigorouſly, and dethrone their king, and take all ſuch corrupt rulers out of thoſe places of power and truſt, in which they had fixed them, for quite other purpoſes.</p>
            <p>IF the reaſonings and concluſions under the firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition be true and good, then this is an evident and undeniable truth. Yea, it ſeems to be a moſt plain and evident truth, barely from this fair repreſentation of the caſe. But let us ſee in one view, how undeniable this truth appears, from what was proved under the firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. If men, in a ſtate of nature, have each an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual right to his own perſon and property, and to defend and ſecure to himſelf the enjoyment of them, free from all injuries and invaſions whatſoever; and a right alſo to an equivalent to any injury done his perſon, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion made of his property, or to make repriſals: if ſuch natural ſociety have right to enter into civil ſtate, and to appoint and conſtitute Kings and civil rulers; to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what mode of government ſhall take place, and what laws they will be governed by, for their civil good, protection, liberty, peace and ſafety: I ſay, if a ſociety in a ſtate of nature have ſuch rights, then moſt certainly and juſtly they do retain ſo much of their natural rights, even after civil combination and compact, that, if their
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:014036_0058_0F92ABDB322CAA60"/>
King and civil rulers will not give them liberty, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, &amp;c. in the enjoyment of their perſons and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties and religion, but groſsly and ſhamefully counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act their moſt ſolemn obligations to them, and ceaſe to anſwer their ends in making them civil rulers, and inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with civil power and authority, they may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throne their King, and take all inferior officers and rulers out of their places of public truſt and authority; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert to a ſtate of nature.</p>
            <p>IF a people have not a right to dethrone their King, in caſe he proves a tyrant, and ceaſes to conſult their good and happineſs, and to ſecure to them their precious rights and natural privileges and properties, which the great King of Kings hath indulged them with; 'tis an inevitable and undeniable conſequence, that they have not a right to their perſons and properties, nor any au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to ſecure them from injuries and ſeizures: i. e. they have not a juſt right to conſult their own temporal and eternal intereſt, nor to promote them: and this is to ſay flatly and plainly, that they have no intereſt at all, neither temporal nor eternal. For not to have a right to defend and ſecure one's intereſt, is not to have right to uſe it as one's own; but not to have a right to uſe a thing as one's own, is not to have any right to the uſe of that thing; and this is, not to have any right to that thing at all: for to ſay that any one has a right to a thing, &amp; not a right to uſe that thing is a palpable contradiction! For a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to dethrone a tyrant, a King who does not conſult nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the good &amp; happineſs of their people, but the contrary, is for the people to conſult their own good &amp; happineſs. That people then, who have not a right to dethrone a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt &amp; tyrannic King, one who does not anſwer the end for which he was made king, have not a right to conſult, promote, defend and ſecure their own liberties, peace &amp; happineſs; but that people who have not a right to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult, promote, defend &amp; ſecure their own liberties, peace &amp; happineſs, have no ſuch things as liberties, peace and happineſs predicable of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> according to the foregoing reaſoning. Unleſs then we mean flatly to deny that there are any ſuch things as rights and properties, in perſons
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:014036_0059_0F92ABDBDED923F8"/>
and eſtates, &amp;c. which may juſtly be ſaid to belong to any people, we muſt never deny that people have a right to dethrone their king, when he proves to be a tyrant, and will not concern himſelf about them, nor endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to protect them in the enjoyment of their perſons and properties, and religion, but wholly diſſerves the great purpoſes for which he was ſeated upon the throne. If any thing in nature is capable of proof, theſe rights of the people in this reſpect, are capable to be proved, and of being ſet in a moſt convincing and clear point of light before all reaſonable and impartial minds.</p>
            <p>NAY, it is as capable of demonſtration, as any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in Euclid, that a king, when he will not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil his obligations to the people, but ceaſes to anſwer their ends and deſigns in raiſing him to royal dignity and truſt, or counteracts theſe purpoſes by his tyrannic and dethrones conduct, does, ipſo facto, ceaſe to be king, and dethrones himſelf: He is no longer king, nor to be reputed ſuch. What in the name of common ſenſe is a king made for? or what does the name king ſignify? is it an important and ſacred thing, or a mere trifle? is it a rattle, a bauble from the toyſhops to pleaſe chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren with? or is there an important and weighty charge and truſt repoſited with the man who wears the name of king; which if he fulfil, he is to be honoured and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by all the people; but if he does not, he is no longer king<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or worthy that name? I am ſerious: I aſk whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a king is made ſuch for himſelf, for his own eaſe and pleaſure, that he may ſpend his days in luxury, wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and debauchery? or is he made ſuch for his wiſdom, probity and benevolence, to be active, and to exert himſelf to the utmoſt to maintain the invaluable rights, properties and priviledges of the people, and to ſecure to them all the advantages and emoluments which God and nature have conferred upon them, both of a temporal and eternal ſignificancy? If he be not made king purely for himſelf, and if the people really de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned when they raiſed him to royal dignity, and put the royal tiara upon his head, that he ſhould conſult and promote their good, and make them happy in the
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:014036_0060_0F92ABDCBAA51790"/>
quiet and undiſturbed enjoyment of their perſons and properties and religion; then, if he does not conſult and promote their good, nor endeavour to make them quiet and happy in the enjoyment of their perſons, proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and religion; but ſhamefully and notoriouſly coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teracts theſe obligations to the people, pray tell me, is he any longer king over that people, or rather hath he not by ſuch egregious violations of his ſacred truſt, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited all title to the crown? muſt the people ſtill revere him, and are they yet bound to yield obedience to him, as to their rightful ſovereign! tho' he is doing all that in him is, to deprive them of thoſe rights and priviledges, which they juſtly account dear to them as their very lives. Tho' his principles are ever ſo tyrannic and deſpotic, and he continually brings them forth into practice, to the ruin and deſtruction of the people: muſt the people yet be his liege ſubjects, muſt they worſhip, honour and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey him as their king! muſt that nonſenſical, inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and accurſed doctrine of paſſive obedience be ſtill preached up, whilſt the people are moſt cruelly deprived of thoſe rights which the great God of nature hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged them with, and made dupes and ſlaves to the tyrant and his paraſites! muſt the people ſuffer in their perſons, their properties and their religion, and yet vary tamely truckle to the yoke, and quietly ſuffer the chains of oppreſſion and vaſſalage to be rivited upon their necks, and the necks of their poſterity yet unborn, whilſt they meanly and baſely crouch down their heads for this helliſh purpoſe! muſt the people receive and be very obſequious to all the commands, orders, ſtatutes and laws, which have the royal ſignet tacked to them, tho' they tend moſt naturally and directly to ſnatch from them the deareſt priviledges and moſt darling rights they have, appertaining to this, or another life! mu<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

ſecurity, peace or happineſs predicable of, and naturally belonging to them if he has ſo much ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frontery. This doctrine of paſſive obedience and non-reſiſtance had better be ſent back again to hell, where it was certainly hatched, than to be preached up in this day of light and knowledge and ſuperior diſcernment: when the rights of mankind, of kings and people, are better underſtood, and more ably defended, than when this doctrine was firſt ſent up from the infernal regions into Great-Britain.</p>
            <p>THIS doctrine of paſſive obedience and non-reſiſtance, 'tis true, was ſounded from many pulpits in Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, by the court-clergy, preſently after the glorious reformation began to gain ground in England; tho' it be ſo very ſimilar to ſome doctrines of that apoſtate church; I mean the Romiſh church. In the time of Elizabeth, that illuſtrious princeſs; but eſpecially in the time of the firſt Stuart, was this doctrine firſt preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up. This is evident in many, or all, the hiſtories of his reign. It may be ſeen by any one who has an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, by looking upon the cannons of kingly pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power, in Nalſon's abſtract of them. A part of the firſt canon I ſhall take liberty to recite in this place. <note n="*" place="bottom">Neal's Hiſtory of the Puritans, quarto Ed. l. <hi>632.</hi>
               </note>
               <q>That the moſt high and ſacred order of kings is of divine right, being the ordinance of God himſelf, founded in the prime laws of nature and revelation, by which the ſupreme power over all perſons civil and eccleſiaſtical is given to them.</q>
               <q>That for any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to ſet up in the king's realms any independent, coercive power, either papal or popular, is treaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able againſt God and the king.

            </p>
            <p>THIS deteſtable and moſt unreaſonable doctrine was revived in the reign of Charles the II. in 1660. <note n="†" place="bottom">Id. II. <hi>585.</hi>

               <q>THE Court Biſhops were no vaſt eaſe, and went on briſkly with reſtoring all things to the old ſtandard; the doctrines of paſſive obedience and non-reſſiſtance were now received.</q>
            </p>
            <p>BUT theſe doctrines of abſolute, unlimited obedience to Kings, and non reſiſtance have long ſince been explod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed almoſt univerſally, as moſt unreaſonable and nonſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, deſtructive of all the natural rights and properties of the people, and diſonant to all juſt principles of ſelf-preſervation. Yet, though the moſt learned divines, and ableſt politicians have many years ſince, diſavowed and refuted them, upon the ſoundeſt maxims of reaſon and revelation, ſome will ſtill cheriſh and endeavour to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them; tho' they are forced in order to do this, as I think, to ſhipwreck reaſon, and commit an horrid rape upon ſacred revelation. In this the old proverb is veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that no brat is ſo ugly, having had a mother, as to die for want of a nurſe. For if any brat was ugly enough to be diſowned after its birth, and expoſed to ſtruglings and death, it ſhould really ſeem as tho' the doctrine of paſſive obedience and non-reſiſtance was: but alas! this very doctrine is ſo lucky as to find ſome, who are willing to cheriſh and foſter it yet!</p>
            <p>WE ſee, in the conon above cited, St. Paul introduced as a voucher for the doctrine! But if I was perfectly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with St. Paul's abilities and doctrines, and had only heard that he was inſpired, and had received ſufficient evidence to induce me to believe it; I ſhould immediately declare that he was preſſed into the ſervice, and ſhamefully miſinterpreted: for 'tis impoſſible that an inſpired man ſhould be a volunteer in ſuch drudgery as this.</p>
            <p>BUT it ſeems neceſſary that I here ſpend a few thoughts upon that text of St. Paul. For if he was a preacher of the doctrines of paſſive obedience and non-reſiſtance, I am groſsly miſtaken, and have hitherto ſcandalouſly miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtood the true meaning of that inſpired man, and muſt certainly read my bible with more care and attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the future. The text referred to in the canon is in
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:014036_0063_0F92ABDF42769998"/>
St. Paul's epiſtle to the Romans xiii.1.8. Let every ſoul be ſubject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: The powers that be, are ordained of God. Whoſoever therefore reſiſteth the power, reſiſteth the ordinance of God: and they that reſiſt ſhall receive to themſelves damnation.</p>
            <p>FOR rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? Do that which is good, and thou ſhalt have praiſe of the ſame: For he is the miniſter of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the ſword in vain: For he is the miniſter of God; a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil. Wherefore ye muſt needs be ſubject, not only for wrath, but alſo for conſcience ſake. For, for this cauſe pay ye tribute alſo: for they are Gods miniſters, attending continually upon this very thing. Render therefore to all their dues; tribute to whom tribute is due; cuſtom to whom cuſtom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.</p>
            <p>I HAVE ſet down this ſcripture at large; and I ſhall now enquire for its true meaning, and whether doctrines of paſſive obedience and non-reſiſtance are really preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it, or not.</p>
            <p>I WOULD have this ſcripture well underſtood: and therefore deſire that ſeveral things may be very carefully conſidered, which will be aſſiſting to us in gaining its true interpretation.</p>
            <p>WE muſt diſtinguiſh critically between the power of Kings and civil rulers, civil power, or civil government, in general; the way and means by which any men come to be poſſeſſed of ſuch power; and the uſe and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they make of their power. Theſe things are very diverſe, and eaſily diſtinguiſhed by every one.</p>
            <p>CIVIL power, or civil government, ſimply conſidered, is undoubtedly ordained of God. No one will pretend to diſpute this. Civil government, when conſidered as abſtracted from the ways and means by which men come to be veſted with it, may truly be ſaid to be of divine ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal. 'Tis very plain that God deſigned that a race of
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:014036_0064_0F92ABDFE4AAFA68"/>
men ſhould be continued upon earth, until the general judgment, or the conſummation of all things, at the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond coming of his divine and glorious ſon. But it is as plain, that a race of men could not be continued thus long upon the earth, and Gods great deſigns and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, in his univerſal plan of things, have been effected, without civil government taking place among them. The unavoidable conſequence is, that God deſigned that civil government ſhould be ſet up among men, and that this was one link in the infinite chain, one event amongſt innumerable others, which God deſigned ſhould have exiſtence, when he formed the amazing projection of a univerſe. Thus 'tis demonſtrable from reaſon, and the very nature of thoſe things which God hath conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, and permitted to take place in his world, that civil government is by divine appointment.</p>
            <p>GOOD David ſeems thus to underſtand the matter. pſ. lxv.6, 7. For promotion cometh neither from the eaſt, nor from the weſt, nor from the ſouth. But God is the judge: He putteth down one and ſetteth up ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Of this ſame opinion was Daniel, chap. 11, 21, 37. And he changeth the times, and the ſeaſons; he removeth kings, and ſetteth up kings.—Thou, O king! art a king of kings: and the God of Heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, and ſtrength, and glory. Thus civil or kingly power, conſidered as ſejoined from the way and means by which men come to be poſſeſſed of ſuch power is from God.</p>
            <p>BUT unleſs we conſider civil power, or royal power, as thus ſeparated from the way and means by which men arrive at ſuch power, we ſhall unavoidably run into groſs errors; as many have done, in explaining the text we are now upon. Civil power is of God. But who dare to ſay that all the ways and means by which men have ever become veſted with civil power are of God, in the ſame ſenſe as the power itſelf is! 'Tis certain, God has ſometimes diſapproved of Kings, and plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared they were none of his. Hoſe, viii.4. They have ſet up kings but not by me: They have made princes
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:014036_0065_0F92ABE450B15C78"/>
and I knew it not: of their ſilver and their gold have they made them idols; that they may be cut off. What was it God was ſo diſpleaſed with, concerning theſe kings? was it with the regal power itſelf? or was it not rather with the people's corrupt and idolatrous ways and means by which they raiſed them to, and maintained them in their regal power and dignity?</p>
            <p>KINGS have many times mounted thrones, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed royal power and authority, in moſt unjuſt and unnatural ways. Many by mere conqueſt and invaſions, by murdering in a cruel and barbarous manner, the reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing princes, and the royal families, have got themſelves proclaimed and ſeated upon their thrones. Every one, who is ever ſo little acquainted with civil hiſtory, knows all this to be true, and much more of the like kind. But who will ſay that all theſe ways and methods of acquiring civil and royal power are from God, as the power itſelf is! Does Heaven approve of unjuſt invaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, cruel murders and bloodſhed, and all the innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ways in which inhuman tyrants have ſlaughtered innocent kings and their families, and mounted their thrones!</p>
            <p>AGAIN, we muſt conſider the uſe and improvement which men make of civil power, as a diſtinct thing from the power itſelf. The power itſelf, we may ſay again, is of God. But I preſume no man will ſay, that God hath ordained all the uſes that have been made of civil power, by all the wicked, tyrannic and deſpotic princes, that have reigned ſince Nimrod built Nineveh and reigned there; in the ſame ſenſe, in which he hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained civil power, or the power which thoſe wretches and peſts of mankind were inveſted with, when ſimply conſidered! If any one is inclined to think ſo, let him caſt his eyes upon his bible, and read I. Kings xi.31, 35, 37. And he ſaid unto Jeroboam, take thee ten princes: for thus ſaith the Lord the God of Iſrael, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and will give ten tribes to thee.—But I will take the kingdom out of his ſons hand, and will give it unto
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:014036_0066_0F92ABE4D739E088"/>
thee, even ten tribes.—And I will take thee, and thou ſhalt reign according to all that thy ſoul deſireth, and ſhalt be king over Iſrael.</p>
            <p>WHEREFORE was it that Jehovah was thus diſpleaſed with Solomon, even ſo as to ſnatch from him ten princes, or tribes, and to give ſo large a part of the kingdom, as ten twelfths at leaſt, to his ſervant Jeroboam? was it becauſe Solomon ſat on the throne of Iſrael, ſwayed a ſceptre, and had civil power and government repoſited with him? If we look back a little to v.4, 5, 6, 7, 8. we ſhall find what the cauſe of God's reſentment was, and wherefore he took the kingdom from Solomon, or his ſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For it came to paſs, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods, and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God, as was the heart of David his father. For Solomon went after Aſhtoreth the goddeſs of the Zidonians, and after Milcom, the abomination of the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monites. And Solomon did evil in the ſight of the Lord, and went not fully after the Lord as did David his father Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemoſh the abomination of Moab, in the hill that is before Jeruſalem; and for Molah the abomination of the children of Ammon. And likewiſe did he for all his ſtrange wives, which burned incenſe and ſacrificed unto their ſtrange gods. Thus Solomon was guilty of groſs and ſhameful idolatry; and for this cauſe God expreſsly told him that he would take the kingdom from him. v.xi. of the ſame chapter. Therefore the Lord ſaid unto Solomon, foraſmuch as this is done of thee, and thou haſt not kept my covenant, and my ſtatutes, which I commanded thee, I will ſurely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy ſervant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>EVERY one who underſtands the conſtitution of the Hebrew civil government, knows that idolatry was, cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men leſae majeſtatis, or high treaſon againſt Jehovah, who was the politic head, and ſupreme civil ruler in the Jewiſh nation; as it was ſetting up another god in the ſtead of Jehovah, their only God and King. Idolatry was alſo high treaſon againſt the civil ſtate itſelf of the Hebrews, it was a notorious and direct ſubverſion of the conſtitution, an open breach of the magna charta of that nation. When therefore Solomon built high places for
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:014036_0067_0F92ABE6DB051570"/>
Aſhtoreth, Milcom, Chemoſh and Molech, he ſet up thoſe idols for gods, in affront to Jehovah the true God and rightful ſovereign of Iſrael, than which, no crime that he was capable to commit, tended more directly and naturally to ſubvert the very foundation of the conſtitution of the Jewiſh civil polity, and to counteract the magna charta of the Hebrews, and to expoſe the whole nation to Jehovah's wrath, and ſo to total ruin.</p>
            <p>FOR this corrupt uſe or abuſe of his royal power, in king Solomon, Jehovah was diſpleaſed. We plainly ſee theſe three things to be very diſtinct; civil power, or civil go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, ſimply conſidered; the ways and methods by which men become veſted with civil power; and the uſe and improvement they make of it.</p>
            <p>Now, we are ready perhaps to aſcertain the genuine meaning of the text of St Paul. When St. Paul ſays, that there is no power but of God, he means that no civil power, by what ways and means ſoever obtained, is without God's permiſſion; and that civil power, or civil government, ſimply conſidered, is according to God's eternal purpoſe and deſign: and when he ſays, that the powers that be, are ordained of God; he means that civil government, regal and imperial power and authority, abſtracted from the ways and means by which men unjuſtly obtain ſuch power, are really the ordinance and appointment of God. When he ſays, whoſoever reſiſteth the power, reſiſteth the ordinance of God; he means, that whoſoever reſiſteth, or oppoſeth civil pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as ſuch, or civil government as ſuch, reſiſteth or oppoſeth God's ordinance. And very well may ſuch a one be ſaid to merit damnation. Or ſuch as thus reſiſt and oppoſe God's ordinance or appointment, ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to themſelves, and that juſtly, detriment or judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>heautois krima leepſontai.</hi> The Apoſtle never dreampt of teaching the Romans, or any other people under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that all the ways and methods, by which every emperor and prince, obtained imperial and royal power, and all the uſes they ever made of ſuch powers, were from God, and ordained by him, in the ſame ſenſe, in which the powers themſelves, or civil government, ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply conſidered, was from God, and ordained by him!
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:014036_0068_0F92ABE7F6B543A8"/>
St. Paul knew, and every other man that knows any thing, knows, that God ſometimes permits men to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain civil power by unnatural, cruel and very unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous means; and to uſe ſuch power when they have got it, for very corrupt and diabolical purpoſes, to the ruin and deſtruction of the people, the wretched ſubjects. And indeed it cannot otherwiſe be, ſo long as God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits things to proceed, in the phyſical and moral worlds, according to their nature. So long as the great intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent author, and powerful upholder of the world, ſhall permit phyſical and moral cauſes to operate, and their effects to be produced according to their nature, there will unavoidably be great injuries, corruptions and wrongs in the moral and civil world. But this, by no means proves, that God is well pleaſed with, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves of, theſe moral and civil wrongs. But when theſe things do happen in the world, when men either come thus to civil power and truſt, or uſe it for ſuch hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid purpoſes, God diſapproves; nor did St. Paul mean to make it the duty of any people, who can do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, tamely to ſubmit to theſe powers, and without any the leaſt reſiſtance, to pay obedience to thoſe laws and orders which tend naturally and directly to bring ruin, miſery and death upon them and their children yet unborn! And it ſhould really ſeem as tho' thoſe men do wilfully miſinterpret the inſpired man, who would bear us in hand that he means any ſuch thing. The Apoſtle expreſsly ſays, giving us an account of the qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the civil power, or ruler, to whom chriſtians ought to be ſubject and obedient, that rulers are not a terror to GOOD works, but to the EVIL. That he is the miniſter of God for GOOD. That he is an avenger to execute wrath upon him that doth EVIL. And that we muſt be ſubject to civil rulers, not only for wrath, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have power to puniſh men, but for CONSCI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ENCE ſake. And that they are ſuch men to whom tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, cuſtom, fear and honour are due. Are tyrants, are traitors againſt the civil ſtate, (for I ſuppoſe that a king is as capable of committing high treaſon as any of his ſubjects are; and that, to counteract the foundation laws, and conſtitutional principles of the ſtate, is crimen leſae
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:014036_0069_0F92ABE899CC9188"/>
magnae chartae; equal to crimen leſae majeſtatis regiae) are thoſe things and civil rulers who are a terror to good works, and an encouragement to evil, who execute wrath upon thoſe that do well, and to whom no man can be ſubject for conſcience ſake, but for wrath only, are theſe the men, theſe the civil rulers to whom tribute, cuſtom, fear and honour are due, and to whom chriſtians, or any other people, are bound to pay paſſive obedience without the leaſt reſiſtance, on pain of damnation! ſuch expreſſions in the ſacred text, as above cited, would be apt to lead an honeſt enquirer after truth and the right of the caſe, to believe that St. Paul meant to exhort the Romans and all men, chearfully to obey their civil rulers who uſed their power and authority well, for Gods glory and the good of the people. And ſuch a man would be very hardly perſuaded to ſuſpect that the apoſtle meant to teach, that men ought to yield an abſolute and unlimited obedience, without any reſiſtance, to civil rulers, let them be, or do, what they will, or what their tyrannic, deſpotic and corrupt principles would naturally lead them to do!</p>
            <p>SUCH an interpretation of St. Paul as ſome have given, and ſtill continue to give, might eaſily be ſhewn to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete with the fouleſt abſurdities, and to be contrary to truth, natural juſtice and righteouſneſs; which would prove thoſe men, who are the authors of ſuch interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to have bad hearts, or weak heads, or both.</p>
            <p>BUT I forbear, having been too prolix already upon this text, &amp; chearfully ſubmit my interpretation to the teſt of truth and reaſon and the word of God, little doubting but it will be well approved by them all.</p>
            <p>I WELL know that there are ſeveral objections made, ſome againſt the truth of the doctrine of this 4th propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; others againſt ſuch doctrine's being practiced upon: and there are alſo a few texts of holy ſcriptures, that are alledged againſt the doctrine, beſides that we have ſo largely treated upon. This doctrine, every one knows, hath been practiced in the Britiſh nation, as well as in many others. I pray to God, that Great-Britain may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver again ſee the day, when it ſhall become neceſſary for the people to exert themſelves, as hath been proved to be right they ſhould, to dethrone a Britiſh King! But this
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:014036_0070_0F92ABE99B056778"/>
rueful time may come. I did not deſign, when I firſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to ſtudy and write upon this ſubject, to do any more than barely to prove the truth of the doctrines I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced: whether I have done ſo much, or not, I freely ſubmit. For ſeveral reaſons that might be given, were it neceſſary, I ſhall not be very officious in anſwering ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections.</p>
            <p>YET I will ſay a few words, in anſwer to two or three objections againſt the impleaded doctrine.</p>
            <p>ONE objection, which ſeems to be pointed againſt the truth of the doctrine of the firſt propoſition, as well as againſt the doctrine of the 4th being put in practice, is, that it will deprive Kings of a legal trial, by their Peers, which is a privilege granted, in the beſt regulated ſtates, to all the ſubjects.</p>
            <p>EVERY one may ſee, by adverting to the firſt propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that this objection is directly againſt its truth. For if the people have a natural and inherent right to appoint and conſtitute a King ſupreme, and all ſubordinate civil officers and rulers over them, &amp;c. then the people are the original of civil power: and if civil pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er originates from the people, the plain and undeniable conſequence is, that the people are the proper judges whether the power they inveſt their king with be uſed well or ill: and if ſo, the people are the peers, before whoſe tribunal the king muſt be judged; they are the perſons, call them what you pleaſe, before whom the king muſt ſtand or fall.</p>
            <p>IN a mixed monarchy, if the people have been pleaſed to conſtitute ſuch, when the king is corrupted, and is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to be too abſolute, and will not give the royal aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to bills which have paſſed the ſtates, or parliament, but is reſolutely engaged to be a tyrannic and deſpotic ſovereign, and not to rule the kingdom by wholeſome laws; then the ſtates or parliament have the power of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, as well as of legiſlation, devolved upon them; and have right and authority, with the voice of the people, to dethrone the tyrannic king. But if the ſtates of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament are alſo corrupted, and have drank ſo deep, with the king, of the ſpirit of abſoluteneſs and deſpotiſm, that the people are deprived of their natural rights and
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:014036_0071_0F92ABEA1BC1F118"/>
privileges, ſo that they can no longer endure; then both the legiſlative and executive powers are reverted to the people, and they have a right in the ſight of God, the king of kings and lord over all, to convict, judge and condemn the king and the ſtates of parliament, by their conſtitution, and the magna charta of the kingdom. All this is true if the propoſition be true; therefore the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is of no force, ſo long as the truth of our firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition remains unrefuted. 'Tis the buſineſs therefore of the objector to diſprove the truth of that propoſition. When he ſhall do this, I will grant to him, that the king is not accountable to the people for any uſes or abuſes of his royal power, and will immediately commence a preacher of the doctrines of paſſive obedience and non-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. Another objection againſt the practice upon the 4th propoſition, is, that it will introduce anarchy and confuſion, club-laws, &amp;c. to the inevitable deſtruction of the liberties, peace and happineſs of the whole civil com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity.</p>
            <p>TO this objection I would ſay, it is poſſible that the dethroning a King, and the removal of civil rulers out of their places of power and truſt, may have ſome bad tendencies, unleſs great care, wiſdom and prudence be exerciſed. But if the important and intereſting affair be managed wiſely and prudently, it is not ſuppoſable, that greater miſchiefs and miſeries will enſue, upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throning a King, who is a tyrannic and wicked ruler, &amp;c. than muſt be endured by the people, ſo long as a tyrant is on the throne, and his corrupt creatures and paraſites kept in places of power and truſt about him. England was never more happy before, nor much more ſince, than after the head of the firſt Stuart was ſevered from his body, and while it was under the protectorſhip of Oliver Cromwell. 'Tis true, there were confuſions in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teregnum, after the death of that friend and lover of his country and the liberties of mankind. But who cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them? They were ſuch men as will unavoidably give diſturbances to any people either in a natural or civil ſtate, or in a ſtate that is neither, if they be allowed. Men that have an unbounded deſire, and an inſatiable thirſt for empire, as Fleetwood, Deſborough, Lambert, Sir
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:014036_0072_0F92ABEAD93C6360"/>
Hen. Vane, and ſome others, undoubtedly had, if they are not promoted, will make any ſtate or people on earth uneaſy, and give them trouble and difficulty.</p>
            <p>THESE were the men who were the fomenters of all the diviſions and confuſions of 1659.</p>
            <p>AGAIN 'tis ſaid, that a king muſt have reſpect to his own honour, dignity and happineſs, as well as to the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and tranquility of the ſtate and people, in all his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations.</p>
            <p>I ALLOW this objection to be a good one, and am rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to confeſs that a king muſt endeavour his own honour, dignity and happineſs in his government; but then I ſuppoſe that a king cannot take a more direct and effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual method to advance and promote his own honour; dignity and happineſs, than to rule his kingdom by good and wholeſome laws; ſuch as are well calculated to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect and defend the people, in the quiet enjoyment of their perſons, properties and religion, and to give peace and tranquility to the whole ſtate. Such laws, and ſuch form of government and adminiſtration, as is moſt aptly calculated to promote the people's good, and to give uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal eaſe, protection and ſecurity to the whole civil com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, tends moſt naturally and directly to advance the honour and reputation, dignity and happineſs of the prince who is on the throne. No king can be honourable or happy, whoſe kingdom is diſhonourable, uneaſy, oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and unhappy. Every king, who deſires to be honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and happy, will endeavour to render his kingdon free and quiet, happy and powerful.</p>
            <p>THIS is all I ſhall ſay upon the objections againſt the doctrines of this ſhort tract, which I may call mine; tho' the rights of the people have been viewed by many others, much in the ſame point of light, in which I have held them up to view, yet I have not taken ſo much as one ſentence from any author, but what I have given him credit for, in the bottom of the page, as every one will undoubtedly judge, who will give themſelves the trouble to peruſe theſe pages.</p>
            <p>I HAVE ſaid little or nothing about the method in which the people ought to proceed, in treating with civil magiſtrates, who do not uſe their power and authority for
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:014036_0073_0F92ABEB975E19F8"/>
the good and intereſt of the people, but violate their truſt and obligations to them, in ſuch manner as they cannot endure; nor do I ſuppoſe this buſineſs belongs to me. However, I leave this matter to the politicians and ſtateſmen, not profeſſing myſelf to be a politician: tho' I do profeſs myſelf to be a true friend to the rights and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of mankind, and an advocate for natural juſtice, righteouſneſs and equity, as well as a liege ſubject to my rightful ſovereign.</p>
            <p>AS to any texts of ſacred ſcriptures, which ſpeak of the duties and obligations of the people to Kings and civil rulers, to honour, revere and obey them: I ſuppoſe that no text of ſcripture obliges any people tamely to ſubmit to tyranny, oppreſſion and ſlavery's hateful chains; but that many texts teach it to be the duty of a people to yield ready and chearful obedience to all civil rulers, who rule for God's glory and their beſt intereſt by making and executing wiſe and wholeſome laws.</p>
            <p>I AM not ſo vain as to imagine that what I have written upon this ſubject, will be very entertaining or profitable to my inteligent readers, if I ſhould have any ſuch, who have peruſed large volumes, ſtudied much and are thoroughly acquainted with the laws of nature and nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Nor was I perſuaded to make theſe diſcourſes pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic for the benefit of ſuch; but for the advantage of the people, to whoſe natural and juſtly acquired rights and privileges, I am firmly &amp; inviolably attached. For theſe I am willing to plead in my family, my cloſet, my pulpit and in public. And if I might be ſo happy, as to raiſe in the minds of the people, a juſt ſenſe of thoſe rights and privileges which nature and her God have indulged them with, and a manly and becoming reſolution to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert and defend them, in all wiſe, prudent and likely ways; I ſhall obtain my main deſign, in this ſhort tractate; and ſhall heartily rejoice, in that I have been an inſtrument of doing ſome little good to my fellow men, in this early ſtage of my life and action, and think myſelf well repaid.</p>
