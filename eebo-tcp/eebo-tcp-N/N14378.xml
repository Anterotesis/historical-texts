            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>THE words of the apoſtle, in <hi>Epheſians</hi> v. 32. "this is a great miſtery, but I ſpeak concerning Chriſt and the church," naturally lead to two inquiries.</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. What is the moſt obvious meaning of the word church in the ſcriptures?</p>
               <p n="2">2d. How doth the marriage union convey, as in a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, the union of Chriſt and the church?</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <p>For the moſt obvious meaning of the word church in the ſcriptures, we may look into the various texts where it is mentioned.</p>
                  <p>I do not recollect that the word is any where uſed in the old teſtament. The apoſtle, in <hi>Acts</hi> vii. 38. uſes it for the old teſtament church, "this is he that was in the church in the wilderneſs with the angel," &amp;c. The words that are uſed in the old teſtament are aſſembly and congregation; <hi>Exodus</hi> xii. 6. "the whole aſſembly ſhall kill it in the evening," that is, the whole church of Iſrael that were bound to keep the paſſover; <hi>Pſalm</hi> xxii. 22. "In the midſt of the congregation will I praiſe thee," which the apoſtle, in <hi>Hebrews</hi> ii. 12. calls the church, "in the midſt of the church will I ſing praiſe unto thee."</p>
                  <p>In the new teſtament, the firſt mentioned place I recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, is <hi>Matthew</hi> xvi. 18. "upon this rock will I build my church, and the gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt it." Upon this rock the truth Peter had made confeſſion of, "thou art the Chriſt, the ſon of the living God," is the
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:018214_0003_0FA5C1A173AE4150"/>
rock on which the church is built, againſt which the gates, the power and policy of hell, ſhall not prevail.</p>
                  <p>Then in the 18th of <hi>Matthew,</hi> 17. in which, ſo far as I underſtand, Jeſus Chriſt is inſtructing his diſciples their duty in their particular connection, thoſe believers of of the apoſtles doctrine collected in the profeſſion of of the name of Jeſus, meeting together in one place, was called the church in that place. In <hi>Acts</hi> viii. 1. we read of the church which was at Jeruſalem, the firſt church gathered by the apoſtles after the deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt; <hi>Acts</hi> xiii. 1. of the church at Antioch; <hi>Acts</hi> xx. 7. and <hi>Revelations</hi> ii. 1. of the church of Epheſus; <hi>Romans</hi> xvi. 3 5. and 1ſt of <hi>Corinthians,</hi> xvi. 19. we read of the church in the houſe of Priſcilla and Aquilla; in <hi>Colloſians</hi> iv. 15. of the church in Nymphas's houſe, and of the church in Philemon's houſe, in the 2d verſe of that epiſtle.</p>
                  <p>Theſe particular churches, gathered by the apoſtles doctrine, was governed by the will of Jeſus Chriſt, as taught by them; and ſo far as that can be underſtood from the ſcriptures, are the rule by which particular churches of Chriſt are to be governed in all ages; but as that would be too lengthy to be here conſidered, muſt be paſſed over.</p>
                  <p>We read alſo of the church of the firſt born, written in heaven, <hi>Hebrews,</hi> xii. 23; of the church for which Chriſt gave himſelf, "that he might ſanctify and cleanſe it, by the waſhing of water through the word, that he might make it to himſelf a glorious church, not having ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing, but that it might be holy and without blemiſh." <hi>Epheſians</hi> v. 26. 27.</p>
                  <p>Hence I collect, 1ſt. That Jeſus Chriſt is the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on whom the church is built.</p>
                  <p>2d. That thoſe that were brought by the apoſtolick doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine concerning him, to believe that Jeſus is the Chriſt. in the firſt ages of chriſtianity, were by apoſtolick authority collected into diſtinct, particular churches, in ſuch places where there were a ſufficient number of believers for that purpoſe, and were called the church in that place. There is little ſaid about the place of their meeting: I ſuppoſe any place that they could obtain, that was convenient for
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:018214_0004_0FA5C1A2341EC9E8"/>
that purpoſe: The church of Troas met in an upper cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; <hi>Acts</hi> xx. 7. 8. the church of the Colloſians in Phile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon's houſe, as may be ſeen by comparing thoſe two epiſtles.</p>
                  <p>Theſe churches appeared as a repreſentation of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal church, in their holding the one truth, that Jeſus Chriſt is the ſon of God, by which they were all gathered together, this being the ſole foundation on which the univerſal church is built, and in their profeſſed ſubjection to the authority of Jeſus Chriſt, the head of the church, and head over all things for its good.</p>
                  <p>3dly. That there is a univerſal church, which will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of all that are included in that glorious church for whom Jeſus Chriſt gave himſelf; the full meaning of which is the general aſſembly and church of the firſt born, written in heaven; Jeſus Chriſt is the firſt born among the many brethren brought to glory. <hi>Pſalm</hi> lxxxix. 27. "I will make him my firſt born, higher than the kings of the earth;" <hi>Romans</hi> viii. 29. "the firſt born among many bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren;" <hi>Colloſians</hi> i. 15. "who is the firſt born of every creature,"—verſe 18. "the firſt born from the dead." It is his church the church of the firſt born; this church, this general aſſembly, called <hi>Pſalm</hi> cvii. 32. "the aſſembly of the people, the congregation of the elders," <hi>Pſalm</hi> cxi. 1. "the aſſembly of the upright, and the congregation," <hi>Pſalm</hi> clxix. 1. "the congregation of the ſaints," that are repreſented to John, <hi>Revelations</hi> v. 8. by the four living creatures and four and twenty elders, and chap. vii. 9. by a great multitude, which no man could number, of all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and kindred, and people and tongues, in addition to the hundred, forty and four thouſand, that were ſealed in the former part of the chapter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of all the tribes of Iſrael. The ſame ſealed number are repreſented, in chap. xiv. 1. to 5. "ſtanding with the lamb on the mount Zion," which did not exclude the preaching of the goſpel to every na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and kindred and tongue and people, verſe 6; which goſpel or word ſhall not return void, but ſhall accompliſh what he pleaſes, and ſhall proſper in the thing where unto he ſends it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="6" facs="unknown:018214_0005_0FA5C1A32F10D7E8"/>
Of this church every believer of the apoſtles teſtimony, or every one that believeth that Jeſus is the Chriſt, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Peter's confeſſion, appears<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon the confeſſion of this faith, to be a viſible member. And it is the duty of every ſuch perſon, who can find a particular church built on this foundation, and who in ſubjection to his authority make the apoſtolick churches their rule as to order, to join with them in the profeſſion of his name, with them obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all things whatſoever he has commanded, walking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in love, as he hath given commandment; for this they are choſen and called to the faith of the goſpel, 1ſt of <hi>Peter,</hi> ii. 9. Such are made uſe of for the ingathering of others. 1ſt of <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> 1. 8. "for from you founded out the word of the Lord;" <hi>Epheſians</hi> i. 9. 10. "having made known to us the miſtery of his will, according to his good pleaſure, which he hath propoſed in himſelf, that in the diſpenſation of the fullneſs of times, he might gather to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one all things in Chriſt, both which are in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and which are on earth, in him." But the Epheſian church being choſen in him before the foundation of the world, to be holy and without blame before him in love, being predeſtinated to the adoption of children by Jeſus Chriſt, according to the good pleaſure of his will, to the praiſe of the glory of his grace, was not to the final exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or reprobation of others, but as a means made uſe of by him, that in the diſpenſation of the fullneſs of times, he might gather together all things in Chriſt; chap. ii 7. "that in the ages to come he might ſhew the exceeding riches of his grace, in his kindneſs towards us through Chriſt Jeſus." The church then is to hold forth the word of life; the word is to ſound out from them. "As oft as ye eat this bread and drink this cup, ye do ſhew forth the Lord's death till he come:" Thus they boldly bear his name, in oppoſition to earth and hell; ſhew that he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and hold forth to the world, that there is no other name under heaven given among men, whereby they muſt be ſaved. Such are the means the great head of the church makes uſe of, as he pleaſes, to the conviction of others: But be the conſequences what they will, it is their
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:018214_0006_0FA5C1A6CF23F230"/>
duty to teſtify to his name, truth and ways, looking for the time when he will gather all the fruit of his purchaſe into one in himſelf; for every one for whom Chriſt died, ſhall certainly, in his time and way, come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him, and to partake in his ſalvation, as thoſe who have been or are viſible members of his church.—For doth not the ſcriptures ſhew the connection of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man race with Jeſus Chriſt, as their head, in as exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive a view as their connection with the firſt Adam, ſee <hi>Romans</hi> 5, 14, to the end; <hi>Hebrews</hi> ii. 9. "we ſee Jeſus, who was made a little lower than the angels, for the ſufferings of death, crowned with glory and honor, that he by the grace of God, ſhould taſte death for every man." 1ſt. of <hi>John,</hi> ii. 2. "he is the propitiation for our ſin; and not for ours only, but for the whole world." And the apoſtle ſays, 2d. of <hi>Corinthians,</hi> v. 14. to the end, "we thus judge, if one died for all, then all died; and he died for all, that they which live, ſhould not henceforth live to themſelves, but to him that died for them, and roſe again." This appears to be the deſign of the manifeſtation of this truth, or of perſons being brought to the knowledge of the truth, and to life in Chriſt thereby, that they which live ſhould not henceforth live to themſelves, but to him that died for them, and roſe again;<note n="*" place="bottom">The thought of this is enough to croath wiſh ſhame, as a garment, thoſe who have hope of life by Jeſus Chriſt, that this deſign has been no more attended to.

to the Gentiles, and are taught to call no man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon or unclean; what God hath ſanctified, call not thou common, which the apoſtle explains, <hi>Acts</hi> x. 28. "God hath ſhewed that I ſhould call no man common or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean." Why? Becauſe God hath ſanctified them; I view them ſanctified, in that Chriſt died for all, and deſigns in his time and way to bring them all to the knowledge of himſelf, and manifeſt his ſanctifying and ſetting them apart for himſelf. This deſtroys all diſtinction between Jew and Gentile, and not only as the nations of Jews and Gentiles, but of all men in every age, that on ſome account or other, beſides the atonement, would preſume to be in, or near, or have a claim upon the divine favour before ſome of their fellow creatures. Henceforth know we no man after the fleſh, "yea, though we have known Chriſt after the fleſh, yet now henceforth know we him no more;" Jeſus Chriſt was a miniſter of the circumciſion, was made under the law, fulfilled the righteouſneſs of it, came to his own, ſent his goſpel firſt to the Jews; but when his death and reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection were fully made manifeſt, and the premiſes under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that all the families of the earth were to be bleſſed in him, that the Gentiles were to glorify God for mercy; when theſe things were mad, fully manifeſt, the apoſtle ſays, "yea, though we have known Chriſt after the fleſh, yet now henceforth know we him no more; therefore if any man be in Chriſt a new creature, theſe old things are paſſed away, behold all things are become new." There is not a fragment of the old diſpenſation or of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of our own, can have any admiſſion as recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to the divine favour, "all things are become new. and all of God, who hath reconciled us to himſelf," us, the apoſtles and firſt diſciples, with the church of the Corinthians, to whom he wrote, who were together viſibly reconciled to himſelf by Jeſus Chriſt, "and hath committed to us the word of reconcilation;" that is, the word of reconciliation committed to the apoſtles, "that God was in Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling the world to himſelf; not imputing their treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes unto them." Now then, if God was in Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling the world unto himſelf; if he be the propitiation

for the whole world; if he taſted death for every man; if Adam was a full figure of him that was to come, and the connection of the human race with Jeſus Chriſt as their head as extenſive as their connection with the firſt Adam, then we muſt conceive that the church of the firſt born, the church for which Chriſt gave himſelf, will finally conſiſt of all nations, kindreds, tongues and people; and in this view, the deſign of mercy for bids, calling any man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and lays a ſure foundation of univerſal love and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence to all the human race, and of faith in prayer for them; while thoſe brought to believe that Jeſus is the Chriſt, profeſſing their faith in, and ſubjection to him, and appearing influenced thereby, are ſubjects of that goſpel charity which the apoſtle enjoins, when he ſays, "have fervent charity among yourſelves," and which I think appears evidently diſtinguiſhable from the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal benevolence due to the whole human race.</p>
                  <p>Thus from the moſt obvious meaning of the paſſages where the word church is uſed in ſcripture, theſe things have been collected. 1ſt, That Jeſus Chriſt is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation on which the church is built. 2dly, A collection of believers profeſſing his name, and in ſubjection to his authority obſerving his laws, in any place, are a viſible church there, or a viſible repreſentation of the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal church. 3dly. The univerſal church will finally have gathered into it, or be made up of all for whom Chriſt died.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond inquiry is, How doth marriage convey, as in a miſtery, the union of Chriſt and the church?</p>
                  <p>Attention to this inquiry will lead us to compare this paſſage in <hi>Epheſians,</hi> with the beginning of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> and various other paſſages, one with another. In <hi>Geneſis</hi> i. 27. we read, "So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him, male and female created he them." There appeared to be male and female created in the one man: The particular formation of building of the woman was from man, of which we have the account, <hi>Geneſis</hi> ii. 21. 22. "And the Lord God cauſed a deep ſleep

to fall upon Adam, and he ſlept<note n="*" place="bottom">As Adam was a figure of him that was to come, may not this deep ſleep prefigure the death of Jeſus Chriſt, from which the church ariſes.</note>; and he took one of his ribs and cloſed up the fleſh inſtead thereof; and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man, builded<note n="†" place="bottom">See the Hebrew in the bible margin.</note> he a woman, and brought her unto the man." Thus the woman "is of the man, and for the man," 1ſt of <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> xi. 8. 9. So is the church, in every view, of and for Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Romans</hi> xi. 36. "for of him, and to him, and through him, are all things." <hi>Colloſians</hi> i. 16. "all things were created by him and for him." As the woman was created in him, was of him and for him, ſo they are called by one name, or ſhe bears his name. <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis</hi> v. 2. "male and female created he them, and called their name Adam." When ſhe was brought to him, he ſays, "ſhe ſhall be called woman, becauſe ſhe was taken out of man." She ſhall be called by a name derived from that of man. So the church is called by the ſame name with Jeſus Chriſt; <hi>Jeremiah</hi> xxiii. 6. and xxxiii. 16. "he and ſhe are called, the Lord our righteouſneſs." Yet, ſo as to be denominated from him, "he ſhall be called a Nazarene," they "the ſect of the Nazarenes;" he is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chriſt, "the diſciples were firſt called Chriſtians at Antioch;" names derived from him, ſhewing that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him they were nothing; that he is their all, and that in him they poſſeſs and enjoy all good.</p>
                  <p>We have the reaſon of this name, "This is now bone of my bone, and fleſh of my fleſh; ſhe ſhall be called wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man becauſe ſhe was taken out of man." "So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies; he that loveth his wife loveth himſelf, for no man ever yet hated his own fleſh, but nouriſheth and cheriſheth it, even as the Lord the church, for we are members of his body, of his fleſh, and of his bones." The circumſtances of the church with Jeſus Chriſt, are ſimilar to that of Adam with his wife, bone and fleſh. "For this cauſe ſhall a man leave his father and mother, and be joined to his wife, and they two ſhall be

one fleſh: This is a great miſtery, but I ſpeak concerning Chriſt and the church."</p>
                  <p>"This is a great miſtery;" the miſtery, that in marriage conveys the union of Chriſt and the church, appears herein: That the woman was created in the man, was united to him before ſhe was diſtinctly builded a woman: When ſhe was thus builded and brought to him, there appeared the viſible marriage union; he ſaid, "this is now bone of my bone and fleſh of my fleſh." "Therefore ſhall a man leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife." Therefore, becauſe of the previous union that was the ground of it, "but I ſpeak," ſays the apoſtle, "con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Chriſt and the church," this holds forth the union between Chriſt and the church, prior to the viſible mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage union which takes place upon any of the children of men being brought to Jeſus Chriſt, who ſays, "for no man can come to me, except the Father which hath ſent me, draw him."</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Romans</hi> xvi. 7. Andronicus and Junia are ſpoke of as in Chriſt before the apoſtle, though they were together choſen in Chriſt before the foundation of the world. Thus is the whole church in Chriſt, in the moſt univerſal ſenſe: He ſtands anſwering fully to the figure of him that was to come, the head of every man, a univerſally as Adam was. In this view there is a union or connection of head and members, even before the members actually appear. "And for this cauſe ſhall a man leave father and mother and cleave to his wife." Jeſus Chriſt left father and mother in cleaving to his wife; <hi>John</hi> xvi 18. "I came forth of the father, and am come into the world." In <hi>Matthew</hi> xii. 47. to 50. and <hi>Mark</hi> iii. 32. to 35. his attention to what he had to do for his church, was not diverted by his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.<note n="*" place="bottom">Is he not the true an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

"who of God is made unto her wiſdom, righteouſneſs, ſanctification and redemption." It is viſibly ſo with reſpect to thoſe that are brought by the goſpel to the knowledge of, faith in, and ſubjection to him: It was really ſo in the purpoſe and purchaſe of Jeſus Chriſt, before they came to the knowledge of him, and is really ſo reſpecting thoſe who yet know him not, live in unbelief and diſobedience; for, ſays the apoſtle, <hi>Hebrews</hi> ii. 8. "then hath put all things in ſubjection under his feet; for in that he put all in ſubjection, he left nothing not put under him; but now we ſee not yet all things put under him: But we ſee Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus for the ſufferings of death crowned with glory and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, that he, by the grace of God, ſhould taſte death for every man." And the prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> gives us the divine oath for this, chap. xlv. 22. "Look unto me," (the juſt God and the Saviour) "and be ye ſaved, all the ends of the earth, for I God and none elſe; I have ſworne by my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, the word is gone out of my mouth in righteouſneſs, and ſhall not return, that to me every knee ſhall bow, every tongue ſhall ſwear, ſurely ſhall ſay, in the Lord have I righteouſneſs and ſtrength, to him ſhall come;" which muſt make all that are incenſed againſt him aſhamed.</p>
                  <p>The name of the viſible church is, "the Lord our righteouſneſs." All that are brought to him call him ſo, and are denominated by it, "'tis the name whereby ſhe ſhall be called." But we have the divine oath, that "every knee ſhall bow, and every tongue ſhall ſwear, ſurely ſhall ſay, in the Lord have I righteouſneſs and ſtrength." The time and manner is with him, who ſaith, "I will work and who ſhall let it;" "who will have all men to be ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and come to the knowledge of the truth; for there is one God, even one mediator, of God and man, the man Chriſt Jeſus, who gave himſelf a ranſom for all, to be teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in due time."</p>
                  <p>In Chriſt Jeſus, God manifeſt in the fleſh, we have the fullneſs of the divine nature, as i. e. preſſed in <hi>Hebrews</hi> i. 3.

Is there not the fullneſs of the human nature alſo in him? The apoſtle ſays, "we are members of his body, of his fleſh, and of his bones," Who does he mean? Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the church, the apoſtles, the firſt diſciples, the church of the Epheſians, who were viſibly ſo, and thoſe who ſhould believe through their word, in every age; yea, all for whom Jeſus Chriſt gave himſelf. The church, in the moſt extenſive ſenſe, are in this union, and are repreſented tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veling together in pun, till the manifeſtation of it. <hi>Romans</hi> viii. 22. "for we know that the whole creation," it is the ſame word we have in <hi>Mark</hi> xvi 15. "preach the goſpel to every creature;" therefore every creature that the goſpel is to be preached to, "groaneth and traveleth in pain together; and not only they, but we ourſelves that have the firſt fruits, even we ourſelves groan within ourſelves, waiting for the adoption, the redemption of our body." By the redemption of our body, I conceive the idea of the body of which Jeſus is the head, as captivated, enſlav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſold, and groaning under this bondage; and thoſe whoſe minds have been led to an underſtanding of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by Chriſt, though their minds are thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, yet groaning, waiting for the adoption, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of the whole body.</p>
                  <p>Now that in Jeſus Chriſt there is the fullneſs of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature, is it not evident from the conſideration of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis</hi> v. 2. where we read of our firſt parents in their primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſtate, "male and female created he them, and bleſſed them, and called their name Adam, in the day they were created."

And as the way in which the original bleſſing that was forfeited was to be reſtored and confirmed, was brought to view in the 15th verſe; ſo it is repeated and illuſtrated in <hi>Geneſis</hi> xii. 3. xviii. 18. xxii. 18. and xxvi. 4. "In thy ſeed ſhall all the nations of the earth be bleſſed." This the apoſtles calls "preaching the goſpel to Abraham," <hi>Gallations</hi> iii. 18. 'Tis agreeable to <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> xxxii. 43.

"Know ye that the Lord, he GOD,<note n="*" place="bottom">I read this verſe without the words ſupplied by the tranſlators.</note> he hath made us, and not we ourſelves, his people and the ſheep of his paſture."

"For his merciful kindneſs is great towards us." Towards who? All the earth, as extenſive as the call to praiſe him. "And the truth of the Lord forever; praiſe ye the LORD." His merciful kindneſs; how is the greatneſs of it made manifeſt, and how doth the truth of the Lord appear to endure forever, but in him "who is the mercy and the truth," in him "in whom all nations are bleſſed," in him "in whom thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob and the mercy to Abraham, which thou haſt ſworn to our fathers in the days of old.</p>
                  <p>Now this bleſſedneſs of the nations, of which theſe paſſages ſpeak, was to have its accompliſhment in the ſeed of Abraham, "In thy ſeed;" which is Chriſt. <hi>Gallations</hi> iii. 6. Now if all the nations of the earth are included in the

bleſſedneſs in Chriſt Jeſus, they are in him as their head; there is the fullneſs of the human nature in Chriſt Jeſus; ſo they were conſidered in him before the evidences of it appeared in or upon any of them; and becauſe of this union, he is engaged in all the doth for them, to bring them to himſelf. "This is now bone of my bones, and fleſh of my felſh; ſhe ſhall be called woman becauſe ſhe was taken cut of man." "Therefore," becauſe of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious union, "ſhall a man leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife, and they ſhall be one fleſh: This is a great miſtery, but," ſays the apoſtle, "I ſpeak concerning Chriſt and the church." "This is now bone of my bone, and fleſh of my fleſh; ſhe ſhall be called woman;" ſhe ſhall wear my name, come into a viſible connection and intercourſe with me, be intereſted in what I am and have, &amp;c. So in conſequence of this union ſhall the church, in the moſt extenſive ſenſe, even every member, from all the ends of the earth, be brought to Jeſus Chriſt, in his times, who is the bleſſed and only potentate; ſhall bear his name; be called by the name which the mouth of the Lord doth name: 'Tis by his authority we are aſſured, ſhe ſhall be called "the Lord our righteouſneſs." Theſe things ſhall be made manifeſt when <hi>Pſalm</hi> xlv. 15. 15. and <hi>Pſalm</hi> lxxii. from the 9th to the end of the 15th verſe, have their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment.</p>
                  <p>Againſt what has been brought to view, particularly in the ſeveral quotations from the Pſalms, ariſes this objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the apoſtle appears to apply ſuch paſſages to thoſe gathered by the goſpel from the among the Gentiles; not to the Gentiles in ſo extenſive a manner as is expreſſed in the Pſalms; and ſo thoſe paſſages are to be underſtood in the limited ſenſe uſed by the apoſtles, who direct their epiſtles to the believers of their teſtimony, collected from among the Gentiles.</p>
                  <p>To this it may be anſwered, that the epiſtles of the apoſtles were wrote to viſible churches, and viſible believers, for their expreſs direction in their conduct towards God and one another, and are left on record for the ſame end, to all believers in all ages, as none but ſuch as are led to the

knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt, were capable of underſtanding the grace there made manifeſt, and the obligations thence ariſing to glorify him in their ſpirits and bodies which are his; but yet it is evident they were deſigned as a means of communication of the knowledge of Chriſt to mankind in general. See <hi>Epheſians</hi> i. 9. 10.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Epheſians</hi> ii. 4 to 7. "But God who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he hath loved us, even when we were dead in ſins, hath quickened us together with Chriſt, and hath raiſed us up together and made us ſit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus." For what end? "I hat in the ages to come, he might ſhew the exceeding riches of his grace in kindneſs towards us, through Chriſt Jeſus." And in the 3d chapter, from the 2d verſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we have the end of the diſpenſation of grace, given to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle towards the Epheſians, "how that by revelation he made known unto me the miſtery, which in other ages was not made known unto the ſons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apoſtles and prophets by the ſpirit, that the Gentiles ſhould be fellow heirs, and of the ſame body, and partakers of his promiſe in Chriſt by the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; unto me, who am leſs than the leaſt of all ſaints, is this grace given that I ſhould preach among the Gentiles the unſearchable riches of Chriſt, and to make ALL MEN ſee what the fellowſhip of the miſtery, which from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jeſus Chriſt."</p>
                  <p>Here we have glad tidings to ALL MEN; to ages to come; to all things in heaven and earth, in what divine grace did for, and among the apoſtles and Epheſians.

                  <p>In theſe paſſages, the duty of the wives is made plain; inculcated and enforced from the obligations to Jeſus Chriſt, "as unto the Lord, as it is fit in the Lord;" which ſhews the duty of the wiſe to flow from the authority of Jeſus Chriſt, and to be directed by his will: So that in all her attention and ſubmiſſion to her huſband, the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and directions of Jeſus Chriſt are ever to be kept in view, as the firſt motive the apoſtle uſes, and truly it is no barren one, but full of excitation. The believing wife may thus think with herſelf, While I am attending my duty to my huſband, the ever bleſſed Jeſus, in his adorable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion, is pleaſed to accept me as attending to him: Therefore, as to the Lord, will be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

be a diſtinct one, is, "that the name of God and his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine be not blaſphemed." <hi>Titus</hi> ii. 4. 5. "That they," the aged women, "may teach the young women to be ſober, to love their huſbands, to love their children."—Wives are not only taught ſubmiſſion to their huſbands from a ſenſe of duty, but "to love their huſbands, to love their children;" which will excite them, from inward af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, ever to be ſtudying and purſuing their comfort and happineſs, while their own is increaſed by the comfort of love: And when to the motive, "as unto the Lord," is joined the "love of huſbands and children, good, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to their own huſbands, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blaſphemed," will follow; will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, did I ſay! is it not inſeparably interwoven? O my Jeſus! is thy name and doctrine concerned in my love and duty to my huſband and children; how happy haſt thou made me, in making love, which is my happineſs, my duty; and bringing thy name and doctrine to my continual view; may it never be blaſphemed by my evil conduct towards my huſband and children; methought I moved in a low ſphere in attending daily to them, but now I find I'm ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted to wait on my Lord; he has been pleaſed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit his name and doctrine to my daily care: Angels hath not higher employment than is appointed me, in the very place where he hath placed me; and when I dwell in love, I dwell in him. The third motive, "that if any obey not the word, they alſo may, without the word, be won by the converſation of the wives, while they behold your chaſte converſation with fear," muſt alſo be a powerful one, in the minds of believing wives, to an attention to the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, of a meek and quiet ſpirit, which is in the ſight of God of great price. If by the hidden man of the heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we underſtand Chriſt dwelling in the hearts of believers by faith, we are led to that which is not corruptable, and to the pattern, fountain, and foundation of a meek and quiet ſpirit, which indeed, in the ſight of God, is of great price. In <hi>Matthew</hi> xi. 29. Jeſus Chriſt ſays, "Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly, and ye ſhall ſind reſt to your ſouls."
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:018214_0018_0FA5C1B6B8269A70"/>
The believing wives underſtand Jeſus Chriſt to be the green olive tree from whence this fruit is found. So did their examples in the old time; "The holy women who truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in God, and thus adorned themſelves, being in ſubjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to their own huſbands, even as Sarah obeyed Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, calling him Lord, whoſe daughters ye are as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement." What doth that import? So long as you are influenced by your duty to Jeſus Chriſt, to attend your duty as wives, you appear to be the children, the followers, or imitators of the holy women who truſted in God; to belong to that family; and need not be afraid with any amazement; for if our hearts condemn us not, then have we confidence towards God. But if inſtead of attention to the directions of the apoſtles of Chriſt, there is giving heed to temptation, not contented in "modeſt apparel, with ſhamefacedneſs and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety," but giving way to a prevailing ſolicitude for "the outward adorning of plating the hair," and of "wearing of gold, pearls and coſtly array," you will appear to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the influence of your luſts; to be walking according to the courſe of this world; according to the prince of the power of the air, the ſpirit that now worketh in the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of diſobedience; and the tendency of it will be to darkneſs and fear with amazement, more eſpecially at times when there is moſt need of conſolation. It certainly doth not become women profeſſing godlineſs, to be thus adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but it becometh them to be adorned with good works. Certainly there appears ability for the good works of the goſpel; ſuch as feeding the hungry and cloathing the nak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, at leaſt as far as the price of the gold, pearls and coſtly array beyond modeſt apparel, that they wear; when the wearing it can be of no uſe, except evidencing their inat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to the ſcripture, which prohibit their wearing it; or what is worſe, oppoſition to them. In which caſe they may be adviſed to read <hi>James</hi> v. 1. 2. 3. with ſober atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which will ſhew ſuch a conduct to tend to fear with amazement; which Chriſtian women ought to turn from; to walk in love to Jeſus Chriſt, to their huſbands and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, according to the directions of the apoſtles of Jeſus
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:018214_0019_0FA5C1B737DD5888"/>
Chriſt, which tends to caſt out the fear that has torment. Verſe 24. "Therfore, as the church is ſubject to Chriſt, ſo let the wives to their own huſbands, in every thing." Which ſhews the duty of wives to ſubmit to and ſeek to pleaſe their huſbands, in every thing that is not contrary to the mind of Jeſus Chriſt, "as it is fit in the Lord." When the wife makes this the rule of her conduct, ſhe purſues her own hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in connection with her huſband's. When his will is contrary to the mind of Chriſt, or would wiſh his wife to do that ſhe is afraid will incur his diſpleaſure, ſhe is then only to point out her reaſons from the word, and to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in attention to the will of Jeſus Chriſt. But when ſhe ſets up her own will in oppoſition to her huſband, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in a victory over him, however ſhe may ſeem to gratify herſelf, ſhe will find it leads to future ſhame, and fear with amazement.</p>
                  <p>We have alſo, in the paſſage before us, verſe 25. "Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands love your wives, even as Chriſt alſo loved the church, and gave himſelf for it," &amp;c. Verſe 28. 29. and 30. "So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies; he that loveth his wife loveth himſelf: For no man ever yet hated his own fleſh, but nouriſheth and cheriſheth it, even as the Lord the church. For we are members of his body, of his fleſh, and of his bones." From this paſſage, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with <hi>Colloſians</hi> iii. 19. and 1ſt of <hi>Peter,</hi> iii. 7. we may collect the mind of Jeſus Chriſt, as ſignified by the apoſtles, concerning the duty of huſbands. 'Tis compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in love. "Huſbands love your wives." Love is the fulfiling of the law, and the rule or meaſure of the love of the huſband to the wife, is, "as Chriſt loved the church, and gave himſelf for it, that he might ſanctify and cleanſe it, with the waſhing of water by the word; that he might make<note n="*" place="bottom">See the former tranſlation.</note> it to himſelf a glorious church, not having ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing, but that it ſhould be holy and without blemiſh."</p>
                  <p>"Jeſus Chriſt loved the church, and gave himſelf for it." "Huſbands love your wives, even as Chriſt loved the church." Did Jeſus Chriſt give himſelf; and am I or have
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:018214_0020_0FA5C1B7F4157B18"/>
I any thing that is for the comfort and happineſs of my wife, that through covetouſneſs or ſelf-will I may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold from her, and yet manifeſt I love her as Chriſt loved the church? Jeſus Chriſt paid the church's debt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed her from captivity, directed her in her duty, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied her wants, knows how to have compaſſion on the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, and them that are out of the way: He took her circumſtances of want, diſtreſs and miſery, upon himſelf, and communicates of his fullneſs unto her; "is of God made to us wiſdom, righteouſneſs, ſanctification and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption;" and is in all an example to direct the love of the huſband to his wife; that he attend to all her wants, diſtreſſes and miſeries; to relieve and ſupply them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his meaſure. And when any thing appears in the conduct of the wife inconſiſtent with her duty, as the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band is the head of the wife, he is to point out her duty from the word. "Jeſus Chriſt gave himſelf for the church, that he might ſanctity and cleanſe it, with the waſhing of water by the word." If the word be made uſe of in the exerciſe of love, the tendency and efficacy would be to heal, as it would always bring Chriſt's authority to the view of the wife, and keep his example in the view of the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and guard againſt the evil cautioned in <hi>Colloſians</hi> iii. 19. "huſbands love your wives, and be not bitter againſt them." Remember that bitterneſs always ſprings from the root of bitterneſs; "the root that beareth gall and wormword, from the turning away from the root of the righteous, that beareth fruit." Yet ſo great is the deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of our own hearts, and ſo imperceptible the preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the enemy, transformed into an angel of light, that this bitterneſs may appear to ſpring from a ſort of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious ignorance, or a miſtaken religious Zeal.</p>
                  <p>When we read, "that the huſband is the head of the wife," and that it is his duty to rule well his own houſe, a ſtrange notion of headſhip and rule may take place, that upon every ſlight occaſion there is a bitter reſolution; I will be maſter of my own houſe; I will be minded; it is my duty, &amp;c. That inſtead of viewing the head as the ſeat of wiſdom, care and tenderneſs, it is viewed as the
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:018214_0021_0FA5C1B8D37E0550"/>
ſeat of domineering; as if its only care was to ſee, that my will may be done; and perhaps for no fault, only that a particular humour is not pleaſed, there will be a ſtamp on the floor, enough to make all ring again, and the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band hold himſelf not guilty, from a religious zeal to be minded to rule his own houſe. If I find out the man, can he be offended if I ſhould inquire, Dear ſir, where find you this in the example of Jeſus Chriſt?</p>
                  <p>From this cauſe often proceeds ſuch diſcontent with that which the induſtrious wife has endeavoured to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare, with as much agreeableneſs to her huſband, as the means he had put into her hands was capable of; that he will deſpiſe both it and her; and inſtead of coming with gratitude, thankſgiving and ſatisfaction to his meals, as that which ſhews his increaſing and perpetual obligation to eat, drink, and do all to the glory of God, there will be bitter unneaſineſs through the whole of the time calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated for family enjoyment and happineſs. If there be ſuch a man, ſhall I put him in mind, that when Jeſus fed the multitude with barley bread and fiſh, he gave thanks; and when Paul and thoſe with him on board the ſhip, were about to eat, "he took bread and gave thanks to God, in preſence of them all, and when he had broken, he began to eat; then were they all of good chear, and they alſo took meat." Dear ſir, thankſgiving to God, and all of good chear, becomes a Chriſtan's table, which the head of the family is to lead in:* Every thing contrary comes from the root of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs, however diſordered the head may be, ſo as not to ſee whence it is. The caution, "be not bitter againſt them," is to be attended to through the whole of the conduct of the huſband to the wife, with whom he is to "dwell ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to knowledge." The above deſcribed conduct muſt flow from ignorance and blindneſs, from the God of this world blinding the mind, though it be with a religious zeal for his own honor as the head of the wife, while the honor that is to be given to the wife as the weaker veſſel, as his own fleſh, as now, "bone of his bone, and fleſh of his fleſh, as heirs together of the grace of
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:018214_0022_0FA5C1B9C03C5938"/>
life," is not attended to, and their mutual prayers are here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hindered.</p>
                  <p>I have been the longer on this, becauſe this evil may proceed from ignorance, and the temptation in it not diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, which, when brought to light, may be the ſooner turned from; for certainly, if a man find a proneneſs to theſe or the like evils, in his temper, it will be natural to ſeek a hiding place, to excuſe and juſtify himſelf, and no where can he find one more eaſy, than under a cloak of falſe religion. But when the true cauſe or ſource is diſcovered to himſelf, he muſt conclude, that it is more agreeable to his duty, when he finds a legal, fretful, froward diſpoſition working in him, only waiting an opportunity of breaking forth, to get alone, and take ſhame to himſelf, before him to whom all things are naked and open, who is "the great High Prieſt that is paſſed into the heavens, Jeſus the ſon of God, touched with the feeling of our infirmities, in all points tempted as we are, without ſin," and take encouragement from him, "to aſk mercy, and find grace to help, in time of need," and take his example with him into his family; who ſays, "learn of me, for I am meek an lowly." Whence proceeds a goſpel diſpoſition, which is meek and quiet.</p>
                  <p>Now then, if there be any in this honorable relation, "HEAD OF THE WIFE, EVEN AS CHRIST IS HEAD OF THE CHURCH," who with their mouths ſhew much love to "the grace of God that bringeth ſalvation to all men that hath appeared," who are ſo far from ſoberly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to its teaching "to deny ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, and to live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly, looking for the bleſſed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour, Jeſus Chriſt; who gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify us unto himſelf a peculiar people zealous of good works," that they give themſelves over to ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, in ſuch a manner, as to neglect their buſineſs, their means of providing for the temporal ſalvation and comfort of their families for idle company, and gaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, till pinched with want, they are fretful and profane
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:018214_0023_0FA5C1BD8795D560"/>
in their families, to a degree, that would be a ſcandel to heathens, where by the name of God and his doctrines are blaſphemed. I dare to appeal to their conſciences, upon ſober reflection (which they muſt come to, whether they will or no) whether their hearts don't die within them and become as a ſtone.</p>
                  <p>I was looking in my own mind, whether there were not a deception ſome how attending the temptations, by which theſe perſons are carried away. Perhaps they will ſay, they thank God they are not as other men,—worldly, covetous, afraid of ſpending a little time or a little money; for their part they don't deſire to have their hearts over-charged with cares of this life, &amp;c. But do they not ſee, that this very practice involves them and their families in the utmoſt perplexity? What, though they may ſometimes appear to gain, hath not divine truth ſaid, "wealth gotten by vanity ſhall be diminiſhed"? Yes, it ſhall. Divine power is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the cauſe of divine truth, and it ſhall be accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Perhaps in this very inſtance in which you gain, it is fulfiled reſpecting ſome other family.</p>
                  <p>When Jeſus Chriſt exhorted his diſciples. "Take heed leaſt your hearts be over charged with ſurfeiting and drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſs, and cares of this life, and that day come upon you unawares," did he not give an example of diligence in work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the work of him that ſent him? Says he, "my meat is to do the will of him that ſent me, and to finiſh his work." Is it not the character of his ſpouſe? "She worketh wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly with her hands, ſhe looketh well to the ways of her houſhold, and eateth not the bread of idleneſs." And doth not his apoſtles direct his diſciples, 1ſt of <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> iv. 11. 12. "That ye ſtudy to be quiet and do your own buſineſs, and work with your own hands, that ye may walk honeſtly towards them that are without, and ye may have lack of nothing." 2d of <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> iii. 11. 12. "We hear that there are ſome that walk diſorderly, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not at all, but are buſy bodies; now them that are ſuch, we command and exhort, by our LORD JESUS, that with quietneſs they work and eat their own bread." <hi>Epheſians</hi> iv. 28. "Rather let him labour, working with
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:018214_0024_0FA5C1BF4B84A778"/>
his hands the thing that is good, that he might have to give to him that needeth." In this the apoſtle was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, 1ſt of <hi>Theſſaionians,</hi> ii. 9. "For labouring night and day, becauſe we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we preached unto you the goſpel of God." <hi>Acts</hi> xx. 34. 35. "Theſe hands have miniſtered to my neceſſities, and to them that were with me: So labouring, ye ought to ſupport the weak, and to remember the words of our Lord Jeſus, how he ſaid it is more bleſſed to give than to receive."</p>
                  <p>Let theſe ſayings ſink down into our ears, and let us remember the exhortation, <hi>Romans</hi> xiii. 13. 14. "Let us walk honeſtly as in the day, not in rioting and drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, not in chambering and wantonneſs, not in ſtrife and envy, but put ye on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and make not proviſion for the fleſh, to fulfill the luſts thereof." 'Tis all day with him; we are naked and open before him; "If I ſay the darkneſs ſhall cover me, even the night ſhall be light about me; yea, the darkneſs hideth not from thee, but the night ſhineth as the day; the darkneſs and the light are both alike to thee."</p>
                  <p>As the duty of huſband is now in view, I would take a little more particular notice of the apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi>'s compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive addreſs to them, all contained in one verſe, 1ſt epiſtle, iii. 7. "Likewiſe ye huſbands dwell with them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to knowledge, giving honor unto the wife as to the weaker veſſel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life, that your prayers be not hindered."</p>
                  <p>"Dwell with them according to knowledge." This may import the knowledge of the miſtery contained in the marriage union; as it is a figure of the union of Chriſt and the church, the knowledge of the love, care, compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and tenderneſs, that Jeſus Chriſt ſhews to his church, as an example to the huſband, and of what his word and the nat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>e of the marriage union binds upon them."</p>
                  <p>"Giving honor to the wiſe as to the weaker veſſel." The apoſtle ſays, "If one member ſuffer, all the members ſuffer with it; and if one member be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers rejoice with it." 'Tis true here, if the head and huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band give honor to the wiſe, all the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>

<pb n="26" facs="unknown:018214_0025_0FA5C1BF70FA8360"/>
rejoice; if ſhe frequently, and without cauſe, ſuffer his diſpleaſure, all the family ſuffer herein. But how may I underſtand this expreſſion, "honor as to the weaker veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel"? When I look into the houſe, I ſee the weaker veſſels, the glaſs, the china, honored with the moſt attention, the ſafeſt and moſt honorable place aſſigned to them; they are handled with the greateſt care and tenderneſs; and in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> xxii. from the 15th, I read, that when Shebna, who looked upon himſelf as the nail faſtened in the ſure place, ſhould be removed, cut down and fall, and the burden on it broken, God would faſten Eliakim as a type of Jeſus Chriſt, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> a nail in a ſure place; "And they ſhall hang on him all the glory of his Father's houſe, all veſſels of ſmall quantity, from the veſſels of cups, even to all the veſſels of flaggons." Here is honor to the weaker veſſels. Hence the honor to the wife, denotes the care and tenderneſs with which ſhe is to be treated; and in all her fears, diſtreſſes and perplexities, to be put in mind of the nail in the ſure place, that can never be cut down and fall.</p>
                  <p>This is agreeable to what follows: "And as being heirs together of the grace of life." The grace of life, is the grace that reigns through righteouſneſs to eternal life, by Jeſus Chriſt our Lord; which comes not by works of righteouſneſs which we have done, but according to his mercy. The idea of heirſhip, is the idea of inheriting what was not our own, by the will of another. Heirs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of the grace of life, carries the mutual obligation that the grace of the goſpel brings us under, to obedience to him in our mutual duties one to another.</p>
                  <p>"That your prayers be not hindered." The direction, 1ſt of <hi>Peter,</hi> iv. 7. "Be ye therefore ſober, and watch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to prayer," together with the repeated exhortations of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, to watch and pray, ſhews the duty of watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs againſt every thing whereby our prayers may be hindered; and as Jeſus Chriſt, in <hi>Mark</hi> xi. 52. ſays, "When ye ſtand praying, forgive, if ye have ought againſt any," we may eaſily ſee that the contrary ſpirit muſt hinder mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual prayer; for where envy and ſtri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e is, there is confuſion and every evil work. That your prayers be not hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:018214_0026_0FA5C1C05108F258"/>
may have reference to mutual prayer in the church, which ought to be attended in the exerciſe of fervent charity, and which may be marred, weakened or broken, by an indulged carriage, unbecoming the goſpel of Chriſt; in which caſe the direction of Jeſus Chriſt, "If thou bring thy gift to the alter, and there remember that thy brother hath ought againſt thee, leave there thy gift before the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and go thy way, firſt be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift," ought to be attended to.—It may alſo have reference to their mutual prayers in the family, as their circumſtances, opportunity and ſenſe of divine mercy, may call them thereunto: For we have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to pray with all prayer and ſupplication in the ſpirit; and in every thing, by prayer and ſupplication, with thankſgiving, to be making our requeſts known to God; and it muſt be the mutual duties of huſbands and wives, to guard againſt that conduct which would hinder the mutual enjoyment of ſuch a privilege.</p>
                  <p>In what has been brought to view, the ſcriptures, in their moſt obvious meaning, have been attended to, as knowing they come with the authority of Jeſus Chriſt, who is Lord of all. The authority of the apoſtles is the authority of Chriſt, as he has connected them with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; ſo that he that deſpiſes theſe their exhortations, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſeth not man, but God. And ſure I am, that an atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them, is the ſureſt way to domeſtic happineſs. I have often thought, that if two perſons come together in the relation of huſband and wife, that wiſhed to live hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily in that relation, they could walk by no better rules, even ſuppoſing they did not believe the ſcriptures; but in that caſe they would have but the body or the letter, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſpirit. The honor, the nearneſs, the endeared af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and the obligations mutually ariſing in that rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, cannot be fully ſeen but as they center in Chriſt Jeſus, in his union with, love to, and care of, his church; in whom the man is not without the woman, nor the woman without the man: "For OF HIM, and TO HIM, and THROUGH HIM, are all things:" To whom be glory forever. AMEN.</p>

                  <head>Containing thoughts occaſioned by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions of the table.</head>
                  <p>Upon looking over the time calculated for family enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, happineſs, &amp;c. mentioned in the 22d page; ſome thoughts occured on the proviſion of the table, which ſwell'd beyond the compaſs of a marginal note, and are brought in by way of appendix, as follows.</p>
                  <p>WHEN the head of a family retiring from his buſineſs to his meals, has the happineſs to make them all ſet down around him and the example of Jeſus Chriſt and the apoſtle, to direct, excite, embolden, and encourage him to give thanks before them all, if his mind is led to underſtand the glory of the goſpel, what can hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his breaking forth into praiſe, for all ſpiritual bleſſings in heavenly things, in Chriſt Jeſus, as they are brought to his view in the bounties of providence on his table; yea, though it be at a time of poverty, and there be only bread and water, to preſerve life till ſome further proviſions can be procured, yet even that would point us to the bread and water of life, for even they were made by him, and for him, and do ſilently, eminently and conſtantly hold forth his glory; if with them I have a piece of a broiled fiſh, ſhall I be diſcontent becauſe I have no more, and ſeem as if the meal was not large enough to call me to thankſgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; or ſhall I not rather remember it is the ſame with which Jeſus fed the multitudes after he had given thanks; the ſame that was laid on the coals, <hi>John</hi> xxi. 9. to which he called his diſciples to "come and dine," verſe 12; or would my diſcontented mind find fault with my bread, becauſe I can't obtain every day the fineſt of the wheat, let it rather remind me, that it was barley bread with which
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:018214_0030_0FA5C1C39CCE30F8"/>
Jeſus fed the multitude, <hi>John</hi> vi 9. If the adverſary, whoſe name is legion, for they are many, attempt like the Midi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anites that typified them, <hi>Judges</hi> vi. to deſtroy the increaſe of the earth, by introducing murmuring, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content and uneaſineſs, inſtead of thankſgiving at my table, may this barley bread with which the multitudes were fed, remind me of what the barley cake did, in the hoſt of the Midianites, and be as officacious to take away my murmuring; for will it not pierce my heart with grief and ſhame that I ſhould murmur at that for which my Lord gives thanks! Can I have the leaſt appearance of a ſervant or diſciple, to be thus above my maſter and Lord, while a "perfect diſciple ſhall be as his maſter." <hi>Luke</hi> vi. 40. "Herein is the love perfect in us, that we ſhould have boldneſs in the day of judgment, for as he is, ſo are we in this world." 1ſt of <hi>John,</hi> iv. 17. Methinks here is alſo a further leſſon for me; when a lad had only five barley loaves, and two ſmall fiſhes, they were all at the ſervice of Jeſus Chriſt, of whom and for whom he had them. If I am favoured with meat, it is calculated to lead me to the meat that endureth to eternal life, which the Son of man ſhall give, who ſays, "my fleſh is meat indeed." If I have a dinner of herbs, and the ſenſe of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine love exciting me and my family to love one another, 'tis better than a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

If I caſt my eye on the ſalt, while I reach after it, it would ſilently remind me of the favour of the knowledge of Chriſt, made manifeſt by his apoſtles in every p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

"Now becauſe we are ſalted with the ſalt of the palace, it was not meet for us to ſee

the kings diſhonour:" This is the inſtruction my ſalt, which was created by him, is of him and for him, would communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to me. Is my table furniſhed, and am I favoured with roots, and will they not turn my mind to the "root of Jeſſe," <hi>Iſaiah</hi> xi. 10. "the root out of a ory ground," chap. liii. 2. "the root of the righteous that yieldeth or giveth," <hi>Proverbs</hi> xii. 12. For my roots were by him, they are from him and for him, to hold forth his glory. Do I find my table enrich'd with fruits, the fruit of the vine; have I a cup of wine there, ſurely it ſo fully points to Jeſus Chriſt, that as oft as I drink it, I ought to remember him, whether it be at the Lord's ſupper, or at my own table. Do I ſee the beans<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> peaſe and ſquaſhes on my table, either of theſe are the fruit of the buſh, and would lead my mind to the angel of the Lord, or the agent Jehovah, that appeared to Moſes in the buſh, which burned with fire and was not conſumed, which cauſed Moſes to turn aſide, to behold with attention, when he was told to put off his ſhoes from off his feet, in token of reverence and reſignation to his Lord, which be did, and was then inſtructed in the meaning, which led Moſes to underſtand, that though the poſterity of Abraham, Iſaac and Jacob, were in bondage in Egypt, ſighing and groaning, and was expeled a ſtranger in Midi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, a ſtrange land, yet God ſaw their trouble and heard their cry, and ſaid unto him, "I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, of Iſaac and of Jacob, this is my name forever, and my memorial unto all ages;" I that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered Abraham, Iſaac and Jacob in all their diſtreſſes, particularly that ſaved Jacob, and his family when in danger o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

"I AM that I AM, I am the God of Abraham, of Iſaac, and of Jacob; this is my name forever, and my memorial throughout all generations: I know the ſorrows of their poſterity, therefore I am come down to deliver them."—And is there not in this name and memorial joy to the whole earth? Is he the God of the Jews only, and not of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles alſo? Yes, "even of the Gentiles alſo; the God of the whole earth ſhall he be called." The promiſe to Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham is. "In thy ſeed ſhall all the nations of the earth be bleſſed." So that there is not held forth to Moſes in the burning buſh, the diſtreſſed ſtate of the children of Iſrael and their deliverance only, but of the whole human race, who by the curſe of the fiery law, appeared in danger of being burnt up without remedy; but Jeſus "was made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law;" he ſuſtained the fire, and freed us from being conſumed. His ſuſtaining of, and deliverance from it, was the beginning of revenges on the enemy; on which the call is, "Rejoice O ye nations, his people." In view of which, in the lxviith <hi>Pſalm,</hi> "All people" are called to "clap their hands, and ſhout with the voice of triumph; for the Lord, High and Terrible, a Great King over all the earth, he hath ſubdued the people under us, and the nations under our feet." The nation and people of the Jews, apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves above the Gentiles, and deſpiſed them; but ſince "God is gone up with a ſhout, the Lord with the ſound of the trumpet," it is evident he hath choſen our inheritance for us, "the excellency of Jacob, whom he loved."</p>
                  <p>Our inheritance: All people, the Gentiles, who are fellow heirs, and of the ſame body, and partakers of his promiſes in Chriſt by the goſpel, and all people, are called on, "Sing praiſes to God; ſing praiſes; ſing praiſes unto our King, ſing praiſes; for God is King of all the earth; ſing ye praiſes that have underſtanding: God reigneth over the heathen; God ſiteth upon his holy throne."—Agreeable to <hi>Pſalm</hi> ii. where it is ſaid, "Yet have I ſet my King upon my holy hill of Zion: Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee," (referring to the reſurrection) "aſk of me, and I will give the heathen thine inheritance, and the utmoſt parts of the earth thy poſſeſſion." Upon
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:018214_0033_0FA5C1CB58D1CE38"/>
his reſurrection, 'tis manifeſt they are his purchaſed poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion. This King now manifeſtly appears to reign in righteouſneſs: "I have ſet my King upon my holy hill of Zion." So in the above xlviith <hi>Pſalm,</hi> on his aſcenſion, he is "King of all the earth," he "rigneth over the heathen," he "ſitteth on his holy throne," he is come whoſe right it is; thus "the princes of the people are gathered together, the people of the God of Abraham;" he not only ſhielded Abraham's family in their affliction, but "the ſhields of the earth belong unto the Lord; he is greatly exalted."</p>
                  <p>Is there not a leſſon for me, under my diſtreſſing trials, of what ſort ſoever, to realize the reverence and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection that is due to my Lord, as in the caſe of Moſes, <hi>Exodus</hi> iii. 5. and <hi>Joſhua</hi> v. 15. reſigning myſelf up to him as not my own, but redeemed by him? Now this was the manner in Iſrael, concerning redeeming and changing,—to eſtabliſh all things, a man pluck'd off his ſhoe, and gave it to his neighbour, and this was a ſure witneſs in Iſrael that he had reſigned his right, and it was the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of him that redeemed it; which I am of my Lord Redeemer, and ought to realize it with reverend ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, under every affliction, knowing that in his everlaſting name, his memorial through all generations, there is a fountain of all-ſufficient conſolation.</p>
                  <p>Are not theſe things brought to my view in the fruit of the buſh upon my table? And doth not the riſing and growing of theſe buſhes from year to year, bring to my mind the uſe my Lord teaches me to make of this mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of himſelf, in proof of the reſurrection, in <hi>Luke</hi> xx. 37. 38? Or, are the above-mentioned beans, peaſe and ſquaſhes, with the cucumbers and mellons, on my table, the fruit of the vine, then they all, with the blood of the grapes, point to the true vine from whence they proceed, to whom they belong, and for whom they were created. But have I not yet done? Am I preſented with the fruit of the apple-tree, to bring to my mind the tree of life, which bear twelve fruits, and yielded her fruit every month; which fruit was for meat, and the leaf for medicine; "the leaves of the tree for the healing of the nations?" If my apple ſhould remind me of the fruit of the forbidden tree,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:018214_0034_0FA5C1CB85F75800"/>
by which ſin and death entered, it will alſo lead me to Chriſt, by and for whom the apple-tree was created; for "as the apple-tree among the trees of the wood, ſo is my beloved among the ſons." I have all in this tree; for the fruit is for food and the leaf for medicine. What may I underſtand by the leaves of the tree, in a natural ſenſe? It ſhows that which evidences of what ſort the tree is: Thus the fig tree was known it had leaves; and as the leaves of a fig-tree were ſewed together for aprons, after the fall, to hide nakedneſs and ſhame, as has been the manner ever ſince, "to cover with a covering, but not of God's ſpirit," to go about to eſtabliſh our own righteouſneſs, which covering is too narrow, a man cannot wrap him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in it; ſo when Jeſus came the Lord our righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he ſaith to the fig-tree, the emblem of ſeeking life by our own righteouſneſs, "never man eat fruit of thee henceforth forever, and immediately the fig-tree withered away;" but his leaf ſhall not wither,—his profeſſion.—The truth he heard of God at this baptiſm, "this is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed," the truth he taught through his life and miniſtry, that he witneſſed a good confeſſion to, before Pontious Pilot, that was wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed in his reſurrection, whereby he is "declared the Son of God, with power according to the ſpirit of holineſs," this truth, which Peter made confeſſion of, on which he will build his church, is, I apprehend, what we are led to for the meaning of the "leaves of the tree, that are for the healing of the nations," whoſe virtues ſhall prevail 'till "there be no more curſe."</p>
                  <p>But it is time to riſe from table. Pleaſe, ſir, to ſtop and taſte a few nuts. Yes, my friend, I will taſte them, that they may lead me down to the garden of nuts, of which I read, <hi>Song</hi> vi. 11. to ſee the "fruits of the valley;" for val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, mountains, rocks, hills and plains, beaſts, and all cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, fruitful trees, and all cedars, creeping things, and fowls of every wing, all in their places ſhew forth his glory; for all things were created by him and for him: To whom be glory forever.

'Tis the place and duty of a child to be in his parents preſence with reverence and delight; and 'tis the duty of the parent to guard againſt a childleſs familiarity, that would tend to make the child humourſome, and bring the parent into contempt; and againſt ſuch an auſterity as would make their preſence a dread which the child would ſeek to avoid. 'Tis their duty alſo to guard againſt ill names, and ſuch phraſes and expreſſions as would intimate to the minds of the children, that their parents have not the fear of God before their eyes. If inſtead of the pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, endearing expreſſions of—my dear child, my ſon, my daughter,—'tis—you little our, you dog, you plague,—or the like; 'tis, what ſhall I call it! a violent rape on the morals of the child. Such children are early capable of reaſoning after this manner,—if I am ſuch a creature, what is my father that begat me, or my mother that brought me forth?—and they ſoon get emboldened to uſe the ſame expreſſions, at leaſt to thoſe that offend them; which is productive of wrath and ſtrife, and promotes an undeſirable hardneſs and harſhneſs of temper and manners.</p>
               <p>Parents muſt likewiſe guard againſt a cuſtomary threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which alienates the mind, and ſowers the temper of the children, and produces contempt of the parents, when they ſee their threatnings are only verbal, never to be feared except when they get into a paſſion. Threatnings ought to be given out with great caution and care; to be what will be the parents indiſpenſible duty in the threatned caſe: They ought to be confined to moral evils; ſuch as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent wilſul diſobedience, lying, cheating, or profaneneſs; any thing that is an apparent ſin againſt God or our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: And when judiciouſly given out, they ought to be punctually executed, not in paſſion and anger, but in love and faithfulneſs. And when any accidental miſcarriage takes place, ſuch as the breaking an earthen veſſel, or a ſquare of glaſs, it ſhould meet with a gentle admonition, never carried ſo high as to tempt the children to lie to hide it, for fear of the wrath of their parents.</p>
               <p>Here I would take notice of the apoſtolick direction, <hi>Epheſians</hi> vi. 4. "And ye fathers provoke not your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:018214_0037_0FA5C1CE07CF7F18"/>
to wrath, leaſt they be diſcouraged, but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord."</p>
               <p>"Leaſt they be diſcouraged." Doth it not include in it every thing in the education of children, that would give them a dreadful diſcouraging idea of God, or of their natural parents, ſo as to cauſe them ſecretly to wiſh they could hide themſelves from him or them, or to make them unhappy at the thought of being always in the Divine preſence (a ſource of ſecurity and happineſs where his name is known) or at the thought of coming into the preſence of their parents.</p>
               <p>The ſcripture account that God is love, and the way in which it is made manifeſt, is calculated to ſhew our high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt happineſs in his preſence and favour; and what is to be moſt feared, is that which will diſpleaſe him, and procure his frown. In like manner, if parents conduct by the Divine rule, their children will be happieſt in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and favour, and it muſt be a great puniſhment to be turned away from them, as a token of diſpleaſure, but for an hour. But when, on the contrary, they cannot come where they are, without ſome hard names or dreadful threatnings, they are provoked and diſcouraged.</p>
               <p>"But bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord." Nurture conveys the idea of nurſing or nouriſhment, agreeable to 1ſt of <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> ii. 7. "We were gentle among you, as a nurſe cheriſheth her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;" 1ſt of <hi>Peter,</hi> ii. 2. "As new-born babes deſire the ſincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby;" 1ſt of <hi>Timothy,</hi> iv. 6. "Nouriſhed up in the words of faith and good doctrine." Admonition conveys the idea, to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, adviſe, inſtruct, warn and reprove.</p>
               <p>The admonition of the Lord, leads my mind to 1ſt of <hi>Corinthians,</hi> x. 11. where the apoſtle, ſpeaking of the things written in the old teſtament, ſays, "they are written for our admonition." The ſcriptures of the new began to be ſpoken by the Lord, and was confirmed to us by them that heard him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They are the admonition of the Lord; not only the ſayings of Chriſt himſelf, but of his apoſtles, that he connects with himſelf, "He that heareth you, heareth
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:018214_0038_0FA5C1CE77E67878"/>
me;" are the admonition of the Lord, as is expreſſed 1ſt of <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> ii. 11. "As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father his children, that ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you to his kingdom and glory."</p>
               <p>1ſt. For nurture. Let the children have the ſincere milk of the word, that they may grow thereby; let them ſuck and be ſatisfied with theſe breaſts of conſolation. Only let us look into the various paſſages, in which Jeſus Chriſt ſpake of, to, or about little children: See <hi>Matthew</hi> xviii. 1. to 14. chap. xix. 14. 15. <hi>Matthew</hi> xxi. 16. <hi>Mark</hi> xi. 13. to 16. <hi>Luke</hi> xviii. 14. 16. and ſee if there is any thing beſides glad tidings of great joy to them: If it be ſo, let the dear children know it as ſoon as they are capable of underſtanding; let them be "nouriſhed up in the words of faith," in thoſe truths that are to be believed, "and good doctrine;" the good news, the glad tidings that the GOSPEL contains. Or is there any threatnings of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal damnation to children, by the apoſtles of Chriſt? If not, who dare ring them in their ears!</p>
               <p>There is indeed, temporal deſtruction, with the greateſt infamy, threatned diſobedient children, <hi>Proverbs</hi> xxx. 17. which is a part of the ſecond branch: The admonition of the Lord ſo is, <hi>Luke</hi> xv. 15. where the prodigal, from a father's houſe, where is bread enough, and to ſpare, is brought to be a poor hungry ſwine-feeder.</p>
               <p>So is every caution and warning through the ſcriptures, eſpecially the new teſtament, which the parents ought to be acquainted with, and bring to the children's view, for warning, reproving, counſeling, adviſing and inſtructing on all occaſions, particularly upon any thing that is ſinful: The divine admonition ought to be brought immediately from the lively oracles, and they convinced it is diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the will of their Greater, Preſerver and Redeemer, on whom their all depends.</p>
               <p>For an example of admonition, we have one drawn to our hands by the apoſtle, 1ſt of <hi>Corinthians</hi> 1. to 11. which being well conſidered, may help parents to make uſe of other ſcriptures in a ſimilar way, as there may be occaſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="unknown:018214_0039_0FA5C1CF41D57798"/>
Thus have I given ſome thoughts on the education of children, to whom I wiſh the bleſſedneſs of an early ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with what God has done for them, and their obligations of gratitude to him. 'Tis the duty of parents, from childhood, to acquaint them with the holy ſcriptures, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in theſe things are contained (as Timothy was) "which are able to make wiſe unto ſalvation, through faith in Chriſt Jeſus:" 'Tis with him to communicate the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of himſelf, according to his good pleaſure: To whom be glory and dominion, forever. AMEN.</p>

               <p>WHEN I meditate on the caſe of children, and propoſe an exhortation to them, inſtead of being governed by the various opinions there are about them. I would turn to the ſcriptures, and form my apprehenſions from them, that I may know what ground there is for a word of exhortation to them. In <hi>Matthew</hi> xviii. 5. and <hi>Mark</hi> ix. 37. Jeſus Chriſt ſays, "Whoſoever ſhall receive one ſuch little child in my name, receiveth me." One ſuch;—it was a child he took in his arms, in <hi>Mark;</hi> a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle child in <hi>Matthew:</hi> And in <hi>Luke</hi> xviii. 15. they brought infants, and Jeſus ſaid, "Suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not, for of ſuch is the kingdom
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:018214_0041_0FA5C1D223C95C98"/>
of Heaven." How comes infants conſtituted of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven? <hi>Matthew</hi> xviii. 11. ſhews Jeſus Chriſt came to ſave them; therefore, "take heed that ye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe not one of theſe little ones; for I ſay unto you, that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is in heaven; for the ſon of man is come to ſave that which is loſt." Their angels: What is the office of the holy angels? "Are they not all miniſtring ſpirits, ſent forth to miniſter for them that ſhall be heirs of ſalvation?" If their angels always behold the face of the God and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is in heaven, doth it not convey the idea that nothing can be done againſt them, in a way of deſpiſing them, but what muſt be immediately known there? And if angels miniſter to infants, are they not heirs of ſalvation? How came they heirs; are they not by nature children of wrath; are they not loſt in Adam, their head; how came they heirs of ſalvation? Verſe 11. informs us, "For the ſon of man came to ſave that which was loſt." Though they are really loſt in union with the firſt Adam, and however they may appear loſt in their own utter helpleſſneſs, and the various diſtreſſes and miſeries, even death itſelf, that they are expoſed to; yet if the ſon of man is come to ſave that which is loſt; has taken hold of them, taken their nature into union with himſelf, and conſtituted them of the kingdom of God, in virtue of his own righteouſneſs, who ſays, <hi>Luke</hi> xviii. 15. "for of ſuch is the kingdom of God," then "take heed that ye deſpiſe not one of theſe little ones." Are they not deſpiſed by thoſe that freely and frequently ſpeak of the everlaſting damnation of infants? Do they get it from any word of Jeſus Chriſt concerning them? Why is it ſo? That they are loſt is readily acknowledged; but the ſon of man came to ſave that which was loſt: Will he not accompliſh his deſign; is he not mighty to ſave? He is the ſhepherd that looks after that which is loſt," that "takes the lambs into his arms and carries them in his boſom:" "How think ye, if a man have an hundred ſheep, if one of them be gone aſtray, doth he not leave the ninety-nine, and goeth into the mountains and ſeeketh that which is gone aſtay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="43" facs="unknown:018214_0042_0FA5C1D24E8F2470"/>
and if ſo be that he find it, verily I ſay unto you, that he rejoiceth more of that than of the ninety-nine that went not aſtray: EVEN ſo it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven, that one of theſe little ones ſhould periſh." If Jeſus Chriſt came to ſave them, and it is not the will of your Father in heaven that one of them ſhould periſh, muſt not the deſpiſers of them, that ſo freely treat of their dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, ſuſpect themſelves as advocates for the deſtroyer? Do they not prevail to draw a vail over the power and compaſſion of the Saviour, and deſtroy the peace of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands?</p>
               <p>It may not be amiſs to illuſtrate this, by bringing in the teſtimony of the prophets and apoſtles. When God, by his prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> was comforting ancient Iſrael in what he would do for them, chap. xxxi. 1. to 14. the ground and reaſon of which we have in the 11th verſe, "For the Lord hath redeemed Jacob, and ranſomed him from the hand of ſtronger than he." Having redeemed and ranſomed him, "He that ſcattered Iſrael will gather him, and keep him as a ſhepherd his flock: Therefore they ſhall come and ſing in the height of Zion; and they ſhall not ſorrow any more at all; then ſhall the virgin rejoice in the dance, both young men and old men together; for I will turn their mourning into joy, and make them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice from their ſorrow, and I will ſatiate the ſoul of the prieſt with fatneſs, and my people ſhall be ſatisfied with my goodneſs, ſaith the Lord." That this good news may reach the bottom of their affliction and ſorrow, expreſſed in verſe 15. in a prophetic view, of the deſtruction of the children of Bethlehem, by Herod, 'tis ſaid, verſe 16. "Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears, for thy work ſhall be rewarded, ſaith the Lord; and they ſhall come again from the land of the enemy, and there is hope in thine end, ſaith the Lord, that thy children ſhall come again to their own border." Death was the enemy where they went; from which they ſhall come again, and inherit their own border, in him, or by virtue of union with him, "who through death, deſtroys him that had the power of death; that is the devil." "Thus ſaith the Lord,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:018214_0043_0FA5C1D2F12D10C8"/>
even the captives of the mighty ſhall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible ſhall be delivered; for I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with him that contendeth with thee, and I will ſave thy children, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> xlix 25." "They ſhall come again from the land of the enemy."</p>
               <p>"And there is hope in thine end that thy children ſhall come again to their own border." What is their own bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der? 'Tis the fruit of the purchaſe of Jeſus Chriſt, called their own in virtue of their union to him. To this I would add the apoſtle Peter, in <hi>Acts</hi> ii. 39. "For the promiſe is to you and to your children, and to all that are afar, of even as many as the Lord our God ſhall call." The promiſe to you and your children, as extenſive as the call of the goſpel, which is directed to every creature, and expreſſed in this language by the prophet, "Look unto me, and be ye ſaved, all the ends of the earth."</p>
               <p>It may not be unſuitable to take notice here of the error of many parents, and others, who comfort themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their infant children, when they die, from their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, ſaying they are undoubtedly gone to happineſs, and rob the Saviour of his glory, and themſelves of any true comfort. If they would think a few minutes, if the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Jeſus Chriſt is excluded, and they gone to happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by virtue of their own innocency, 'tis a happineſs that they themſelves can never be admitted to; "for there is no other name under Heaven among men, whereby they can be ſaved, but the name of Jeſus" They ſeem not to attend to the apoſtle; "he hath concluded all under ſin, that he might have mercy upon all."</p>
               <p>The apoſtle John, when writing to the diſciples, under the character of little children, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ys, "I write unto you, little children, becauſe your ſin are forgiven, for his name ſake: I write unto you, little children, becauſe you have known the Father." The Father is not known to any but to whomſoever the ſon will reveal him. When they underſtood the forgivneſs of ſins for his name's ſake, the know the father: Thus is he, who is love, made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt. And this is what little children in Chriſt's ſchool are taught, by an aged apoſtle, "I write unto you, little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:018214_0044_0FA5C1D75F6AA210"/>
becauſe your ſins are forgiven you, for his name's ſake," which he lays in the foundation of his exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to them, "Love not the world," &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I am aware of an objection againſt what I have brought to view. How can theſe things be ſo, when we ſee chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as ſoon as they grow up, turn after their own luſts, after "the courſe of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the ſpirit that now worketh in the children of diſobedience?" Do we not ſee children and youth ſoon arrive at a ſhocking pitch of profaneneſs and immora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity? Yes, verily, multitudes of them appear to be in the ſnare of the devil, and led captive by him, at his will: But whoſe are they? Do they belong to him who hath inſnared them, and leads them captive; yea, though he ſo blind their minds as to lead them to profane the name of their right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful owner, and to ſay he ſhall not reign over us, doth it alienate the property of them? May they not be told with truth and propriety, that they are not their own, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to Jeſus Chriſt, to whom they muſt give an account of their conduct, who will bring every knee of them to bow to him; that they are working out their own ſhame and confuſion of face before him? May they not be called to repent; to return to their rightful proprietor, owner and Lord?</p>
               <p>But how repent, unleſs they are wrong in their aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Jeſus Chriſt, and in their walking according to the ſpirit that now worketh in the children of diſobedience? How return, if they have not gone aſtray; if they belong not to their Lord Redeemer; i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> he be not the ſhepherd and biſhop of their ſouls? Is not this idea held up in every call to repentance? <hi>Iſaiah</hi> xiiv. 22. "Return, for I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed thee." <hi>Jeremiah</hi> iii. 12. "Return, thou back-ſlid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Iſrael, ſaith the Lord;" 14. "Turn, O back ſliding children, ſaith the Lord. for I am married unto you;" 22. "Return, ye back ſliding children, I will heal your back-ſlidings." The idea of his right as Redeemer, Huſband and Father, is implied in the call to return, and every ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Thus much OF CHILDREN; what follows is addreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed TO CHILDREN.</p>
               <p>Children,—let me aſk your attention to what is laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, ſimply from the ſcriptures.—Are theſe things ſo? If ſo, methinks it is "glad tidings of great joy," and ſhews the ground of obligation that lies upon you to look upon yourſelves as not your own, as not at liberty to walk after your own luſts, as not belonging to ſatan, however he may ſeek to devour or inſnare you,—you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to Jeſus Chriſt, our Creator, Preſerver and Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, he has bought you with his blood, and therefore you are under the higheſt obligations to "glorify him in your ſpirits and bodies which are his;" and is it not in this view, moſt ungrateful, baſe and wicked, to walk contrary thereunto? I have thought whether it were not the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of children about what our Lord and Saviour is to them, has done, and is doing for them, that was the
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:018214_0046_0FA5C1D96B5FB6C8"/>
cauſe of their ſinking ſo low into the mire and filth of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſs and immorality; while a ſenſe of love always carries with it, a ſenſe of obligation to grateful obedience: Where this is the caſe, it would be natural to turn our minds to the exhortation of the apoſtle to children, "chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren obey your parents in the Lord, for this right." When we conſider the wretched, helpleſs circumſtances we come into the world in, and view the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Father of mercies, giving paternal love, tenderneſs and compaſſion to our parents, and by this means, daily loading us with his benefits; as ſoon as we are capable of reflecting, it muſt give us a view of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to gratitude and thankfulneſs, which cannot be expreſſed, without a ſenſe of obligation to obedience; therefore, children "obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right," it muſt commend itſelf to your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences as right.—I wiſh to unfold ſomething of the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this expreſſion; if I could, it would diſcover ſuch obligations as could not be broken through, without do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing violence to our own conſciences, our peace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, for it muſt lead to a united view of what our Lord Jeſus Chriſt has done, and is doing for us, and what he makes our parents to us, and does for us by their means, which would lead our minds to all the thought, care, toil and labour of the father, and to the compaſſionate tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the mother, who often, with much pain and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, nouriſhes her offspring from her own body, both night and day; well might the apoſtle ſay, "children obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right." Here alſo is a direction to children, when they come to years capable of underſtanding the will of God in Chriſt Jeſus concerning them; if ever the parents, through the preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of temptation, command any thing contrary to his revealed will, to remember the words of the apoſtle to the rulers who commanded them contrary to the will of the Lord, "we ought to obey God rather than man," and duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to remind their parents of the reaſons of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; to obey in any thing contrary to his revealed will, would not be to obey them "in the LORD."</p>

"Honor thy father and mother," which is the firſt commandment, with promiſe, "that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayeſt live long on the earth;" a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary conduct, ſlights the divine authority that commands, and the divine promiſe annexed thereto; it ſlights our own welfare, and forfeits life upon earth. What baſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, guilt and ſhame, doth diſobedience to parents carry along with it!</p>
               <p>When the apoſtle to the Romans, ſpeaks of God's giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over the Gentiles to a reprobace mind, and rehearſes what they were filled with which led thereunto, we find in the catalogue. "diſobedience to parents," <hi>Romans</hi> i. 30. So when he ſpeaks of the perilous times that ſhould come in the laſt days, one part of the deſcription is, "diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to parents," 2d. of <hi>Timothy</hi> iii. 2.</p>
               <p>This is that which, beſides the ingratitude, baſeneſs and wickedneſs that appears in it, has a leading tendency, to various others, if not all kinds of vice and wickedneſs: Therefore, "children obey your parents in the Lord;" "Honor thy father and mother, that it may be well with thee, that thou mayeſt live long upon the earth," even till it pleaſe God in his providence, to call you by a natural death, in his own time and way, and not hurry yourſelves, by your diſobedience, into the hands of civil juſtice, to an untimely death, to which it has a tendency.</p>
               <p>When Jeſus Chriſt addreſſed his diſciples under the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of little children, <hi>John</hi> xiii. 33. the exhortation he had to give them, to which he thus called their attention, was, verſe 34, "a new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye alſo love one another." This is the duty of every one, more eſpecially of all who hope for ſalvation from the love of the Saviour, which ought to excite children to treat one another with kindneſs and love, not to wiſh evil to any that offend us, not to "render evil for evil," not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe thoſe that are poor, but endeavour to think of the forgivneſs and condeſcenſion of Jeſus Chriſt, agreeable to the exhortation of the apoſtle, <hi>Epheſians</hi> iv. 31. "let all bitterneſs, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil

ſpeaking, be put away from you, with all malice, and be ye kind one to another, tender hearted, forgiving one another, even as God in Chriſt hath forgiven you."</p>
               <p>Here I would take notice of what I have ſeen in ſome inſtances, with ſorrow. When young perſons have been intruſted with the care of little children, either at home, or to lead them abroad, they have ſeemed to loſe all ſenſe of that kindneſs and tender-heartedneſs, of which the apoſtle ſpeaks; and as it were, cruelly divert themſelves with tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the dear little ones frightful ſtories, and giving out many threatnings to them, 'till <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ear and diſtreſs has baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every agreeable feeling from their tender breaſts, and they burſt forth into ſobbing and crying; for which they have been called croſs,—twitch'd, ſcolded at, threatned and beaten: Which conduct, in many caſes, has been of very hurtful conſequences. How contrary is this to the obligations we are under to walk in love one to another!</p>
               <p>There is one conſideration I would ſuggeſt to all that have the care of little children; i. e. what Jeſus Chriſt ſaid, "of ſuch is the kingdom of heaven," and in that remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able paſſage, <hi>Mark</hi> ix. 36. 37. "he took a child and ſet him in the midſt of them, and when he had taken him in his arms," (obſerve the bigneſs of the child, a child in the arms) "he ſaid unto them, whoſoever ſhall receive one of ſuch children, in my name, receiveth me, and whoſoever ſhall receive me, receiveth him that ſent me." Would we treat Jeſus Chriſt in the above manner were he upon earth! And will not the above paſſages warrant us to ſay that he is now on earth, in the leaſt of theſe his brethren; ſo that as ye did unto them ye did unto him; and on re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection on the above conduct, any of us that have been guilty, on recollecting what we have done when we thought no one ſaw us, may well be afraid, and ſay—ſurely God was in the place, and I knew it not.</p>
               <p>May the thought ever excite to an attention to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned exhortation, "Let all bitterneſs and wrath and anger and clamour and evil ſpeaking, be put away." Evil ſpeaking comes from a little member, but "'tis a fire, a world of iniquity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it ſets on fire the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Without attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, I ſhall juſt take notice of it as it diſcovers itſelf in profaneneſs, uncleanneſs, covetouſneſs, ſtealing and lying.</p>
               <p>To begin with profaneneſs. Can there be any thing more baſe, ungrateful and wicked, than to profane that worthy name, which is above every name, in which there is ſalvation, the juſt God and the Saviour, Emanuel, God with us. We know not God but as he is thus manifeſt: So there can be no ſpecies of profaning that name, but it includes in it the baſe ingratitude of profaning the Saviour. If the conſideration of his being their God, was uſed as an argument againſt profaneneſs with ancient Iſrael, as <hi>Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>us</hi> xix. 12. "neither ſhalt thou profane the name of thy God," certainly the grace manifeſted in the goſpel hath the ſame obligations in it; and opens up a ground of perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual praiſe and thankſgiving: And who of us are not at ſome times conſtrained to acknowledge it; and with our tongues to bleſs God, even the Father? Shall we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with curſe our follow-creatures, "that are made after the ſimilitude of God?" <hi>James</hi> iii. 9. Certainly theſe things ought not ſo to be; the grace of the goſpel teaches, by precept and example, "to bleſs them that curſe you, bleſs and curſe not, love your enemies; do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that deſpitefully uſe and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute you." Here we are warranted to make uſe of the Saviour's name, in praying for our enemies; he bids us, and ſets the example. How contrary the profane practice of calling on his name to damn thoſe we think injure or diſpleaſe us! It comes as evidently from the deſtroyer, our adverſary, the devil, as the above-mentioned precepts and examples come from the Saviour. Stop dear child! ſtop young man, over-heated with paſſion and reſentment, and hurried by temptation! ſtop one minute and conſider which you ought to follow: Hear the apoſtle, "Let all evil ſpeaking<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>be put away from you, with all malice."</p>
               <p>The next branch of evil ſpeaking I would take notice of, is uncleanneſs. If we conſider the warnings and cautions

given againſt it by the apoſtles of Chriſt,<note n="*" place="bottom">See <hi>Gallations</hi> v. 19 <hi>Ephaſians</hi> v. 3 to 6. <hi>Colloſians</hi> iii. 5. to 8 1ſt of <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> iv. 3. to 8. 1ſt of <hi>Peter.</hi> iv. 2. 3. And in the epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> the apoſtle ſays, "What, know ye not that your bodies are members of Chriſt; ſhall I then take the members of Chriſt, and make them the members of an harlot? GOD forbid. What I know ye not that he that is joined to an harlot is one body, for two ſhall be one fleſh; but he that is joined to the Lord is one ſpirit. Flee fornication: Every ſin that a man doth is without the body; but he that commiteth fornication, ſineth againſt his own body. What! know ye not that your body is the temple of the holy ghoſt in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own, for ye are bought with a price? Therefore glorify God in your body and in your ſpirit, which are God's." 1ſt of <hi>Corinthians,</hi> vi. 15. to the end.</note> we muſt ſee the propriety of our children's being warned to ſhun the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of this evil; to ſhun the ſpeeches, behaviour and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, that tends hereunto. What ſhameful ingratitude doth it diſcover, when we ſee our children, who are pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledged in their education ſo as to be able to write their thoughts legibly, defiling the fences, as they paſs the ſtreets, with ſhameful uncleanneſs! writing what they would at firſt be afraid to ſpeak, 'till their minds are hardened by writing, then reading and repeating, 'till they contract a habit of evil ſpeaking; which has a tendency, as they grow up, to lead after all uncleanneſs with greedineſs. I think I may tell them with truth, if they ſhould live two or three times twenty years after, it would not obliterate, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the ſhame that ſuch conduct muſt produce, upon the remembrance of ſuch follies; for old age has a lively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of what is done in youth, though it forgets later tranſactions; and the ſenſe of forgivneſs doth not take away the ground of ſhame, but increaſes it, agreeable to <hi>Ezekiel</hi> xvi. 63. "That thou mayſt remember and be aſhamed and confounded, and never open thy mouth any more becauſe of thy ſhame, when I am pacified towards thee for all that thou haſt done, ſaith the Lord God."—This I would cloſe with the advice of Divine wiſdom. <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs</hi> vii. 24. to 27. "Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth; let not thine heart decline to her ways; go not aſtray in her paths; for ſhe hath caſt down many wounded, yea, many ſtrong have been ſlain by her: Her houſe the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death."</p>

                  <pb n="52" facs="unknown:018214_0051_0FA5C1DDAA613288"/>
I might mention the ſcripture warnings and cautions againſt covetouſneſs, ſtealing and lying. Covetouſneſs in children diſcovers itſelf in a fretful uneaſineſs for what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to other children, prompting them to attain it by any means, if it can't be had, as they ſay, by fair means, and tempts them to ſteal, and then to lye to hide the crime. The ſtory of Achan is left on record for warning and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, which we have in <hi>Joſhua</hi> vii. particularly verſes 20 and 21, where Achan ſays, "Indeed I have ſinned againſt the LORD GOD of Iſrael, when I ſaw among the ſpoils a goodly Babyloniſh garment, and two hundred ſhekels of ſilver, and a wedge of gold, of fifty ſhekels weight, then I coveted them and took them, and behold them hid in the earth, in the midſt of my tent." &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Covetouſneſs is idolatry, it makes an idol of what it fixes on: Can there be any thing more baſe and diſinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious, when we conſider what God is to us, and hath done for us, than to prefer any thing our peviſh minds covet after, and in purſuit of it to diſobey him. The apoſtle ſpeaking to the Epheſians, who were in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure acquainted with what God in Chriſt was to them, and had done for them, ſays, chap. iv 28. "Let him that ſtole, ſteal no more, but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing that is good, as ſhewing a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent way of attaining what we need, and helping thoſe that may need help from us. And in the ſame chapter, he exhorts to put away lying, and ſpeak truth "every man to his neighbour," from this motive, "for we are members one of another;" therefore, in this view, we act as if we would deceive ourſelves, as if the eye ſhould pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely betray the feet into the mire.</p>
               <p>By what has been brought to view of the ingratitude and baſeneſs of ſome of the many works of the fleſh, ſomething is diſcoverable of the ſource from whence they proceed, and of the darkneſs, diſtreſs and miſery to which they tend: It may lead to the ſame reflections on all the works of the fleſh, which are brought to view by Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Matthew</hi> xv<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 19. 20. <hi>Mark</hi> vii. 21. 22. and by the apoſtle, <hi>Gallations</hi> v 19. 20. 21.

               <p>Thus, dear children, I have endeavoured to lead your minds to the grace revealed in the goſpel, and to the view of the obligations this grace lays upon us;—if you accept my attempt, and are hereby excited to turn over the pages of revelation and to attend to Jeſus Chriſt and his apoſtles, ſpeaking in them, I have all I wiſh for from you: I know I am not my own, and that every opportunity and talent I have, belongs to my Redeemer; therefore, ſo far as duty to him. and love to you hath excited me hereto, I have reaſon to be ſatisfied, whatever reception it hath. To his honor and glory, and your comfort and benefit it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted. To the only wiſe God our Saviour, glory and majeſty, dominion and power, both now and ever. AMEN.</p>

                     <hi>Note.</hi> In page 10th I mentioned, that both "he and ſhe are called the Lord our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs," referring to <hi>Jeremiah</hi> xxiii. 6. and xxxiii. 16. where we read, "In thoſe days ſhall Judah be ſaved and Jeruſalem ſhall dwell ſafely; and this is the name wherewith ſhe ſhall be called, The Lord our righteouſneſs." In the former tranſlation it is, "And he that ſhall call her, is the Lord our righteouſneſs;" referring to the glorious perſon by whom ſhe ſhould be called into that ſafe and happy ſtate. If our tranſlators meant to be thus underſtood, it did not appear clear in their manner of expreſſion,—which led me to underſtand it as ſpoken of the name of the church. I have therefore recited the paſſage as it ſtands in both tranſlations.</note>
