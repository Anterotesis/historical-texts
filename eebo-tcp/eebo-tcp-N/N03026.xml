            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>Preface.</head>
            <p>THE following Sermon being preach'd by my worthy Brother &amp; Collegue on occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Deceaſe of an <hi>honourable &amp; moſt valuable aged Perſon,</hi> whoſe excellent Conduct, both in private &amp; publick Life, thro' a long Series of Years, hath made him ſhine as an uncommon <hi>Light</hi> in this degenerate Age; I cannot but take a Pleaſure in the Hope, that as a laſting Honour will be done to the Name of our deceaſed Friend &amp; Father, ſo the Glory of GOD, the Credit of Religion, and the Benefit of Survivors will be promoted by the Publication of it; eſpecially in that a <hi>double</hi> Pattern is here exhibited, eminently amiable and reverend, and meriting univerſal Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p>The Words of the Text relating to the <hi>Scripture-Nathanael</hi> (who, it's probably tho't was the ſame with the Apoſtle <hi>Bartholomew</hi>) appear'd ſo juſtly applicable to our deceas'd <hi>Nathanael,</hi> as pointing out the particular Genius &amp; reigning Temper of his Soul, that they often occur'd to my Thoughts, when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with him in his Life; as they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately did to my Rev. Brother on his Death: and they certainly afforded a very proper Theme for a Funeral-Diſcourſe upon this Occaſion.</p>
            <p>I muſt acknowledge, Col. <hi>Byfield</hi>'s known ſuperior Worth loudly beſpake all the Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours to his Memory proper to come from the
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:003640_0004_100316ED071DC318"/>
ſacred Desk: and tho' ſome peculiar Reaſons have for theſe later Years very much reſtrain'd me from bringing <hi>Funeral-Characters</hi> into the Pulpit, and may perhaps influence me for the future to be very ſparing on this Head; yet I can hardly excuſe my ſelf, upon a cool Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, that I have in this particular extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Caſe ſo much indulg'd my Inclination to Silence on ſuch Occaſions. He himſelf (if I miſtake not) had an Averſion to pompous Deſcriptions in Funeral-Sermons: and it muſt be confeſs'd, they often carry too much the appearance of fulſome <hi>Panegyrick</hi>; adapted rather to diſplay the Powers of the Orator, than the Merits of the Subject. However, in the <hi>preſent Caſe,</hi> where ſuch a Variety of excellent <hi>Gifts</hi> &amp; Accompliſhments, where ſo conſpicuous a Pattern of real <hi>Sanctity,</hi> and ſo long a Run of publick <hi>Service &amp; Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> concur'd, to furniſh out a very lovely and illuſtrious Character; it might be thought, by ſuch as have a juſt ſenſe of his Value, a Wrong to the World, and an Injury to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as well as Injuſtice to the memory of the Deceas'd, if his Miniſters had forborn to drop a Tear over his Grave, and publickly recommend his Example. — I willingly now take this opportunity to join with my Brother in doing it.</p>
            <p>When I view the <hi>excellent and venerable Perſon,</hi> whoſe Death we are lamenting, and reflect on the ſeveral Parts of his genuine Character, he appears to me to have been very happy in rare Endowments both of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:003640_0005_100316F2721C9918"/>
and Grace, as well as ſingularly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd by many eminent Diſtinctions in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</p>
            <p>He is acknowledg'd to have poſſeſs'd a <hi>diſtinguiſh'd Furniture</hi> for the important Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces he was call'd to act in: and ſteadily conducted himſelf in them, as much I believe as any man, by the dictates of his <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and a well-weigh'd Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and he was uſually ſatisfy'd in his own deliberate Judgment: which ever preſerv'd to him a peaceful Breaſt.</p>
            <p>He had a Greatneſs of Soul, that made him ſcorn the mean Tricks of Craſt, deteſt the little arts of Flattery, and hate a Bribe.</p>
            <p>He was an admirer of Order &amp; Decorum, and a proper Regimen in all Things: A ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pattern of Sobriety &amp; ſtrict Virtue; of Induſtry; of punctual Veracity &amp; Honeſty; and of Liberality on various Occaſions, for which he kept himſelf prepar'd by conſtantly devoting a certain Proportion of his annual Increaſe to pious &amp; charitable Uſes. One inſtance in particular (for its noble nature) deſerves to be remembred; It is not long ſince he was at the Expence of an Impreſſion of the <hi>Aſſembly's Catechiſm,</hi> which (to the number of <hi>Ten Thouſand</hi>) he diſpers'd in the Country Towns, where they might be moſt needed.</p>
            <p>He was an Inſtance of <hi>early</hi> Piety: and his <hi>firſt Love</hi> continu'd &amp; viſibly grew thro the ſucceeding Coarſe of his long Life. He was a Man of Prayer, and much in <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:003640_0006_100316F60AADE6E8"/>
with GOD</hi>; which they may deride, that are unacquainted with it. He was a careful Redeemer of his Morning &amp; Evening<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Hours for Divine Contemplation &amp; Devotion in the Cloſet; a ſteady maintainer of good Oeconomy &amp; religious Duties in the Family; a conſtant and ſeaſonable Attender of the publick Worſhip; a conſcientious keeper of the Sabbath; a diligent Reader of the holy Bible; a wiſe obſerver of Divine Providence; a Promoter of ſerious &amp; profitable Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; a faithful Reprover of Sin; a ſervent Lover of Zion; a great Example of Patience and pious Fortitude under afflictive Trials, and always breathing the Faith and Hope and Humility of an improv'd Saint on a Sick Bed. — Having had his Converſation in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and being ſatisfy'd with Life, he deſir'd to depart and be with Chriſt: and at length finiſh'd his Courſe with Joy, triumphing in the near view and believing expectation of a bleſſed endleſs Futurity.</p>
            <p>It remains only to ask the Prayers of all the Friends of our <hi>Zion,</hi> that GOD would pour out his Spirit, and be the <hi>Repairer of the Breaches</hi> made upon us, in the Deaths of pious &amp; uſeful Perſons; and to recommend the following valuable Diſcourſe to the Divine Bleſſing, that it may be of uſe to all into whoſe bands it may come, to promote in them that <hi>Sincerity,</hi> which is here repreſented and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplified, and which will ſecure to them the Approbation of GOD in this World, and a glorious Reward in the next.<note place="bottom">Boſton, N.

            </epigraph>
            <p>IF we take a view of thoſe holy men of old, of whom we have an account in the inſpir'd writings, we ſhall find a great diverſity in their ſeveral characters. They are all repreſented as truly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent persons: yet they ſhine with a diff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering luſtre: ſome in a higher, and others in a lower degree of brightneſs; ſome in the glory
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:003640_0008_100316FB10BEC610"/>
of one virtue; and others in the glory of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other: according to the various turns of their natural temper and genius, and the gifts of almighty GOD diversely conferred on them.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>diſtinguiſhing</hi> glory of <hi>Nathanael,</hi> ſeems to have been his undiſguiſed, ſincerely open temper and conduct, both towards GOD and man. His character upon other accounts, no doubt, was conſiderable: but this being one of the moſt eminent &amp; obſervable ſtrokes in it, our SAVIOUR ſingles it out to be a ſtanding pattern, worthy of univerſal imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>NOTHING that I remember, is any were in the <hi>bible</hi> recorded of this <hi>Nathanael,</hi> ſave only the place where he liv'd<note n="*" place="bottom">Which appears to have been <hi>Cana</hi> in <hi>Galilee,</hi> ſee <hi>John 2I.2</hi>
               </note>; beſides what we find in the paſſage of hiſtory, of which my <hi>text</hi> is a part: upon which account, we are at a loſs to determine who he was; from what particular family he deſcended; what ſtation he fill'd, or civil figure he made in the world.</p>
            <p>ONE thing my <hi>context</hi> mentions worthy our remark; That at the time, when our SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR beſtow'd upon him this commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he was ſo far from being a <hi>believer</hi> in CHRIST, that he laboured of a very unhappy miſtake with relation to his <hi>Meſſiahſhip.</hi> For
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:003640_0009_100317027A655B28"/>
when <hi>Philip</hi> addreſt him in that language,<note n="†" place="bottom">Verſe 45</note> 
               <hi>we have found him of whom Moſes in the law, and prophets did write,</hi> JESUS OF NAZARETH: I ſay when he was thus addreſt, the common notion that then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd among the <hi>Jews,</hi> was the reply he had ready at hand, <hi>can there any good thing come out of Nazareth</hi>? This was certainly a very great and dangerous miſtake; and if <hi>Philip,</hi> who was himſelf convinced that JESUS was the CHRIST, had been of a warm temper, and inclined to harſh judgment, he might have cenſur'd him as one that had rejected CHRIST, and was void of all ſincerity &amp; real goodness. But if he had done thus, he would have been greatly to blame; for at that very time, our SAVIOUR, who knew the hearts of all men, pronounced him <hi>an Iſraelite indeed.</hi> He was ſatisfied the miſtake he was under, did not proceed from prevailing corruption; but want of light: the evidence of his <hi>Meſſiahſhip,</hi> having not yet been laid before him. He therefore allows him to be a real ſaint; and ſpeaks very honourably of him: which I take this notice of, to teach us moderation and charity; and reſtrain us from attributing any miſtakes or errors, whither of faith or practice, to the badneſs of men's hearts, which for all any thing we know, may be conſiſtent with ſincerity, and GOD's knowing them to be real ſaints. But to return.</p>

               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:003640_0010_1003170795A39CA0"/>MY <hi>text</hi> preſents us with a very fair and beautiful character: which may be depended on as an exact repreſentation; ſince it came from one of inſallable skill &amp; judgment. And there is this extraordinary circumſtance in it; Our SAVIOUR ſpake thus of <hi>Nathanael</hi> without any previous acquaintance; inſtantly upon the very firſt ſight of him. A ſure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of his being <hi>more than a man</hi>! And it probably had it's influence upon <hi>Nathanael</hi> in producing that confeſſion from him<note n="*" place="bottom">Verſe 49.</note>, <hi>Rabbi, thou art the ſon of God, thou art the king of Iſrael.</hi> He was ſenſible our SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR had no knowledge of him: and yet was conſcious to himſelf, he had given the exact portraiture of his ſoul. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore rightly argues upon it, <hi>thou art the ſon of God.</hi> And from this time he became a <hi>true Chriſtian,</hi> as before he was a <hi>real Saint.</hi>

            <p>TWO things are here ſaid of <hi>Nathanael,</hi> in which his character is ſumm'd up.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>I.</hi> THAT he was <hi>an Iſraelite indeed.</hi> And</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>II.</hi> AN Iſraelite indeed, <hi>in whom is no guile.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ACCORDINGLY there are the two beads, under which I ſhall with all poſſible brevity, open to you this character: which when I have done, I ſhall more largely apply it in the beſt manner I am able.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:003640_0011_1003170C424C2E38"/>
               <hi>I.</hi> HE was <hi>an Iſraelite indeed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THERE is a twofold application of the name <hi>Iſraelite.</hi> Tis ſometimes us'd to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie a natural defendant of <hi>Jacob,</hi> who was afterwards called <hi>Iſrael.</hi> So the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are frequently called <hi>Iſraelites</hi>: and the moſt common name for any one of the ſtock of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was that, an <hi>Iſraelite.</hi> And in this ſence, its likely <hi>Nathanael</hi> was an <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elite indeed.</hi> i. e. A true ſon, the genuine off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of <hi>Iſrael</hi>; as immediately proceeding from him by natural generation.</p>
            <p>But there is a far better and more excellent ſenſe of this word. It often ſtands to ſpecifie the <hi>ſpritual</hi> poſterity of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> i.e. his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by reſemblance, or participation of the ſame likeneſs of piety and goodneſs. Hence that of the Apoſtle<note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. 9.6.</note> 
               <hi>they are not all Iſrael, which are of Iſrael.</hi> He plainly diſtinguiſhes between <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and allows the appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in its <hi>ſpecial &amp; beſt</hi> ſenſe, only to thoſe, who like their father <hi>Iſrael,</hi> are the ſubjects of real holineſs.</p>
            <p>AND 'tis in this ſenſe <hi>Nathanael</hi> is here call'd <hi>an Iſrealite.</hi> And he is ſaid to be an Iſraelite <hi>indeed.</hi> The meaning of the phraſe put into literal engliſh is obviouſly this, that he was <hi>a real good man</hi>; a <hi>true Saint</hi> and <hi>faithful ſervant</hi> of the moſt high.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:003640_0012_10031672303B3E88"/>NOT that he was perfectly and indefec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively ſo. In ſuch a ſenſe, <hi>there is not a juſt man upon earth, that doth good and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not.</hi> He was therefore a <hi>man of like paſſions with others</hi>; had his faults and fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. But they were only the ſpots of GOD's children. He had notwithſtanding a prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing awe and reverence for the bleſſed GOD; an habitual love to virtue: and made it his careful endeavour to follow after it.</p>
            <p>HE had upon his mind a realiſing convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of future and inviſible things: and it had a governing influence upon his heart and life. He was afraid of ſin, and dare not <hi>knowingly</hi> allow himſelf in the commiſſion of it. And if thro' miſtake, or the prevailing ſtrength of corruption or temptation, he was at any time led aſide, we muſt ſuppoſe it only in here and there an inſtance: his general courſe being at the ſame time, in ſome good meaſure conformed to the great rule of duty.</p>
            <p>THE principles of grace were certainly predominant in his ſoul; the reigning bent of his mind on the ſide of virtue: and ſuch his manner of life, that he had the approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his conſcience for his rejoicing; and could addreſs the holy GOD in the language of <hi>Hezekiah</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Iſaiah 38.3.</note>, <hi>Remember O Lord, I beſeech thee, how I have walk'd before thee in truth,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:003640_0013_100316B34C6DBF58"/>
and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy ſight</hi>! Yet muſt we look upon him as deeply humbled and abaſed, when he conſider'd how far he had fallen ſhort of what might in ſtrictneſs have been exacted of him; and as having his hope not in himſelf, but the meer mercy of a moſt gracious GOD, thro' the <hi>promiſed Meſſiah and ſaviour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THUS was he a <hi>good man,</hi> a <hi>true Saint.</hi> And O how beautiful does he appear in this view! His greateſt glory was his being an <hi>Israelite indeed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>POSSIBLY he was cloathed with civil honour; poſſeſt large intellectual endowments and liv'd in flowing outward circumſtances: but 'twas his being a real holy man that ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd him far more great and noble: as he hereby reſembled the infinitely glorious GOD, was conformed to the Image of the lovely JESUS, and became a temple of the HOLY GHOST. And O the inconceivable advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of his being a ſaint of the moſt high! By this means he became the delight of his maker, an actual poſſeſſor of that divine loving kindneſs, which is better than even life itſelf, and an heir to all the great and invaluable promiſes of the ſure and well-ordered cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. — The great GOD was his GOD; his guide thro' life; his ſupport in death; and when his fleſh &amp; heart fail'd him his unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able friend and portion.</p>

               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:003640_0014_100316AA4BCB8418"/>BUT,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>II.</hi> HE was an Iſraelite indeed, <hi>in whom was no guile.</hi> An <hi>Iſraelite indeed</hi> was his <hi>general</hi> character, wherein he agreed with good men in common: but that more ſpecial glory of a good man, his being without guile, ſeems to have been that wherein he excell'd.</p>
            <p>HE was <hi>without guile,</hi> the phraſe muſt not be taken abſolutely: for in ſuch a ſenſe, it can be applied to none but the perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly holy JESUS, of whom 'tis teſtified, that <hi>he did no ſin, neither was guile found in his mouth.</hi> But the meaning of it is, that guile had not a predominant reigning influence over his heart or life: and not only ſo, but it may be expreſſive of the peculiar turn of his mind as open, plain and ſincere; without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, craft and hypocriſie: which natural tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per as ſanctified and improved by divine grace, he was enabled to exerciſe upon religious prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and views, and in an uncommon degree, both towards GOD and <hi>man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HE was <hi>without guile</hi> in regard of the <hi>bleſſed</hi> GOD. That is to ſay, he was a man of undiſſembled piety; a true worſhipper of the true GOD; ſincere in his profeſſion of religion, and in reality what he pretended to be. Deceit and hypocriſie were contrary to the very bent of his mind, and above all things abhorrent to him, as terminated upon the heart ſearching GOD. He did not take up religion
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:003640_0015_100316B65873C7E8"/>
as an outward form; he did not put it on for a cloak or diſguiſe; he did not practice it out of meer faſhion, to fall in with the cuſtom of the people among whom he liv'd: but he had a real regard for the honour of GOD, and was heartily concerned to recommend himſelf to the divine ſavour.</p>
            <p>HIS chief aim was not to make a ſplendid outward ſhew, to appear externally religious, while he was inwardly full of hypocriſy and iniquity: but he was one that ſincerely lov'd the day, the houſe and worſhip of GOD; and was a conſtant, diligent and exemplary attendant on it; and this we may ſuppoſe not only in publick, in the more open view of men; but more privately in his family, ſtatedly ſerving the LORD with his houſehold; and ſecretly in his cloſet, when he had no witneſſ but GOD and his own ſoul.</p>
            <p>NOR did he ſatisfie himſelf with meer outward expreſſions of piety and devotion. He was chiefly concerned about the inward frame of his mind; and accordingly was one who: heartily lov'd and fear'd GOD: His truſt in him; his belief of him; his dependance upon him; his reſignation and ſubmiſſion to him, were all unaffected and without diſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</p>
            <p>THUS was he a man of <hi>real</hi> piety; without diſguiſe or deceit; of no prevailing <hi>guile</hi> reſpecting his <hi>maker.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:003640_0016_100316B9683D3948"/>HE was alſo <hi>without guile</hi> in regard of <hi>man.</hi> By which we are to underſtand "<hi>The ſingleneſs of his heart, diſcovering itſelf in a conſtant plainneſs and honeſt openneſs of ſpeech and behaviour</hi>".</p>
            <p>DECEIT and flattery were an abomination to him. He dealt not in empty compliments; meer pretences of love and friendſhip, cheating thoſe he converted with, with a ſhew of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, when he realy intended none towards him; but his profeſſions in this kind were ſincere, and might with ſafety be depended upon. He was not an enemy in his heart; yet a fawning, deceitfull flatterer with his tongue: and what is not ſo very common, it might be known by his words and actions, whom he vallued, when he was a friend, and to how great a degree</p>
            <p>He was not given to craft; and made no use of little tricks &amp; fetches, to deceive others, and lead them into a wrong judgment of him. He form'd no deſign he took pains to miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; he engaged in no affair, he made uſe of ſecret managements to conceal, or deceitful diſguiſes to put a good gloſs upon: but his actions were plain and above board; his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct without intreigue, and thoſe winding cunning devices, that often render men's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour obſcure and unintelligable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:003640_0017_100316BB068CC200"/>HE was an implacable enemy to all lying, equivocating, and craſtily impoſing either up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the credulity or weakneſs of others, to the miſleading or abuſing them; was true to his promiſe, punctual to his engagements; and in one word, never liv'd under diſguiſe; never walk't in an empty ſhew, making a falſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of what he was not: but realy was what he pretended to be; did what he profeſs'd to do; and conſtantly took care to make his words and actions, and their true meaning, keep peace with each other.</p>
            <p>AND if from the freedom and openneſs of his temper, he ſometimes diſcloſed thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions <hi>craft</hi> might have concealed: or did thoſe things in the open light, <hi>cunning</hi> might have kept hid from the view of men; he herein acted like a ſincerely fair, and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted man: which is infinitely better in it<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelf, as well as more honorary to him, than if he had managed with <hi>that ſort of policy,</hi> which is evidently a fruit of darkneſs.</p>
            <p>ALL which if put together, how charming is the character? how lovely and beautifull the poſſeſſor of it? and who can forbear ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? he was <hi>ſo far one of the excellent ones of the earth.</hi>
            </p>

            <p n="2">
               <hi>II.</hi> TO make ſome <hi>application</hi> of <hi>this character,</hi> in <hi>two words,</hi> for our own uſe and benefit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:003640_0018_100316C0C584A8A0"/>AND,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>I.</hi> I may with propriety, take occaſion herefrom, to <hi>adviſe</hi> and <hi>admoniſh</hi> thoſe who are <hi>wanting</hi> in the <hi>great point of ſincerity towards GOD and man.</hi> And this, not only becauſe they are herein unlike <hi>Nathanael</hi> in that very thing, for which he is chiefly commended by our SAVIOUR; but becauſe of the infinite importance of freedom from guile: it's abſolute neceſſity in order to ſolid comfort here, and compleat bleſſedneſs in the future ſtate and world.</p>
            <p n="1">I. I may reaſon a little with thoſe who are wanting in the <hi>great point of ſincerity towards GOD.</hi> And may it not be juſtly feared, this is the caſe of many? And perhaps there are thoſe, who are ſo evidently leavened with guile reſpecting their maker, that they have no need of much time or pains, in order to ſatisfie themſelves tis ſo; but can at once determine againſt themſelves. They appear, it may be, in the habit of religious perſons; they outwardly live as righteous men; they are exact and punctual in their regard to the externals of duty; attend the worſhip, and obſerve the inſtitutions of the LORD JESUS; and this with external ſigns of devotion, reverence and affection: but yet, their own conſciences aſſure them, tis all form and complement; meer ſhew &amp; lifeleſs appearance. They know they have no real value for the honour of GOD; but their view is to recommend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:003640_0019_100316C545B26F60"/>
to men: they have no deſign to ſerve their maker, but uſe religion as a cloak to ſerve themſelves.</p>
            <p>TO ſuch I can't help ſaying,</p>
            <p>O conſider! ſeriouſly conſider the dreadful ſolly of thus treating the infinitely holy GOD! <hi>He ſeeth not as man ſeeth! but his eyes are like a flame of fire,</hi> piercing into the inmoſt receſſes of the heart: nor is there a thought there, but lo! he knoweth it altogether. — Our very ſouls are as viſible to him, as our bodies; — and he conſtantly views them, and is perfectly acquainted with their moſt inward frame and temper; with all their views and purpoſes, their motions &amp; tendencies. That's the ſtile in which the glorious GOD is ſpoken of in the ſcriptures, <hi>the LORD ſearcheth all hearts</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">I Chron. 28.9.</note>. Yea, he himſelf ſpeaks of an <hi>inſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> into <hi>humane hearts,</hi> as a glory that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhingly belongs to him, <hi>I the LORD ſearch the heart, I try the reins</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Jer. I7.I0.</note>. What ſtupidity then is it to pleaſe ourſelves with the thought of cheating our <hi>Maker</hi> with guile and hypocriſy? Surely our GOD is not a man that we can impoſe upon him! We are all open and naked before him, and let the mask we have on be what it will, he nevertheleſs beholds us as we really are. And while we are flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him with our lips, or deceiving him with
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:003640_0020_100316C6E77A3768"/>
a falſe ſhew, ſhou'd not the thought, that he has ſecret caſement into our breaſt, through which every thing appears in its true light, dreadfully ſhock and abaſe us? If we would allow our ſelves only to realiſe this, hypocriſy would appear the height of folly; and of all Perſons we ſhou'd be the moſt aſhamed of ourſelves, and cover'd with confuſion, when we have dealt deceitfully with GOD.</p>
            <p>BUT it may be our aim is, to gain a repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation among men, for our piety and devotion: <hi>all our works we do, for to be ſeen of men</hi>; to be applauded and commended by them. But ſuppoſe we ſhou'd compaſs this deſign; what is it more than pleaſing our ſelves with vanity, if we are gratified with others ſpeaking well of us, while at the ſame time we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious to our ſelves, 'tis beſide what we deſerve. Others applauding our piety can't alter our real character: we ſhall notwithſtanding re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main the ſame perſons. And if when we are commended for our ſincerity, we know in our own hearts that we are full of hypocriſy and guile, what have we to value our ſelves for? And inſtead of being pleaſed, have we not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther infinite reaſon for bluſhing, to think of our having mock'd GOD, to impoſe upon men?</p>
            <p>AND the folly we are chargeable with, is exceedingly aggravated, if we conſider the pains we muſt be at, to obtain this end, which
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:003640_0021_100316CA23796FA8"/>
has really nothing of worth in it. We muſt do every thing, at leaſt in appearance, which a good man does; muſt attend the worſhip and ordinances of the goſpel; muſt ſhow re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the day and houſe of GOD; muſt be exact in the performance of all the external duties of religion: and not only ſo, but muſt have a conſtant guard upon ourſelves, leſt we let drop our mask &amp; diſcover our hypocriſy. And in the doing of this, what pains muſt we be at? perhaps much greater than need be uſed by men of real ſincerity: for they are prompted to all they do, from a principle of love to GOD and his ſervice; which makes every thing natural, and ſo eaſie and pleaſant. Whereas what we do being counterfeit, every thing is a burden; and we muſt be in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual uſe of caution, or our guile will diſcloſe itſelf.</p>
            <p>NOW what greater argument of folly, than our putting our ſelves to ſo much pains and trouble, to ſo little purpoſe? eſpecially if it be added, that the ſame pains if rightly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged, would in all probability, turn to our unſpeakable advantage; the eternal ſalvation of our ſouls. For 'tis a moſt certain truth, that a perſon would be under the moſt hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full proſpect of getting to heaven, if he took as much pains for it, as ſome men do to make a meer ſhew of being religious.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:003640_0022_100316CECAFE8B70"/>BUT if nothing elſe will, O let the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable end of hypocriſy convince us of it's folly! No ſin is more odious in the ſight of a holy GOD; nor will any one receive a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier doom; a more ſevere puniſhment. Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites are the perſons whoſe portion it will be ſo <hi>to dwell with devouring fire, to dwell with everlaſting burnings</hi>

            <p>O conſider this, ye that uſe deceit with your maker in the great buſineſs of religion! Let deſtruction from his preſence be a terrour to you. — Deceive not your ſelves, GOD won't be mocked. — If you go on carrying it towards him with guile, <hi>this ſhall ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of his hand, ye ſhall lie down in ſorrow.</hi> Ye ſhall have no hope, when <hi>GOD taketh away</hi> your <hi>ſoul</hi>: neither will <hi>GOD hear, when trouble cometh upon you.</hi> Yea <hi>though</hi> your <hi>excellency mount up to the heavens, and</hi>

            <p n="2">2. SUCH alſo may be admoniſhed, who are wanting in the neceſſary duty of <hi>ſincerity towards man.</hi> Alas! that this is ſo common a fault in this day of prevailing guile. 'Tis juſt matter of complaint, "that ſincerity and plainneſs are almoſt out of faſhion; and that the greateſt part of the converſation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and of their intercourſe with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is little elſe but driving a trade of diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation". How common are the ſins of flattery and deceit; diſcovered in the moſt laviſh pretenſions to love, and friendſhip, and a diſtinguiſhing reſpect, when there is little or nothing in the heart to anſwer the true intent of our words; inſomuch that "our language is running into a lie, the uſe of ſpeech almoſt perverted, and words made to ſignifie noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing". What tricking is made uſe of? what crafty, underhand, fly, inſinuating manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in our trade and commerce with each other? And how often is there a contradiction between our hearts and tongues in our engagements to one another? How many allow themſelves in making promiſes, they have no intention to perform? and that they forget as ſoon as they have made?</p>
            <p>BUT certainly tis a vile ſhame it ſhould be thus. Let us remember; the GOD that made us, and to whom we are accountable, is
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:003640_0024_100305429D3B17E0"/>
a GOD of truth. He never made uſe of guile towards his creatures, in any of his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with them, or declarations to them: but has always been plain and open; treating us with perfect ſincerity, an abſolute freedom from deceit. And as we are herein capable, in ſome good meaſure, of imitating the copy he has ſet us; ſo tis his expectation that we do ſo. And 'twill be an eternal reproach to us, if we are unlike him, practiſing diſſimulation, falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and guile. Nor in this caſe, may we call ourſelves his children. For thoſe that are <hi>born again, not of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of GOD</hi>; are his children by reſemblance of him, in this moral part of his glory. And 'tis a ſad mark of our being the children of another father, even the father of guile and deceit, if this wicked diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of his rule in us; and we make it our practice to act contrary to the great law of integrity, in our treatment of one another.</p>
            <p>AND as we call our ſelves <hi>chriſtians,</hi> how ill does it become us to allow our ſelves in the exerciſe of deceit and guile? to flatter and cajole? and make uſe of the baſe arts of fraud and cunning in our dealings with each other? how contrary is this, to the temper and conduct of the <hi>ſincere Jeſus, in whoſe mouth was no guile.</hi> And with what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriety, in this caſe are we called after his name, and denominated his diſciples?</p>

               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:003640_0025_100316D372936B10"/>IN fine, the ſcriptures frequently mention this ſin of guile towards men, and diſcourage the practice of it. — A ſpecial mark is ſet upon it, as a ſin abominated by GOD. <hi>The LORD will abhor the deceitfull man</hi>

Pſal. 52.2, 4, 5. <hi>Thy tongue deviſeth miſchiefs, like a ſharp raſour, working deceitfully. — Thou loveſt all devouring words, O thou deceitful tongue.

               <hi>and root thee out of the land of the living.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT 'tis time I now proceed,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>II.</hi> TO <hi>call upon us all</hi> to ſee to it, that we be <hi>men of ſincerity; free from guile,</hi> both towards GOD and <hi>Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. LET us be <hi>ſincere towards GOD</hi>: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king conſcience of keeping our ſelves, as much as poſſible, free from that diſſembling with the Almighty; which is ſo common in the world; and what we are all prone to, and apt to make too light of.</p>
            <p>In order whereto,</p>
            <p>LET us beware of taking more pains to <hi>ſeem</hi> to be religious, then to be <hi>really</hi> ſo. Thus tis with the Hypocrite. His concern is not ſo much to be truly <hi>godly,</hi> as to <hi>appear</hi> to be ſo: and therefore his pains in religion are chiefly calculated to this end; which if he can but obtain, he deſires nothing more. But let us on the contrary, as we would approve ourſelves men of ſincerity, be concerned to be in truth pious towards GOD, and not meerly to make others think we are. Let us be careful to keep iniquity out of our hearts, as well as to hide it from the view of men. And let our pains in religion be chiefly intended, to pleaſe GOD and recommend our<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:003640_0027_10031678C7749D78"/>
to his favour, and not terminate in gaining credit among our fellow creatures —.</p>
            <p>ALSO, let us take heed of minding <hi>only</hi> the <hi>outſide</hi> of duty, not regarding our <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſenſe</hi> and <hi>feeling</hi> in the performance of it. The man of guile concerns himſelf only with the externals of piety, not at all regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his heart. He worſhips GOD outwardly, but has no inward reverence or eſteem for him. If the duty be but done, no matter how, or in what manner. Let us therefore, if we would have upon ourſelves the ſymptoms of ſincerity, regard our hearts, as well as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal performance of duty. Let us, when we engage in the outward part of religion, take care that our ſouls be ſutably affected; and not make it a matter of meer form and ceremony. Let us inwardly honour GOD, when we outwardly worſhip him, not ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our hearts to be remov'd far away from him. And let it be our great concern, when we pray to GOD, or do any other duty more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately relating to him, to experience with in ourſelves the workings of love, fear, hope, faith or joy; not contenting ourſelves, unleſs we have ſome motion of ſoul towards him.</p>
            <p>MOREOVER, let us beware of reſtraining ourſelves, in the obſervance of the duties of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to thoſe only that are to be performed before others. This is the way of the Hypocrite: He limits his regards to thoſe obſervances that
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:003640_0028_1003167BC3C0E060"/>
may be ſeen of men; neglecting thoſe that are ſecret, and to be perform'd only between GOD and his own ſoul. But let us as an evidence of our ſincerity, extend our care to the whole of duty; obſerving thoſe parts of it that are ſecret, as well as thoſe that are more open. Let us do the duties of the cloſet, as well as thoſe of the family, and houſe of GOD; and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally make conſcience of thoſe performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that are hid from men, as well as thoſe that are moſt within their view.</p>
            <p>IN fine, let us take heed of being govern'd in our piety; by carnal views and motives; making uſe of religion like the hypocrite, as a cloak for our coveteouſneſs, or ſome how or other, baſely to ſerve our ſelves: But let us engage in it upon ſutable motives; an inward feeling of the beauty and lovelineſs of it; — a real regard for the honour of GOD;—an over-powering ſenſe of the divine authority, and the inviolable bonds of love and gratitude, we are under to GOD and the Redeemer. — And let our aims be true goſpel ones. Let us have a view to our ſelves, <hi>i.e.</hi> our own trueſt intereſt, the future glorious recompence of reward. — But above all, let us eye the glory of GOD; making that the ruling ultimate end of all that we do in religion.</p>
            <p>THUS let us be ſincere with GOD. Tis what he really deſires at our hands. Pſal. 5I.6. <hi>Thou deſireſt truth in the inward parts.</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:003640_0029_10031680B02C7178"/>
Tis what he highly approves of, and will be peculiarly well pleaſed with. I Cron. 29.I7. <hi>Thou trieſt the heart, and haſt pleaſure in uprightneſs.</hi> Yea, tis what he peremptorily requires, and inſiſts upon, and won't be turn'd off without. Joſhua 22.5. <hi>But take dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent heed — to ſerve him</hi> (the LORD) <hi>with all your heart, and with all your ſoul.</hi> And in one word, tis the very life and ſoul of all religion; a fundamental diſpoſition, that muſt run thro' all the ſervice we do for GOD: nor elſe ſhall we be accepted of him, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded by him. Pſal. I5.I, 2. LORD, <hi>Who ſhall abide in thy tabernacle? Who ſhall dwell in thy holy hill? He that walketh uprightly; he that ſpeaketh the truth from his heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. LET us be without <hi>guile in regard of men</hi>; ſtrictly keeping ourſelves within the bounds of undiſguiſed plainneſs. Let it be our care to put on ſimplicity and uprightneſs. Let us be men of truth; of an unfeigned heart and open conduct. And at all times let us be ſincere in our profeſſions; without fraud or cunning in our dealings: upon all cccaſions diſcovering a true generous openneſs of nature, and integrity of diſpoſition.</p>
            <p>NOTHING will render us more lovely and beautiful. The man that is fair &amp; open; of downright plain ſincerity, both in word and action; How deſirable is his character? How
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:003640_0030_100316AD81D6EAB0"/>
honourable his name? Who better belov'd? Who more generally eſteem'd?</p>
            <p>NOR will any thing more tend to our preſent benefit, than the conſtant practice of ſincerity. Craft may ſerve a preſent turn; but as the wiſe man obſerves, <hi>a lying tongue is but for a moment</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Prov. 12.19.</note>. Perſons are ſeldom able to practice deceit long without a diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very: and then they at once forfeit their reputation, to their laſting diſadvantage. This may be one thing implied in thoſe <hi>proverbs</hi> of <hi>Solomon, Bread of deceit is ſweet to a man, but afterwards his mouth ſhall be filled with gravel</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Prov. 20.17</note>. <hi>A flattering tongue work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ruin</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">ibid 26.28.</note>. Whereas no one need fear any inconvenience by the practice of ſincerity. For the more a man diſcovers of un up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right heart, in a conſtant courſe of plain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſguiſed dealing, the more ready are the world to place their dependnace on him, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt their affairs in his hands: nor is any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon under better circumſtances to promote his own intereſt. Upon which account, a great man very pertinently expreſſes himſelf <note n="‖" place="bottom">Dr Tillorſon, Vol. 2 pag. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </note>, <q>I have often tho't that GOD hath in great wiſdom hid from men of falſe and diſhoneſt minds, the wonderful advantages of truth and integrity, to the proſperity even of our worldly affairs! Theſe men are ſo blinded
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:003640_0031_10031685C177B798"/>
by their coveteouſneſs and ambition, that they cannot look beyond a preſent advant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, nor forbear to ſeize upon it, tho' by ways never ſo indirect; they cannot ſee ſo far as to the remote conſequences of a ſteady integrity, and the vaſt benefit and advant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, it will bring a man at laſt. Were but this sort of men wiſe and clear-ſighted enough to diſcern this, they would be honeſt out of very knavery, not out of any love to honeſty or virtue, but with a craſty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to promote and advance more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally their own intereſts: and therefore the juſtice of divine providence hath hid this trueſt point of wiſdom from their eyes, that bad men might not be upon equal terms with the juſt and upright, and ſerve their a own wicked deſigns by lawfull and honeſt means.</q>
            </p>
            <p>MOREOVER, ſincerity is of eaſie practice- <q>It is always conſistent with itſelf, and needs nothing to help it out: it is always near at hand, and ſits upon our lips, and is ready to drop out before we are aware.</q> There is no trouble in the exerciſe of it. — It needs no contrivance, no pains to diſguiſe or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal it. — We have nothing to do, but to act according to the real ſentiments of our minds.—</p>
            <p>IN fine, the conſtant practice of this virtue will give us boldneſs before the SON of MAN,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:003640_0032_10031687467FD180"/>
in that <hi>day,</hi> when every diſguiſe ſhall be plucked off, and every man appear juſt as he is: when <hi>the ſecrets of men ſhall be judged; and GOD will bring every work into judgment, and every ſecret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOTHING now remains, but to take ſome proper notice of the occaſion, of my bringing you ſuch a diſcourſe at this time: the <hi>Death</hi> of that <hi>Aged</hi> and <hi>Honourable</hi> perſon, whoſe <hi>Funeral,</hi> we were, the laſt week, called to attend.</p>
            <p>IT would be a great incongruity, juſt after a ſolemn diſcourſe againſt guile and inſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, if I ſhou'd allow myſelf, in ſaying any thing, either to flatter the dead, or deceive the living: and I think, I ſo far know myſelf, as to be aſſur'd, while thus ſtanding in the preſence of a holy GOD, I dare not attempt a repreſentation, I had reaſon to believe was not true and faithfull.</p>
            <p>I do not ſpeak of him, as free from infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities. For who among men can pretend to be without fault? <hi>If thou, O LORD ſhould'ſt mark iniquities: O Lord, who ſhall ſtand</hi>? The very beſt of us have reaſon, to make that acknowledgment, <hi>Who can underſtand his errors</hi>? And to breath out the following prayer, <hi>Cleanſe thou me from ſecret faults.</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:003640_0033_1003168CED09FFB0"/>
YET I may with all freedom ſay, He was <hi>an Iſraelite indeed</hi>; <hi>a good Man, a real Chriſtian.</hi> Nor will it be denied, that freedom from <hi>guile</hi> was one thing, for which he was diſtinguiſhed In regard of the bleſſed GOD, his <hi>piety</hi> was undiſſembled: which he diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in a flaming zeal for his honour; a conſtant exemplary regard to his worſhip both in the <hi>cloſet,</hi> the <hi>family,</hi> and the place of GOD's preſence: where he ſet a good pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of unaffected devotion, in his obſervance of <hi>all</hi> the inſtitutions of the LORD JESUS. And in regard of <hi>men,</hi> few had their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation more free, from that winding of the ſerpent; that flattery and deceit; that craft, ſhuffling and double dealing, that is ſo common among men. — But I have no need to inſiſt here, not doubting, your tho'ts were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>our</hi> NATHANAEL, while I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting the <hi>character</hi> in the <hi>text</hi>: the application was so easie and obvious; and I would hope, unexceptionable: having carefully avoided ſaying any thing, but what I tho't in juſtice belonged to him.</p>
            <p>BUT tho' his open temper, and ſincerely plain and undiſguiſed manner of life, was that wherein he excelled: yet were there other things in him, which ought not to be paſſed over in ſilence.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Father of Sprits</hi> was pleaſed to form within him a ſoul, much beyond the
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:003640_0034_1003168E6FA203F8"/>
common ſize: furniſh'd with large capacities; a good underſtanding, a quick apprehenſion, a ſolid judgment: all which being join'd with a happy turn of mind, well fitted him for the many poſts of honour, heaven deſign'd him for, and he was afterwards, in the ſeveral periods of his life, fixed in.</p>
            <p>HE was of an extraordinary active, vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſpirit; and of ſuch great natural courage that he never fear'd taking upon him, any ſervice, he was call'd to in providence: and ſuch was the firmneſs of his mind, that no man could better bare up under difficulties and diſcouragements. They ſcarce made any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon him; till they came to lie ſo heavy, as to ſink the ſpirits of moſt other men.</p>
            <p>HE was well form'd for government: his ſpeech, his behaviour, his very looks; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally as joyn'd with a happy talent of turning them this way, were adapted to command re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and reverence. He had himſelf a great veneration for authority, and a ſtrong diſpoſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to promote the ſame in others: was a lover of good order; in maintaining of which, his zeal and care were particularly commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, in the OEconomy of his family: where every thing was managed with the niceſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs; every one moving in a known ſphere, with a becoming decency and regularity: more eſpecially in that part of his life, when
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:003640_0035_100316980D489AB0"/>
his buſineſs requir'd a numerous train of ſervants.</p>
            <p>He was one of good elocution: could ſpeak well; with propriety and fluency. And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps few, on a ſudden, could expreſs themſelves with more pertinency; greater freedom, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection or clearneſs.</p>
            <p>HE was of a catholick ſpirit: not confin'd in his charity within the limits of a party; but heartily lov'd and honour'd all good men, however differing from him in matters of leſs importance. He greatly deſired the eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment of theſe churches, and their abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the fruits of righteouſneſs; as being of their profeſs'd principles, and preferring their manner of worſhip: yet was he far from placing religion in any <hi>particular form,</hi> either of <hi>worſhip</hi> or <hi>diſcipline</hi>; believing with the great Apoſtle, that <hi>the kingdom of GOD is not meat and drink; but righteouſneſs and peace, and joy in the</hi> HOLY GHOST.</p>
            <p>HE was upon principle, a man of charity; had ſeriouſly weighed the obligations to this duty, and the proper meaſure in which it ought to be exerciſed: and according to his beſt judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had form'd a <hi>rule</hi> to himſelf, which for <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years,</hi> he inviolably kept to: conſtantly paying (for that was the phraſe he was wont to uſe) ſuch a proportion out of his eſtate; which whatever it was ordinarily, it once hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, within <hi>my knowledge,</hi> in the courſe of
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:003640_0036_1003169AC559FEC0"/>
one year, to amount to ſome hundreds of pounds: with which, together with his other diſtributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he often times refreſh'd both the souls and bodies of many, that were in want. 'Twas his principle to do what he did, this way, in the time of his life; and therefore if he has not by his laſt will, made many charitable donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he herein only acted according to his known ſettled Judgment.</p>
            <p>HE had upon his mind an uncommon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of the reality of inviſible things, and a future ſtate. Nor did I ever ſee the man, that was more free from the remains of unbelief; that had a more uniform, ſteady and unſhaken faith, in the <hi>Goſpel Revelation.</hi> He never ſeem'd to waver or doubt; but was poſſeſt of a conſtant, firm belief of the things of GOD and another world. And he had the comfort of it, in the various changes and paſſages of his life; but eſpecially at the time of his death: in the view of which, he was under no manner of fear; but ſeem'd perfectly reſign'd to his Maker: free and willing, at GOD's call, to go away into eternity. And the teſtimony of a good conſcience, was what ſupported him; a lively hope in the mercy of GOD, thro' a glorious Redeemer: And in the ſtrong exerciſe of this hope and faith, his <hi>body</hi> fell <hi>aſleep in</hi> JESUS, while his <hi>ſpirit,</hi> we truſt, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd to <hi>the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE now heartily joyn, in lifting up our prayer to the GOD who dwelleth in the
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:003640_0037_1003169C47E2D450"/>
heavens, that ſhowers of divine bleſſings may deſcend upon the <hi>children's children</hi>! —And may you ſincerely chuſe your <hi>father's</hi> and <hi>grand-father's</hi> GOD, for your GOD! So will he be your never-failing friend &amp; all-ſufficient portion. —</p>
            <p>AND may the breaches which a righteous GOD is making in this church of our LORD JESUS, whereby he is thinning our glory, and weakening our ſtrength, be happily repair'd! And let there be no reaſon for that complaint, <hi>the righteous periſheth, and no man layeth it to heart.</hi>—</p>
            <p>AND as our aged venerable fathers go off the ſtage, O holy LORD GOD, <hi>pour out thy ſpirit from on high,</hi> upon the <hi>Sons</hi> of NEW-ENGLAND, that they may be qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified to adorn and fill up their places! — that we may have <hi>our Judges as at the firſt,</hi> and <hi>our Councillors as at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning</hi>; all our <hi>Officers peace,</hi> and <hi>our Exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors righteouſneſs.</hi>—</p>
            <p>O revive thy work in the midſt of theſe declining years! that we may do that which is right in the ſight of the <hi>LORD,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to all that our fathers have done before us. — <hi>Let us yet remain</hi> thy people! — <hi>So ſhall</hi> glory dwell in our land.</p>
