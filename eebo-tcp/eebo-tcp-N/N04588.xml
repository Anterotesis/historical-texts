            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>MY Brethren, ſeeing the Soul is the great Seat of Principles and Source of Action, it follows neceſſarily from thence, that the chief Points of Practical Religion are theſe two, namely, <hi>Firſt,</hi> to uſe all proper Means to get it right ſet or fixed upon ſuitable Objects, and then to keep it ſo againſt all Temptations to the contrary. Attempts to regulate the Speech and Life, are like to be but of little Service, while in the mean Time the Thoughts and Tendencies of the Soul are neglected, and ſuffered to run at random without Notice and controul, like a Veſſel a-drift without a Compaſs or Helm, wandering wherever the Winds or Waves carry her: For when the Soul is neglected, the bad Temper here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by contracted, muſt needs have a corrupt
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:005699_0003_1026C636CB09DDE0"/>
Influence upon the whole Behaviour, of which it is the Parent.</p>
            <p>As we cannot be truly religious at all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til our Souls be thoroughly renewed by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Influence; ſo we cannot make Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in Religion unleſs we keep a ſtrict Guard over their Temper and Motions.</p>
            <p>All outward Services before the Heart is changed, is like a Building without a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, (eſpecially when depended on,) and all care and pains to regulate the Speech and Practice afterwards, while the Heart is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected, are like endeavours to regulate a Watch, by obſerving or trying to alter the Motions of the Wheels, while the Main-Spring is not touched, in which the chief Fault lies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moſes</hi> therefore with great Reaſon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to this Duty, in the Words of our Text, and enforces his Entreaty by a weighty Argument; <hi>only take heed to thy ſelf, and keep thy Soul diligently: i. e.</hi> particularly, eſpecially and above all, be careful and diligent in the uſe of all proper Means to keep thy Soul from Sin; the Soul being the principal and moſt noble Part of Man, may be juſtly called himſelf; and he
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:005699_0004_1026C63885AB9578"/>
that keeps it takes heed to himſelf to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and only he. Here it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, That this Duty is recommended in our Text in the ſingular Number, that ſo every Perſon may be the rather induced to apply it to himſelf, as if it were directed to him particularly by name; and hence we may infer, That the more cloſe and diſtinct pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick Diſcourſes are, they better they are like to anſwer their Deſign, for generals do not ſtrike.</p>
            <p>Now the Argument that inſpired <hi>Moſes</hi> offers to preſs the preceeding Duty is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That unleſs the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed it, they would forget the Mercies and Judgments of God, and looſe the Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of them; <hi>leaſt thou forget the Things which thine Eyes have ſeen, and leaſt they depart from thy Heart. Moſes</hi> here refers to the manifold Appearances of divine Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Mercy, which the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had beheld in their Deliverances from <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> Oppreſſors, and all the other Enemies which laboured to obſtruct their Paſſage in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the promiſed <hi>Canaan,</hi> as well as the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plays of divine Glory and Goodneſs at <hi>Horeb;</hi> and likewiſe the Judgments of God inflicted
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:005699_0005_1026C63C6A93A498"/>
on impenitent Tranſgreſſors among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Now the Remembrance and Senſe of theſe Things, tended to encreaſe their Love to God and fear of him and incite Obedience to his Laws; which were but juſt returns of Gratitude for the invaluable Benefits they had received, and of the laſt Neceſſity to ſecure their higheſt Honour and their deareſt Intereſts, both in this Life and that to come. But the contrary thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> Forgetfulneſs and Stupidity, ſerved to prepare the Way for their Sin and Ruin!</p>
            <p>By the Word <hi>Soul</hi> in our Text, is intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that ſpiritual and immortal Subſtance endowed with Underſtanding and Will; which it has pleaſed the great Creator to confer upon Man, by which he is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from, and advanced above the Brute-Creation. This is frequently called the <hi>Heart</hi> in Scripture, <note n="*" place="bottom">Prov. xxiii. 26. Matt. xxii. 37.</note> to ſignify that it is the chief and moſt noble Part of Man, the Source of Life and ſpring of Action. The Terms Soul and Heart are doubtleſs ſynony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous (or of the ſame import) in our Text, as appears by comparing both Parts thereof together.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:005699_0006_1026C63DF0277BF0"/>In Diſcourſing upon this Subject I ſhall endeavour to ſhew what is <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> by, and <hi>imply'd</hi> in keeping the Soul diligently, and then proceed to the Improvement.</p>
            <p>And, <hi>Firſt: Keeping the Soul,</hi> ſuppoſes the <hi>good State</hi> and <hi>Frame of it,</hi> for what is not good cannot be kept ſo.</p>
            <p>The Soul of Man indeed at his firſt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was adorn'd with the divine Image, which conſiſted in Knowledge, Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Holineſs, with Dominion over the Creatures. The Mind was furniſh'd with divine Light, and the Will and Affections with pious Propenſities: Neither was their any vicious Taint in any of the Faculties to mar their religious Tendencies.</p>
            <p>But when our firſt Parents violated the Covenant of Works, their primitive Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was entirely loſt; a univerſal Diſorder ſeiz'd the human Soul, and corrupted all its Powers; Darkneſs poſſeſs'd the Mind, and a complicated Depravity the Will and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections: So that their natural and general Byaſs is towards Sin and Vanity!</p>
            <p>And hence a Renovation of them, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration to ſome Degree of that moral Image
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:005699_0007_1026C644860171F0"/>
of God, which they have loſt becomes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in order to communion with God here, and the enjoyment of him hereafter. The native Darkneſs of the Mind muſt be baniſhed and the Light of Day introduced. The Obſtinacy of the Will broken, and 't made plyant to the Will of God; the Diſorder of the Affections removed, and they fix'd in their free, general and ſupreme Bent, upon God and divine Objects. Before this Change paſſes upon the Soul, it can't be kept in a holy Frame; and therefore this ſhou'd be firſt ſought after with the utmoſt Vehemence: And indeed, 'till this be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, the Foundation of vital Piety is not laid. Hence our Lord enjoins us, <hi>Firſt,</hi> to make the Tree good and then the Fruit will be good.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly:</hi> The Command of keeping the Soul ſuppoſes, the <hi>liableneſs</hi> even of the <hi>renewed Perſon to neglect his Soul,</hi> and wander from God like a loſt Sheep, becauſe of remaining Corruption. Altho' the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Power of Sin be broke in the Regenerate, yet there is in them <hi>Fleſh</hi> as well as <hi>Spirit,</hi> the <hi>old</hi> as well as the <hi>new Man;</hi> a <hi>Law</hi> in their <hi>Members</hi> waring againſt the <hi>Law</hi> of
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:005699_0008_1026C6460DC67D40"/>
from their <hi>Minds:</hi> This corrupt Principle luſts againſt the Spirit, tempts them to backſlide from God, and ſometimes leads them captive. <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſalm cxix. 176. Rom. vii. Col. iii. 5.10. Gal. v. 17. Heb. xiii. 18.</note> The numerous Falls of the Saints of God recorded in Scripture, are inconteſtible Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of this awful Truth. The beſt of Men are in Danger of the worſt of Sins while on this Stage of Temptation; and eſpecially at ſuch Seaſons, when they neglect their own Hearts, and reſt upon Grace receiv'd.</p>
            <p>It is true, neglecting and overlooking the Heart generally, becauſe it is hidden from the World, and taking care to regulate the Life chiefly for the ſake of Applauſe or any other ſelfiſh End; is doubtleſs the Character of Hypocrites: And hence our Lord reprov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Phariſees <hi>for cleanſing the out ſide of the Cup and Plater, while the inſide was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected.</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Matt. xxiii. 25.</note>
            </p>
            <p>On the Contrary, gracious Perſons no doubt (for the general) are chiefly careful of their Hearts: Yet in times of ſpiritual Deſertions and Decays, when with the Churches of <hi>Epheſus</hi> and <hi>Sardis,</hi> they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:005699_0009_1026C648B8BAC420"/>
their firſt Love and fall from their firſt Works, and the Things that remain are ready to die, they may for a Time under the Power of Temptation, ſadly neglect their own Hearts!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This Command of keeping the Soul, ſuppoſes the <hi>evil Nature</hi> and <hi>dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Conſequences</hi> of <hi>neglecting it.</hi> As this is a manifeſt Violation of God's <hi>Authority</hi> and Contempt of his <hi>Love;</hi> ſo it is hurtful in its Fruits to our ſelves and others; this robs us of our Peace and Comfort, this weakens our Hope and mars our Joy, as well as hinders our uſefulneſs. When the Soul is neglected, the guſt or reliſh of divine Things gradually abates, and we grow cold and inſipid in our religious Performances; the World greatens in our Eyes, and thro' want of a proper Guard, we are the more eaſily enſnared by its Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and being enſnared our Minds are perplex'd with guilt, and our Evidences for Heaven, blotted and eclipſed: Now do not Deadneſs and ſlaviſh Fear indiſpoſe us to ſpeak and act for God, as well as make us very uncomfortable in our ſelves?</p>
            <p>But this is not all, while Perſons neglect their own Hearts, the View of their own
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:005699_0010_1026C64A7598C3A0"/>
Iniquities being hid from them, they are in danger of being lifted up with Pride, and inclin'd to a cenſorious Severity, concerning the Conduct of others; who are, perhaps, more advanced in Knowledge and Goodneſs than themſelves; which Iniquity is as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to the Peace and Benefit of Society, as it is contrary to the Word of God, which enjoyns us to <hi>be merciful as he is merciful,</hi> and aſſures us, that <hi>he ſhall have Judgment</hi> without Mercy, <hi>who hath ſhewed no Mercy.</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">James ii. 13.</note>
            </p>
            <p>I might add, that thro' Neglect of the Heart ſome are ſuddenly involv'd into thoſe crimſon Impieties, which bring Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach upon the Name, Ways and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, as well as harden the Hearts of the Wicked; and thus they do grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Injury in a little Time to Religion, then they have done Good in the paſt Space of their Lives. O lamentable! ſhould not therefore the Pſalmiſt's Petition reſpecting this be often in our Hearts and Mouths? <hi>Let none that ſeek thee he aſhamed for my ſake Lord God of Hoſts!</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſalm lxix. 6.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:005699_0011_1026C64F365ACF68"/>Surely Brethren the Diſorders of the Tongue and of the Life, do generally flow from the Neglect of the Heart. But to proceed,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> This command of keeping the Soul <hi>diligently,</hi> ſuppoſes the <hi>Difficulty of it,</hi> which ariſes partly from the Deceitfulneſs, and deſperate Wickedneſs that is in it, <note n="†" place="bottom">Jer. xvii. 9.</note> and partly from the innumerable Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to Sin, which are injected into it by the Devil and the World, all which it is very Difficult to oppoſe. Moreover tho' the Souls Affections are ſometimes warmly engag'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God and Religion by the Spirits In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, yet ſo ſoon as that is withdrawn, they return to their Native Coldneſs by Degrees, as warm Water taken from the Fire, or the Earth when the Sun withdraws his beamy Warmth far from the Horizon: now it is exceeding difficult to withſtand Deadneſs, when it comes upon us like an arm'd Man.</p>
            <p>And that which renders this Work the more Difficult, is the <hi>Conſtancy</hi> of it, it muſt be continu'd in to our dying Breath; if we intermit but a few Moments we
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:005699_0012_1026C651DDAEADB8"/>
run a dreadful Riſque of incurring the Conſequences before mentioned. To keep the outſide tolerably regular, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Duties with a careleſs Frame of Heart, is no great Matter, and does not require great Labour.</p>
            <p>But to withſtand all Temptations to Sin, and labour for the Crucifixtion of it; with Groans that cannot be uttered! To ſtrive in the faithful Uſe of all proper Means, to preſerve good Impreſſions, and to ſtir up our ſelves to take hold on God in every Duty, and that not only when he is preſent with us, but abſent from us. O this is exceeding Difficult! and is therefore juſtly compar'd by our Lord to a <hi>ſtrait Gate and narrow Way.</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Mat. vii. 13.14.</note> Such as do mind their own Hearts, will find Work enough there, without being buſie Bodies in other Mens Matters.—</p>
            <p>In the mean Time let me obſerve my Brethren, that tho' the keeping of our Souls is exceeding Difficult, yet thro' Mercy it is not an impoſſible and hopeleſs Taſk. Allbeit conſidered in ourſelves we are not equal to it, yet he who enjoyns it, is able
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:005699_0013_1026C6536448ECD8"/>
to aſſiſt us in the Performance of it: Thro' Chriſt we can do all Things, but without his Aſſiſtance and Influence we can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to Purpoſe in Religion. <note n="††" place="bottom">John xvi 5.</note>
            </p>
            <p>I proceed to ſhew what is <hi>imply'd</hi> in keeping the Soul, and here I may obſerve. That it implies in General, <hi>the earneſt and conſtant Uſe of all appointed Means to keep the Soul from Sin, and preſerve its Senſe of divine Things:</hi> And hence we are bid to <hi>keep our ſelves in the Love of God.</hi> 
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Jud. xxi.</note> But particularly,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> It implies, our <hi>Jealouſie and Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſs over the Thoughts, Affections, and Deſigns of our Souls.</hi> We ſhould be jealous over them with a godly Jealouſie, leaſt <hi>a deceived Heart turn us aſide,</hi> and <hi>we feed upon Aſhes and die with a Lye in our Right Hand.</hi> The Heart by Nature is a grand Cheat. <note n="†" place="bottom">Jer. xvii. 9.</note> And even after Converſion ſo much of that Falacy remains as ſhould put us conſtantly upon our Guard. <note n="‡‡" place="bottom">Mat. xvi. 23.</note> Surely as <hi>Solomon</hi> obſerves, <hi>There is a Way which ſeems right to a Man, the End whereof is Death.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Pro. xiv. 12.</note> And elſewhere he informs us, That
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:005699_0014_1026C655293DE068"/>
               <hi>every Way of Man is Right in his own Eyes, but the Lord ponders the Hearts.</hi> 
               <note n="¶" place="bottom">Pro. xxi. 2.</note> It is therefore no wonder that he declares him to <hi>be a Fool, that truſteth in his Heart,</hi> and on the Contrary pronounces a <hi>bleſſing on the Man that feareth always.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Pro. xxviii. 14.</note> And as we ſhould beware of believing raſhly, and confidently the Notions of our Hearts without a ſtrict Tryal of them by the Law and the Teſtimony, to which, except we attend and abide by, the Prophet declares that <hi>there is no Light in us.</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Iſa. viii. 20.</note> So we ſhould keep a conſtant Watch over the Thoughts of our Souls that the Diſorders thereof may be ſeaſonably ſuppreſſed, at their firſt riſe, before they come to a Head. And hence our Lord has frequently recommended the Duty of Watchfulneſs. <note n="‡" place="bottom">Mark xiii. 37.</note> 
               <hi>That which I ſay unto you all, I ſay Watch.</hi> Without this we are in a very perilous Situation, ſeeing we are in an Enemy's Country, and have a Traitor within the Walls. <note n="‡‡" place="bottom">2 Cor. iv. 4.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, Keeping our Souls,</hi> implies our <hi>faithful oppoſing the firſt Riſings of Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in them, and a careful avoiding of thoſe
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:005699_0015_1026C65B66C08840"/>
Things that tend to inflame them.</hi> We are bid to <hi>reſiſt the Devil,</hi> and inform'd, that <hi>he will fly from us,</hi> 
               <note n="††" place="bottom">Jam. iv. 7</note> 
               <hi>i. e.</hi> in the Way of Duty we may expect a Conqueſt over him, but not otherwiſe: We muſt therefore <hi>wreſtle with Principalities and Powers, and ſpiritual Wickedneſſes in high Places,</hi> 
               <note n="¶" place="bottom">Eph vi. 12.</note> Sin is moſt eaſily ſuppreſſed, and Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thereto repell'd in their Beginnings; but by our Delays they gain Strength, and then like a formidable Torrent, reſiſtleſs bear down all before them.</p>
            <p>And ſeeing our Corruptions are apt to be inflamed by the Preſence of ſome Objects, it is therefore neceſſary to keep at a Diſtance from them, and thereby avoid the Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of Evil. <note n="‡" place="bottom">1 Theſſ. v. 22.</note> If we pray as we are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, that we be not led into Temptation, and yet run unneceſſarily into it, do we not contradict our Prayers by our Practice, as well as betray our Inſincerity, and tempt the righteous God to forſake us, and ſuffer our Enemies to enſnare and triumph over us? We cannot ſincerely and conſiſtently labour to keep our Souls from error in prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:005699_0016_1026C65D1CB9D220"/>
and Evils in Practice, without a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious avoiding thoſe Things that tend to ſeduce and corrupt us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Keeping the Soul, implys a <hi>fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Examination of its Thoughts and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies, together with a bitter bewailing over the Evils that we diſcern in them.</hi> How can we be ſuitably affected with the Caſe of our Souls, unleſs we know it: And can this be reaſonably expected without Enquiry? No ſurely! It is therefore highly neceſſary, attentively to obſerve the Diſpoſitions of our Souls; and impartially, as well as fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, to examine them by the Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone of God's Word. <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Cor. xiii. 5.</note> This is the Way to know the <hi>plague-ſore of our own Hearts,</hi> which is neceſſary to excite our juſt Sorrows for it, and the Way in which we can only on a ſcriptural Foundation, expect the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of our Supplications. <note n="†" place="bottom">

                  </gap> viii. 38.</note> Our Lord pronounces a Bleſſing upon thoſe that mourn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and aſſures us that they ſhall be comforted. <note n="‡" place="bottom">Mat. v. 4.</note> And the Prophet <hi>Zachariah</hi> informs us, that when a Spirit of Prayer is poured out, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Promiſe of the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,

and Perſons are enabled by Faith to behold a pierced Redeemer, they weep bitterly, as one for the Loſs of a firſt born. <note n="‡" place="bottom">Zech. xii. 10.</note> And certainly the Sins of the Soul, which are the fatal Sources of thoſe that taint the Life, require our ſadeſt Sorrows! The <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt</hi> lamented his being conceived in ſin; <note n="**" place="bottom">Pſal. li. 5.</note> And <hi>Hezekiah</hi> humbled himſelf for the Pride of his Heart, together with the Inhabitants of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the Wrath of God was turned from them all his Days <note n="††" place="bottom">2 Chron. xxxii. 26.</note>.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Keeping the Soul implys, <hi>frequent and humble Supplications to God, for the enlightning and ſanctifying Influences of his Holy Spirit,</hi> without which we cannot be preſerved; <hi>as well as a realizing of his Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipreſence.</hi> And hence the Pſalmiſt prayed, that God would unite his Heart to fear his Name; <note n="*" place="bottom">lxxxvi Pſal. 11.</note> and ſignifies how much he was affected with the Thoughts of God's being every where preſent, and obſerving every Thought of his Mind, as well as every In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his outward Behaviour. <note n="‡‡" place="bottom">cxxxix Pſal. 2, 3.</note> It is indeed Needful to be continually ſenſible of our Ignorance and Weakneſs to perform
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:005699_0018_1026C66429E67890"/>
Duty aright; and under a humble Impreſſion thereof, to attempt it, in the mean Time earneſtly imploring divine Aſſiſtance, and believingly relying on the Mediator for it. Indeed, without frequent lifting up of the Heart to God by ejaculatory Prayer, as the various Occaſions of Life require, the ſavour of Piety will gradually languiſh in our Souls. The Improvement of this Subject yet remains.</p>
            <p>Methinks, Sirs, what has been ſaid, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers Matter of Reproof to thoſe who wholly neglect their Souls, and depend on outward Acts of Worſhip: Surely that God who is a Spirit, will not accept of bodily Worſhip without the Spirit. Thoſe who habitually neglect their Souls and rely on externals, are Hypocrites in Religion, like the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees of old; their ſacred Service is abhorred by God! <note n="‡" place="bottom">Iſa. i. 11.13, 14.</note> and their Perſons will be finally rejected of him, if they continue in this Caſe. <hi>For except our Righteouſneſs exceeds that of the Scribes and Phariſees,</hi> the Mouth of Truth has told us, <hi>we can in no caſe enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi>

who, tho' they have the root of the Matter in them, ſlumber and ſleep with the fooliſh Virgins; and for a Time in ſome Degree neglect their Souls, which cauſes leaneſs in them, and an unſavirouſneſs, if not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worſe, in their Speech, as well as Barenneſs and Diſorders in Life.</p>
            <p>The Neglect of the Soul, my Brethren, ſoon manifeſts it ſelf in the Practice: What but this, is the Cauſe of <hi>Debates, Envyings, Wraths, Strifes, Backbitings, Whiſperings, Swellings, Tumults?</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">2 Cor. xii. 10.</note> which are ſo diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and detrimental to Religion!</p>
            <p>Surely all ſuch as neglect their own Souls, are guilty of rebellion againſt God's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and ingratitude againſt his Love. For which of all God's Kindneſſes do they thus requite him? O that ſuch would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Evil of their Negligence, as well as the Injury they thereby do to themſelves, and the Way they prepare to do miſchief to others!

            <p>I likewiſe exhort, in the Name of the LORD JESUS CHRIST, thoſe that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, to keep their Souls in the Manner before repreſented.</p>
            <p>Without this, my dear Brethren! you will <hi>forget</hi> the <hi>Mercies which your Eyes have ſeen,</hi> and <hi>looſe the thankful Impreſſion of them,</hi> which is as ungrateful to God as it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to your Progreſs in Piety.</p>
            <p>Again, Sirs, you ſhould keep the Soul! becauſe it is the <hi>Fountain of Action;</hi> from hence ſayeth <hi>Solomon are the Iſſues of Life.</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Prov. iv. 23.</note> All vital Actions flow from the Heart, and therefore keeping it is like caſting Salt into the Spring to heal it. In the Heart is the Treaſury of good and evil, which appears in

the Practice, as our Lord obſerves. <note n="‡" place="bottom">Matt. xii. 35.</note> It is from the Heart that the Tongue ſpeaks and the Hand acts; and therefore Heart-Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders are like Errors of the firſt Concoction, which cannot be rectified afterwards; and hence it is ſo neceſſary to keep our Hearts with all keeping; we ſhould keep our Eyes, our Tongues, but above all our Hearts, <hi>only take heed to thy ſelf and keep thy Soul diligently.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this, <hi>God will be glorified,</hi> not only by your Obedience to this particular Precept, but by a holy Converſation iſſuing from it; which is one of the moſt beautiful Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and ſtrongeſt Attractives to invite others to ſincere Religion.</p>
            <p>By this, my Brethren, <hi>your Love to Jehovah-Jeſus will be encreaſed,</hi> which diſpoſes to ſpeak of him, and to him, with ſeriouſneſs and ſavour; for ſurely, as <hi>Solomon</hi> obſerves, <hi>the Mouth of the Righteous ſpeaketh wiſdom,</hi>

<pb n="23" facs="unknown:005699_0022_1026C67081762158"/>
this will ſweetly incline you to Meekneſs and Mercy, to candor and Charity, which hopes all things, which ſuffers long and is kind.—And what can be more amiable in it ſelf, and uſeful to us and others than Humility?

But to proceed,</p>
            <p>By this, (I mean by keeping your Souls) <hi>our Peace of Mind will be preſerv'd,</hi> and our <hi>joy encreas'd.</hi> The Lord has graciouſly promis'd, to keep him in <hi>perfect Peace whoſe Mind is ſtayed on him.</hi> Tho' God gives di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Joy freely, yet uſually in ſuch a Way as encourages the Diligence of his Creatures in Religion.</p>
            <p>By this, <hi>our Evidences for Heaven will be confirm'd,</hi> which is an ineſtimable and ſoul-ſupporting Privilege; and hence we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>to give all Diligence to make our Calling and Election ſure:</hi> Intimating that this is the only Way in which we can expect the Aſſurance of Salvation.

            </p>
            <p>By this, in a Word, <hi>all our Graces are like to be ſtrengthned,</hi> for <hi>to him that hath ſhall be given, i. e.</hi> to him who believingly labours to improve what he hath, more ſhall be given.</p>
            <p>Keeping the Soul as it tends to prevent <hi>Guilt, Diſtance from God,</hi> and <hi>Deadneſs in Duty,</hi> ſo it of conſequence lays the Perſon open as it were, to divine <hi>Influence,</hi> which drops like the Dew of <hi>Hermon</hi> on the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of <hi>Zion.</hi> Without this we cannot grow in Goodneſs, but by it we are fed and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed as with Marrow and Fatneſs.</p>
            <p>We are commanded, my Brethren! to grow in Grace; which, doubtleſs, implys our earneſt uſe of means for that end, among which, that of keeping the Soul is a principal One; in this Way we may humbly hope, that Chriſt will dwell in our Hearts by Faith, and that we ſhall be rooted and grounded in Love, and ſo be prepar'd for the various Tryals which await us in this preſent World of change, labour and miſery, and be at laſt receiv'd into the Manſions of Bleſſedneſs: <hi>Which may God grant for Chriſt's ſake.</hi>
