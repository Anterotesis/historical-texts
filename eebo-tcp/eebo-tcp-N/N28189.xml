            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>MURDER is a crime of ſo atrocious a nature, and at the ſame time ſo ſeldom committed in the <hi>United States</hi> of <hi>America,</hi> that whenever it is perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated, our ſouls ſhudder at the depravity of human nature, and we become eager to find out the wretch, who ſhould be ſo ſunk in villainy, as to imbrue his hands in innocent blood.</p>
            <p>To this crime of ſo deep a die, a proportionate ſhare of puniſhment is annexed: murder and treaſon being now, according to the ameliorated laws of our ſtate, the only felonies for which thoſe who are found guilty of them, can be condemned to ſuffer an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious death.</p>
            <p>But if our minds revolt with horror, at the idea of murder, it unfortunately happens that this crime may frequently be committed in ſuch a manner, as to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it impracticable for us to obtain <hi>direct</hi> and <hi>poſitive</hi> proof againſt the guilty. Hence the verdict of a jury muſt in such caſes be entirely dependant on <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial evidence.</hi> Theſe, however, ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with the utmoſt caution; as circumſtances may appear exceedingly ſtrong againſt the ſuſpected perſon, who may, notwithſtanding be perfectly innocent of the crime laid to his charge.</p>
            <p>He muſt, indeed, be little acquainted with the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of juriſdiction in Great-Britain, Ireland, and the other nations of Europe, who does not know, that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious inſtances have occurred, in which juries, actuated by the pureſt, though no doubt, the moſt miſtaken motives, have, by placing too much ſtreſs on circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:037576_0003_10111B7B033D3940"/>
proof aſſigned to undeſerved puniſhment, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who, in conſequence of their verdict, have, after ſuffering an ignominious death, been fairly and poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively proved to have had no ſhare in the crimes for which they have ſuffered.</p>
            <p>Upon the firſt intelligence of a murder being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, ſuſpicion will naturally be attached to ſomebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy—The rumour againſt the unfortunate man, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther innocent or guilty, is propagated with unremitting aſſiduity, either by thoſe, who entertain ſome animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity againſt him, or by credulous perſons, who greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſwallowing what they hear, are eager to diſſeminate their opinions as widely as poſſible. Thus the tale goes round, daily accumulating further ſtrength, till at laſt a prejudice, which at firſt might only have influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced the minds of a few individuals, becomes popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, a mole-hill becomes a mountain—and the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate victim become the object of horror and indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the unthinking multitude, who, if it were not for the juſt rigour of the laws, would make him, with out judge or jury, a ſacrifice to their own wild and diſtracted imaginations.</p>
            <p>The above remarks could never, perhaps, with more propriety have been applied to any particular caſe, than that of Mr. LEVI WEEKS, a young gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of reſpectable character, againſt whom, at the laſt court of <hi>Oyer and Terminer, and general Gaol-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery,</hi> a bill of indictment was found, for the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Miſs JULIANNA ELMORE SANDS.</p>
            <p>The circumſtances of his guilt appeared at firſt, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry trivial. They were however, afterwards, either by the malicious and ſtudied deſigns of his enemies, or what is more probable, by that prepenſity which thoughtleſs people generally exerciſe, in propagating ſlander, without, perhaps, having any particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in view, augmented to ſuch a degree, as in a great meaſure, to render him the object of univerſal abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. Thoſe who dared to ſuppoſe him innocent,
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:037576_0004_10111B85664DEC68"/>
were very generally conſidered as partakers in his guilt. Tale after tale, ſucceeded to irritate the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic mind. Hand-bills were ſoon after his firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, generally diſtributed throughout the city, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the induſtry of thoſe bent upon his deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; or, perhaps, by ſome unprincipled ſcribbler, who, regardleſs of the effect, which his productions might have upon the weak part of the community, could conjure up thouſands of ghoſts and goblins <note n="*" place="bottom">We have ſeen hand-bills, announcing the appearance of dancing devils: a ghoſt in the debtors' apartment: various accounts of witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, ſtrange and wonderful prophecies, &amp;c. &amp;c. On due examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where are thoſe ſupernatural appearances to be found? Shall we never learn wiſdom, or muſt we ever be the dupes of impoſture?</note> at the Manhattan Well, for the ſake of raiſing a few pence to purchaſe a dinner.</p>
            <p>Happy, thrice happy the people, who entertaining true notions of rational liberty, whilſt, on the one hand, they are ready to bring <hi>real</hi> criminals to that puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which the laws of the land inflict on their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merits, are on the other, bound by the ties of the ſocial compact, never to condemn a man without a hearing —nor to ſuppoſe him guilty, till his crime ſhall be proved againſt him, in a court of juſtice—</p>
            <p>An impartial court, compoſed of ſuch wiſe and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right magiſtrates, as at preſent adorn our bench; and a jury of ſuch citizens as ever have, and I truſt, ever will compoſe the jurors of the city of New-York, will, no doubt, on all occaſions, endeavor to diveſt themſelves of <hi>that bias which popular rumours may have inſtilled into their minds, againſt the accuſed;</hi> examine the teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony, which may be brought before them, with calmneſs, coolneſs, and deliberation, and without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, favor, or affection, pronounce the innocence or guilt of the priſoners who may be brought before them.</p>
            <p>In the caſe of MR. LEVI WEEKS, who was brought to the bar on Monday the 31ſt of March laſt, the
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:037576_0005_10111B86EB8F9898"/>
attention of the public was in general attracted, though his name had been very generally marked with undeſerved obloquy, ſince the middle of the preceding January, and many had been taught to believe, that the charges to be adduced againſt him would not only be of the moſt ſerious nature, but alſo that no excul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patory proof could poſſibly appear in his favour, yet we find that after the moſt lengthy, and impartial trial which perhaps was ever held in the city of New-York, the jury, after having withdrawn for the ſhort ſpace of <hi>about four minutes,</hi> pronounced him <hi>innocent,</hi> and the ſurrounding multitudes, who, a few days before, were crying out <hi>crucify him, crucify him,</hi> began in a manner unknown in our courts of juſtice, to expreſs their approbation by loud applauſes. Such is the benefit of impartial courts and juries, from whoſe deciſion reſulted this TRIUMPH OF INNO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CENCE.</p>
            <p>It need ſcarcely be premiſed, that the caſe of a young man who is a native of this place, and who had, therefore, been <hi>univerſally beloved by the moſt reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table inhabitants of New York, for his probity, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, temperance, ſuavity of diſpoſition, gentility of manners, &amp;c. in ſhort, for a diſplay of all thoſe virtues, which are moſt ornamental in the human character,</hi> when accuſed of ſo heinous a crime, as that of murder, would attract a large ſhare of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic attention: particularly, when it is conſidered, that the reports concerning him were ſo numerous and contradictory as to leave no place whereon the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial mind wearied in endeavouring to inveſtigate the truth, could find a reſt.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, when the trial came on, the concourſe of people was ſo great, as was never before witneſſed on a ſimilar occaſion in New-York. Indeed, it is probable, that though the room in which the court was held is very large, not one fourth of thoſe who attended could procure admiſſion.</p>
            <p>On the evening previous to the trial, I had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:037576_0006_10111B096F3AC648"/>
to a few friends my intention of going to the Federal Hall, on the enſuing day, and waiting its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult. They ſuggeſted the idea, that the public were gaping with eager anxiety for the iſſue, and that an account of it would no doubt be very generally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable.</p>
            <p>Not being acquainted with the art of ſtenography, I am incapable of giving verbatim what was ſaid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ſolemn and awful occaſion. Indeed if I were, I ſhould, in the firſt inſtance, think it proper to give only a curſory ſketch.</p>
            <p>The prejudices reſpecting him, who was ſo lately a priſoner, but who is now ſo honorably cleared, have been diſſeminated far and wide. The ſooner this can be announced to the public the better, ſo that all falſe impreſſions may be done away.</p>
            <p>The vaſt concourſe of people, which upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, not only crouded the outer hall, but even the bar itſelf, prevented me from taking my notes with that accuracy, which I could have wiſhed. I believe, however, that from what I wrote on the occaſion, and what my memory can ſupply, the following ſketch may be deemed, with reſpect to the moſt important points, authentic.</p>

            <head>THE TRIAL.</head>
            <p>SEVERAL of the jury ſummoned on this occaſion, were objected to by the priſoner; but the following gentlemen were at laſt impannelled:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Garret Strong, Simon Schermerhorn, Robert Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn, George Scriba, Wm. G. Miller, Richard Ellis, James Hunt, Samuel Ward, John Rathbone, Wm. Wharton, jun. Wm. Wilſon,</hi> and <hi>Jaſper Ward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The indictment being read, the purport of which was, that on the evening of the 22d December, about 8 o'clock, he had taken from the place of her reſidence Miſs JULIANNA E. SANDS, that after beating, abuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c. the body of the ſaid ELMORE, he had thrown her into a well belonging to the Manhattan company, near Bayard's Lane, which contained a great quantity of water, and that he had been the means of killing or murdering the ſaid ELMORE—To which Mr. WEEKS pleaded <hi>Not Guilty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The judges, upon this occaſion, were Judge Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, Richard Varick, Eſqr. Mayor, and Richard Harriſon, Eſq. Recorder.</p>
            <p>Richard Furman and Robert Lenox, Eſqrs. Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, likewiſe attended during a great part of the trial.</p>
            <p>The Council on behalf of the ſtate, was, Mr. Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, aſſiſtant Attorney-General—and on the part of Mr. WEEKS, Gen. Alexander Hamilton, Col. Burr, Brockholſt Livingſton, Abraham Skinner, James Woods, Charles Baldwin, and Francis Lynch, Eſqrs.</p>
            <p>The buſineſs was opened by an elegant addreſs from Mr. Colden, in which, after paying a handſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037576_0008_10111B8A1A53DE40"/>
to the talents of the attornies for Mr. WEEKS, and noticing that influence which they might acquire by the force of oratory, he obſerved, that if from the maſs of evidence, he ſhould adduce, he could draw truth, he would, in that caſe, fully diſcharge the duty of a public proſecutor.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to the perſon, who now ſtands as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner at the bar, it was certainly much in his favour, that he had heretofore been univerſally conſidered as a young man of unblemiſhed character, and irreproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able morals; and that indeed, the crime of which he was accuſed, was of ſuch a horrid nature, as ſcarcely to make it poſſible that he could have committed it; and that when all circumſtances were conſidered, it could ſcarcely be ſuppoſed, that human nature was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ſuch a crime.</p>
            <p>He, however, on the other hand, ſtated, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding theſe favourable appearances, he could ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce proofs, that Mr. LEVI WEEKS had ſeduced the affections of the deceaſed Miſs E. SANDS that he had promiſed her marriage; taken her in a ſleigh, on the evening of the day mentioned in the indictment, carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her to the fatal ſpot and murdered her.</p>
            <p>This was the general purport of the attorney gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral's adddreſs. He, however, condeſcended, on a number of particulars, which, though no doubt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in a court of juſtice, is incompatible with the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity contemplated in the preſent ſketch.</p>
            <p>He concluded by obſerving, that whether Mr. WEEKS was guilty of the crime laid to his charge or not, it was certain, that a moſt inhuman murder had been committed by ſome one on the body of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed: that the nature of the teſtimony could, in ſuch a caſe as the preſent, be only circumſtantial; but that a chain of circumſtances, ſupported by a number of witneſſes, ſhould often be more concluſive with a Jury than a direct proof—inaſmuch, that in the latter caſe, there might be perjury, whereas in the former no
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:037576_0009_10111B0CA144E438"/>
ſuch thing could be ſuſpected. He added, that as the trial would undoubtedly be long, and the witneſſes on the part of the people numerous, he would now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
            <p>[☞ And here I would obſerve, before I enter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the evidence on either ſide, that it is not my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to give even a DETAIL of ALL the different teſtimonies. Many of them appeared to have no ſort of connection with the point in queſtion. Indeed the learned Judge, in ſumming up the evidence at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the trial, ſpoke to the following purpoſe— That in the great maſs of evidence before them, there was a conſiderable portion, which would ſeem to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace the records of a Court.—Nothing, therefore, ſhall appear here, except what is more immediately connected with the ſubject.]</p>
            <p>The firſt, and perhaps the moſt material evidence on the part of the people, was Mrs. Ring, who <hi>affirmed,</hi> that in the month of July laſt, Levi Weeks came to board in her huſband's houſe and was ſoon after obſerved to pay particular attention to Elmore Sands, who had lived with them as one of their family for the laſt three years: that about the 10th or 11th September, being apprehenſive of the fever ſhe went to the country and was deſirous of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Elmore along with her, who was, however, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing, and that ſhe therefore remained at home. That about four weeks after her departure ſhe receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a letter from her huſband adviſing her to return home, with which ſhe ſoon after complied, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned accordingly. That Elmore being taken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, Mr. Weeks was very aſſiduous in his attention towards her; ſat by her bed, expreſſed great uneaſineſs at her affliction, and wiſhed to call a phyſician; that about the end of November or 1ſt of December, El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more uſually ſlept in her own room; and that going up about twelve o'clock one night, ſhe found Mr. Weeks ſitting by the bed-ſide with his cloaths on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:037576_0010_10111ADFB1A11FB8"/>
that the door was ſhut againſt her. (Here Mr. Ring, the huſband of this evidence, was ordered to leave the court, during the time his wife was giving evidence.) That the deponent aſked Mr. Weeks what was meant by the door being ſhut againſt her; to which he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered that he did not know that it was ſhe, upon which the witneſs aſked, why the door was ſhut at all, to which M. Weeks replied, that as Elmore was ſick, he was afraid to truſt her with any other perſon for fear of neglect. That at another time when the deceaſed was unwell, Mr. Weeks was found ſitting by her bed ſide, that they were often found together, and alone in different parts of the houſe, and that every day gave corroborations to prove that Mr. Weeks inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to marry her. That on the morning of the 22d of Dec. Mr. Weeks went out immediately after break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, ſaying he was going over to his brother's. When he returned ſome time after he ſaid he had hurt his knee: upon which one obſerved that he would not be able to go out that day. He ſaid, he would be able at night. After Elmore had dreſſed his knee he went up ſtairs accompanied by her, where they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained more than an hour; that ſome time after eleven o'clock he came down ſtairs and was ſoon after followed by her. That a little before night Mr. Weeks and Elmore were in the dining room together, from whence they ſoon after went up ſtairs and ſtaid about half an hour. That about dark Elmore had dreſſed herſelf as neatly as ſhe poſſibly could; and that as it was cold and ſhe was to go out that evening, ſhe borrowed a muff from a neighbour: that Mr. Weeks came in a little before eight; and that when the clock ſtruck eight, her huſband, the deceaſed and Mr. Weeks were ſitting together; that the witneſs then adjuſted Elmore's ſhawl, which was crooked, and that ſhe had the muff in her hand: that Mr. Weeks then went to the door with his hat in his hand; that Elmore was then up ſtairs, all ready to come down:
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037576_0011_10111B12C791B2C8"/>
that immediately after, the door being opened, ſhe heard a perſon come down ſtairs, and that there was a whiſpering by the door, which was inſtantly ſhut: that ſhe was a good deal agitated upon this occaſion, and that the ſuppoſed going out of the two attracted the attention of her huſband: that ſhe did not ſee Mr. WEEKS again till ten o'clock, when William Ander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, his apprentice, was waiting for the key to go to bed: that he then came to the fire and gave the key to the apprentice, deſiring him to go to bed, and that he appeared to be agitated, and his countenance pale: that he aſked whether Hope, the ſiſter of this depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, who had gone out in the morning, had returned, to which ſhe anſwered, No: that he then aſked whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Elmore had gone to bed, to which ſhe anſwered, that ſhe had gone out: that he then expreſſed his ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe that ſhe ſhould go out alone at ſo late an hour, to which the witneſs anſwered, that ſhe had no reaſon to ſuppoſe that ſhe had gone out alone, to which he made no reply: and that Mr. Weeks went to bed in about half an hour after he came in, and that he was apparently much diſtreſſed: That under the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the return of Elmore, ſhe had ſat up till about twelve o'clock, at which time ſhe ſearched the houſe, and not finding her, went to bed, leaving the door un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locked. On Monday the 23d, Mr. Weeks along with the other boarders breakfaſted as uſual, and that a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle after Mr. Weeks went out: that ſhe then heard ſome perſon go ſoftly up ſtairs, whom ſhe ſuppoſed to be Elmore: that Mr. Weeks then came into the room and aſked concerning Elmore, to which the deponent anſwered, that ſhe had not ſeen her: that he then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed his ſurprize where ſhe ſhould be, to which ſhe anſwered, that perhaps ſhe might be upſtairs; and that the deponent being nettled at his queſtions, farther obſerved, that ſhe ſuppoſed he knew beſt where ſhe was, upon which he went up ſtairs, and upon coming down ſaid ſhe was not there: that the witneſs not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:037576_0012_10111B8BA63AC228"/>
him went up ſtairs herſelf, and found that what he had ſaid was true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that about fifteen minutes after he came again, making enquiry about Elmore, and expreſſing his ſurprize where ſhe could be, to which the witneſs anſwered, that ſhe had reaſon to believe ſhe had gone out with him, to which he replied, that he had not ſeen her ſince the time ſhe left the room the preceding evening, on which he appeared much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned: that about twelve o'clock, upon obſerving to Mr. Weeks that ſhe had been fifty times at the door looking for Elmore, he replied, that he had looked of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tener than that himſelf: that on the next morning the 24th December, after breakfaſt, Mr. Weeks perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her (the witneſs) to be exceedingly diſtreſſed, took hold of her arm, ſaying, "Don't be uneaſy; things may turn out better than you expect." That on the afternoon of the ſame day, the witneſs told Mr. Weeks, that matters had now become exceedingly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and that ſhe could ſtand it no longer; that ſhe aſked him what had become of her, at the ſame time obſerving, that if it had not been for the unlimited con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence which ſhe entertained of him, ſhe would have been much more unhappy than ſhe now was; and he then expreſſed great ſorrow at the deponent's diſtreſs: That in a farther converſation upon this ſubject, the deponent had mentioned to Mr. Weeks, that Elmore previous to her going out had mentioned to her, that ſhe was to be married to him that evening at 8 o'clock; upon which he appeared to be much agitated, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to cry, ſaying, that he was ruined and undone, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſhe appeared to clear him, and that he would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther die than live under it: That on the Thurſday fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Mr. Weeks came in about ſeven o'clock P. M. at which time the witneſs being much afflicted, ſaid, ſhe was ſure that he had got her, and begged he would tell the truth; to which he replied, "It is my firm belief ſhe is now in eternity. It really is." That upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſked what made him ſay ſo, he anſwered, "that
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037576_0013_10111B9359C6C910"/>
he had frequently heard her ſay, ſhe wiſhed that ſhe had never been in exiſtence." The witneſs, upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing queſtioned with reſpect to the diſpoſition of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed, replied, that ſhe was exceedingly lively, and that the evening ſhe laſt went out, ſhe appeared more chearful than uſual: that on Thurſday the muff was found in the Manhattan well. Being queſtioned con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the character of Mr. Weeks, ſhe replied, that he was a kind, friendly, and ſober young man, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways very ſociable in the family. The witneſs being queſtioned, whether ſhe had ever enquired of Mr. Weeks, about his being engaged to Elmore, replied, that ſhe never had, till the Tueſday after her diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance. On being aſked whether ſhe did not know of the deceaſed being intimate with any other perſon beſides Mr. Weeks, ſhe anſwered, No. Whether there was reaſon to ſuſpect any improper conduct be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween her husband and Miſs Sands, ſhe replied, not in the leaſt.</p>
            <p>Hope Sands, ſiſter of the laſt witneſs, <hi>affirmed</hi>— That ſhe had once found Mr. Weeks and the deceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed locked up in a room together; but did not know what paſſed between them: That upon her aſking him on Monday, the 23d Dec. whether he knew where Elmore was, he replied, he did not. On being queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned with reſpect to Mr. Weeks' general character, ſhe replied, that he was loved by all the family, but that his attachment appeared to be more particularly fixed upon Elmore than any other perſon.</p>
            <p>Elias Ring, <hi>affirmed</hi>—That during his wife's ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in the country, from the tenth or eleventh of September, till about ſix weeks thereafter, Mr. Weeks and the deceaſed were frequently alone together in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent parts of the houſe; that one night, believing them to have been in bed together, he next morning went to Mr. Weeks' room, found the bed greatly tumbled, and the clothes, which Elmore had worn the preceding evening, lying in the room. On being
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:037576_0014_10111B185EF896C0"/>
aſked whether he had ever ſaid, that Mr. Weeks was engaged to Elmore, he replied, that probably he might —He likewiſe depoſed, that Mr. Weeks was much more attentive to Elmore, than he was to Hope Sands, or Mary Clark, both of whom were unmarried wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men living in the houſe: That Elmore was a girl of a lovely diſpoſition, and decent character, and that he was not at firſt uneaſy on account of her diſappear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, becauſe he thought that Mr. Weeks, in whom he repoſed the greateſt confidence, was along with her. That upon the twenty-ſixth of Dec. Mr. Weeks, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter taking him, (this deponent) up ſtairs, had enquired whether he had ſaid any thing about his, (Mr. Weeks') knowing any thing about Elmore, to which he, (the deponent) anſwered, that he had, and that he verily believed he knew all about her. On being aſked, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he had ever ſaid, that if he could do it privately, he would kill Mr. Weeks, he replied, that he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver even thought of ſuch a thing.</p>
            <p>Margaret Clark being <hi>ſworn,</hi> depoſed that ſhe had lived in Mr. Ring's houſe, in the capacity of ſervant ſome time before Mr. Weeks had come to reſide there as a boarder; but that ſhe was not there during the time that Mrs. Ring was in the country, that ſhe knew that Mr. Weeks and the deceaſed had been in bed together the Monday before her diſappearance, but that ſhe did not believe, that Mr. Weeks had engaged to marry her. That he was always very at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive to any one in the family who might be ſick; but not more ſo to the deceaſed, than to any other perſon. That the deceaſed was an active and lively girl, and that during the converſation, which at any time had paſſed between them, ſhe had never ſaid, that ſhe was engaged to marry Mr. Weeks.</p>
            <p>Iſaac Hatfield being <hi>ſworn,</hi> ſaid that he had gone to lodge in Mr. Ring's houſe about the 14th or 15th of September, where he continued four or five weeks, during which time he obſerved a great intimacy to
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:037576_0015_10111B99245617F0"/>
ſubſiſt between Mr. Weeks and the deceaſed, who ſeemed to be exceedingly fond of each other: that when he left the houſe, there was no boarder there except Mr. Weeks; being aſked with reſpect to the diſpoſition of the deceaſed, he ſaid, that ſhe appeared to him to be a very lively and chearful girl.</p>
            <p>Mr. Croucher being <hi>ſworn,</hi> depoſed that he had lodged in the houſe from the 2nd week in September, during which time he had obſerved great intimacy between Mr. Weeks and the deceaſed; and that he had never obſerved any courtſhip to be more warm; that for two nights, the deceaſed had been a great while in Mr. Week's bed-room, and that one evening, the door being left unguardedly open, he had ſeen them engaged in an indecent act: Upon being aſked wheth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er he had any difference with Mr. Weeks, he anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he once had, and in conſequence of that difference, he had called Mr. Weeks an impertinent puppy; that the evening on which the deceaſed was miſſing he had been at a houſe in the Bowery, from which he returned about half paſt eleven o'clock, an hour later than uſual, as he had engaged with Mr. Ring always to be at home by ten o'clock; that he had never been on bad terms with the deceaſed, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that there was ſome dryneſs between them for a while, in conſequence of his difference with Mr. Weeks: that on the night of Sunday, the 22d Dec. on Monday night, and every night thereafter as long as Mr. Weeks continued there, he had been diſturbed by a noiſe in Mr. Week's room, &amp;c. On being aſked whether he had paſſed near the Manhattan well the night of the 22d, he anſwered that he had not; he further obſerved, that the night was cloudy and walking very bad.</p>
            <p>Henry Ronalds having <hi>affirmed,</hi> ſaid, that he had been acquainted with the deceaſed from her infancy, concerning whom he never knew any thing unbeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="18"
                   facs="unknown:037576_0016_100EDF0BB94E93F8"

in her conduct or character, and that ſhe was a lively and active girl.</p>
            <p>John Benſon having <hi>affirmed,</hi> ſaid, that he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided in the houſe of Mr. Ring for ſome days, in the month of September laſt, during which time he had perceived nothing extraordinary in the conduct of the deceaſed, or Mr. Weeks. He added that the deceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was a lively and active girl.</p>
            <p>Suſannah Broad, an aged woman, being <hi>ſworn,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that ſhe lived in the vicinity of the houſe of Mr. Ezra Weeks, and that about eight o'clock, on a Sunday evening, ſhe heard the gate open, which made her believe that ſomebody was ſtealing: that a ſleigh or chaiſe had been brought out, ſhe knew not which, and that about twelve days after the body of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed was found. That ſhe had never before nor ſince, heard a ſleigh or carriage go out from that gate.— On being croſs-examined, ſhe ſeemed quite indeciſive with reſpect to the ſleigh going out, and gave no ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory anſwers with reſpect to other circumſtances, concerning which ſhe was queſtioned. Chief Juſtice Lanſing, in ſumming up the evidence, mentioned her teſtimony as being entitled to no conſideration.</p>
            <p>Several evidences were now brought to prove, that on the evening of the 22d December, a one horſe ſleigh, without bells, had been met driving down the middle road, at a great rate, containing, as ſome of them ſaid, a man and a woman, and others, two men and a woman: that on Monday the track of a one horſe ſleigh had been obſerved near the Manhattan Well, and that, on the preceding evening, cries of the moſt extreme diſtreſs were heard. As, however, there did not appear the ſmalleſt ſhadow of evidence, that Mr. Weeks had any ſhare in theſe tranſactions, it is unneceſſary to detail them.</p>
            <p>Dr. Skinner being duly <hi>ſworn,</hi> depoſed, that he had viſited the body of the deceaſed, after it had been taken out of the well, both in the houſe of Mr. Ring,

and in the ſtreet: but more particularly in the latter.<note n="*" place="bottom">For the ſake of ſuch of my readers as may not be acquainted with the ſubject, it may be proper to obſerve, that the body of the deceaſed continued expoſed to public view, at the houſe of Mr. Ring<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for two or three days previous to interment: and that for ſome hours before the removal of the corps, it was placed in the ſtreet. Hundreds, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps I might ſay thouſands, came to view it.</note> That he found ſeveral bruiſes on her legs, neck, left breaſt, forehead, and chin, which he ſuppoſed to be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by compreſſion: that he obſerved ſeveral rediſh and black ſpots, the cauſe of which he did not exactly know; that her neck was not broken; that he was unacquainted with both the parties; that he did not believe that the appearances which he ſaw could be the effect of cold or heat.</p>
            <p>James W. Lent being <hi>ſworn,</hi> ſays, That while ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at dinner, he had been called upon to aſſiſt in ſearching for the body of a young woman in the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hattan well; and that he had gone thither, accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Meſſrs. Andrew Black, Lawrance Myers, — Page, and Elias Ring; that they took along with them a pole, in which they fixed ſome nails; that upon put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down the pole into the well, they found ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, which upon attempting to draw up became hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier and heavier; that upon ſeeing ſome calico appear upon the top of the water, they were convinced they had got the body of the young woman of which they were in queſt; that in order to get her up the more eaſily, a rope was procured from the neighbourhood and placed under her arms, by which means ſhe was pulled up in ſuch a manner as to do no injury to the body; that her appearance was ſuch as to induce him and the others who were preſent upon the occaſion, to ſuppoſe that ſhe was murdered; that her hat, handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief and ſhoes were off; that her ſtockings were down and partly torn, and that her toes were ſcratched, and alſo her hands, but not in ſuch a manner as to induce a belief, that ſhe had ſuſtained the injury by attempting to climb up the well; that immediately after finding
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:037576_0018_100EDF0DE563E258"/>
the body, they went to the Police Office, where a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant appeared to be in readineſs for the apprehenſion of Mr. Weeks; that upon finding him to be the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſuſpected, he was exceedingly aſtoniſhed, as he could not conceive him to be guilty of an atrocious deed; and that immediately after his caption, he aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whether the body was not found in the Manhattan well? The witneſs, on being aſked whether the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very had been kept a ſecret amongſt thoſe who took the body out of the well, replied that it had.</p>
            <p>Dr. Snedeker being <hi>ſworn,</hi> depoſed, that he had ſeen the corps two or three days after it was taken out of the well—that the collar and breaſt bones were hurt—and the neck much injured: that he could move the collar from the breaſt bone: and that, upon her breaſt, there was a livid appearance as large as a dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. The witneſs being aſked whether a corpſe might aſſume a livid appearance by expoſure to the air or cold, replied, he believed not—Being queſtioned, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch an appearance might not be occaſioned by ſuffocation, he anſwered, that he was not certain.</p>
            <p>Dr. David Hoſſack having <hi>ſworn,</hi> depoſed, that he had ſeen the body of the deceaſed, and had obſerved three or four ſpots on the neck, and that her forehead was bruiſed: both of which he conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to be the effect of violence from ſome other perſon than herſelf, and that in his opinion, ſhe could by no act of her own, have inflicted ſuch wounds on herſelf as appeared on his examination of the body.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Oſborn, being <hi>ſworn,</hi> depoſed that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed Miſs Sands, with whom ſhe was well acquainted, was a lively girl, received the muff, which was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards found in the Manhattan well from Mrs. Blonk.</p>
            <p>William Williams being <hi>ſworn,</hi> depoſed that he had rode from the houſe of Mr. Ring with a horſe to the Manhattan well in ſixteen minutes, and at another in fifteen, that he was then only on a trott and hat very probably it might have been done in leſs time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:037576_0019_100EDEE3075DBA18"/>Mr. Buſkirk being <hi>ſworn,</hi> depoſed exactly to the ſame purpoſe as the evidence immediately preceding.</p>
            <p>William Croſs being <hi>ſworn,</hi> depoſed that the horſe belonging to Mr. E. Weeks was a good runner, ſmart and active, and that ſuch a horſe with a ſleigh, moderately loaded might, when there was good ſleigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing run a mile in five minutes.</p>
            <p>The evidence being now cloſed on the part of the people, colonel Burr addreſſed the court and jury in one of the moſt eloquent ſpeeches, which we have ever heard. His eloquence was however, in the preſent caſe unneceſſary, as the guilt aſcribed to Mr. Weeks, appeared to every perſon preſent upon the trial to have been unſupported by any ſubſtantial evidence.</p>
            <p>Colonel Burr then addreſſed himſelf in behalf of the priſoner to the court and jury, in one of the moſt maſterly ſpeeches both with reſpect to compoſition and oratory, which we have ever heard, the purport of which is as follows.</p>
            <p>He began by taking notice of the great calmneſs, with which the jury had liſtened to the ſubject in diſcuſſion for many hours. He obſerved, that in criminal caſes, it was eſſentially neceſſary for a jury who did not wiſh to be hereafter tortured with remorſe of conſcience that circumſtantial evidence was, in general, improper, and ought in no caſe whatever, to be relied on, unleſs that they were uniformly and completely connected together in one regular chain. He ſpoke of the influence which prejudice might have upon the imaginations, as tending in ſuch caſes to prevent a wiſe and juſt deciſion: that in a court of juſtice, if there were any biaſs it ought rather to be in the favour of the priſoner's innocence, than of his guilt, and at all events, every man ſhould be deemed innocent of the crime laid to his charge, 'till he was proved guilty: that tales of every ſpecies had been <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="5 letters">
                  <desc>•••••</desc>
               </gap>gated againſt the priſoner, which had left the
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:037576_0020_100EDF1007B0EEE0"/>
moſt unfavourable impreſſion upon the public mind. That with reſpect to theſe it was eſſentially neceſſary for the jury to fortify themſelves, in order to their fixing upon a juſt and proper verdict; and that he was perſuaded, that if the whole evidence aqainſt Mr. Weeks was fairly and impartially examined, there was not a ſingle circumſtance on the face of the teſtimony, which could influence a jury to pronounce the priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er guilty.</p>
            <p>He obſerved, that, notwithſtanding the intimacy, which was ſaid to have ſubſiſted between the priſoner and the deceaſed, it did not amount to courtſhip, or a well-founded expectation of a future marriage; and that his attention to her appeared by no means to indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate any ſuch views: that the deceaſed had manifeſted equal partiality for other perſons, as for Mr. Weeks: and that ſhe was frequently in the habit of going out late at night, and that in her apologies for ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, it would be found, that ſhe had aſſerted, that ſhe had ſpent her time in houſes, where it afterwards appeared ſhe had not been:—and that hence it might fairly be concluded, that if the conduct of the deceaſed had not been irregular, it at leaſt had been very indiſcreet, and might have expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her to danger, both with reſpect to her morals and perſon; and that if ſhe really had been murdered, the ſuſpicion might, with more propriety be attached to ſome other perſon than to Mr. Weeks. That it would appear, on the evidence, which would hereafter be produced, in what manner the priſoneer was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed on the evening of the 22d Dec.: from which it would be evident, that he could not poſſibly have had any ſhare in throwing the deceaſed into the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hattan Well—and that about half paſt 8 o'clock, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nearly the time at which the unfortunate tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was ſuppoſed to have happened, he was at the houſe of his brother, where he ſupped, and ſat till ten o'clock, in a calm, compoſed, and cheerful manner, as

uſual, and without diſcovering the leaſt perturbation of mind.</p>
            <p>He obſerved, that before a jury could be juſtified in bringing a verdict againſt a priſoner, upon circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial evidences, circumſtances upon which they were to found their opinion, muſt be cloſely connected together, and that there muſt be no breach in the chain —but that the old woman's depoſition, with reſpect to the ſtory of the ſleigh, was ſo exceedingly defective, that it did not deſerve the ſmalleſt attention—that ſhe was obviouſly loſt in recollection, with reſpect to dates and time.</p>
            <p>He obſerved, that on this occaſion, the utmoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry and ingenuity had been exerciſed, to irritate the public mind againſt the priſoner—that upon ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving every circumſtance, he could have no motive in perpetrating ſo horrid a deed: that there could be no love connected with jealouſy—that he could not poſſibly have harboured any reſentment—which was more than could be ſaid with reſpect to ſome others, who were her acquaintances, and whoſe intereſt it might be greater to have deſtroyed the deceaſed, than Mr. Weeks.</p>
            <p>He then proceeded to ſtate, that Mr. Weeks was a young man highly eſteemed by many of the moſt reſpectable inhabitants of New-York; that there could not poſſibly be any good ground for ſuſpecting that he was the murderer of the deceaſed; that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering every circumſtance, viewing his general character and appreciating any motive, by which it might be ſuppoſed, he could poſſibly be actuated, he could not be guilty.</p>
            <p>That there was nothing extraordinary in the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of his being appalled, when taxed with the charge of murder, as this might be produced at the aſtoniſhment of the charge, or reſentment againſt the perſons who dared to harbour ſuch a ſuppoſition.</p>
            <p>He warned the jury againſt paying attention to popular rumours and mentioned two caſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in which
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:037576_0022_100EDF11F169BFF0"/>
perſons after having been generally ſuppoſed guilty of the crimes alledged againſt them, were afterwards found innocent.</p>
            <p>The firſt was with reſpect to a man who was indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for having murdered a young woman. Although entirely innocent of the crime laid to his charge, he got affrightened and in order, as he hoped, to ſave himſelf from the agony of death, upon the gibbet, got another woman to repreſent the perſon who was ſuppoſed to be miſſing—the fraud was diſcovered and this connected with other circumſtances induced the jury to bring their verdict <hi>guilty.</hi> The man was hanged; but the woman ſuppoſed to be murdered, afterwards made her appearance, by which every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was convinced that the jury had been miſtaken in their verdict.</p>
            <p>The ſecond caſe which he mentioned was reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a rape ſuppoſed to be committed, ſome few years ago upon a young woman of this city, the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of which muſt be freſh in the memory of moſt people: the public mind was in that caſe greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed, and notwithſtanding the verdict of a jury declaring the preſoner not guilty, the irritation of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> minds was ſo great as to induce them to inſult the magiſtrates and to pull down the houſe of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who was believed to be aiding and abetting this ſuppoſed rape—A civil ſuit was afterwards commenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt the perſon accuſed, who, though acquited by a jury, was for a long time, to gratify the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of ſome vindictive individual, immured with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the walls of a priſon—The accuſation, however, againſt the priſoner, has of late appeared to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely falſe and groundleſs<note n="*" place="bottom">Colonel Burr previous to the jury being incloſed, quoted the caſe of three other perſons, who were executed for ſuppoſed crimes of which it was afterwards clear they were innocent.</note>—Thus he was a ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>er on account of popular prejudice.</p>
            <p>Without mentioning theſe things he had reaſon to ſuppoſe the jury now before him was fully armed
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:037576_0023_100EDEE70361E3F8"/>
againſt prejudice, which, in many caſes, had been found to operate againſt the innocent: that they ſhould impartially weigh the whole maſs of teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny before them and give no ſcope to the effect, which previous reports might have had upon their imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that in caſes of this ſort every body knew ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: every day added more and more to the report —inceſſant talk upon the ſubject inflamed the public mind: frequent repetition induced belief and that ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination formed reality.</p>
            <p>He concluded by obſerving, that the circumſtance of Mr. Weeks, when firſt apprehended, having aſked whether the body of the deceaſed was found in the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hattan well was not in the least extraordinary, as he had been previouſly appriſed that the muff had been found there. On the whole he believed that the proof againſt his client, was ſo little to the purpoſe and that the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which would now be adduced in his favour, was ſuch as to induce the jury to bring in a verdict in his favour without leaving their ſeats.</p>
            <p>After having finiſhed this eloquent addreſs, of which I have given a curſory ſketch, the evidences were then brought forward in favour of Mr. Weeks.</p>
            <p>Wm. Seaman being <hi>ſworn,</hi> depoſed, that he lives in the houſe of Mr. Ezra Weeks, as an apprentice; that amongſt other things aſſigned to his care, there was that of the horſe and ſleigh, concerning which Mr. E. Weeks paid little or no attention: that upon the evening of the 22d December, he had as uſual locked up the gate and had either put the key in his pocket or on the mantle-piece, he could not ſay which—nor could he recollect whether he had found it in his pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, or on the mantle piece, the next morning— that, however, when he went there, he found eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing in the ſame ſituation as he had left it—that the ſleigh had eight bells affixed to it with leather ſtrings, which it would take ſome time to unlooſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that he believed if the knots had been unlooſed, and
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:037576_0024_100EDF13F99DF448"/>
afterwards tied by ſome other perſon, he was inclined to believe, that he would have obſerved it. He added farther, that he had been home on the evening of the 22d of Dec, ſaw Mr. Levi Weeks there, about half paſt 8 o'clock, and that he was perfectly mild, compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and cheerful as uſual.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Foreſt being <hi>ſworn,</hi> depoſed, that ſhe lived in the neighborhood of the houſe of Mr. Ring, and of courſe was near at hand, when the unfortunate cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of the diſappearance, and afterwards the diſcovery of the deceaſed took place. That upon the ſecond of Jan. about twelve in the forenoon, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to Mr. Levi Weeks being arreſted, ſhe had men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to him the circumſtance of the muff, which the deceaſed had worn, being found at or near a well cloſe by Bayard's lane: that he received this information with the utmoſt compoſure, and from every appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, did not diſcover the ſmalleſt degree of perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Joſeph Watkins being <hi>ſworn,</hi> depoſed, that he had been called upon by Mr. Ring, on the twenty ſecond of Dec. for the purpoſe of aſſiſting in fetching up the body of the unfortunate Miſs Sands: that after get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a pole properly prepared, with nails in it, and a rope, by which they might with more convenience, take up the corpſe. That upon its being got out of the well, her hair appeared to be down and tumbled, her ſhawl torn off, her face much ſwelled: and being queſtioned with reſpect to the other injuries which appeared on her body, he ſeemed to conſider them rather as ſcratches than bruiſes. He obſerved farther, that her ſtockings were down; that with reſpect to her feet, he had not obſereed whether they had been inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red or not: that the neck of the deceaſed was ſwelled; but that he had not perceived any marks.</p>
            <p>This witneſs further declared, that in September or October laſt, during the time that Mrs. Ring was abſent in the country, he heard a noiſe in a room in
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:037576_0025_100EDEE8CD51C658"/>
Mr. Ring's houſe which was only ſeparated from his own appartment by a thin partition, and that the noiſe was ſimilar to that, which might happen when huſband and wife were in bed together, that two diſtinct voices could be heard upon theſe occaſions, the one of which was loud and rough, and the other low; that he be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lieved the voice of the former was that of Elias Ring, and the latter that of Miſs E. Sands; that this ſtruck his mind with aſtoniſhment, and that he was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive, it might occaſion great diſquietude in Mr. Ring's family. That the voice of the man was not that of Mr. Weeks becauſe his was very ſmooth; that of Mr. Ring on the contrary was rough, and that he was well acquainted with the tone of Mr. Ring's voice: and that for 12 or 14 times he had heard a noiſe of a ſimilar kind between the middle of the months of September and October, that after Mrs. Ring's return no noiſe of that nature was heard; that one morning after the diſcovery of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed body, Mrs. Ring appeared exceedingly ſorry for the ſituation of Mr. Weeks, whom ſhe repreſented as being a young man of the moſt friendly diſpoſition, and exceedingly attached to her family: and that if any perſon was ſick he would without diſcrimination pay the utmoſt attention. This deponent further added, that the body of the deceaſed had, in a room of Mr. Ring's houſe been expoſed for ſeveral days, and afterwards for a few hours previous to its interment, in the ſtreet: that Mr. Croucher was very aſſiduous in ſpreading ſuſpicions againſt Mr. L. Weeks.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Watkins, the wife of the aforeſaid deponent, being from ſickneſs, confined to her room, was ſworn by the chief juſtice, and her teſtimony was as follows: That between the room in which ſhe and her huſband ſlept, and another in the poſſeſſion of Mr. Ring, there was only a thin lath and plaiſter partition, that from the middle of Sept. to the middle of Oct. ſhe had fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently been diſturbed by the ruſtling of the beds,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:037576_0026_100EDF16D0B23F08"/>
ſuch as might be occaſioned by man and wife<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the voice was evidently rougher than that of Mr. Weeks: that he poſſibly could not be the perſon who was with that woman: That Mr. Watkins appeared greatly alarmed about the buſineſs, and ſaid that the devil would be to pay in Mr. Ring's family, upon the return of Mrs. Ring—That up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Mrs. Ring's return, no noises of a ſimilar na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture were heard: on being aſked with regard to Miſs E. Sands's general conduct ſhe anſwered, that ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved it was in general regular and proper, that Mrs. Ring had told her that Mr. Weeks was amiable in his manners and kind to the children; that in fact he was conſidered rather as one of the family than a boarder.</p>
            <p>Anthony Rutgers being <hi>ſworn,</hi> depoſed that he had fallen in with Elias Ring in Gre<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>wich Street, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by another perſon, that the weather at that time, was exceedingly bad, admitting neither of walking or riding with convenience, that Mr. Ring aſked him if he knew any thing about a muff; upon which the deponent expreſſed great ſurpriſe when Mr. Ring told him the girl had been miſſing about eight days, that ſhe might be dead for ought he knew, and her death might be occaſioned by a love fit, that this deponent ſuppoſing her body might be in the river, adviſed them to employ George Wallgrove who was one of the moſt expert perſons of any in this city for ſweeping for drowned perſons; the deponent fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther declared that from the converſation which paſſed betwen him and Mr. Ring, he did not believe at the time that Mr. Ring had any idea of the girl's having been murdered.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Foreſt being again called, mentioned a conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation which had paſſed between her and Mr. Grouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er—That Mr. Croucher was ſorry for the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate affair: that he had ſpent the evening of the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſecond of Dec. at a friend's houſe in the bowery: that he was very ſorry that on his way home, he had
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:037576_0027_100EDEEA5A2158A8"/>
not come paſt the Manhattan well, as in that caſe he might have been the means of ſaving the life of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed.</p>
            <p>Elizabeth Watkins, daughter of Joſeph Watkins, being <hi>ſworn,</hi> depoſed, That ſhe was acquainted with Miſs E Sands, and that ſhe knew the room in which ſhe ſlept, to be adjoining to that of her mother's. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being queſtioned with reſpect to the general char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter of Mr. Weeks, ſhe declared in her opinion he was a quiet, peaceable, and benevolent young man.</p>
            <p>Doct. Mackintoſh being <hi>ſworn,</hi> depoſed, That he had been called upon to attend a coroner's inqueſt, upon the body of Miſs E. Sands, and that going thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, had fallen in with Dr. Prince, who accompanied him, and who was alſo deſired by in officer to attend upon the occaſion. That upon examining the body, nothing appeared to vindicate a ſuppoſition of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal violence, as the injuries which ſhe had reveived, ſeemed more like ſcratches, than wounds or bruiſes: that he had opened her head, breaſt and body, and that no extravaſion of blood appeared: that there was no diſlocation of the neck, that, however, there were livid ſpots—That being particularly required by the coronore's inqueſt, to examine whether ſhe was pregnant or not, he was decidedly of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ſhe was not: that there was no marks of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence on the belly, and that the collar bone was not diſlocated.</p>
            <p>Dr. Prince being <hi>ſworn,</hi>, appeared exactly to coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide with Dr. McIntoſh in opinion.</p>
            <p>Dr. Romayne, being <hi>ſworn,</hi> ſeemed to coincided in the ſame opinion.</p>
            <p>David Foreſt being <hi>ſworn,</hi> depoſed, that in a conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation with Mr. Croucher, who came into his ſtore where this deponent was, ſaid if Miſs Sands was dead, it would be nothing ſtrange to him, after he had heard what the landlord expreſſed: he further told him, that there was a material evidence, who would come from
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:037576_0028_100EDF18A12D9B48"/>
the Jerſeys, that would be fully ſufficient to have Mr. Weeks arraigned, condemned and hanged!</p>
            <p>Iſrael Lacey being <hi>ſworn,</hi> depoſed, that he was a lodger in Mr. Ring's houſe at the time Miſs Sands diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeared. That he came home that evening, about ten o'clock, and in about four minutes after, went to bed along with his companion, Mr. Ruſſel; that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his, the deponent's ſtay at that houſe, he did not perceive that Mr. Weeks appeared more attentive to Miſs Sands than to any of the other females about the houſe. That upon the night of Miſs Sands' diſappear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and on the enſuing night; he did not hear any noiſe in Mr. Weeks' room: that on the contrary, in all his actions he appeared to be as cool, tranquil and collected as ever. That he underſtood Mr. Ring had expreſſed himſelf to this purpoſe: That it would be no harm to ſhoot Mr. Weeks, if it could be done without diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery.</p>
            <p>Mr. Duſtan being <hi>ſworn,</hi> depoſed, that on Friday laſt, a man, at that time unknown to him, but whom he afterwards knew to be Mr. Croucher, had come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his ſtore, between 6 and 8 o'clock in the morning, who ſaluted them with "good morning, gentlemen— Levi Weeks is taken up by the high ſheriff—Some more freſh proof will be brought forward againſt him —A material evidence will come forward from Hackenſack." After announcing his name to be Croucher, he took his leave, apparently having no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther buſineſs than to communicate this news.</p>
            <p>Hugh M'Dougal being <hi>ſworn,</hi> depoſed, That he had for ſome time paſt been acquainted with Mr. Croucher, concerning whom, however, he did not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain the moſt favorable opinion: that upon going through Greenwich ſtreet about the 2d of January, and paſſing the houſe of Mr. Ring, he found Mr. Crouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er amazingly aſſiduous in drawing in the multitude who came paſt, to view the corpſe: that he mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a variety of circumſtances againſt Mr. Weeks, in

the propagation of which he appeared very diligent that the ſaid Croucher had been occaſionally in the ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bit of coming to his (the deponent's) houſe with ſuch articles as ſhawls, &amp;c. to ſell; that he made it a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral point to come at dinner time, but not liking him, his viſits were not welcome; that he had told his wife if Mr. Croucher ſhould come with more goods, ſhe ſhould tell him that if they wanted any they would call upon him: that upon Thurſday laſt he had called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him while buſy in his garden, and his ſole buſineſs appeared to be, to inform him of freſh evidence from the Jerſeys: To which the deponent replied, that as a difference had ſubſiſted between him and Mr. Weeks, his conduct appeared to him to be extremely indelicate and improper; and that for his part, notwithſtanding all the tales which might be propagated to Mr. Weeks <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>dence, were brought forward to depoſe, that on the evening of the 22d of December, he had ſupped at a houſe in the Bowery, in which he continued from ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>down or before that period till nearly eleven o'clock at night, during which time he could not have been gone ten minutes from the houſe without being miſſing. Mrs. Brown, who reſides in the upper end of the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery, depoſed, that upon the anniverſary of her child's birth-day, ſhe had invited ſome friends to ſupper, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom was Mr. Croucher, who continued in the houſe from about half paſt four till eleven o'clock in the evening: but upon being more particularly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, ſhe could with great difficulty condeſcend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the preciſe day, on which this birth-day feaſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened.</p>
            <p>A School-Madam, who lives in that vicinity, being <hi>ſworn,</hi> depoſed, that ſhe had on the evening of Mrs. B.'s child's birth-day, been at her houſe, during the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of the day, along with ſeveral other perſons, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:037576_0030_100EDF1ABAB305F8"/>
whom Mr. Croucher was one, who continued there from about ſun-down till about eleven o'clock. On being queſtioned on what day this happened, ſhe could not tell. Whether before or after Chriſtmas ſhe could not recollect. Was it on a Sunday or week day—ſhe could not at firſt remember: but at laſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented that it was on a Sunday: but what particular Sunday, ſhe could not expreſsly determine.</p>
            <p>Two more perſons, who were ſaid to have been preſent at this birth-day feaſt, depoſed, that Mr. Crou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher had been one of the party, and that he continued in the houſe from about ſun-down till towards eleven o'clock. They, however, were equally undeciſive with reſpect to the month and day on which this tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action happened as the two preceding evidences.]</p>
            <p>Timothy Crane being ſworn, depoſed, That he boarded ſome time at the houſe of Mr. Ring, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which he could perceive no partiality of Mr. Weeks to either of the girls about the houſe; that the deceaſed was ſometimes more cheerful than at others; that he worked in the ſhop with Mr. L. Weeks, on whoſe conduct he perceived no difference after the abſence of Miſs Sands; that he laid out the work as uſual, and attended to every part of his buſineſs as heretofore.</p>
            <p>John M'Comb being <hi>ſworn,</hi> ſays, That about 6 or 7 o'clock in the evening, his wife and he had gone to the houſe of Mr. E. Weeks, where L. Weeks ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till about 8 o'clock; that ſome time previous to his departure, he ſtood leaning on the back of a chair, liſtening to the converſation which paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween me and his brother, without indicating the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt confuſion or perturbation of mind.</p>
            <p>Amos Mead being <hi>ſworn,</hi> ſays, That on the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the 22d of December, Mr. and Mrs. M'Comb were at the houſe of Mr. E. Weeks; that L. Weeks ſtayed there from about half paſt eight till about ten o'clock, when he went away.</p>

               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:037576_0031_100EDEEE499B2310"/>Ezra Weeks being <hi>ſworn,</hi> ſays, That on the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the 22d of December, L. Weeks had come to his houſe, where he remained till he (the deponent) went to church, and that he did not return till about 5 o'clock in the afternoon: that between 6 and 7, L. Weeks came in and continued till about 8, converſing cheerfully with Mr. and Mrs. M'Comb, and himſelf; that he then left the room and returned in about 20 minutes, ſupped, and talked in his uſual manner, ſpoke about the buſineſs of the enſuing day, took minutes of the work to be done with accuracy, and had the work done with punctuality.</p>
            <p>Charles Thurſton being <hi>ſworn,</hi> ſays, That he wrought in the ſhop with Mr. E. Weeks, firſt as a journeyman, then as a foreman; that upon the report of Miſs Sands being miſſing, Mr. L. Weeks ſtill ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be as attentive to buſineſs as formerly; that the books were kept with the ſame accuracy; that he appeared to be perfectly compoſed in his mind.</p>
            <p>Among the numerous witneſſes who have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mentioned, there were none who, when queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with reſpect to Mr. Weeks's character, did not ſpeak of him in terms of the higheſt applauſe.</p>
            <p>To ſubſtantiate this point, which, however, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be diſputed by nobody, a great number of the moſt reſpectable citizens were called as evidences. And their unanimous opinion with reſpect to him was, that he was a young man of amiable character, and the moſt irreproachable manners; that he was mild, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, benevolent, induſtrious and temperate, and that in ſhort, he was univerſally eſteemed by all who knew him.</p>
            <p>After the examination of the witneſſes, which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued from Monday morning at eleven o'clock, till Wedneſday morning at two, the Counſel for Mr. Weeks, without a ſingle remark upon the teſtimony, ſubmitted the whole to the Court. Mr. Chief Juſtice
