            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </head>
            <p>IT is the high reward of thoſe who have riſked their lives in a <hi>juſt and neceſſary war,</hi> that their names are ſweet in the mouths of men, and every age ſhall know their actions. I am happy in having it in my power, before a polite aſſembly, to expreſs what I think of thoſe who have riſked their lives in the <hi>war of America.</hi> I know my abilities riſe not to a level with ſo great a ſubject, but I love the memory of the men, and it is my hope that the affection which I feel, will be to me inſtead of genius, and give me warm words to advance their praiſes.</p>
            <p>I CONCEIVE it as the <hi>firſt honour</hi> of theſe men, that before they engaged in the war, they ſaw it to be <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>neceſſary.</hi> They were not the vaſſals of a proud

chieftain, rouſing them, in barbarous times, by the blind impulſe of attachment to his family, or engaging them to eſpouſe his quarrel, by the muſic and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments of his ball. They were themſelves the chieftains of their own cauſe, highly inſtructed in the nature of it, and, from the beſt principles of patriotiſm, reſolute to defend it. They had heard the declaration of the court and parliament of Great-Britain, claiming the authority of binding them in <hi>all caſes whatſoever.</hi> They had examined this claim, and found it to be, as to its foundation, groundleſs, as to its nature, tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and as to its conſequences, ruinous to the peace and happineſs of both countries. On this clear appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion and decided judgment of the cauſe, aſcertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their own reaſon, and collected from the beſt writers, it was the noble purpoſe of their minds to ſtand forth in its defence.</p>
            <p>THESE brave men were not ſoldiers by profeſſion, bred to arms, and from a habit of military life attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it. They were the mechanics of the city, the merchants of the counting-houſe, the youths engaged in literary ſtudies, and the huſbandmen the peaceful cultivators of the ſoil. Happy in the ſociability and converſation of the town, the ſimplicity and innocence of the country village, the philoſophic eaſe of acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mic leiſure, and the ſweets of rural life, they wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not a change of theſe ſcenes of pleaſure, for the dangers and calamities of war. It was the pure love of virtue and of freedom, burning bright within their minds, that alone could engage them to embark in the bold and perilous undertaking.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:016213_0006_0F9BCE598D128AD8"/>THESE brave men were not unacquainted with the circumſtances of their ſituation, and their unprepared ſtate for war. Not a bayonet was anvilled out, not a fire-arm manufactured, and ſcarcely a charge for a fire-arm was in their poſſeſſion. No redoubt was caſt up to ſecure the city, no fort was erected to reſiſt inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, no gun mounted on the deck of any veſſel, and no veſſel launched upon the ſtream of any river.</p>
            <p>THE power of Britain, on the other hand, was well known, and by the lightning of her orators, in a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand writings and harangues, had been thrown, in full force, upon their minds. They were taught to believe her (what indeed ſhe was) old in arts and in arms, and enriched with the ſpoils of a thouſand victories deriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the ancient captains and the heroes of her iſle. Embraced by the ocean as her favourite, her commerce was extenſive, and ſhe ſent out her ſhips of war to every ſea. Her thunder was heard in the Eaſt-Indies and the Weſt, and no fort or battery on the ſhore had been proof to her aſſault. Abounding in men, her armies were in full force, her fleets were compleatly manned, her diſcipline was regular, and the ſpirit of her enterprize by ſea and land, had, in moſt caſes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured her ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>THE idea of reſiſtance to the power of Britain was indeed great; but the mighty ſoul of the patriot drank it in, and, like the eagle on the ſummit of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, collected magnanimity from the very proſpect of the height to which he meant to ſoar. Like the ſteed, who ſwallows the diſtant ground with his fierceneſs <note n="*" place="bottom">Book of Job.</note>,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:016213_0007_0F9BCE59A0A744A8"/>
he attempted the career, and poured himſelf upon the race.</p>
            <p>THE patriot quits his ſhop, his farm, his office, and his counting-houſe, and with every hope and every anxious thought prepares himſelf for war. The mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials of gun-powder are extracted from the earth; the bayonet is anvilled out; the fire arm is manufactured in the ſhop; the manual exerciſe is taught; the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany is formed in battalion; the battalion is inſtructed to manoeuvre on the field; the brigade is drawn forth; and the ſtandard of defiance is planted on the ſoil.</p>
            <p>SHALL I mention the circumſtances of the day when the ſword was drawn, and the firſt blood was ſhed; and ſhall I trace the progreſs of the war in the courſe of five campaigns: The war of the enemy, which, like the ocean whence it came, rolled its angry waves and beat upon our coaſts, now ebbing and retiring to it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and now ſwelling, with a refluent tide, the ſeveral bays that open to receive the rivers of America: The war of the American, which, like the bold and ſteady winds that paſs his mountains, met and tempeſted the ocean, whoſe waves were ſeen to roll, and break, and daſh upon the ſhore. Or ſhall I drop the figure, and relate, in ſimple language, in what manner it has been fought from Canada to Georgia, and from Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia to Canada; from the ocean to the mountain, and from the mountain to the ocean.</p>
            <p>THE narration would require the ſpace of an intire day: I can mention but the ſum of things; and only tell you that the inroad of the foe has been ſuſtained upon
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:016213_0008_0F9BCE5A58918D00"/>
the plain, and the forward and impetuous bands have been driven over the diſdaining ground which they had meaſured in advance. The hill has been defended, and the rallying and repulſed, and repulſed and rallying foe, has been taught to underſtand that the valour of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica was worthy of the cauſe which her freemen had eſpouſed. The wilderneſs has been penetrated, and the current of the river has been ſtemmed, and the ridge of hills has been ſurmounted in the march. The north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern plains have been rendered hoſtile to the Briton, and the proud city, thought impregnable, was ſcarcely ſafe, when, by the combined fury of the two advancing bands, ſhe was made to ſhake beneath the ſtorm of winter and of war. The ſouthern plains have been rendered hoſtile to the Briton, and the inſurrection has been quelled, and the iſland and the fort has been defended. The mid-land plains have been rendered hoſtile to the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and here it has been fought, foot to foot, and point to point, in ſkirmiſhes, and night-ſurprizes, and in pitched battles, with alternate hope, and dubious ſucceſs for many hours. The enemy, beaten in one ſtate has retired to a ſecond, and beaten in the ſecond he has returned to the firſt; and beaten in every ſtate he has ſought the water, and like a ſea monſter roll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his native element, the deep, has waſhed his wounds in the brine of ocean: Riſing from the ocean he has ſought the land, and advanced with a ſlow and ſuſpicious ſtep upon the hoſtile territory. War has again ariſen, and it has been fought from ſpring to autumn, and from autumn to the ſpring, through the heats of ſummer, and the inclemencies of winter, with
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:016213_0009_0F9BCE5B0EC36758"/>
the moſt unabated ardour, and unſhaken perſeverance. What tract of country has not been <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> with the veſtiges of war? What ground has not been cut with trenches? What hill has not been covered with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubts? What plain has not been made the ſcene of the engagement? What ſoil of the whole earth has not been ſowed with ball?</p>
            <p>GREAT, in the mean time, have been the labours of the ſoldier marching to receive the enemy in every ſtate. Deſiſting from the march for a ſhort night, he has ſlept without tent or covering, expoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſummer winds and autumnal dews; or in the ſolſtitial month, he has built his hut, without nail or hammer, and, on the bleak hill, has outwatched the cold ſtars, centinels of the winter ſky.</p>
            <p>THESE have been the toils of the heroes of our army: But thoſe brave ſouls whom we this day more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly celebrate, have added more than toils reſulting from the calamities of life, even life itſelf. They have withdrawn from the embraces of their friends; quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted every fond hope of eminence in life, an idea very dear and flattering to the minds of men; they have bid farewel to the ſun and moon, and the ſweet changes of the varied year; they have ruſhed to war, and have fallen in the conteſt.</p>
            <p>THESE of them have fallen in the long and labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous march, worn out with the toils of the protrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ſevere campaign. Theſe have fallen by the fever of the camp, amidſt the unavailing tears of their companions. Theſe have fallen by the ſlow approach of waſting hunger, when, for many days, it has been
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:016213_0010_0F9BCE5BD0D89B58"/>
heard in the priſon-ſhip <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, "There is no bread." Theſe of them have fallen by wounds not at once mortal. Theſe have fallen when advancing on the enemy, they have received the bayonet in their breaſt; or high in hope, and anxious of victory <note n="*" place="bottom">Thucydides.</note>, they have inſtantly dropt, by the cannon or the muſket ball.</p>
            <p>FOR what cauſe did theſe brave men ſacrifice their lives? For that cauſe which, in all ages, has engaged the hopes, the wiſhes, and endeavours of the beſt men, <hi>the cauſe of Liberty.</hi> LIBERTY! thou art indeed va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable; the ſource of all that is good and great upon the earth! For thee, the wiſe and the brave of every age have contended. For thee, the patriot of America has drawn his ſword, and has fought, and has fallen.</p>
            <p>WHAT was in our power we have done with regard to the bodies of theſe men: we have paid them mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary honours: we have placed them in their native earth; and it is with veneration that we yet view their tombs upon the furzy glade, or on the diſtant hill. Aſk me not the names of theſe. The muſes ſhall tell you of them, and the bards ſhall woo <note n="†" place="bottom">Plato.</note> them to their ſongs. The verſe which ſhall be ſo happy as to embrace the name of one of theſe ſhall be immortal. The names of theſe ſhall be read with the names of Pelopidas, Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minondas, and the worthies of the world. Poſterity ſhall quote them for parallels, and for example. When they mean to dreſs the hero with the faireſt praiſe, they ſhall ſay he was gallant and diſtinguiſhed in his early fall, as Warren; he was virtuous, and prudent, and intrepid, as Montgomery; he was young, and
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:016213_0011_0F9BCE5C8FFA8BB0"/>
faithful, and generous, as Macpherſon; he fell in the bold and reſolute advance, like Haſlet and like Mercer; he ſaw the honour which his valour had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, and fainted in the arms of victory, like Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kimer; having gallantly repulſed the foe, he fell co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with wounds, in his old age, like Wooſter.</p>
            <p>The names of theſe brave men ſhall be read; and the earth ſhall be happy, where their bodies are depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited. Happy hills of Boſton, where the God of arms gave uncommon valour to the patriot. Here the muſes ſhall obſerve the night, and hymn heroic acts, and trim their lighted lamps to the dawn of morning. The little babbling Myſtic brook, ſhall hear the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lody, and, ſtealing with a ſilver foot, ſhall tell it to the ocean. Happy hills within proſpect of New-York, where the enemy, rejoicing in his early ſtrength, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured and fought, and where, detracting the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, he fled, with precipitation to his ſhips: On theſe hills the tomb of the hero is beheld, and fancy walking round covers it with wild and romantic ſhades. Happy grounds in the neighbourhood of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia, where the foreigner ſhall enquire the field of battle, and the citizen ſhall ſay with conſcious pride, as if the honour was his own, this is the tomb of Witherſpoon; that is the ground where the noble Naſh fell, Happy plains waſhed by the Aſhley and the Cooper, and before the walls of Charleſtown, where the brave Lincoln now turns away the fury of the enemy <note n="*" place="bottom">Virgil.</note>: Here has the hero fallen, or rather he has riſen to eternal honour, and his birth-place ſhall be immortal. His fame, like a veſtal lamp, is lighted up:
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:016213_0012_0F9BCE5E1FE4DF08"/>
It ſhall burn, with the world for its temple; and the fair aſſemblies of the earth ſhall trim it with their praiſe.</p>
            <p>I WILL felicitate America through all her plains, and on all her bending rivers: Rivers over whom did the ſhade of ſilence brood, and, rolling down, you had it not to tell of feats of valour to the liſtening groves. The Kennebec could not tell of an adventrous band which had ſtemmed his current, and from the cataract and the ridge of hills, had advanced beyond his ſource. The great St. Lawrence could not tell of naval bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles which had been fought upon his lakes, or of engagements near his tide; but moved ſilent, though majeſtical, along the antient Huron, and Algonquin plains. The Hudſon could convey no account from the heights where the valiant Gates was ſucceſsful: heights where though the tombs of the enemy are chiefly ſeen, yet becauſe they were brave, I will admit you to renown, and clothe you with my praiſes <note n="*" place="bottom">Longinus.</note>: Even there ſhall the foot of bards wander, and the muſes ſhall delight to dwell. The Delaware, noble river, that rolls by theſe walls <note n="†" place="bottom">Philadelphia</note>, could relate of no fort de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended on his iſland, or fort defended on his bank: The fort of Red-bank, where Donop, advancing, fell with three hundred of his followers, and on the eighth day, expiring with his wounds, penitentially exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<q>I fall a victim to my own ambition, and the avarice of my prince, but deeply ſenſible of the kind treatment I have received from my enemy!</q>
For this penitential ſigh, and the juſt tribute of thy praiſe, O Donop, I will mix thee with the fame of heroes, and on thy memory drop a tear.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:016213_0013_0F9BCE5ECE3BF778"/>BUT why drop a tear? I will lift my eye to fairer proſpects, the woods, and the plains, and the rivers of America. Smile, O woods! exult, O plains! and be not inſenſible, O rivers! of the fame to which you are advanced. When, O rivers! you roll your waters to the ocean, tell her that ſhe wake not the heroes who ſleep upon your banks; chide her, that ſhe roll her billows ſoftly to the ſhores. Nay, chide her not; for ſhe herſelf has become partial to our ſhores: The ocean has beheld the timber cut from the mountain, the veſſel riſing on the ſtocks, launched upon the ſtream, and maintaining an equal combat, on the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh ſeas, with the ſhip of ſuperior force. The ocean has beheld the valour of our noble captains: when they have fallen, ſhe has embraced their bodies, and has borne them to the riſing ſprings and the green caves concealed beneath her ſurface. Ocean! thou didſt embrace the body of the gallant Weeks, the intrepid Mugford, the adventrous Campbel: Ocean! thou didſt embrace the body of the noble Biddle. Why ſhould the heroes be diſturbed with ſtorms? Ocean! let thy flow be calm over them: Soothe them on thy coral beds, and kiſs them with thy waves.</p>
            <p>The waves of ocean, and the native earth, ſhall em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the bodies of entombed heroes; but the praiſe of men ſhall embrace their fame. The praiſe of France ſhall embrace the fame of the heroes of America; for having early hailed the <hi>riſing ſtars</hi> of theſe ſtates, ſhe will love thoſe, who on theſe ſhores, firſt obſerved their courſe. The praiſe of America, with reciprocal affection, ſhall embrace the fame of France; for having early hailed the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:016213_0014_0F9BCE5F8F206020"/>
virtue of her chiefs, who, with the ſpeed and the pleaſant breath of the vernal gales over the Atlantic wave, ruſhed to our aſſiſtance, ſhe has loved them; and when they have fallen, ſhe has placed their bodies with her own heroes, and their fame in the weſtern heavens, that it may remain to tell to future huſband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men what we owe to the illuſtrious houſe of Bourbon. France! with the laurels acquired on our ſoil, thou haſt planted ſprigs of the cypreſs: But let it not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent thee to have ſhed thy blood in the noble cauſe of America. In this thou haſt become <hi>Protector of the rights of mankind</hi>; and the fame of Louis XVI. is lighted up for immortality. It ſhall burn above the circle of the night, and the wide fields of heaven ſhall retain its luſtre.</p>
            <p>HAVING paid that reſpect to the memory of theſe men, which the annual return of this day demanded, it remains that we ſoothe the griefs of thoſe who have been deprived of a father, bereaved of a ſon, or who have loſt a brother, a huſband, or a lover in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt. Fathers, whoſe heroic ſons have offered up their lives in the debate; it is yours to recollect, that their lives were given them for the ſervice of their country. They have paid the debt; and they ſhall be ſenſible of joy, when, with you, in a ſtate of nobler and more bliſsful exiſtence, they ſhall behold their name<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> written on the jaſper walls and pearl ſhining <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

Ruſſel, Locke, and Newton, who, while he caſts his eyes upon the orbs of heaven, ſhall ſometimes drop his attention to their mighty revolutions, and ſhall read the inſcription. Great ſouls of ancient, and great ſouls of modern time! You ſhall read the names of a Gardiner, a Parker, a Cheeſman, a Hendricks, a Veſey, a Bowey, a Perry, a Knolton: The names of a Leech, a Waters, a Baxter, a Yates, a Morris, a Fleming, an Anderſon: The names of a Buſh, a Houſton, a White, a Shelburne, a Bonner, a Haymond, a Dickinſon, a Huger, and a Roberts: The names of a thouſand officers and ſoldiers, worthies of the earth, and bright lights of heaven; who, by the cruelty of the enemy, the miſtake of the centinel, or the bold emprize <note n="*" place="bottom">Spencer.</note> of valour, have fallen in the cauſe of America.

            <p>THE names of theſe ſhall be read more eſpecially by the early navigators and the firſt diſcoverers of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica: The great Columbus, who with heaven-taught ſagacity and mighty reach of thought, conceived the apprehenſion of a continent towards the weſt; with unconquerable fortitude of mind explored the ſea un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, big with ſtorms; and with greatly-merited ſucceſs, attained theſe ſhores: Americo Veſputius

the Florentine, who from the pleaſing relation which he writ of his voyages, ſubſequent to the diſcovery of Columbus, was fortunate to give his name to this continent: Cabot, who coaſted North-America from the bay of Mexico to the cold ſeas, where the icy mountains roll; Raleigh, who firſt hailed the native of Guiana, and the native at the mouth of the Roanoque: You, mighty ſouls! ſhall behold the riſing glory of the <hi>new world,</hi> which you had diſcovered: You ſhall hail the independence of the States, and ſhall read the names of thoſe who have aſſiſted to eſtabliſh them.</p>
            <p>THE names of theſe ſhall be read with equal admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration by the early ſettlers of America: Men pious, and virtuous, and ſimple in their mode of life; who hating tyranny, and loving liberty civil and religious; quitted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their native iſland, adventured on the ocean, penetrated to theſe ſhores, and choſe a reſidence at once the boundary and the object of their emigrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Men patient and laborious, who with induſtry cut the tree from the mountain, ſwept the foreſt from the ſoil, erected habitations, and changed the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to fields of paſture and to cultivated vallies: A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and bold band of brothers, who rouſed the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in the brake, the indian, and the wild beaſt, and fought againſt the warrior of Europe, rendered hoſtile becauſe of their connection with Britain, once fondly called the Mother-Country: An unwearied, a vigilant, a deceaſed, but immortal race of men, who, as hewn pillars at the bottom of the building, have ſupported the ſtrength and dignity and riches, and gradually-riſing renown of America. O ſky-inhabiting progenitors!

you ſhall read the exertions of theſe your immediate deſcendents, who have retributed to Britain for the injuries and oppreſſions, and diſdains you had received from her: Who have quelled her invaſion, quenched her fire <note n="*" place="bottom">Armſtrong.</note>, repelled her hoſts, humbled her ſpirit, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected her arrogance, and erected a trophy on the ample and diſtinguiſhed field of gloriouſly purchaſed victory.

            <p>SONS, whoſe heroic fathers have early left you, and, in the conflict of the war, have mixed with departed heroes; be congratulated on the fair inheritance of fame which you are entitled to poſſeſs. If it is at all lawful to array ourſelves in borrowed honour, ſurely it is beſt drawn from thoſe who have acted a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed part in the ſervice of their country. If it is at all conſiſtent with the feelings of philoſophy and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to boaſt of lineal glory, ſurely it is moſt allowable in thoſe who boaſt of it as flowing from truly patriot anceſtors. We ſhall deſpiſe the uninſtructed mind of that man who ſhall obtrude upon our ears the idea of a vain anceſtral honour; but we ſhall love the youth, and transfer to him the reputation of his father, who, when the rich and haughty citizen ſhall frown upon him as ignobly deſcended, ſhall only ſay with modeſty.

I had a father who has fallen in the ſervice of his country.</p>
            <p>SISTERS of the youth who has fallen in the conteſt with the tyrant: He was yours in his early bloom, and in his more advanced years; he was yours in the evening walk; at the morning hour; in the ſeveral hours of unclouded happineſs: He was yours while he could be yours conſiſtent with the will of heaven, that he ſhould be ranked with the heroes of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Siſters! weep not the youth as the ſiſters wept Phaeton on the banks of Eridanus: He alſo was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventrous, and mounted, aſpiringly, a glorious car; but no foul ambition entered to his mind; and no devious error marked his way. Serene and unmoved from his courſe, he illumined the tract through which he rode; and though his orb is ſet, it is but to new-dreſs his beams <note n="**" place="bottom">Milton.</note>, and to flame with freſh-ſpangled luſtre in the forehead <note n="**" place="bottom">Milton.</note> of a brighter ſky.</p>
            <p>MATRONS once joined in the bliſs of connubial af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; but with attentive eye you have not beheld the the huſband of your fond expectation returning from war <note n="†" place="bottom">Oſſian.</note>.

though he has departed to Elyſium. But why ſhould you weep? The praiſes of your country, and of the world ſhall conſole you It is now yours to direct alone the education of your children: The ſphere of honour is but enlarged to you; and the path is laid open by which you may aſcend to memory in future ages, and be ranked with Cornelia amongſt the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</p>
            <p>VIRGINS, whom in a few revolving moons the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meneal chain was to bind; but the youth who had long ſighed for you, and thought to deſerve you by his valour, has ruſhed to the war, and has fallen in the battle: Virgins! I do not mean to reſtrain your tears, or to ſay that you ſhall not mourn: I only aſk that you bend not in ſorrow o'er the earth where the hero is entombed. Here, can the hero be entombed? He lives, O Virgins! he lives in yonder heavens: His fame kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles bright above you: His worth ſhall be mentioned to your honour: His valour ſhall array you in perpetual ſmiles: The ſhade of age, abaſhed, ſhall not dare to to approach you: and men ſhall ever prize her beauty whom a hero loved.</p>
            <p>SIGHS for departed heroes take their riſe in the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of the heart; but they are arrayed by the object which they mourn, like the blue miſts of the early day, which are tinged by the ſplendent beams of the riſing ſun. Ceaſe, gentle ſighs! though your boſoms are ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayed with light: I cannot hail you now: I mean to addreſs myſelf to the ſurviving heroes of my country. You, I know, weep not the fortune of theſe men; you rather envy them. But why, my countrymen,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:016213_0021_0F9BCE64CE77EF08"/>
ſhall envy of immortal actions touch your breaſts? Your wounds and ſervices are honourable alſo. You have met the inroad of the bold invaſion; you have mixed in the riſing and renewed war. Venturing on the burning edge of the engagement, you have cloſed the furrowed ranks: And when the enemy have preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed advantage, you have gallantly reſtored the battle; and the day won againſt hoſtile numbers, and boaſted diſcipline has crowned you with the ever-greens of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; and when after times ſhall ſpeak of theſe who have riſen to renown, you alſo ſhall be mentioned with them. I will charge it to the golden-winged and ſilver-tongued bards, that they recollect and ſet in order eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry circumſtance; the cauſes of the war; your early and juſt exertions; your many toils; your hazardous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements; your noble reſolution; your unſhaken perſeverence; your unabated ardour; your hopes in the worſt of times; your triumphs in the days of victory; your humanity, and god-like ſpirit of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs to an undeſerving enemy: All theſe will I charge it, that they recollect and ſet in order, and give them bright and unſullied to the coming ages.

With peculiar pleaſure they ſhall convey the fame of WASHINGTON, and of you, my gallant country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who now repel the enemy upon the plains clothed with your former victories: Waſhington, on whoſe early brow the honours of a former war had budded: who had drawn fire and experience from the valour he reſiſted, contending with the noble power of France:
