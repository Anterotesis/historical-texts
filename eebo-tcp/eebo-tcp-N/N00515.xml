            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Sermon here presented unto you, was Delivered in your Audience; by that unworthy Instrument, who did formerly spend some years among you, in the work of the <hi>Ministry,</hi> though attended with manifold <hi>sinful failings</hi> and infirmities, for which I do <hi>implore,</hi> the Pardoning <hi>Mercy</hi> of God in Jesus Christ, and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat</hi> from you the <hi>Covering</hi> of Love. As this was prepared, for that Particular Occasion, when it was delivered amongst you; so the <hi>Publication</hi> of it, is to be Particularly recommended to your service.</p>
            <p>My hearts <hi>desire,</hi> and Continual <hi>Prayer,</hi> to God for you ALL is; that you may be <hi>saved</hi> in the day of the Lord Jesus Christ, and accordingly that all means He is using with you, by <hi>Mercies</hi> &amp; <hi>Afflictions, Ordinances</hi> and <hi>Providences,</hi> may be Sanctifyed, to the building you up in G<hi>race</hi> and <hi>Holyness,</hi> and preparing you for the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of Glory. We are told by the <hi>Apostle,</hi> Acts 14. 22: <hi>That through many Tribulations, we must enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> Now since (besides your share in the Common <hi>Calamities,</hi> under the burden whereof, this poor people are <hi>groaning</hi> at this time the Righteous and Holy God, hath been pleased

            <p>AMongst all the great and sore Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, with which the Soveraign and Holy God, hath visited this his Poor People; there is none more full of <hi>amazing</hi> Considerations, and <hi>Distressing</hi> Influences, than that of his Permitting Satan, to Range and Rage in the midst of us, by his direful Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <hi>Afflicting</hi> some in a most fearful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual manner, and accordingly <hi>accusing</hi> others, as the Instruments of his malice, in those Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical Tortures; And how much <hi>further</hi> it may proceed, or <hi>longer</hi> it shall continue, is only known to him, Who <hi>giveth no Account of his Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> to any of the Children of men.</p>
            <p>I being Occasionally at S<hi>alem</hi>-Village, upon a visit when this Affliction was newly; come upon them, was desired to Preach among them; and this <hi>D</hi>iscourse (for the substance of it) was then Delivered. The Copy whereof being desired, by some Friends here, who were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to Contribute towards the publication of it; Not knowing but that God which gives S<hi>eed to the Sower, and Bread to the Eater.</hi> Who

I have yielded to their desire, that it might be thus exposed to publick view. Which also I have, much the rather done, that I may (the best I can at so great a distance as the other <hi>England</hi>) make humble tender of most dutiful Observances, to my Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured Father (if yet on this side the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of Eternal Rest) as a Pepper-corn ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment, of all his unrequiteable <hi>Care, Cast,</hi> and <hi>Pains,</hi> in my Education; Entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Acceptance, of what I hope I may truly say, the Lord hath <hi>brought unto me,</hi> that his Soul may <hi>Bless the before he dyes:</hi> And that I may obtain the continuance of those servent Prayers, and affectionate benedictions, in the Name of God; which I have throughout my whole life been under the refreshing influences of; but more especially, since I was called to the Ministry; as appears by a Letter directed to me, at <hi>Martha's Vineyard,</hi> Dated <hi>January</hi> 20 1676. wherein he bespeaks me, and God for me, in such Expressions as these. <q>And will the Lord Remember for me his Glorious Name; A God hearing Prayer; and make my heart rejoyce even mine, in a Son whose Eyes the Lord hath opened, and whose heart as <hi>Japhets</hi> he hath perswaded and enlarged,
<pb facs="unknown:000643_0010_0FA961C98D25EFB0"/>
to serve him in that work, whereunto Parents had designed him; and for which they begged him as a loan. And hath the Lord allured you: and brought you into a wilderness, to speak comfortably unto you; and give you <hi>Vineyards from thence,</hi> And will the Lord Indeed, Zach 10, 9. Take of my seed, and sow among the Gentiles, to remember him in far countries <hi>that they may live with their Children, and turn again.</hi> Gen 49: 18. <hi>I wait for by salvation O Lord.</hi> And Praise waits in silence, from my soul in, Zion, when he shall further evidence his Return to you in mercy, and your Return to him in Covenanted Duty. Now the good Lord; who hath pleased to put you into his service, put a Rich anointing of his Spirit upon you, Make you <hi>Wisehearted, skilful, Faithful, Painful,</hi> and <hi>Successful</hi> in the service of his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle; and set many a Pearl in your Crown, in Conversion of Sinners, and Edification of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts. The Lord T<hi>he Angel of the Covenant, that Redeems my soul from all evil,</hi> Bless you, and lay the Foundations of a Family for you in Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness: so building up my house in yours, and yours in wholly a <hi>Right seed,</hi> that may be accounted to him for a <hi>generation,</hi> that he may build up his own in both. (that so you and yours may do worthily in <hi>Ephratha,</hi> and Famous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>Israel.</hi> Now to him <hi>that is able to keep you from falling, and to Build you up, and give

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I Commend you with Incessant Prayers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> With the same fervour of Holy Zeal and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, he exprest himself by Letters to Mr. <hi>Thomas Mayhew,</hi> late Governour of <hi>Martha's</hi> Vineyard; that good old <hi>Simeon,</hi> who about Ten Years ago, had his <hi>Nunc dimittis,</hi> into the Mansions of <hi>E</hi>verlasting <hi>Peace;</hi> particularly upon the Receipt of <hi>L</hi>etters, from the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of <hi>Boston</hi> concerning me. Thus his Letter begins. <q>I understand by Letters from my Son, that the Lord hath lengthened out your life, to a good old age, and Crowned your grey Head with a Gracious Heart, found in the way of Righteousness, which I longed to hear, and rejoyce much at the hearing of; as good News from a far Country; But much more, in those Concomitant Letters, from several Ministers, whose Praise is in the <hi>G</hi>ospel; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending my Son <hi>Deodat</hi> with their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current Testimonies, of his walking in the Truth, with his Yoke-fellow, in all Godly Conversation, as Heirs of the Grace of Life, for which my heart rejoyceth in the Lord, as seeing the Priat of the Fingers, as a Return of Prayer upon it. Blessed be the God of <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> into whose Living Arms, his Dying Mother (within a few weeks after his birth,) by the hand of Faith presented him, and by Prayer Dedicated him
<pb facs="unknown:000643_0012_0FA961CB0F012408"/>
to his Service in the Gospel.</q> And Oh! that these pious Wishes, and fervent prayers, may be heard and answered by the Lord accordingly.</p>
            <p>However the serious Consideration, of such a solemne Designation of me, by both my Parents, to the service of God in the Ministry; Secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by my Fathers proportionable endeavours, in my Education (both in Schoole and Colledge learneing) hath engaged my heart and soul, to attend thereunto, if so the will of the Lord be. And whereas by my Fathers being silenced, and his Estate much weakened, I was hindred of some Academical Preferments, and after-Six Yeares Standing at Colledg, necessitated to make digression to secular affaires; yet I found from time to time, the Soveraigne Providence of God, in a continued series, disappointing, and frown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon me: so that I trust, the Lord hath been by his Grace and Spirit, carrying on a good work in my Soul, thereby the better to fit me, for future service to him and his People in my generation. Under the influence of these considerations, I have still reserved my self at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, from worldly entanglements any further then duty bound me, to prevent <hi>Infidel-Negligence</hi> of my Family. I <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 8. And I do seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously declare; that whatsoever hath hindred, my whole and sole, devoting my <hi>Time, Strength,</hi> and <hi>All,</hi> to the service of God in the Ministry; hath
<pb facs="unknown:000643_0013_0FA961CE190CA8A0"/>
been for many years, and still is, my burthen and not my choice.</p>
            <p>Although the Unkindnesses, and Reflections, hard Travails and difficulties; I have met with, in that service, had long ere now, Totally discouraged me, had not the Lord by the assistance of his grace, strongly inclined me thereunto. Out of design to glorify God therein, and not for any secular advantages accruing thereby. And I do further profess, that I do earnestly desire, by divine assistance to Do all, and Be all, unto the Glory of God; declaring, that whatsoever either in word or deed, I have been overtaken by, tending to the dishonour of God, or the grief of any sincere souls, I do desire, and will endeavour, by the assistance of his Grace and Spirit to reform it; though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so <hi>pleasing</hi> to the Flesh, or agreeable to Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Constitution, and be humbly thankful, to such as shall give me notice thereof. Or did I know and duty I allowed my self in the neglect of, I would by the help of the same grace, come up to the practice of it, tho' never so <hi>contrary</hi> to Flesh and Blood. And wherein I have at any time, given just offence, to the meanest of those that fear the Lord, I do heartily beg their <hi>Pitty</hi> and <hi>Prayers,</hi> that the God of all grace, would pardon and heal, what is past for his names sake. strengthning my soul, in all holy resolutions, and endeavours, to walk more <hi>Circumspectly</hi> for the future, <hi>Redeeming the time,</hi> or trading with it, to my Spiritual and
<pb facs="unknown:000643_0014_0FA961CF47234D10"/>
Eternal advantage; in all things <hi>Adorning the Doctrine, of God my Saviour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And although, in thus obliging my soul to God, I do labour under many sinful frailties and Infirmities yet the sincerity of my heart in the maine, is now before the Omniscient God, and will be revealed, when Jesus Christ shall Judge the secrets of all hearts, at his appearance and his Kingdom. I commit these things to the Readers Consideration, and the Ensuing discourse to his Perusal: Earnestly intreating, the incessant Prayers, of all my <hi>Relations, Friends</hi> and <hi>Readers,</hi> that the Lord would please to assist me, by his Holy Spirit to <hi>Do</hi> or <hi>Suffer,</hi> whatsoever he shall call me unto, in my passage through this vail o teares: To the Glory of his Great Name, and the good of others, that so I may, in the Day of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, inherit that <hi>Blessedness,</hi> which shall be the everlasting portion, of <hi>that servant whom his Lord when he cometh, shall find so doing.</hi> Who am</p>

            <p>IT seemed good to the Great and Glorious God, the Infinite and Eternal <hi>ELOHIM</hi> in the beginning, to Create the <hi>Heavens</hi> and the <hi>Earth;</hi> and together <hi>with</hi> and <hi>in</hi> the Third Heavens, a numberless

number of glorious <hi>Angels;</hi> that were Ordained to <hi>do</hi> his Pleasure, and <hi>obey</hi> his Commands. To these he appointed (as a <hi>tryal</hi> of their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience) a <hi>Ministration</hi> in this lower world, for the good of the Children of Men, and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of the <hi>Heirs of Salvation.</hi> But a number of these <hi>Intelligent Spirits,</hi> being unwilling (as some Learned conceive) to yield their Service to man, of so much an inferiour nature to themselves being made of Earth: They Rebelled against the Will of their Soveraign Lord and Creator; For which their <hi>borrid</hi> Transgression, they were by the Righteous Judgment of God; thrust down from that Glorious Place, which was once Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be <hi>their own Habitation,</hi> into the Lake of Eternal Perdition, there to be <hi>Reserved in Chains of Darkness, to the Judgment of the Great Day.</hi> Jude 6. SATAN himself <hi>then,</hi> and all his accursed Legions being Fallen into a miserable and irrecoverable Estate, are filled with Envy <hi>at</hi> and Malice <hi>against,</hi> all Mankind; and do set themselves by all ways and means, to work their Ruine and Destruction for ever: Opposing to the utmost, all <hi>Persons</hi> and <hi>Things,</hi> Appointed by the Lord Jesus Christ, as Means or Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their Comfort here, or Salvation here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. Hence when <hi>Joshua</hi> (the <hi>Type</hi> of JESUS) stood to Minister, as <hi>High Priest</hi> before the Lord, to make Atonemement for the People of his Covenant; SATAN stands at his Right-hand,

to <hi>withstand</hi> and <hi>oppose</hi> him in his Ministrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: which the Blessed Jesus (the <hi>Antitype</hi> of <hi>Joshua</hi>) taking notice of, he doth according to his Soveraign and Irresistible Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority Command Deliverances to his Chosen Ones, by Stilling the <hi>Clamour</hi> and Suppressing the <hi>Power</hi> and Malice of SATAN, their <hi>Grand</hi> Adversary and <hi>Implacable</hi> Opposer, as in the Words now before us; <hi>And the LORD said unto SATAN, the LORD Rebuke thee, O SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAN,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>THESE Words are part of the Prophecy of <hi>Zechariah,</hi> whose Name by Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, signifies the <hi>Remembrance</hi> or <hi>Memory of the Lord,</hi> and his <hi>Title</hi> agrees to the very <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of this Prophecy; which was to put them in mind, what GOD had done <hi>for</hi> them, in delivering them from <hi>Captivity,</hi> and what they had done <hi>against</hi> him by <hi>Iniquity;</hi> that so they might be awakened unto Reformation of what was amiss. He was the <hi>Second Prophet,</hi> that came from the Lord to the People of <hi>Israel,</hi> after their Return from the Babylonish Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity. He was Contemporary and Colleague with <hi>Haggai,</hi> beginning to Prophecy but two Months after him, and backing what the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had said, more briefly, with more full and mysterious Testimonies; especially as to the Coming of the Messiah, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He Warns

The Prophecy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains then, <hi>Exhortations</hi> to true Repentance, dispersed throughout the Prophecy: <hi>Predictions</hi> of many Blessings and Mercies to the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, relating to the Times of the Gospel, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> The <hi>Coming</hi> of the LORD JESUS, the <hi>Calling</hi> of the Gentiles, and the Protection of his Church to the end of the World, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all the <hi>Rage</hi> and <hi>Fury</hi> of his and their Enemies; together with severe <hi>Comminations</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Enemies of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and against the <hi>Impenitent</hi> among themselves; Intermingling <hi>Encouragements</hi> to <hi>Joshua,</hi> and all Leaders, both in <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Sacred</hi> Order, to be Faithful in the <hi>Discharge</hi> of Duty incumbent on them in all respects as the matter might require. These are the principal matters in the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy.</p>
            <p>In this Chapter, we have an account of <hi>Zechariahs Fourth Vision,</hi> concerning the <hi>Resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> and Establishment of the <hi>Priesthood,</hi> and Temple-Worship; and the <hi>Comforts</hi> Redound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Church</hi> from those Administrations;

Typically by <hi>Joshua</hi> the <hi>Brand,</hi> Spiritually and Mystically by JESUS the <hi>Branch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Particularly, First we have the <hi>Conflict</hi> of the A<hi>ngel</hi> of the Lord, that is <hi>Christ,</hi> against SATAN on behalf of <hi>Joshua,</hi> whom, the <hi>Mischievous</hi> (yet seemingly <hi>zealous) Devil,</hi> (transforming into an <hi>Angel of light</hi>) objected against, and <hi>despised,</hi> by reason of his <hi>filthy garments; verse,</hi> 2, 3.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>SATAN</hi> being rebuked for his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, the <hi>cause</hi> of his objection is removed, by take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away the <hi>filthy garments,</hi> and giveing him <hi>change of raiment; verse</hi> 4. And in order to his <hi>New inauguration,</hi> or Enstailment in the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, there is bestowed on him, those ornaments which might Represent him, <hi>full of Splendour,</hi> and fitly qualified for that Office, <hi>verse.</hi> 5.</p>
            <p>Upon his Installment, the <hi>Angel of the Lord</hi> gives him a renewed Charge, in a <hi>Solemn Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation</hi> of the Continuance of his Office, and that he would be with him, and assist him in all Administrations, that were according to his own Institution, <hi>verse</hi> 6, 7.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We have GOD <hi>the</hi> FATHER, Revealing the <hi>Lord Jesus</hi> C<hi>hrist,</hi> the Great and True <hi>High Priest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, Under the Title and Metaphor, of <hi>the BRANCH, Verse</hi> 8.</p>
            <p>Secondly, of a STONE with Eyes, being full of <hi>Providence</hi> and <hi>Wisdom</hi> for the Church <hi>Verse</hi> 9. Adjoyning the <hi>Special Effects,</hi> of his

            <p>Here then, In the first Verse, We have the Representation of <hi>Joshua</hi> the High-Priest, or <hi>Great Priest,</hi> as the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> who was so by Descent, <hi>a great Officer</hi> in the Church, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever mean he was in his Garb, and being a Publick Person, <hi>Represented</hi> the whole Church, And as he C<hi>onducted</hi> the People out of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> and <hi>Rebuilt</hi> the Temple, was a <hi>Type of Christ,</hi> both in his <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Office.</hi> (2) We have the <hi>posture</hi> of this <hi>Joshua; standing</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Angel of the Lord, the Angel of the Covenant, as he is elsewhere called. Now <hi>Joshua</hi> is brought in <hi>Standing</hi> (1) as a <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi> to show Inferiority as sitting, denotes Dignity, and Superiority; As a <hi>Servant</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving Authority, in his Office; from his Lord; As a <hi>Servant</hi> manifesting all <hi>Readiness,</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence</hi> in Obedience. As a <hi>Servant,</hi> to be by his Lord <hi>directed,</hi> as also under his Eye, for <hi>Support</hi> and <hi>Protection.</hi> Or,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Standing, as a <hi>guilty Person;</hi> As one <hi>unworthy</hi> to be imployed, in such <hi>Eminent</hi> service; And as a <hi>Publique Person,</hi> had much to <hi>answer</hi> for the sins of the People, as well as his own.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Here is the <hi>Opposition Joshua</hi> met with, And SATAN <hi>the Adversary;</hi> whose malice appears,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:000643_0021_0FA961D4E3F0AB18"/>
against all good <hi>men,</hi> and good <hi>things</hi> in the world.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We have the <hi>Posture,</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> of SATAN in <hi>Opposing,</hi> and <hi>accusing</hi> of Joshua; <hi>standing at his Right Hand</hi> the <hi>Right Hand</hi> is the place of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuser that being.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Weapon</hi> Hand.</p>

            <p>In this <hi>second verse</hi> we have the LORD ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in the vindication of <hi>Joshua,</hi> from the malicious accusation of <hi>Satan,</hi> according to his <hi>Covenant Mercy,</hi> and <hi>Special Favour</hi> shewed to him, and the People in delivering them from the Babylonish Captivity; Particularly Here we Note.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Person speaking,</hi> the LORD, that is <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> set forth by a Title of Glorious Soveraignty and Power, the LORD-REDEEM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ER, and Restorer of Mercy, to His Covenant People. The LORD-MEDIATOR, <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Head</hi> of His Church; He before whom, <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua</hi> but now stood, as a SOVERAIGN LORD, appears for him, as a <hi>Glorious Advocate,</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercessor.</hi>

but a <hi>vain thing</hi> for thee, O S<hi>atan,</hi> to move me against them, I know their <hi>faults,</hi> but I will now admit no further <hi>accusations,</hi> being resolved to <hi>perfect</hi> my Mercy to them, <hi>Is not this a Brand pluckt out of the Fire?</hi> The <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> Word rendred <hi>Brand,</hi> signifies Light and Sparkling on Fire, so that it would have been <hi>utterly burnt up,</hi> if the <hi>L</hi>ord had not been <hi>exceeding Merciful;</hi> and therefore nothing but <hi>Diabolical</hi> C<hi>ruelty,</hi> could put it into the Fire again, the like Expression we have, Amos 4. 11. <hi>Ye are as Brand pluckt out of the Burning,</hi> The Sum is here then; I have (<hi>qs. d.</hi>) but now graciously delivered them, and I will not by any of thy <hi>Malicious</hi> C<hi>lamours,</hi> be moved to <hi>Reject</hi> or Afflict them.</p>
            <p>The Doctrine then is:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the LORD JESUS CHRIST, is the only Prevalent Intercessor with GOD the FATHER, for the relief of those that are in Covenant with him, &amp; are made partakers of his special mercy; when they are under the most threatning and amazing distresses, that by therage and malice of Satan they can be exposed unto.</hi>

               <p>In a word, what was foretold concerning <hi>Ishmael,</hi> is in the most <hi>absolute sense</hi> true of him, Gen. 16. 12 <hi>His Hand is against every Man, and every Mans Hand is</hi> (or should be) <hi>against him.</hi> Such an <hi>Universal</hi> and <hi>Implacable</hi> Adversary and Enemy is this S<hi>atan.</hi> But to Instance briefly in the <hi>Objects</hi> of his Enmity</p>
               <p n="1">1.

He <hi>fell</hi> from Gods favour at first, by <hi>rebellion,</hi> and hence by his <hi>righteous Judgement,</hi> was doomed to continue, under the power of <hi>irreconcilable enmity,</hi> against him for ever. He is an Enemy to all the <hi>Divine Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes,</hi> and most glorious <hi>Persons</hi> in all their holy designs and operations. To all the Divine Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, <hi>Negative, Positive, Relative,</hi> and Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours by Blasphemous denying them to Eclipse the glory of them; he was a lyar <hi>in</hi> and <hi>from</hi> the beginning, against the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Holyness</hi> of GOD; Gen. 3. 1. <hi>Yea hath</hi> GOD <hi>said</hi> &amp;c. He puts them, upon scrupling the truth of the threatning and in the <hi>fourth verse;</hi> down right denies it, <hi>ye shall not surely by</hi> &amp;c. Herein also he reflected upon the <hi>Holyness</hi> of God,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:000643_0026_0FA961D949658C50"/>
by which he was engaged in that threatning, to advance his own glory; <abbr>
                     <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </abbr> The glory of his justice, by punishing mans transgression with Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>the Death</hi> as is denounced, Gen. 2. 17. <hi>Thou shalt surely dy,</hi> or dy the Death.</p>
               <p>Thus the <hi>Unclean lying satan,</hi> set himself against these <hi>Essential,</hi> and <hi>Inseperable</hi> Attributes, of the <hi>Blessed</hi> God: and in the same manner, doth he <hi>Eclipse</hi> the rest, so far as he is permitted to do it. Again, he is <hi>an Enemy</hi> to all the most glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Persons</hi> in the God-Head; FATHER, SON, and HOLY GHOST, in their <hi>Joynt</hi> Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and <hi>Eternal Decrees,</hi> concerning the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,</hi> and <hi>Salvation</hi> of sinners; by and under the <hi>Mediator;</hi> and he is an <hi>Enemy</hi> to them in their <hi>Distinct Operations,</hi> in a way of <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency,</hi> for the promoting that which is <hi>Holy,</hi> and <hi>Just,</hi> and <hi>Good.</hi> To GOD the FATHER in Managing his <hi>Eternal Purposes</hi> of Grace, to Sinners by and in the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifesting his <hi>Electing Love</hi> unto them, which is <hi>Primarily</hi> and <hi>properly</hi> ascribed to him, <hi>2 Thes.</hi> 2. 13.

Man,</hi> and the more, because he was <hi>Made Flesh,</hi> and shewed such Favour to Mankind, as to <hi>Tabernacle</hi> among them; <hi>John</hi> 1. 14. And indeed, this Humiliation of the SON of GOD <hi>being made Man</hi> gave <hi>Satan</hi> advantage to shew and exercise his <hi>Enmity</hi> against him, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> as he was the <hi>Seed of the Woman,</hi> for as he was the SON of GOD, he could not any way come at him, being <hi>God over all Blessed for ever,</hi> Rom. 9. 5. But when once <hi>Incarnate,</hi> and become an Inhabitant of this <hi>Lower World,</hi> where <hi>Satan</hi> Ranges to and fro continually; then he Spits his <hi>Venemcus Malice</hi> against him, To cut him off by <hi>Herods</hi> bloody Decree, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. 16.

Again, he is the <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> of the HOLY GHOST, as he is the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of <hi>Grace,</hi> Heb. 10. 29. The Spirit of <hi>Truth</hi> John 14. 17.

Hence <hi>Annanias</hi> is said to <hi>Lye</hi> against the HOLY GHOST, or Spirit of Truth, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 3.

do <hi>Despight unto the Holy Spirit of Grace,</hi> Heb. 10. 29. <hi>B</hi>y stirring up men to <hi>Resist</hi> him <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 51. Thus Satan is an Enemy to GOD CREATOR, to GOD-REDEEMER, to GOD SANCTIFIER, in all their <hi>Operations,</hi> and <hi>Designs</hi> of <hi>G</hi>race.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Satan is the GRAND Enemy of all mankind</hi> He is full of Enmity, against the Woman and all her Seed, as Eve was the Mother of all living; Gen. 3. 15. <hi>And I will put enmity betwixt thee and the woman</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Enmity, denotes a principle of Irreconcilable Hatred, an Innate</hi> C<hi>ontrariety; which vents it self in all manner of Endeavour, to prevent the good, and promote the hurt, ruine and destruction of the Object.</hi> This Enmity of <hi>Satan,</hi> appears in the <hi>Names</hi> given him in Scripture, relating to man, as the Object of his Malice; He is called THE A<hi>ccuser,</hi> even <hi>of the Brethren,</hi> Rev 12 10.

of-any meer mortal whatsoever. But</p>
               <p>Particularly here; First, <hi>He is the Enemy of the SOULS of men.</hi> And indeed, this is that he drives at, in all his <hi>designs,</hi> and <hi>operations,</hi> and to catch devour and destroy SOULS; Hence when he draws <hi>wretched mortals,</hi> to Contract with him; He bargains with them, that after the time of his <hi>service</hi> to them, he will have their Souls, <abbr>
                     <hi>viz</hi>
                  </abbr> Intending to Torment them for ever.</p>
               <p>He is a S<hi>pirit,</hi> and hence strikes at the <hi>Spiritual</hi> part the most <hi>Excellent</hi> (Constituent) part of man. Primarily disturbing, and Interrupting, the <hi>Animal</hi> and <hi>Vital</hi> Spirits, he maliciously <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perates</hi> upon, the more <hi>Common Powers</hi> of the Soul, by strange and frightful <hi>Representations</hi> to the Fancy, or Imagination, and by violent, <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> of the body, often threatning to extinguish life; as hath been observed, in those that are afflicted amongst us. And not only so, but he vents his malice, in <hi>Diabolical Operations,</hi> on the more sublime and <hi>distinguishing faculties,</hi> of the <hi>Rational Soul,</hi> raising <hi>Mists</hi> of Darkness, and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, in the <hi>Understanding.</hi> Ephes. 4. 18. 2 Cor. 4. 4: Stirring up, the <hi>innate Rebellion</hi> of the will, though he cannot <hi>force</hi> it unto sin.

<pb n="17" facs="unknown:000643_0031_0FA961E007895240"/>
And <hi>loving the world</hi> (i e) the <hi>Pleasures, Treasures,</hi> and <hi>Honours</hi> thereof, in such a degree as is <hi>inconsistent,</hi> with the love of the <hi>chief good;</hi> I John 2. 15. James 4. 4. And although it must be acknowledged, that there is a <hi>Corrupt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi> in Fallen Man; yet it is <hi>Satan,</hi> that frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>moves</hi> it unto act, and all he intends there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is the <hi>Captivating</hi> the <hi>whole Soul,</hi> and by consequence the <hi>Whole Man,</hi> to Disobedience of the Command of GOD; that by his <hi>Holy,</hi> and <hi>Righteous Judgment,</hi> his Wrath might be <hi>Revealed</hi> to the utmost, against the <hi>Souls</hi> and <hi>Bodies</hi> of Impenitent Sinners, Cursing them to <hi>Everlasting Burnings, Prepared for the Devil and his Angels,</hi> Mat. 25. 41. And thus he would destroy all Souls, did not <hi>Divine Grace</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Satan is the</hi> ENEMY <hi>of the</hi> BO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DIES <hi>of Men.</hi> The Soul being the <hi>better</hi> part, is the principal object of his <hi>Malice,</hi> but together with that (as an Instrument by which it Exerteth its Powers in the State of Union) the Body is often sorely afflicted by him, when he cannot obtain leave to go any further. And here</p>
               <p n="1">1. Sometimes he brings Distress upon the Bodies of Men, <hi>by malignant Operations in, and Diabolical Impressions on, the Spirituous Principle or Vehicle of life &amp; Motion.</hi> This we have set before us in the case of the <hi>Possessed, Mark.</hi> 9. 18. <hi>and
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:000643_0032_0FA961E18B9BB1E8"/>
wheresoever he taketh him, he teareth him, and be foameth, and gnasheth with his Teeth,</hi> &amp;c, Now although <hi>Actual Possessions,</hi> were most frequent and observable, while our SAVIOUR was on the Earth, and it seems to be so much permitted in that time, that the <hi>Eternal Power</hi> and GODHEAD, of the <hi>Lord Jesus</hi> might appear, in the subduing <hi>Satan,</hi> and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing his Tyranny, over the <hi>Souls</hi> and <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> of the Children of Men: Yet there are certainly some <hi>Lower</hi> Operations of <hi>Satan,</hi> (whereof there are <hi>sundry Examples</hi> among us) which the Bodies of Men and Women, are liable unto. And whosoever, hath <hi>carefully ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served</hi> these things, must needs be <hi>Convinced,</hi> that the Motions of the Persons Afflicted, both as to the <hi>Manner,</hi> and as to the <hi>violence</hi> of them, are the <hi>meer effects</hi> of Diabolical <hi>Malice</hi> and <hi>Operations,</hi> and that it cannot ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally be imagined, to proceed from any other cause whatsoever.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Sometimes <hi>by Moving and Exasperating the Corrupt Particles of the Blood,</hi> &amp; <hi>vitiated Humours of the Body,</hi> be doth (by God's Permission) Smite the Bodies of Men, with <hi>Grievous, Pes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilential</hi> and <hi>Loathsome</hi> Diseases; Of this JOB was a special Instance, Job 2. 7. S<hi>o</hi> S<hi>atan went and smote Job with sore Boiles, &amp;c.</hi> It is not expressed, what Disease it was, with which the Devil <hi>smote Job;</hi> but certainly it Seized
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:000643_0033_0FA961E3AF47E1C0"/>
him, with the utmost degree of <hi>Malignity</hi> and <hi>Loathsomeness,</hi> that natural causes, under the influence of <hi>Diabolical Malice,</hi> could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce; and we may rationally conceive that never any man, had <hi>that Disease</hi> or those <hi>Boiles</hi> (as <hi>Job</hi> had them) who out-lived the Tormenting Pains, and Malignity thereof. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can we deny, but that <hi>Satan</hi> may (by Divine Permission) spread the <hi>Contagious At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes</hi> of Epidemical Diseases, in the <hi>Aiery Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> (the Territory assigned to him) who is <hi>Prince of the Power of the Air,</hi> Eph. 2. 2) And make them <hi>Penetrate,</hi> so as to render them the more <hi>Afflictive</hi> and <hi>Destructive</hi> to the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of such as are Infected by them. This he did by <hi>Permission</hi> (not only for Tryal as in <hi>Jobs</hi> case) but also for the Punishment of Sinners; hence we read of his being employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed sometimes by the Great God, as the <hi>Executioner</hi> of his just Revenges, in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of his and his People Enemies; and thus he was among the <hi>Egyptians</hi> when the <hi>L</hi>ord plagued them, Psal. 78. 49, 50. <hi>By sending Evil Angels among them. He spared not their Souls from Death, but gave them over to the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilence.</hi> Besides, I may not insist here, How <hi>Satan</hi> by wicked men his <hi>Instruments</hi> brings outward <hi>Calamities, Sorrows, Pains</hi> and <hi>Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> on the Bodies even of the Children of God; of whom as the Apostle declares <hi>the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:000643_0034_0FA961E531B15810"/>
World was not worthy,</hi> Heb. 11. 37, 38. <hi>They Wandred in Sheep-skins and Goat-skins, in Dent and Caves of the Earth,</hi> &amp;c. by reason of the malicious Persecutions of wicked Tyrants, the <hi>Instruments of Satan,</hi> and who doubtless were <hi>hurried</hi> on by his Instigations. And surely what is said concerning <hi>Casting into Prison,</hi> is likewise true of other Afflictions, as <hi>Scourgings,</hi> or any Corporal Punishments for Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness sake. That though men are the <hi>Actors,</hi> yet it is the <hi>Devil,</hi> that shall Cast some into Prison, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 10. He is the principal <hi>Instiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> in all such Designs for the hurting the Bodies of men, when not permitted to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed further, being willing to do all the <hi>mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief</hi> that he can, when he cannot do so much as he would: But</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Satan vents, his Malice against the</hi> very LIVES <hi>of men, to cut them off and destroy them.</hi> He is the <hi>Prince</hi> of Death, that hath the <hi>Power of Death, Heb.</hi> 2. 14. He is the DESTROYER of all <hi>Life,</hi> both <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Corporal.</hi> All his <hi>Designs</hi> against the Souls and Bodies of men, <hi>terminate</hi> here, even in the <hi>Weakening</hi> or <hi>Extinguishing</hi> of Life, and when he <hi>touches</hi> the life of the Body, he <hi>aims</hi> at the Life of the Soul: He it was that stirred up <hi>Cain,</hi> to Commit the first <hi>Murder</hi> in the World, when he slew <hi>Abcl</hi> his Brother, for

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Immediately</hi> and directly, Operating <hi>in,</hi> and <hi>upon</hi> the object by his own power and influence.

Lively Image of a person or thing, and <hi>Satan</hi> certainly can do it much more; and besides, it seems hardly safe to believe, that the <hi>Devil</hi> was capable, to impose upon the <hi>pure</hi> and sinless imagination of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, by any <hi>Illusion</hi> whatsoever.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Sometimes by <hi>Entring into,</hi> and <hi>Possessing the Souls of the Man;</hi> bringing him unto <hi>full S</hi>ubmission, and entire <hi>Resignation</hi> to his Hellish Designs; that it is <hi>Totally</hi> Enslaved him to his <hi>Authority</hi> and direction.

               <p>First, <hi>That the more solemnly, and Person or People are Devoted to God, and thence do shine with Lustre of Holiness, both of Heart and Life, the more vehemently doth he oppose, malign, and Persecute them.</hi> That which makes him so <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious</hi> against the Children of GOD, is his <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed Contrariety,</hi> to the Image of GOD that is on <hi>them,</hi> and the Principle of Holiness that is <hi>in them.</hi> So that the more <hi>Beauty of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> they hold forth in their Conversation, the more violently, and outragiously doth he <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose</hi> them: A special Instance of this, we have in <hi>Job,</hi> concerning whom the Searcher of Hearts, did (before his afflictions) give this Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony, that <hi>he feared God, and eschewed evil,</hi> Job 1. 8. Upon the notice whereof, <hi>Satan</hi> set him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self against him, to interrupt him <hi>in,</hi> and divert him <hi>from,</hi> that <hi>Sincerity</hi> and <hi>Universallity</hi> of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, by obtaining permission to bring <hi>Crosses</hi> and <hi>Afflictions</hi> upon him, in his <hi>Estate</hi> and <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren chap.</hi> And finding him to be <hi>constant</hi> in his Resolution, to Serve GOD Uprightly, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Testimnoy of GOD himself, <hi>chap.</hi> 2, 3.

his Designs, he did <hi>Transform himself into an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of Light,</hi> as the Apostle saith, <hi>2 Cor.</hi> 11. 14. <hi>(i. e.)</hi> pretend to as much Holiness in outward appearance, as the best; hence when <hi>the Sons of</hi> GOD, <abbr>
                     <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </abbr> the <hi>Angles,</hi> the Eldest Sons of GOD by Creation, came, to <hi>present themselves before the Lord, (i. e.)</hi> to pay their <hi>Homage unto,</hi> and to receive the <hi>Commands</hi> of their Soveraign LORD, <hi>Satan came also among them, Job.</hi> 1. 6.

               <p>Secondly, <hi>That the more eminent Service, or Office any person is employed IN, or called to the discharge OF, for the glory of GGD, and the good of his Church, the more violently doth</hi> Satan <hi>resist, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand or oppose him.</hi>

<pb n="33" facs="unknown:000643_0047_0FA961EEDD912338"/>
Satan in mind, that even He &amp; all other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, are bound to worship GOD, their Soveraign <hi>L</hi>ord and Maker and thence that the Devil ought to worship the Lord Jesus who was Truly and Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentially God his Creator. For surely he is even the Devils God by Creation, in which he was made a <hi>glorious Angel,</hi> but he made himself by transgression an <hi>horrible</hi> Devil.</p>
               <p>(Secondly) The Soveraign Power, of the Great God to rebuke Satan, appears, <hi>In that he doth manage and over-rule, all his motions and Operations, to serve his own most Holy Ends, and to advance his own glory in the winding up.</hi> Angelical natures are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>active,</hi> and as the <hi>blessed Angels,</hi> are very dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in serving, and glorifying, GOD, and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string <hi>for the good of the heirs of salvation,</hi> Hebr. 1. 14.

               <p>But what the wise man saith, wisely and truely concerning the <hi>Devices</hi> of man, is every way true of the <hi>Designs</hi> of <hi>Satan,</hi> Prov: 19: 21. <hi>There are many devices in a mans heart, but the Counsel of the Lord it shall stand, (i. e.)</hi> totally to <hi>defeat</hi> the accomplishment of them,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:000643_0048_0FA961EF6598ADF8"/>
or to <hi>over-rule</hi> the issues, effects and consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of them to his own Glory. Thus the GREAT GOD, doth many times out-do <hi>Satans Politicks,</hi> and over-shootes him in his own how, making that which he designed, as meanes to <hi>Prevent</hi> the good of the Church, appear to be a most proper medium to <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote</hi> the benefit thereof, according to his <hi>Blessed will</hi> and Counsel, who can say concerning his own <hi>most Holy</hi> Design; and be as good as his word, in despight of <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Divels,</hi> Isa. 46: 10. <hi>My counsel shall stand, And I will do all my pleasure.</hi> This will appear, if we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>pernicious</hi> designs, and <hi>malicious</hi> methods of <hi>Satan,</hi> in order to the Crucifixion of Our LORD JESUS, and the end he aimed at in his being cut off; and how in a stupendious manner; all was over-ruled, to accomplish <hi>Gods Eternal Purposes,</hi> in the Salvation of this Elect.</p>
               <p>(Briefly then, The <hi>Devil finding nothing in him</hi>) (as our Saviour saith, John. 14. 30.) On which to fix any temptation, whereby he might stain him in his Holyness; or pervert him from his Obedience; but was totally overcome, and rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in a Single conflict, with the <hi>Captaion of our Salvation,</hi> Math: 4: 1, to, 11. He is resolved to prosecute another design, even the taking away his bodily life, in order whereunto <hi>He entred unto Judas, Named Iscariot one of the Twelve.</hi> Luk. 22. 3.
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:000643_0049_0FA961F0E98FFBF0"/>
Who presently went and set himself to take opportunity, to betray him, Ver. 6. Then <hi>Satan</hi> stirred up, the <hi>Envy</hi> of the people, to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him to the Judgment, Math. 27. 18. Brought in <hi>Two false Witnesses</hi> against him; Math. 26. 60. Moved <hi>Herod,</hi> and <hi>Pontius</hi> Pilate Gentiles, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn him, and therein gratify the <hi>wicked people. of Israel,</hi> that were gathered together, Acts 4. 27. And (to compleat the <hi>Diabolical Tragedy</hi>) Instigated the people, with <hi>wicked hands</hi> to Crucify him. Acts. 2. 23. And after his <hi>Buryal,</hi> they endeavour to prevent his <hi>Rising again,</hi> or removal out of the Sepulcher (as they pretended) by setting a guard about it, rolling a <hi>great stone</hi> upon it, and <hi>sealing it</hi> to make it unalterable; Math. 27. 66. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>SATAN</hi> then had thus far <hi>gained</hi> the Point, <hi>&amp;</hi> prevailed in his <hi>Hellish</hi> designs, against the life of the <hi>Man-CHRIST-JESUS;</hi> yet in all this process he had neither <hi>broken</hi> the Chaine by which the GREAT GOD holds him, nor could he (in, the least) <hi>overstraine</hi> one linke thereof; nor yet deviate <hi>one inch</hi> from the methods determined, and traced out, by the <hi>Purpose</hi> of the <hi>Eternal God</hi> in any one step or intreague, of this whole af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faire: but in spight of all the <hi>Malice, Power,</hi> and <hi>Policy,</hi> of <hi>EARTH</hi> and <hi>HELL,</hi> it came to pass in every particular passage thereof, As the <hi>Hand</hi> of <hi>GOD</hi> disposed, in the Course of his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: According as his Counsel <hi>fore-determined should be done, Acts.</hi> 4: 27. 28.

Hitherto we may observe, how <hi>Satans - plot</hi> and project, seemed to be agreeable, (though a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his will,) to the <hi>purpose,</hi> and Eternal Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel of the <hi>blessed</hi> GOD: but in the ends and issues proposed, Behold how vastly (even <hi>Toto Coelo</hi>) they differ!

               <p>That <hi>Whensoever, God hath declared a person or people, to be in Covenant with him, as the Objects of his special mercy and favour, he will assuredly and shortly, suppress the malice of Satan, however vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently engaged against them.</hi>

To Explaine this Proposition, we may consider the Arguments used in the Text, to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press</hi> Satan's importunity and <hi>Magnify</hi> God's Mercy, which are Twofold,</p>
               <p>First; <hi>God's Free-Love, set on them from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, in</hi> that expression, T<hi>he LORD that hath chosen Jerusalem.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly <hi>HIS particular favour, in delivering Joshua and them, from the Babylonish Captivity.</hi> Is not this a Brand pluckt out of the Fire? Of each of these a few words.</p>
               <p>First; <hi>God free love from Eternity, placed on his Covenant people.</hi> The Lord that hath chosen Jerusalem &amp;c. <hi>God</hi> at the first, chose the seed of <hi>Abraham, Isaac and Jacob,</hi> to be a people to himself, above all the nations of the earth, Psal. 105. 6. And <hi>avouched</hi> them to be <hi>His peculiar people,</hi> Deut. 26. 16. He chose the land of <hi>Judea,</hi> to be the place of their abode, and there he chose the City <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> or the <hi>vision</hi> of <hi>peace,</hi> as the name signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, in which his people might enjoy <hi>peace</hi> and quietness; after their <hi>travels, toils</hi> and <hi>troubles</hi> in the wilderness, where the <hi>Thrones of Judgment</hi> were established, Psal. 122. 5. Where also the <hi>Temple</hi> was builded, &amp; the <hi>Worship</hi> and <hi>Ordinances</hi> of GOD, Celebrated, and the tokens of Gods presence were placed. So that audience, and acceptance of prayers; might be expected, when offered <hi>towards this City and House,</hi> I Kings 8. 44. Hence by a <hi>Metonymis</hi> of the <hi>City,</hi> put for
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:000643_0055_0FA961F8E0BA6EE8"/>
the inhabitants, it notes the people of Jerusalem, and by a <hi>Senecdoche</hi> of the part for the whole, implies that whole people which was in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with GOD in those days, which did also figuratively represent, the Evangelical Church, the Heavenly Jerusalem, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 22. Now Choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing is an act of freedom and Liberty in God; and a Testimony of Love and Mercy, to such as are chosen; By which he is inclined to help them in Misery.</p>
               <p>Secondly HIS particular favour, in delivering <hi>Joshua</hi> and them, from the Babylonish Captivity <hi>is not this a brand</hi> &amp;c. Where GOD hath begun to shew special favour, he will compleat it, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Hell.</hi> As he said so the Lords people find it, <hi>God is not a man that he should lye,</hi> Numbers 23. 19. (<hi>i. e.</hi>) as to his <hi>promise,</hi> nor that he should fail in his <hi>Providence,</hi> to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on those works, in which he hath made such blessed beginnings, <hi>is not this a brand pluckt out</hi> &amp;c. (<hi>i. e.</hi>) with an holy pitty <hi>rescued,</hi> when all on a light fire, now CHRIST is brought in, using this argument in his <hi>Intercession</hi> for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who in imitation of him may also <hi>use it</hi> for themselves, and it seems thus to be framed (<hi>qs.d.</hi>) KNOW O S<hi>atan,</hi> GOD the FATHER, hath begun to own <hi>Joshua</hi> and the <hi>People,</hi> in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance <hi>in part,</hi> and that may encourage them to expect all that <hi>remains,</hi> for the LORD will
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:000643_0056_0FA961F9A2B0EF88"/>
perfect what concerns them, and will not <hi>forsake the works of his own hands, because his mercies endure for ever,</hi> Psal. 138. 8. The force of a gument then, for clearing the Proposition lyes in these two assertions.</p>
               <p>First, GOD in choosing <hi>of</hi> and covenanting <hi>with</hi> a Person or People, doth engage all his <hi>Glorious Attributes,</hi> for their good as the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter doth require. When he Declareth he will be their GOD, all his <hi>Sufficiency</hi> and <hi>Efficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> is for them, (<hi>i. e.</hi>) to the utmost of what he hath Engaged by Covenant: hence his <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, Positive,</hi> and <hi>Relative</hi> Attributes, do Recommend his as a proper Object of Faith, for <hi>Present help</hi> to his People in <hi>time of Trouble,</hi> Psal. 46. 1. So that humble <hi>Reminding</hi> him of his Covenant, doth in its own Nature <hi>prevail</hi> with him to exert His <hi>Wisdom, Power, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Truth</hi> and <hi>Faithfulness,</hi> &amp;c. in a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable degree, to <hi>Relieve the Distressed,</hi> as their occasion doth or may require: For <hi>He Remembered his Covenant, and Repented according to the multitude of his Mercies,</hi> Psal. 106.45.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Where GOD <hi>hath given some Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of his</hi> Mercy, <hi>it is to be used as argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prevail with Him, for what we may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther stand in need of.</hi> Thus in the Text, <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua</hi> is as a brand pluckt out of the Fire, and therefore may <hi>depend</hi> on it, to be Established in the <hi>Priesthood,</hi> and owned accordingly. Thus
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:000643_0057_0FA961FA62928660"/>
then the scope of the Proposition is cleared up, <abbr>
                     <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </abbr> When God hath taken a person or people into Covenant, and shewed them spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Favour, <hi>The Gates of Hell</hi> (as our Saviour saith, Mat. 16. 18.) <hi>shall never prevail against them.</hi> Lastly,</p>
            </div>

               <head>PROPOSITION VI.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Great GOD, doth manage all his Designs of Mercy to his People, under the Gospel Dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in and through the Mediator,</hi> The very <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure</hi> of the Gospel Covenant, is such; and the Termes thereof, are so <hi>Methodized,</hi> as to introduce a necessity of depending on a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator.</hi> The whole Transaction of the <hi>Gospel Covenant,</hi> betwixt the GREAT GOD, and Fallen Man, is by the <hi>Mediator;</hi> hence it is on better Termes, than the Covenant of Works, H<hi>eb.</hi> 8. 6. Under the New Covenant, all Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses <hi>to</hi> God, are by the Mediator, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 15, 16. and all Communications of Grace <hi>from</hi> God, are by the Mediator, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 16. Here than three things are briefly to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered.</p>
               <p>First, JESUS CHRIST <hi>is appointed, according to the method of the Covenant of Grace, to be the Only Mediator betwixt God and Man,</hi> I <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>For there is ONE GOD, and ONE MEDI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ATOR, betwixt GOD and Man, the Man Christ-Jesus.</hi>
                  <pb n="44" facs="unknown:000643_0058_0FA961FB0BD4F228"/>
And He is, the <hi>Mediator of the New Covenant,</hi> Heb. 12. 24. To his <hi>Mediatorial Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> is to be referred; His <hi>Intercession</hi> with GOD <hi>the</hi> FATHER, for all Good to his Elect; which he <hi>ever Liveth</hi> to Discharge, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. By <hi>Him</hi> our Prayers <hi>Ascend</hi> to GOD, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 14. By <hi>Him</hi> all Answers of Grace from GOD <hi>Descend</hi> to us. Hence he promiseth, <hi>Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father is my Name, he will give it,</hi> Joh. 16. 23.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In the Management of this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, He is invested with <hi>Kingly Power.</hi> He is a KING for <hi>Dignity,</hi> Psal. 2.6. A KING for <hi>Authority</hi> of Government: KING OF KINGS <hi>and</hi> LORD OF LORDS, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 16. <hi>A King for Judgment,</hi> All Judgment is <hi>Committed</hi> unto Him, <hi>John</hi> 5. 22. And it shall finally be <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged</hi> by him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 34. &amp; 41.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>It is one special Administration of</hi> CHRISTS Mediatorial Kingdom, to <hi>Oppose, Suppress,</hi> and <hi>Destroy, the Kingdom and Power of</hi> Satan, <hi>that Grand Enemy of the Souls, and Salvation of men.</hi> Betwixt CHRISTS Kingdom, and <hi>Satans</hi> Kingdom, there is a direct <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety</hi> and Opposition: Now <hi>Contraries</hi> do mutually endeavour to <hi>Overcome</hi> each other, and bring them to nought. Hence when CHRISTS Kingdom goes up, S<hi>atans</hi> must go down; On this special Errand, our Saviour is said to come into the World: <hi>For this
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:000643_0059_0FA961FBF82CD048"/>
the</hi> S<hi>on of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the</hi> D<hi>evil,</hi> 1 John 3. 8. He was Incarnate, not only to <hi>Oppose</hi> his most <hi>secret Insinuations</hi> and Temptations; but to <hi>Over power</hi> his most <hi>violent motions,</hi> and hostile Invasions, when he ruffles in the Titles of the <hi>God of this World;</hi> 2 Cor.4.4.

                  </hi> of his Dignity, and <hi>Cast out</hi> of all his Power and Dominion, which he had over the Children of men, <hi>John</hi> 12. 31. The reason is, by CHRIST'S Execution of His <hi>Kingly Office</hi> in Heaven, Satans Power is S<hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,</hi> and the <hi>Prince of this World is judged,</hi> John 16. 8. (<hi>i. e.</hi>) <hi>Condemned</hi> to Lose all his Authority, that His Kingdom may be no more; such then was and is the <hi>Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> and Power of CHRIST-MEDIATOR; that he could have <hi>Rebuked,</hi> and totally <hi>Vanquished</hi> Satan by his own Power, <hi>Who is over all God blessed for ever,</hi> Rom. 9. 5.

               <p>First, according to our Spiritual State, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting our <hi>Regeneracy,</hi> or <hi>Unregeneracy:</hi> And therefore.</p>
               <p n="1">1.

We would hope we are Interested in the Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Covenant of GOD, and delivered from the <hi>Raging</hi> Tyranny of the <hi>Roaring</hi> Lyon. It is good to be sure, and too sure we cannot be at any time, much less at such a time as this: That it may appear before <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Men,</hi> that we are chosen unto Salvation, by the GOD of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> &amp; are accordingly <hi>devoted</hi> to him, and to his service in an <hi>Unviolable Covenant,</hi> against which the gates of <hi>Hell</hi> shall never have any power.

<pb n="48" facs="unknown:000643_0062_0FA961FE275F8378"/>
all attempts of <hi>Satan,</hi> to bring us into Covenant <hi>with</hi> him, or Subjection <hi>to</hi> him. And in order to this let us be Awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>To put our selves, upon faithful and thorow</hi> Tryal <hi>and</hi> examination, <hi>what hath bin amiss.</hi> We all, even the best of us, have by sin a hand and share, in <hi>Provoking</hi> God thus to let <hi>Satan loose,</hi> in an unusual manner, WHO <hi>can say he is clean?</hi> This is a time then, for <hi>Solemn-self-examination.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this time of sore affliction, there should be great <hi>Searching of heart,</hi> as there was for the <hi>Divisions of Reuben;</hi> Iudges 5: 19. GOD is a GOD of Wisdome, A <hi>Righteous</hi> &amp; <hi>Holy</hi> GOD, and he never afflicts the people of his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant without a <hi>Cause,</hi> and <hi>that Cause</hi> is always Just: We should go, as far as we can in the search, by the light of conscience, conducted by the <hi>Rule</hi> of the word, and when we can go no farther, we should <hi>pray</hi> the prayer of Job; chap, 10, 2. <hi>Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou Contendest with me.</hi> Yet was he Upright; and (even in God's account;) One that feared GOD, and eschewed evil, Ch 1: 8. The Like prayer <hi>David</hi> makes, Ps; 139: 23, 24. <hi>Search me O GOD, and know my Heart, try me and know my thoughts. And see if there be any wicked way in me</hi> &amp;e.

               <p n="2">2. Add then to the former, <hi>True and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned Reformation, of whatsoever appears to be the</hi> P<hi>rovoking Evils, we fall into.</hi> He or they that to <hi>Serious Examination,</hi> (which must be supposed to include <hi>Hearty Confession</hi> of what hath been amiss) Adds <hi>thorow Reformation,</hi> may only hope to obtain Pardoning Mercy at the Hand of God, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 13. And may it not be said, even to the <hi>Purest Churches,</hi> as he said to them, <hi>2 Chron.</hi> 28. 10. <hi>but are there not with you, even with you Sins against the</hi> LORD <hi>your God.</hi> And certainly, no <hi>Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings</hi> are so abhorred of the Lord, as those of <hi>his Sons</hi> and <hi>Daughters, Deut.</hi> 32. 19. This Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning and Reforming then, is the Duty <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired</hi> of, and <hi>Pressed</hi> upon <hi>Israel,</hi> or the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Covenant People of God, when by sin they had <hi>departed</hi> from him, Hosea 14. 1. O ISRAEL, <hi>Return unto the Lord thy God, for
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:000643_0064_0FA961FF89828E18"/>
thou hast fallen by thine Iniquity.</hi> Hence the neglect of this Returning, in those that are under many and great Afflictions, is very displeasing unto God, <hi>Amos</hi> 4. 11. <hi>And ye were as a Fire-brand pluckt out of the Burning, yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the Lord.</hi> Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that <hi>obstinate persisting,</hi> in the neglect of it, after <hi>frequent Warnings,</hi> provokes the Lord, to punish those that are guilty thereof, <hi>seven and seven times more,</hi> Lev. 26. 23, 24. If we would then, <hi>avoid</hi> the displeasure, and <hi>obtain</hi> the Covenant Favour of GOD, we must both in Profession, and practice, fall in with the Example, of the formerly Degenerous, but afterwards Reformed <hi>Ephraim, Jer.</hi> 31. 18, 19. <hi>Turn thou me, and I shall be turned; for thou art the Lord my God. Surely after that I was Turned, I Repented, and after that I was Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, I smote upon my Thigh,</hi> &amp;c. Then, and not till then, will the <hi>Rowels of the LORD, be turned within him, and his Repentings kindled together for us.</hi> Now that our Reformation may be unto Divine Acceptation, it must be,</p>
               <p>First <hi>Personal</hi> and particular (<hi>in universalibus latet delus</hi>) We commonly say, <hi>that which is every Bodies work, is no Bodies work.</hi> Every one is guilty, in the <hi>Provocation,</hi> and therefore every one should apply themselves to <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Every one of us should set our selves to do our <hi>own Duty,</hi> and Repent of our <hi>own Sin.</hi>
                  <pb n="51" facs="unknown:000643_0065_0FA96200507A8D38"/>
There is an inclination in the best, to Charge the <hi>Sins of others,</hi> as the procuring cause of GODS Judgments and to reflect severely on the <hi>Pride, Lukewarmness, Coveteousness, Contention, Intemperance,</hi> and <hi>Uneven Conversation</hi> of others; but we can hardly be brought, to smite upon our <hi>own Breast,</hi> and say, <hi>What have I done?</hi> Unless we be, in particular <hi>Charged,</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> was by the Prophet <hi>Nathan,</hi> in the <hi>2 Sam.</hi> 12. 7. <hi>Thou art the man.</hi> Thou art he (<hi>qs. d.</hi>) that art concerned in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation by thy Transgression.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Reformation,</hi> (by which we may clear up, that we are the Covenant People of God) must be <hi>Universal.</hi> We must turn from <hi>all</hi> and <hi>every</hi> sin which hath been <hi>Committed,</hi> and apply our selves to the <hi>discharge</hi> of <hi>every</hi> Duty, which hath been <hi>neglected.</hi> We must have no sinful Reserves, as he, <hi>2 Kings</hi> 5. 18. <hi>In this thing pardon thy Servant,</hi> &amp;c. He was Convicted it was a <hi>Sin,</hi> that needed <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and yet would fain be Excused in the Commission thereof. Thus <hi>Junius,</hi> and <hi>Trem.</hi> and the <hi>Dutch</hi> Annotators Translate it, and <hi>Pisc.</hi> Interprets it of his desire to continue in that Office, which he could not with good Conscience discharge. Though some Learned and Judicious understand it as a craving of pardon for what he had therein done amiss in time past. In short so far as we are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

of <hi>Reservations</hi> in our Reformation so far will there remain a <hi>Cloud</hi> upon the Evidences of our <hi>Covenant Interest</hi> in GOD <hi>that hath Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen Jerusalem.</hi> This to Regenerate Souls. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly then</p>
               <p>Let <hi>Unregenerate sinners, be</hi> warned <hi>and</hi> awakned, to <hi>get out of that miserable state of sin, and consequently of subjection to Satan, (That</hi> Tyrannical, Implacable, and Indefatigable, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy of <hi>souls) in which you are.</hi> O break off your first by repentance, and your Iniquities by a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving closure with the LORD JESUS CHRIST, for <hi>Justification, Sanctification</hi> &amp; <hi>Salvation,</hi> That ye may be delivered, from the Power, and domination of <hi>Satan,</hi> under which you are ensnared, to do his will, although utterly cross to the will of GOD, and may be <hi>wanslated,</hi> into the Kingdom of the Lord Jesus, the <hi>Dear Son of God,</hi> and Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Savious of the souls of men Col: 1. 13.

               <p>Secondly <hi>By using indirect means to prevent or remove this afflction; and trying unwarrantable

projects, to reveal</hi> S<hi>ecrets, or discover future events.</hi> When persons have been under long exercise, those about them are very desirous, to relieve them out of, or prevent those grievous fits, of <hi>D</hi>iabolical tortures, with which they are distressed. And hence do not consider the Efficacy or Tendency of those things they use. I call such <hi>indirect means,</hi> as being duely observed, cannot be found to have any <hi>Natural</hi> or <hi>Physical</hi> virtue in them, to produce the <hi>Desired Effect</hi> of themselves: Nor yet have any warrant from the word of GOD, which if they had; ought to be believed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon, to produce the <hi>Effect</hi> for which they were <hi>Instituted;</hi> tho' never so mean in their own nature. Because the <hi>Power</hi> of the GREAT GOD, is engaged, to uphold the decisive influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his own instituted means, as we find in the <hi>bitter water which caused the curse,</hi> Num: 5: 17. which was onely compounded, of <hi>Holy Water</hi> (or common water set apart unto sacred use) <hi>and the dust of the floor of the sanctuary;</hi> This we may imagine had not any physical influence in its own nature, proportionable, to such a <hi>solemn effect</hi> or consequence, as was in that case appointed thereunto; It must then depend, whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and onely, on the Divine Institution of it, to be for the <hi>Cursing,</hi> or <hi>Clearing,</hi> of the woman as she was in the sight of GOD, <hi>Guilty</hi> or <hi>not Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> as we read ver. 27 and 28. <abbr>viz</abbr> if <hi>G</hi>uilty her <hi>Belly should</hi> S<hi>well, and her Thigh should Rot,</hi> if
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:000643_0078_0FA9620DDA0A4668"/>
clear, she should <hi>be free (i. e.)</hi> from any hurt, <hi>and should Conceive Seed.</hi> But seeing we find no means instituted of God, to make <hi>Tryal</hi> of Witches, or to <hi>Charm away</hi> Witchcraft, (both which are a kind of Witchcraft) we are to expect <hi>Effects</hi> in the ordinary course of Providence, suitable to the natural vertue of <hi>Causes,</hi> and means used accordingly; but what is otherwise, must be of the <hi>Nature of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments;</hi> these indirect means, are such as, <hi>Burning</hi> the Afflicted Persons Hair; parings of Nails, <hi>stopping</hi> up and Lovling the Urine. Their <hi>Scratching</hi> the Accused, or otherwise <hi>fetching Blood</hi> of them, with many more, which I forbear to mention, least <hi>unwary persons</hi> should be inclined to try these Diabolical Feats. But as to the <hi>Effect,</hi> this is plainly found, a <hi>Giving place</hi> to the Devil, for he giving way to it, and <hi>Ceasing to Afflict,</hi> upon the use of it, brings such projects into Esteem, and <hi>Gaines</hi> to his own Devices (for I can call them no better) too much <hi>Credit</hi> and <hi>Observance:</hi> For hence such as use them, finding him <hi>slee</hi> thereupon, are encouraged to the <hi>frequent</hi> use of them, and are (as a Learned Writer faith) made <hi>Witches,</hi> by endeavouring, to defend themselves against <hi>Witchcraft,</hi> and using the Devils <hi>Shield,</hi> against the Devils S<hi>word,</hi> or (as I may allude) going down to the Philistines, to have those Weapons <hi>sharpened</hi> and <hi>pointed,</hi> with which we
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:000643_0079_0FA9620E9C245498"/>
intend to Fight against them.</p>
               <p>In a word, is it because there is not a GOD in the midst of us, able to <hi>Rebuke</hi> and <hi>Vanquish</hi> Satan, in all his Operations: If there be, then away with whatsoever hath not Scripture P<hi>recept</hi> or <hi>President</hi> for its Warrantee. And let us use those Weapons, which are not C<hi>arnal, but Mighty through God, to the pulling down strong Holds,</hi> &amp;c. 2 Cor. 10. 4. Thus may we put to the worse, those P<hi>rincipalities</hi> and <hi>Powers</hi> of Darkness which do in such a fearful manner, <hi>wrestle</hi> and Contend with us at this time, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6. 12.</p>
               <p>But I must not conclude this particular, without testifying against some other practises amongst us Condemned by the <hi>Rule</hi> of God, and <hi>writings</hi> of learned and judicious men as yielding to, and tampring <hi>with</hi> the Divel, <abbr>Viz</abbr> the <hi>sive</hi> and scys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers; the Bible and Key; The white of an Egge in a Glass; The horse-shooe nailed on the thresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>old; A stone hung over the Rack in a stable: with many more: which I would not make known to any, that are ignorant of them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are no better then <hi>Conjurations,</hi> and if in the use of them <hi>Discoveryes</hi> are made; or Effects produced, to the gratifying their sinful Curiosity in any degree, it must be from the <hi>Devil,</hi> and not from GOD; who never instituted any such ways, by and in which, to discover <hi>secret</hi> things or <hi>future</hi> Events to the Children of Men.

Hence such as by these Experiments, adventure <hi>to play on the hole of the aspe,</hi> and approach unto the <hi>Den</hi> of the <hi>Dragons;</hi> are in great Danger To become a <hi>prey</hi> unto Satans <hi>malice,</hi> being (or ever they are aware) <hi>seduced</hi> by his <hi>subtilty</hi> into an intire subjection to his <hi>Infernal</hi> powers, so as at last to be Destroyed <hi>by</hi> him, and cast <hi>with</hi> him, into the Lake that burneth with <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone</hi> for ever.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Give no place to the Devil by <hi>Rash Censuring of others, without sufficient grounds, or false accusing any willingly.</hi> This is indeed to be like the Devil, who hath the Title <hi>(Diabolos)</hi> in the Greek, because he is a <hi>Calumniator,</hi> or <hi>False Accuser.</hi> Hence when we read of such false Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers in the Latter Days, they are in the Original called <hi>(Diab<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

be suspected, it is to be ascribed to GODS P<hi>leasure</hi> supreamly permitting, and <hi>Satans Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice</hi> subordinately troubling, by Representation of such to the Afflicting of others, even of such as have all the while, we have reason to believe, (especially some of them) no kind of <hi>Ill will,</hi> of <hi>disrespect,</hi> unto those that have been complained of by them. This giving place to the Devil <hi>avoid,</hi> for it will have uncomfortable and <hi>pernicious</hi> influence, upon the Affairs of this place, by letting <hi>out</hi> Peace, and bringing <hi>in</hi> Confusion and <hi>every evil work</hi> which we heartily pray, God in mercy to prevent. Fourthly and Lastly,</p>
               <p>Then we give place to the Devil, <hi>When we are guilty of unbelief of God, and his Power, promise and Providence; for our benefit and relief under our troubles.</hi> Unbelief betrayed our first Parents, to the first sin. The <hi>Devil</hi> in the serpent, first moved them to <hi>question</hi> the truth of the Threatning, and so they came to <hi>deny.</hi> it Gen 3. 1 and 4. Yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the God of this world, the <hi>Author</hi> and main Fomenter of <hi>Unbelief,</hi> by and in which he reignes over the children of perdition, 2 Cor.4.4. Unbelief is a mother sin, &amp; there are many sins, to which men could nor be drawn, were it not for <hi>Unbelief</hi> of the Threatnings, denounced in the word of GOD, against that <hi>sin,</hi> which they do so boldly perpetrate: and of the <hi>Promise</hi> made unto the contrary <hi>Duty,</hi> which they do so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominably
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:000643_0082_0FA96210D0B35C30"/>
neglect. Indeed Unbeleif of the <hi>truth</hi> of God's promise, or <hi>Efficacy</hi> of His providence, extending towards us (these being <hi>Inseparable attributes</hi> of the Blessed God) brings in questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whether he is or hath a being. For he can as soon cease to <hi>Be</hi> as to be most P<hi>owerful,</hi> most <hi>Faithful,</hi> most <hi>Gracious,</hi> and Bountiful, which are all Attributes relating to his P<hi>rovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> and this is to go away from GOD, For he that cometh to GOD, must believe that he is Heb: 11: 6. Hence the Apostle, Cautions even the brethren, that they may not be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it, Heb 3: 12. <hi>Take heed Brethren Lest there be in any of you, an evil heart of Unbelief, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from the Living God.</hi> Intimating, that so far as the best fall into Unbelief, they go <hi>from God,</hi> and so far must needs give <hi>place to the Divel.</hi> For there are but these two <hi>Rulers,</hi> over all men in the world, and all that <hi>leave</hi> the one go to the other.

Excercised in prayer, is the Token, of Gods Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, with his Elect under the Gospel, As the how in the Clouds, was the token of his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with the world, in the dayes of <hi>Noah;</hi> Gen. 9. 12, 13. And through Christ it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent, for him the Father <hi>heareth always,</hi> Joh: 11. 42. And therefore us also through him for He hath made us <hi>accepted, in the Beloved; Ephe</hi> 1.6.</p>
               <p>Yet once more, Let ours be Fervent prayers; even with our <hi>whole heart,</hi> Psal. 119. 10. for such Prayer (only) hath the promise, of finding God and his Salvation. Then shall ye find me <hi>when ye seek me with all your heart,</hi> Jer. 29. 13. Hence <hi>David</hi> pronounceth all those blessed, that thus <hi>seek the LORD</hi> Ps. 119. 2. This is when we do Rouze up our Soul, with all it's faculties unto Prayer, as the Psalmist doth unto praise, <hi>psal.</hi> 103. 1. 2. When our whole Soul in all its affections are <hi>poured out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord as Hannah</hi> I Sam. 1. 15. This prayer is like to speed, we say amongst men, <hi>Qui timmide rogat, docet negare;</hi> he that begs faintly, may expect a denyal. And in this case <hi>Justly;</hi> the Apostle <hi>James</hi> tells us, <hi>Let not such a man</hi> as if Faint, Weak, <hi>D</hi>oubting In prayer, <hi>Expect any thing of the LORD,</hi> James 1: 7. yet on the other hand, the same Apostle assures us the <hi>Effectual fervent prayer,</hi> of a Righteous man AVAILETH MUCH Chap 5: 16. This <hi>Faithful</hi> and <hi>Fervent</hi> Prayer, frequently put in

               </p>
               <p>Let us then use this <hi>Weapon;</hi> It hath a kind of Omnipotency, because it interesteth us, in the help of THE OMNIPOTENT: <hi>Satan</hi> the worst of all our Enemies, is called in Scripture a DRAGON, to note his <hi>Malice;</hi> a SERPENT to note his <hi>Subtilty;</hi> a LYON to note his <hi>Strength.</hi> But none of all these can stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Prayer, The most inveterate Malice, (as that of Haman) Sinks under the Prayer of <hi>Est<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;</hi> chap. 4. 16. The deepest policy (the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel of Achitophel) Withers before the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of David. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 31.

               <p>The Sixth and Last USE, is in two words of Comfort, to bear up the fainting Souls of those that are <hi>Personally</hi> under, or <hi>Relatively</hi> Concerned in, these direfull Operations, of the GRAND <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy of Mankind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, there is Comfort for you, in that ye are <hi>the visible Covenant People</hi> of GOD. In General, this whole People of <hi>New-England,</hi> As to the <hi>maine bulk</hi> of them (or in and by their <hi>Godly</hi> Leaders, who engage <hi>themselves</hi> &amp; all <hi>under</hi> them, both in C<hi>ivil</hi> &amp; <hi>Sacred</hi> Order) are in <hi>Covenant</hi> with GOD, and have many times (as such) been <hi>signally</hi> owned by Him; notwithstanding all their <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi> and <hi>Degeneracies.</hi> Besides, there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that have both <hi>Explicitely,</hi> and <hi>Implicitely; Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly</hi> and <hi>Really</hi> Devoted themselves to God: And are <hi>indeed</hi> of the Number <hi>Chosen</hi> by the GOD of <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> True Citizens of that <hi>Jerusalem that is above,</hi> which is the <hi>Mother</hi> of us all, Gal. 4. 26. Yea, some of those, that are under <hi>these</hi> Afflictions, may plead <hi>these</hi> Priviledges, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with the LORD, to <hi>Rebuke</hi> S<hi>atan,</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver</hi> them and theirs, from these his malicious and woful Oppressions. And to <hi>this,</hi> that there are scarce any, who are under the influence, of this Affliction, but are also under the <hi>Solemn</hi> Obligation, of a <hi>Baptismal Covenant,</hi> which in its own nature,

ligeth them, to be <hi>for God,</hi> and is a valid Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to plead with GOD to be <hi>for them,</hi> and against <hi>Satan.</hi> Put all these together, and sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we shall not cast away our Confidence in GOD, for deliverance from these fore Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. For we are all his people on one account or other: And the <hi>LORD will not forsake his people, because it hath pleased him to make you his People,</hi> I Sam. 12. 22 But Secondly,</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is Comfort, in Considering, that the LORD JESUS <hi>the Captaine of our Salvation, hath already overcome the Devil.</hi> CHRIST that Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Seed of the woman, hath given this cursed old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and incurable, <hi>Bruise on the head,</hi> Gen 3: 15. He was too hard for him in a <hi>Single conflict</hi> Matth 4: Beg: He opposed his Power and Kingdom in the Possessed; He suffered not the Devils <hi>To speak, Because they knew him</hi> Mark: 1: 34. He compleated his Victory, by his Death on the Cross, and Destroyed his Dominion, Hebr 2: 14. <hi>That through Death he might destroy Death, and him that had the Powers of Death,</hi> that is the <hi>DEVIL;</hi> and by and after His Resurection, made shew openly unto the would, that he had <hi>spoiled</hi> Principalites and Powers, <hi>Triumphing over them</hi> Col 2: 15. Hence, if we are by Faith uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him, his victory is an earnest and praeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of our Conquest at last.

               <p>To conclude; <hi>The Lord is known by the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which he Executes in the midst of us.</hi> The Dispensations of his providence, appear to be Unsearchable, and his doing past finding out. He seems to have allowed <hi>Satan,</hi> to afflict many of our people, and that there upon he is come down in <hi>Great wrath,</hi> threatning the Destruction of the <hi>Bodyes,</hi> and (if the Infinite mercy of GOD pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent not) of the <hi>Souls</hi> of many in this place. Yet
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:000643_0092_0FA9621CCAF8BB28"/>
may we say in the midst of the <hi>terrible</hi> things which he doth in righteousness; He alone is the GOD of our Salvation, who represents himself, as the Saviour of all that are in a low and distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Condition, because he is good, and <hi>His mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy endureth for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us then Return, &amp; Repent, rent our hearts, and not our Garments. Who can tell, if the <hi>L</hi>ord will <hi>Return</hi> in mercy unto us? And by his Spirit life up a Standard, against the <hi>GRAND Enemy,</hi> who threatens to come in like a Flood, among us, and overthrow all that is <hi>Holy,</hi> and <hi>Just,</hi> and <hi>Good.</hi> It is no small comfort, to consider, that <hi>Job's</hi> exercise of Patience, had it's beginning from the <hi>Devil;</hi> but we have seen the End to be from the <hi>LORD, James</hi> 5. 11. That we also, may find by experience, the same Blessed Issue, of our present distresses, by Satan's Malice. Let us Repent of every Sin, that hath been Committed; and Labour to practice, every <hi>Duty</hi> which hath been Neglected.
