            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>OBSERVATIONS UPON THE REVOLUTION IN FRANCE.</head>
            <div n="1" type="part">
               <p>THE late revolution in France is an event of the greateſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. It has employed the pens of ſeveral able writers. Not find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, however, in any of them thoſe ſentiments which I could alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether approve, I have been induced to publiſh my own.</p>
               <p>There are two writers on the ſubject who have conſiderably en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged the attention of mankind, Mr. Burke and Mr. Paine. Mr. Burke, who is a man of conſiderable abilities and eloquence, has at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked the late revolution in France with a degree of acrimony which cannot ſurely be with reaſon defended. His obſervations upon the politics of France, where they are unconnected with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, are, it muſt be confeſſed, often ſagacious and juſt. When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he ſpeaks of religion, however, he ſhows, that if he is not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, he is, almoſt, a papiſt. He ſays in ſome parts of his works that he was educated amongſt monks, and that he has a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect for their character. His inclination to old religious eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſhows itſelf very ſoon in his firſt pamphlet upon the ſubject of the late revolution, entitled "Reflections on the Revolution in France, &amp;c." He attacks the celebrated Dr. Price for a ſermon which he preached at the diſſenting meeting houſe of the Old Jewry, London, on the 4th of November, 1789. The following paſſage in the ſermon, which is worthy the pen of an apoſtle, is ſeverely animadverted upon by Mr. Burke. Dr. Price ſays<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> "Thoſe who diſlike that mode of worſhip which is preſcribed by public author<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, ought, (if they can find no worſhip <hi>out</hi> of the church which they approve) to ſet up a ſeparate worſhip for themſelves, and by doing this, and giving an example of a rational and manly worſhip, men of weight, from their rank and literature, may do the greateſt ſervice to ſociety and the world." See his ſermon.</p>
               <p>Mr. Burke ſays, "The hint given to lay divines of <hi>rank and lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature</hi> may be proper and ſeaſonable, though ſomewhat new. If the noble ſeekers ſhould find nothing to ſatisfy their pious fancies in the old ſtaple of the national church, or in all the rich variety to be found in the well-aſſorted ware-houſes of the diſſenting congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:025356_0005_0FCD0357B67B5F58"/>Dr. Price adviſes them to improve upon non-conformity; and to ſet up, each of them, a ſeparate meeting-houſe upon his own particular principles. It is ſomewhat remarkable that this reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend divine ſhould be ſo earneſt for ſetting up new churches, and ſo perfectly indifferent concerning the doctrine which may be taught in them. His zeal is of a curious character. It is not for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of his own opinions, but of any opinions. It is not for the diffuſion of truth, but for the ſpreading of contradiction."</p>
               <p>Mr. Burke in many parts of his writings avows himſelf a ſtrenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous advocate for a national eſtabliſhed church. He, perhaps, would prefer the church of Rome; but where that cannot be eſtabliſhed, would wiſh the church of England, from its being ſomewhat ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. The church of Rome was eſtabliſhed in France. The king of that country was called the eldeſt ſon of the church; and the Baſtille, though the French would not allow it, was another inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. It is moſt certain that many perſons have been ſent to the Baſtille for ſpeaking and writing againſt the Roman-catholic reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. They have ſuffered there the moſt cruel tortures. A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement alone there, however, was almoſt ſufficient puniſhment for the worſt crimes. As Mr. Burke is an advocate for the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual eſtabliſhment of the Roman catholic church in France, becauſe it has been eſtabliſhed there ſeveral centuries, it may be uſeful to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the principles of this church, firſt, and then to make ſome obſervations upon the church of England. The Pope, the head of the Roman catholic church, we know from ſcripture, reaſon, and experience, to be the enemy of God and man. This language may appear ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſh and violent to ſome, but if we inveſtigate the matter with due care and attention, we ſhall find the language to be juſtified by truth. St. Paul in his ſecond epiſtle to the Theſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians ſays, that the day of Chriſt ſhall not come "except there come a falling away firſt, and that man of ſin be revealed, the ſon of perdition: who oppoſeth and exalteth himſelf above all that is called God or worſhipped; ſo that he as God ſitteth in the temple of God, ſhowing himſelf that he is God. And now ye know what withholdeth, that he might be revealed in his time." Chap. 2. ver. 3—7. It is aſſerted by the celebrated Joſeph Mede, and other learned writers, that the underſtanding Daniel's viſion of the four Monarchies, is of great conſequence to the interpretation of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred prophecies. Mr. Mede ſays, "The Roman empire to be the fourth kingdom of Daniel, was believed by the church of Iſrael, both before and in our Saviour's time, received by the diſciples of the apoſtles, and the whole chriſtian church for the firſt 400 years, without any known contradiction. And, I confeſs, having ſo good ground in ſcripture, it is with me, tantum non articulus fidei, little leſs than an article of faith." On the Apocalypſe, page 899, and 900, Folio.</p>
               <p>With this point allowed, which ſeems a fair datum, it will not be difficult to find, <hi>where,</hi> and, <hi>about what time,</hi> the man of ſin aroſe. It was the Roman empire which withheld the man of ſin from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing revealed. This was a doctrine adopted by Cyril, Chryſoſtom, Tertul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>an, and other learned writers in the earlier ages of chriſtian<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ity. Daniel ſays, "the ten horns out of the fourth kingdom are ten kings that ſhall ariſe: and another ſhall ariſe after, and he ſhall be diverſe from the firſt." Chap. 7. ver. 24. The Roman empire was
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:025356_0006_0FCD035B55926A48"/>ſhivered into a plurality of kingdoms, (as Mr. Mede expreſſes it) agreeably to the prophecy of Daniel, about the year 476. This is a circumſtance generally allowed by hiſtorians and chronologiſts. It was ſome time <hi>after</hi> that the little horn, that the eleventh king of Daniel, aroſe. And this we may confidently pronounce to be the ſame character as St. Paul's man of ſin, and that they both ſignify the pope of Rome. They do not mean the biſhop of Rome <hi>before,</hi> but, <hi>after,</hi> the apoſtacy. St. Paul prophecies of a moſt deplorable ſeceſſion from the faith, before the man of ſin ſhould be revealed. He alludes to the ſame character alſo in the firſt epiſtle to Timothy. "Now the ſpirit ſpeaketh expreſsly, that in the latter times ſome ſhall depart from the faith, giving heed to ſeducing ſpirits and doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of devils; ſpeaking lies in hypocriſy, having their conſcience ſeared with a hot iron; forbidding to marry, and commanding to abſtain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thankſgiving of them which believe, and know the truth." Chap. 4. ver. 1—4. It may be uſeful to dwell upon theſe prophecies of St. Paul, not only to confirm the faith of the chriſtian, but to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten the unbeliever. We ſhall find them moſt remarkably ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled. We ſhall find that the biſhop of Rome did <hi>oppoſe and exalt himſelf, above all that is called of God, or worſhipped;</hi> that, <hi>he ſat in the temple of God, at God.</hi> Du Moulin in a work entitled "New bricks for the building of Babel," aſſerts that Cayer, a popiſh wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, maintained, que le pape doit eſtre adorè, "that the Pope ſhould be adored." Some have prayed to him "O thou that takeſt away the ſins of the world, have mercy upon us." The famous Ravaillac, who killed Henry the 4th of France, ſaid "he yielded to the temptation which prompted him to kill the king, becauſe he made war againſt God, in as much as the pope is God, and God the pope." See his trial at the concluſion of Sully's Memoirs. This was a language which Ravaillac borrowed from the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, with whom he was probably too intimate. Others alſo have called the pope, "my Lord God the pope." The pope <hi>oppoſed and exalted himſelf above all that is called God,</hi> by ſelling indulgences for the moſt heinous crimes, and by this became eminently <hi>the Man of Sin.</hi> In the time of Luther, Tetzel a Dominican friar, was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by Pope Leo the tenth, to raiſe money by the ſale of indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences. Leo was a great admirer of the arts, and extravagant in other gratifications. He contrived this expedient to fill his coffers, which were emptied by his expenſive inclinations. He was with reaſon ſuppoſed to be a Deiſt. He ſecretly laughed at that religion which he openly profeſſed. <hi>He ſpoke lies in hypocriſy, having his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſeared with a hot iron.</hi> Tetzel publiſhed ſome diſcourſes upon indulgences, in which he ſays "The ſouls confined in purgatory, for whoſe redemption indulgences are publiſhed, as ſoon as the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney tinkles in the cheſt, inſtantly eſcape from that place of torment, and aſcend into Heaven." He ſays "for twelve pence you may redeem the ſoul of your father out of Purgatory." Theſe diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes have been ſince republiſhed, and are now extant. This is aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the celebrated hiſtorian Dr. Robertſon, in his hiſtory of Charles the Vth. Vol. 2, page 80 and 81, quarto. Seckendorf, a writer of great repute among the Proteſtants, gives the form of the abſolution uſed by Tetzel, in which he ſays "May our Lord Jeſus have mercy upon thee, and abſolve thee by the merits of his moſt
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:025356_0007_0FCD035C48B82998"/>holy paſſion. And I by his authority, that of his bleſſed apoſtles Peter and Paul, and of the moſt holy Pope, granted and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to me in theſe parts, do abſolve thee, &amp;c. &amp;c." Dr. Moſheim in that valuable work his Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory ſays that "Secken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorf's incomparable hiſtory of Lutheraniſm contains facts which are taken from the moſt precious and authentic manuſcripts and records, contained in the library of Saxe Gotha, and in other learned and princely collections." Some have called theſe proceedings of Tet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zel the fooleries of a private perſon, and therefore reflecting no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace upon the court of Rome. This, however, can by no means be admitted, if we pay the leaſt regard to the opinions of faithful and intelligent hiſtorians; for they declare that Tetzel was inſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and directed in his conduct by the Pope himſelf. A book was afterwards publiſhed at Rome, under the authority of the Popes, called Taxa Cancellariae Romanae, and was tranſlated into Engliſh under the title of "Rome a Great Cuſtom-Houſe for Sin." Dr. Robertſon refers to the Franckfort edition of this work in 1651; and ſays "The officers of the Roman chancery publiſhed a book, containing the preciſe ſum to be exacted for the pardon of every particular ſin. A deacon guilty of murder, was abſolved for twenty crowns. A biſhop or abbot might aſſaſſinate for three hundred li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vres. An eccleſiaſtic might commit uncleanlineſs, though with the moſt aggravating circumſtances, for a third part of that ſum." See Hiſtory of Charles the Vth. Vol. 2, page 105, quarto, and the various authorities cited in that page. This price-current, as it has been wittily called, has been often altered, from the caprice of the Popes, or from an alteration in the value of money. It has been contended by catholic writers that the church of Rome does not ſignify by indulgences the permiſſion or the forgiveneſs of ſins, but a releaſement from canonical penances, after ſincere repentance, and the ſacrament of penance. Cardinal Bellarmine, who wrote ſeveral volumes in folio upon the principles of the Roman catholics, and was eſteemed among them a pillar of orthodoxy, ſays of the Pope, ſed in poenam purgatorii, immo etiam in poenam eternam Gehennae, ſine dubio poteſtatem habet, ſaltem conſequenter &amp; indirecte, quia dum abſolvit per ſacramentum poenitentiae, a culpâ lethali, liberat conſequenter hominem a debito poena ſempiternae; &amp; in eodem mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do dum per indulgentias abſolvit hominem a poenitentiâ injuctâ vel injungenda, abſolvit eundem conſequenter a poenâ purgatorii, quam is luiturus eſſet, ſi cam poenâ non expleviſſet, vel ab eâ abſolutus non fuiſſet. Bellarm. de Indulgentiis, Lib. 1. Cap. 6.</p>
               <p>"He indiſputably has power over the torments of purgatory, and over the eternal torments of hell, at leaſt conſequently and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly, becauſe while he abſolves, by the ſacrament of penance, from mortal ſin, he conſequently ſecures from the pains of eternal puniſhment; and in the ſame manner, when by indulgences he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves a man from penance, enjoined, or to be enjoined, he conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently abſolves the ſame man from the pains of purgatory, which he would ſuffer, if he had not ſatisfied them by penance, or had not been abſolved from them." The cardinal ſays here that the Pope by indulgences can abſolve from the ſacrament of penance, and the pains of purgatory. This ſurely is more than a releaſement from canonical penances. In ſhort, the truth ſeems to be this, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer doctrines about indulgences, which were eſteemed orthodox,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:025356_0008_0FCD035DB5F5CC08"/>are ſo monſtrouſly abſurd, that ſome modern defenders of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man catholic church are willing, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ade, wherever they can. That St. Paul means the church of Rome, by what he ſays in the firſt epiſtle to Timothy, as well as by what he ſays in his ſecond epiſtle to the Theſſalonians, is what every impartial and intelligent perſon muſt allow. He ſays, <hi>that in the latter times ſome ſhall depart from the faith, forbidding to marry, and commanding to abſtain from meats.</hi> Theſe circumſtances ſeem characteriſtic of, <hi>peculiar to,</hi> the Roman Catholic Church. It is ſaid in a Roman catholic catechiſm, which was printed at Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, in 1782. "<hi>Q.</hi> How many are the commandments of the church? <hi>A.</hi> Six. <hi>Q.</hi> Say the ſix commandments of the church. <hi>A.</hi> 1. To hear maſs on ſundays and holy days. 2. To faſt and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain on the days commanded. 3. To confeſs our ſins at leaſt once a year. 4. To receive at Eaſter or thereabout. 5. To pay tithes to our paſtors. 6. Not to ſolemnize marriage <hi>within forbidden times</hi> or forbidden degrees of kindred." See leſſon 25. It has been aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted by the defenders of the Roman catholic church that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding to marry, and commanding to abſtain from meats, are not peculiar to them; for that ſeveral ſects in the early ages of chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity maintained the ſame doctrines. It is to be obſerved, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that St. Paul refers to the <hi>latter times;</hi> and it may reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably be concluded that he alludes to the ſame ſeceders from the faith who were to ariſe after the Roman empire ſhould be divided, and the <hi>man of ſin</hi> ſhould be revealed. There is now no ſect of chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, excepting the Roman catholics, who forbid to marry, and command to abſtain from meats. It is at particular times that they forbid the laity, and, at all times, the prieſts, to marry. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants contend that it is unreaſonable to debar the clergy from marriage, becauſe ſome of the apoſtles were actually married men. St. Paul ſays "marriage is honourable <hi>in all,</hi> and the bed undefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led." By ſaying that thoſe who adminiſter the goſpel ſhould not marry, the papiſts reflect upon the conduct of thoſe apoſtles who had wives, and are altogether inconſiſtent and abſurd. The famous Cardinal Bellarmine makes a curious argument againſt marriage, by a bewildered interpretation of a paſſage in the Revelation of St. John. I call it a bewildered interpretation, though I allow in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reſpects the talents, the learning, and above all the elegant Latin, of the Cardinal. He ſays the locuſts in the ninth chapter of Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, who are repreſented as coming out of the bottomleſs pit, with a ſmoke, and darkening the ſun and air, are the Lutherans. He ſays a locuſt is a greedy devouring animal, like a Lutheran, not temperate like a Catholic; and that when men indulge themſelves in meats and luxurious living, they are naturally provoked to the incontinence of marriage. In this he meant to arraign the conduct of Luther, who eat meat, without regard to particular days or times of the year, and who married a nun. Though I do not think that all the religious opinions of Milton are orthodox, yet I admire his ſentiments upon the legality of marriage to all mankind, as he ſays,

In this no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e it is ſaid that the apoſtle meant "let marriage be honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in all, and the bed undefiled," that is, let married people abſtain from thoſe irregularities which are a diſgrace to the ſanctity of the marriage bed. This is good doctrine to be ſure, but is not what the Apoſtle here meant. He meant in this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of his epiſtle to the Hebrews to allow marriage to all men, by what he ſays in the firſt quoted paſſage from his epiſtle to the Corinthians.</note> If the learned reader, however, will examine the original Greek, he will find the tranſlation to be altogether juſt and unexceptionable. As futile and as erroneous are the objections of the papiſts to the tranſlation of the following paſſage, in the ſame epiſtle of St. Paul, "it is better to marry than to burn." Chap. 7. ver. 9. St. Paul tells us that St. Peter was a married man. The Pope, by ſaying that no miniſters of the goſpel ſhould marry, reflects upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of his pretended predeceſſor. I will allow, however, that in ſome caſes St. Paul recommends to a miniſter of the goſpel, if he has the gift of continence, not to marry. The Roman catholics de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote all their prieſts to celibacy, whether they have or have not the gift of continence. Some of their writers, however, ſay that they recommend to none to become prieſts except they have the gift of continence. In fact, though, the incontinence of their prieſts has been ſo great as to become proverbial. I appeal to hiſtory and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience. It is not only the clergy that they have confined to the ſingle life, but a vaſt body of monks and nuns. In France their number was prodigious. The conſequence of this was that it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to multitudes of thoſe who were ſecluded from marriage, as it happened to many of the Gentiles before the propagation of the goſpel, whom, (to uſe the words of the apoſtle) "God gave up
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:025356_0010_0FCD0360C0052080"/>unto vile affections; for even the women did change the natural uſe into that which is againſt nature: and likewiſe alſo the men, leaving the natural uſe of the woman, burned in their luſt one toward ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, men with men working that which is unſeemly." Romans i. 26, 27.—It would be ungenerous and unreaſonable to ſay that all the Roman catholics who have been unmarried have been addic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to irregular or unhallowed luſts. Some have known to poſſeſs themſelves "in ſanctification and honour." Yet the ſyſtem which indiſcriminately devotes millions to celibacy is cruel, and wicked; and they, whoever they are, that defend it, are not without fault. The monaſteries and nunneries in France, like thoſe in other parts of the world, were the nurſeries of ſloth and vice. They were filled with a ſet of people, the determined enemies of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, from their determined reſolution to continue the eccleſiaſtical tyranny which was exerciſed over it. At the time of the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Scotland, the celebrated preacher John Knox, who was <hi>a ſon of thunder,</hi> uſed to ſay that the beſt way of clearing the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from the Romiſh prieſts, was to deſtroy their monaſteries and abbeys, "that if their neſts were deſtroyed, the rooks would ſoon leave the country." In the time of Knox, the proteſtants in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land went further than is now neceſſary in France; they demoliſhed the very buildings of the Roman catholic ſocieties. The ſame ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage may be gained by converting the building of a monaſtery to a new uſe, as by its actual demolition. When however the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate and property belonging to it are ſeized, and its old inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants are turned out, they ſhould not be left to periſh, but ſhould have a proper annuity regularly paid to them. The miſchiefs which were often produced in ſociety by the prevention of prieſts from marriage, may be ſeen in the hiſtory of the celebrated Abelard and Eloiſa. He ſeduces her, but is willing to marry her. She diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuades him from marriage, leſt it ſhould prevent his preferment in the church, and ſays expreſsly (ſee her letters) that ſhe would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be his miſtreſs than his wife. Mr. Pope, in that pernicious poem which he has produced on the ſubject, with no injuſtice to her character, repreſents her wickedly ſaying,
<q>
                     <lg>
                        <l>How oft, when preſt to marriage have I ſaid,</l>
                        <l>Curſe on all laws, but thoſe which Love has made.</l>
                        <l>Love free as air, at ſight of human ties,</l>
                        <l>Spreads his light wings, and in a moment flies.</l>
                     </lg>
                     <lg>
                        <l>Not Caeſar's Empreſs would I deign to prove,</l>
                        <l>No, make me miſtreſs to the man I love.</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>It is the well known doctrine of the church of Rome, that a prieſt had better commit fornication than marry. Bellarmine ſays that marriage is worſe than fornication in a prieſt, becauſe it renders him unable to keep the vow which he has ſworn to maintain; red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit eum inhabilem ad votum ſervandum.—See Bellar. De Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chis, Lib. 2. Cap. 24.—</p>
               <p>Such a doctrine as this has a tendency to fill the world with whores and ſons of whores. The new conſtitution of France, I
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:025356_0011_0FCD0363DB7DCFB0"/>therefore think to be commendable in declaring that "the law no longer recognizes religious vows, or any other engagements contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to natural rights."</p>
               <p>I ſuppoſe it will be acknowledged by all mankind that the Roman catholics <hi>command to abſtain from meats.</hi> This is done in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the expreſs direction of St. Paul, who ſays in the tenth chapter of the firſt epiſtle to the Corinthians, "Whatſoever is ſold in the ſhambles, that eat, aſking no queſtions for conſcience ſake." If we apply to the Engliſh dictionary, we ſhall find the explanation of ſhambles to be "a butchery, a place to buy meat at." In objection to this, however, it may be ſaid, that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man catholic church only forbids the uſe of meat on <hi>certain</hi> days, and not on every day. Here again St. Paul will anſwer for us, who ſays in the epiſtle to the Coloſſians, "Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in reſpect of an holy day." The Roman catholics in ſome countries have burnt, or otherwiſe put to death, men for eating a gooſe or a bit of bacon on a faſt-day They have burnt perſons for having the Lord's prayer, or the ten commandments, in their mother-tongue. The celebrated Boſſuet, biſhop of Meaux, is an advocate for "the exerciſe of the ſword in matters of religion and conſcience" and ſays it is "A thing which in truth cannot be called in queſtion, without enervat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and as it were maiming the power of the legiſlature. So that there cannot be a more dangerous illuſion than to fix ſuffering for a characteriſtic of the true church." See the end of his ſecond vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume of avertiſſements againſt Jurieu. The Roman catholic miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionaries in Abyſſinia, upon ſome oppoſition ſaid, we muſt raiſe a civil war to promote our religion. In ſhort, it would almoſt freeze the heart with horror, and almoſt fill the world with books, if we were to tell of the cruelties and murders with which the papiſts, through a miſguided zeal, have vexed and polluted all the countries of the world. If we conſider theſe circumſtances, we ſhall find that the man of ſin foretold by St. Paul, as well as the eleventh king of Daniel, who was to "wear out the ſaints of the Moſt High" and the perſecuting character deſcribed by St. John in the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, all ſignify the Pope of Rome. St. John repreſents his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter under the emblem of a who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, <hi>drunken with the blood of the ſaints,</hi> and ſeated <hi>on ſeven mountains.</hi> And again he ſays "and the woman, which thou ſaweſt is that great city which reigneth over the kings of the earth." See Revelation, chap. 17. ver. 18. It is well known to thoſe who have read the Latin authors that they call Rome the city of ſeven hills.—Martial, among others, writes to this purpoſe, and ſays,
<q>
                     <l>Hine ſeptem Dominos videre Montes,</l>
                     <l>Et totam licet aeſtimare Romam,</l>

               </p>
               <p>It was for a long time denied by the Roman catholic writers that St. John, in this paſſage, which we have juſt quoted, meant Rome. The moſt learned of them have for ſome time, however, acknowledged that Rome is here ſignified, (ſee on this ſubject the celebrated Durham on the Revelation, Page 667) and confeſſed
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:025356_0012_0FCD03653923C6F0"/>that they could make no other interpretation. Some apply the prophecy to heathen Rome, and ſome to what Rome ſuffered under the Goths. That it cannot mean heathen Rome is moſt certain, becauſe St. John ſays that he, is to foretell things which were to come to paſs after the time he was writing. St. John, cannot be ſuppoſed to be an hiſtorian who was to relate paſt events. The prophecy in this chapter of Revelation cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to what Rome ſuffered under the Goths, becauſe it is ſaid that thoſe empires which ſhould deſtroy the papal power, ſhould be thoſe which had formerly ſupported it. See verſes 16 &amp; 17 of this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The Goths had never ſupported it. France, as well as every other power which has ſupported it, will before long, (if the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies of Daniel and St. John are true<note n="*" place="bottom">See "Obſervations upon the Downfal of the Papal Power, and the Conſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It appears from ſcripture, that though the patience of the ſaints was for a long time to be exerciſed in bearing the tyranny of the court of Rome, yet they are at laſt commanded to reſiſt her by force. "Reward her even as ſhe rewarded you, and double unto her double." Revelation, chap. 18. ver. 6. It has been ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by many perſons who are of the peaceable ſects of chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that the papal power is at laſt violently to be aboliſhed, but they can ſcarcely believe that the work is to be done by the ſaints. We ſhall be convinced, however, of this truth, if we attend to the preceding words in this chapter. It is ſaid "come out of her my people, that ye be not partakers of her ſins." See verſes 4 &amp; 5. Thoſe therefore who do not partake of her fins, namely the people of God, are to be among the executioners of this predicted wrath.</p>
               <p>It is difficult to eradicate from the minds of Roman catholics the prejudice that their church is the true, becauſe it is the moſt antient. St. Paul, as we have mentioned, prophecies of a moſt deplorable falling away, and departing from the faith; and this happened with the biſhops of Rome. For the doctrines inculcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them about the concluſion of the ſixth century were directly oppoſite to the doctrines of the apoſtles. The Roman catholics have violently contended that Peter was ſuperior to his brethren, that he was the prince of the apoſtles. This was a doctrine to which our Saviour expreſsly mentions his ſtrong diſlike. He ſays to his diſciples, "Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe dominion over them, and they that are great, exerciſe authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty upon them. But it ſhall not be ſo among you; but whoſoever will be great among you, let him be your miniſter". Matth. 20.25, 26. It is true he ſays to Peter, that he <hi>is the rock upon which be will build his church,</hi> and that he will <hi>give unto him the keys of the kingdom of heaven.</hi> Yet we cannot reaſonably ſuppoſe that he meant to exalt Peter above his brethren, for he tells them to call no man maſter. Theſe expreſſions were applicable to each of the apoſtles, excepting Judas. If, however, we were to ſix on any one apoſtle as ſuperior to the reſt, it would not be Peter. St. Paul ſays that he <hi>laboured more abundantly than all.</hi> St. John ſeems to
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:025356_0013_0FCD0366CDA1DE40"/>have approached our Saviour more in purity of mind than Peter, and to have been more beloved by him. He at his crucifixion recommends to John to conſider his mother as his own. John uſed to lie in his boſom when they were at table, and to have more of his ear when living than the reſt. To John he gave the Revelation which God had given to him, which with the Goſpel he wrote, go further (though great reſpect ſhould be had to the latter zeal of Peter) towards building up his church, than Peter's two epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles. Some doubt whether St. Peter ever was at Rome. If he was there, he was not biſhop of the place. If he had been biſhop, however, it is immaterial to the cauſe of the pope. It does not ſignify whether or not a man is ſucceſſor in the place where St. Peter was biſhop, if he teaches a different doctrine. If he was an <hi>angel from heaven,</hi> and in that place, he would <hi>be accurſed</hi> under ſuch circumſtances. St. Peter and the apoſtles taught that mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage was honorable in all men, whether miniſters of the goſpel or not. The pope ſays that no clergyman, whether he has the gift, of continence or not, ſhould marry. The binding a miniſter of the goſpel by a vow not to do what is lawful to every man, is as wicked as tyrannical. The apoſtles ſay we may eat meat on eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day of the week.

The apoſtles were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with little, and propagated the goſpel "without money, and without price." The popes riot in every luxury, and will violently take the goods of others.

On a day, which they call Maundy Thurſday, they curſe (or they uſed to curſe) all the good people in the world; and I do believe, if ever theſe hallowed pages ſhould reach Rome, that neither they not their pious author would be ſecluded from the common execration. In the old and new teſtaments we are frequently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to avoid idolatry. The apoſtles repreſent it as a crime of the firſt magnitude, and that thoſe who commit it have no place in the kingdom of heaven. The decalogue ſays "Thou ſhalt not make to thee any graven image—thou ſhalt not bow down thyſelf to them, nor ſerve them. For I the Lord thy God am a jealous God." The council of Trent ſays "that images ſhould have due honor and worſhip given them for thoſe they repreſent; as not only putting off the hat, but falling down before them." And the Roman catechiſm ſays that "images ſhould be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped." This conduct of the papiſts is ſo flagrantly and palpably contradictory to that part of the decalogue which I have quoted; that they have thought it prudent in their common prayer books to print the decalogue without this part of it. This is an indiſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fact, and can be proved at once by an appeal to the liturgies of the church of Rome, to liturgies printed under the authority of the pope. The plea, that this was done for the ſake of brevity, is altogether unſatisfactory, as the whole of the decalogue is but ſhort, and every part is of the greateſt importance. The papiſts call the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Mary the queen of heaven, regina coeli, laetare, alleluiah. This is an expreſſion borrowed from the idolatrous language of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens. They pray to her ſometimes as to a deity, and not as to a
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:025356_0014_0FCD03689BE87090"/>mediator or interceſſor. Their prayers to the virgin Mary as an interceſſor, are inceſſant and innumerable; notwithſtanding what St. Paul has ſaid that "there is one God, and one Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Man." 1 Timothy, 2; 5. They have "the roſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the bleſſed Virgin, and the litany of our lady of Loretto." They call the virgin Mary our Lady of Loretto, becauſe, as they ſay, ſome angels took the houſe, in which ſhe lived in the holy land, to Loretto, in Italy. The Roman catholics alſo (I defy contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction for I write with their prayer book before me) pray to St. Fabran and St. Sebaſtian, to St. Gervaſe, and St. Protaſe, to St. Beroard, and St. Dominick, as interceſſors. I like the praying to St. Dominick the leaſt of all their prayers, becauſe I think him one of the worſt men that ever exiſted.

At the elevation of the hoſt they ſay "Moſt adorable body, I adore thee with all the powers of my ſoul." Some of the popiſh writers acknowledge, that if the real preſence was not contained in the ſacrament, their church would be guilty of as groſs idolatry as ever was practiſed, by the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens. As this is a matter of great importance. I will make ſome further obſervations upon it. It may be proved by arguments as convincing to a candid mind as mathematical demonſtration, that the real preſence is not contained in the ſacrament, and therefore that the papiſts are flagrant idolators. In the creed of Pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> 4th. before his elevation to the papal chair, which by Roman catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics is thought the eſſence of orthodoxy, it is ſaid "I do profeſs that in the moſt holy ſacrament of the euchariſt, there is troly, really and ſubſtantially, the body and blood, together with the ſoul and divinity, of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and that there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion made of the whole ſubſtance of the bread into the body, and of the whole ſubſtance of the wine into the blood; which converſion the Catholic Church calls tranſubſtantiation." Some proteſtant writers have uſed as ſtrong an argument againſt tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, as can be uſed againſt any error whatever. It is obvious to every one, it cannot be controverted, that our Saviour his ſelf
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:025356_0015_0FCD0369D014F180"/>inſtituted the ſacrament? Now ſay the proteſtants, could he eat his own body, and drink his own blood? If the bread had by our Saviour been converted into fleſh, and the wine into blood, it is reaſonable to ſuppoſe that his diſciples would have made ſome ſcruples about eating human fleſh, and drinking human blood. His diſciples were Jews, who by the law were ſtrictly commanded not to taſte the blood even of thoſe animals whoſe fleſh they eat. And it is the cuſtom of the Jews at this day, to ſqueeze the meat which they eat till it is altogether free from blood. If therefore the diſciples did not heſitate in any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner at taking the ſacrament in the way it was adminiſtered by their Lord, we have a right to conclude that they thought him ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>figuratively</hi> and not <hi>literally,</hi> when he called the bread his body and the wine his blood, as when he called himſelf <hi>a door</hi> and <hi>a vine.</hi> The apoſtles, after the death of our Saviour, agreed that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Gentiles were not to be bound to circumciſion, but were to "keep themſelves from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from things ſtrangled, and from fornication." It chriſtians are to abſtain from the blood of a beaſt, ſhould they be allowed to drink the blood of a man? If the bread in the ſacrament is converted into the real body of Chriſt, ſhould not we expect to ſee a body diſtinguiſhable by head, and hands, and feet, inſtead of a round maſs of bread? If an experiment were made upon common and what is called conſecrated bread and wine, would they not grow mouldy and ſour in the ſame proportion of time? That there is a converſion, in the manner Roman catholics contend, in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, implies the power in the worſt of men of working a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, whenever they pleaſe. The candid part of them muſt allow that ſome of their clergy and ſome of their popes have been pollut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with every vice of which human nature is capable; that (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the expreſſion of the prophet) <hi>from the ſole of the foot, even unto the head, there has been no ſoundneſs, but wounds, and bruiſes, and putrifying ſores.</hi> And I will allow that ſome of the clergy, as well as the laity, of their communion, have been remarkable for their virtues. Who can read the works of the celebrated Prince of Conti without being ſtruck with his many amiable virtues? He contends againſt the immoral tendency of the ſtage with the purity of a primitive chriſtian. St. Paul ſays in his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond epiſtle to the Theſſalonians that ſome of thoſe who followed "the man of ſin, were to follow him with the deceivableneſs of unrighteouſneſs." By which phraſe, I conceive he meant, that they were to ſuppoſe themſelves doing right when doing wrong. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to my obſervations relative to tranſubſtantiation, I think it has been well obſerved that God made man, but man can never make God. It is moſt certain that the popiſh prieſts blaſphemouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and wickedly ſay that the bread which they have conſecrated is God, that it has the power of working miracles, a power which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Among other inſtances he ſays, "<hi>A fox quits the hen he had carried away by virtue of the holy ſacrament.</hi> St. Gregory the pope tells us that St. Boniface, whilſt he was a young child, ſtanding at the door of his lodging, he perceived a fox running away with a hen in his mouth. Immediately away he went to the church, and placing himſelf before the holy ſacrament, he made this prayer to it. "Lord, I beſeech thee to preſerve the pullen which my mother feeds in her back yard, for the ſuſtenance of her little family." Having done this he returned to his lodging, where this fox appeared again with the hen in his mouth, and laying down the hen, fell down dead at the feet of this child. S. Gregor. Dialog. lib. 1." If this be not idolatry, if this be not worſhipping as God, a thing which we have made with out hands, I know not where we can find idolatry.</p>
               <p>Such being the principles of the Roman catholics, I cannot agree with Mr. Burke that it was impious and wicked in the French to overthrow their church. Mr. Burke makes frequent and bitter lamentation through all his pamphlets relative to the French revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, for the deſtruction of this church. It was therefore perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, it was ad rem, when treating of the revolution, to mention the principles of the Roman catholic church. A great deal of the queſtion relative to the propriety or impropriety of the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is involved in the queſtion, whether the Roman catholic re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is true or not. It is agreed by all proteſtant commentators of note upon the prophecies (among whom we may reckon Sir Iſaac Newton and Joſeph Mede) that the Roman catholic church is to continue 1260 years<note n="*" place="bottom">See on this ſubject my before-mentioned Pamphlet on the Downfall of the Papal Power.—</note> Many learned commentators on ſcripture ſuppoſe theſe 1260 years are nearly expired. If their ſuppoſitions be juſt, the French revolution is the precurſor to the total and final extirpation of the papal power, and has been brought about by divine appointment that the prophecies may be fulfilled.—In ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, however, I would not wiſh to be underſtood as meaning that the whole of this matter has been effected by hallowed hands. It is a judicious obſervation of Sir Iſaac Newton that the Almighty will ſuffer infidelity as well as true religion at laſt to extirpate the errors and abominations of popery.—God may ſometimes execute his wrath by his children, or he may make the wicked ſometimes the inſtruments of that wrath. He may execute his wrath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by the means of both.—Mr Burke ſeems to have a violent prepoſſeſſion in favor of the Roman catholic religion, which has miſled his judgment relative to the French revolution. He ſays in his letter to the archbiſhop of Aix "your church, the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of which was the ornament of the chriſtian world in its proſperity, is now more brilliant in the moment of its misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, to the eyes who are capable of judging of it." And again Mr. Burke ſays in the ſame letter "maintain, Sir, the courage which you have hitherto ſhown; and be perſuaded that though the world is not worthy of you and your colleagues, we are not all inſenſible to the honor which you do to our common nature." I think it would be difficult for <hi>a profeſſed catholic</hi> to ſay any thing more deciſive in favor of his religion. Theſe colleagues of the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:025356_0017_0FCD036F6DED2808"/>archbiſhop of Aix, of whom the world is not worthy, were (however amiable in ſome reſpects in private life) the ſupporters of the moſt peſtilent ſuperſtition that the world ever ſaw.—A part of this horrible ſyſtem of ſuperſtition I have deſcribed in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding pages. To deſcribe more would be inconvenient in a work like this.—Mr. Burke ſeems to imagine that all the oppoſition to the religious eſtabliſhment in France has proceeded from atheiſm or from deiſm, that it has been made "in a drunken delirium from the hot ſpirit drawn out of the alembick of hell."—The oppoſition to the religious eſtabliſhment was unitedly made by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts and by chriſtians. Mr. Rabaut de St. Etienne on the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing motion which was made by the Comte de Caftellane in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Aſſembly "no man ſhall be moleſted for his opinions, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted in the exerciſe of his religion," ſays that his conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents "are a juriſdiction (ſenécha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He ſays in the ſame ſpeech, that there are two millions of proteſtants in the kingdom of France.—Meſſieurs Condorcet and Peyſonnel compute the proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants to be three millions.</p>
               <p>Mr. Burke appears to be an obſtinate advocate for a church eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment. He ſays in his firſt pamphlet on the French revolution "Firſt I beg leave to ſpeak of our church eſtabliſhment, which is the firſt of our prejudices, not a prejudice deſtitute of reaſon, but involving in it profound and extenſive wiſdom. I ſpeak of it firſt. It is firſt, and laſt, and midſt in our minds. For taking ground on that religious ſyſtem, of which we are now in poſſeſſion, we continue to act on the early received, and uniformly continued ſenſe of mankind." And again he ſays "the conſecration of the ſtate, by a ſtate religious eſtabliſhment, is neceſſary alſo to operate with a wholeſome awe upon free citizen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>." A church eſtabliſhment im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies that men ſhould preach the goſpel for hire, and that the clergy have a right to collect tithes from the people. Which things are expreſsly forbidden by the goſpel. Our Saviour ſaid to his diſciples "freely ye have received, freely give." St. Paul ſays that "theſe hands have miniſtered to my neceſſities." The mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a bargain before-hand for what a man ſhall receive for preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the making it a profeſſion whereby he is to obtain a livelihood, has no foundation in chriſtianity. The tithes by which the clergy are ſupported, are forbidden in the new teſtament, and are injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to liberty, and to agriculture, which is one of the nobleſt and moſt beneficial employments to mankind. St. Paul ſays (ſpeaking of things under the Moſaic diſpenſation) "and verily they that are of the ſons of Levi, who receive the office of the prieſthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people, according to the law." Hebrews, chap. 7. ver. 5. And ſoon after he ſays "for the prieſthood being changed, there is made of neceſſity a change alſo of the law. For he of whom theſe things are ſpoken per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar. For it is evident that our Lord ſprang out of Judah; of which tribe Moſes ſpake nothing concerning the prieſthood." Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, 12, 13, 14.—That the miniſters of the goſpel in the preſent day have a right to tithes, like the Levites of old, will appear by no means reaſonable, if we conſider the origin of tithes under the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:025356_0018_0FCD0371573715B0"/>Moſaic Law. The levites were one of the tribes of Iſrael, and were to have tithes inſtead of a ſhare of the land, which they had a right to in common with their brethren. The prieſts, who ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the altar, were allowed but a tenth part of the tithes. The nine other parts were allotted to the general body of the Levites, and to be kept for widows and ſtrangers.—The clergy of our day who receive tithes, inherit, like other men, the poſſeſſion of their anceſtors, and ſome of them conſiderable eſtates, and yet will take the whole tithes, and give what they pleaſe, and perhaps but little to the widow and the ſtranger. Tithes and circumciſion, parts of the old law, are equally abliſhed by the New Teſtament; and it would be as reaſonable in the clergy to circumciſe us by force, as to take our property for tithes in the ſame violent manner.—It is moſt certain that tithes were not demanded in the times of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive chriſtians, but were extorted by the papal power.

I conceive that the drawing a political line of diſtinction between us and them has a tendency to prevent their converſion, that the unlimited toleration of them has a tendency to bring them over to the goſpel, and therefore that the unlimited toleration of them is the cauſe of God.</p>
               <p>In our conduct towards the Jews we ſhould imitate St. Paul who ſays "unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews." He never inſulted them in the manner that ſome who call themſelves Chriſtians inſult them. One would ſuppoſe that the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton abuſe of them for their religious principles, would irritate their minds, would inflame them to a deſire of revenge, and have a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to confirm them in their unbelief. They might from this entertain a diſguſt to the principles and the truth of the goſpel, from the folly and wickedneſs of thoſe who call themſelves <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> friends. St. Paul addreſſes them with the tenderneſs of a parent towards his children. He ſays "my heart's deſire and prayer to God for Iſrael is, that they might be ſaved." Our Saviour's miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was at firſt intended only for the Jews. "I am not ſent but unto the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael." He laments with an affectionate and pleaſing ſenſibility the invincible obduracy of the Jews. "O Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem, which killeſt the prophets, and ſtoneſt them which are ſent unto thee: how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings, and ye would not! behold your houſe is left unto you deſolate."—He ſhed tears over Jeruſalem, when he reflected up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her coming deſtruction. And when he was extended by the Jews upon the croſs, with a patience that triumphed over ſcorn and over torture, he mildly ſays, (O admirable meekneſs! O godlike benevolence!) "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do." Thoſe who wiſh to be the true diſciples of our Saviour and of his apoſtles ſhould endeavour to imitate them in this as in other matters. If it ſhould be obſerved the prophets mention that the Jews were to be "ſcattered among all people" and were to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come "a curſe, and an aſtoniſhment, and a hiſſing, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach." I will anſwer that theſe prophecies refer to the time of
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:025356_0020_0FCD0374427205B8"/>the apoſtacy, from which dark and gloomy night, the glorious goſpel of our Saviour is going to emerge as brilliant as the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtar.</p>
               <p>The French have not led the Jews away captive. They ſhould not wiſh them to ſit down and weep by the waters of France, and to hang their harps upon the willows which grow therein.</p>
               <p>The French nation will immediately reap an advantage from the naturalization of the Jews, from giving them the ſame political pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges with others, in an increaſe of ſubjects attached to the new go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment which ſecures them theſe privileges. It is a childiſh ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity to ſuppoſe, that where the Jews are naturalized, they will overrun, and be miſchievous to, the country which naturalizes them. The learned Abbé Gregoire, who is in many reſpects an amiable man, and a friend to humanity, though he profeſſes himſelf to be a Catholic, in his late curious Eſſay<note n="*" place="bottom">It is entitled (according to the Engliſh tranſlation) "An Eſſay on the Phyſical Moral, and Political Reformation of the Jews. A work crowned by the Royal, Society of Arts and Sciences at Metz. By the Abbé Gregoire, a member of that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety."</note> on the Jewiſh Nation ſays, that there are at preſent about five millions of Jews in the world. If they were all to emigrate to France, and probably ſhe will never ſee a fifth part of them at a time, what could they do, if they had hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile intentions, againſt twenty five millions of people? It is the part, however, of men who are perſecuted, and not of men who are reſtored to equal rights with others, to bear hoſtile intentions. It is by juſtice, and humanity, and not by perſecution, that a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ſecures itſelf. To do good to thoſe who are governed, ſhould be the object of every government, and it ſhould be to the people what the poet ſays the river Nile is to Egypt,

               <p>Mr. Burke ſays of the Engliſh Nation, "They do not conſider their church eſtabliſhment as convenient but as eſſential to their ſtate; not as a thing heterogeneous and ſeparable; ſomething added for accommodation; what they may either keep up or lay aſide, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their temporary ideas of convenience. They conſider it as the foundation of their whole conſtitution, with which, and with every part of which, it holds an indiſſoluble union. Church and ſtate are ideas inſeparable in their minds, and ſcarcely is the one ever mentioned without mentioning the other." For my part I cannot ſee that the church eſtabliſhment is eſſentia to the ſtate. Other ſtates have thriven without ſuch a religious eſtabliſhment, and therefore it is not neceſſary to England. That the Engliſh conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution merits high admiration, I ſhall endeavour to prove in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing pages. I mean to defend the great outlines of it, an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary monarch, with an hereditary nobility, and with an houſe of commons freely elected from the people, as a government ſuited to
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:025356_0021_0FCD0375B9523990"/>the genius of the people of England. Cicero ſays, "Statuo eſſe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time conſtitutam rempublicam, quae ex tribus generibus illi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gali, optimo, &amp; populari modice confuſa." I do not know whether this be true, yet I think where there is a monarchy, the Engliſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution is an excellent plan of government. I cannot perceive, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, how the excluſive eſtabliſhment of the church of England is neceſſary to the Engliſh conſtitution. If we examine the liturgy of the church of England, we ſhall find that it has a conſiderable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance to that of the church of Rome. Both liturgies have the creed of St. Athanaſius. It is aſſerted, to the diſgrace of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, at the concluſion of this creed, as it is printed in the Roman Catholic liturgy, "This is the Catholic faith, which except a man believe faithfully and ſtedfaſtly he cannot be ſaved." And the liturgy of the church of England adopts it, but omits (in the way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation) the word ſtedfaſtly. "This is the Catholic faith, which except a man believe faithfully, he cannot be ſaved." The doctrine of the Trinity, as maintained in this creed, has not any foundation in ſcripture, and is an affront to reaſon. It is the opinion of the great Sir Iſaac Newton, in his letters to Le Clerc, that the maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it as a point neceſſary to be believed, has conſiderably impeded the progreſs of Chriſtianity. Calling the ſon of God, Almighty, and praying to him as if he were the Almighty, is erroneous. It is ſaid in ſcripture "I am the Lord thy God—thou ſhalt have none other Gods but me." Exodus, 20. 2, 3. "Hear, O Iſrael, the Lord our God is one Lord." Deut. 6.4. "Lord God of Iſrael, there is no God like thee, in heaven above, or on earth beneath." 1 Kings, 8.23. "To whom then will ye liken me, or ſhall I be equal? ſaith the holy one." Iſaiah 40.25. "I am the Lord, and there is none elſe, there is no God beſides me: that they may know, from the riſing of the ſun, and from the weſt, that there is none beſides me: I am the Lord and there is none elſe." Iſa. 45.5, 6. "Thus ſaith the Lord thy redeemer, the holy one of Iſrael." Iſa. 48.17. And I conceive, as has been aſſerted by the learned Dr. Clarke, that, in the ſixth verſe of the ninth chapter of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, the words relating to Chriſt "everlaſting father" ſhould be tranſlated "Father of the age to come." Vide "Clarke on the Attributes." Page 403. See alſo an admirable demonſtration in this book that there could not originally be two omnipotent being. "And the Lord ſhall be king over all the earth. In that day there ſhall be one Lord, and his name one." Zechariah, 14.9. Thus much we read in the Old Teſtament. In the the New Teſtament we read that our Saviour prayed to the deity, which manifeſtly ſhows that he was inferior to and dependent upon him. He could not have given us an example of piety, if he had not been dependent upon God. He is jealous of their putting him upon the ſame rank with God. He expreſsly forbids it. He expreſsly mentions his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriority. "Why calleſt thou me good? There is none good, ſave one, that is God." Luke 18.19. "For my father is greater than I." John 14.28. This, however, is evaded by ſaying that reference is here made to the human, and not to the celeſtial nature of our Saviour. St. Paul, however, ſays of the Almighty "For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he ſaith all things are put under him, it is manifeſt that he is excepted which did put all things under him. And when all things ſhall be ſubdued unto him,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:025356_0022_0FCD03774DD8A5B0"/>then ſhall the Son alſo himſelf be ſubject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all." 1 Corinth. 15. 27, 28. The inferiority of our Saviour to his celeſtial nature is here clearly and unequivocally determined. He is not excepted from all which is put in ſubjection to God himſelf, at the conſummation of all things. St. Paul ſays "There is none other God but one. For though there be that are called Gods, whether in Heaven or in Earth (as there be Gods many, and Lords many); but to us there is but one God, the father <hi>of</hi> whom are all things <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and we in him: and one Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>by</hi> whom are all things <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and we by him." 1 Corinth. 8. 4, 5, 6. And St. Paul ſays of our Saviour, "Who is the image of the inviſible God, <hi>the firſt born of every creature.</hi>". Coloſs. 1.15. Nor do I conceive that the paſſage in the Epiſtle to the Phillippians is contradictory to what the apoſtle ſays in other places. "Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: but made himſelf of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a ſervant, and was made in the likeneſs of Men. Wherefore God alſo hath highly exalted him." Philipp. 2. 5, 6, 7, 9, For I conceive that we improperly tranſlate the words, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in this manner, "thought it not robbery to be equal with God." The Greek word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> from <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> aſſimilo, ſignifies only ſimilis, and therefore it would be more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to tranſlate the words thus "thought it not robbery to be like unto God." I think it will appear from the context (which it is always right to conſider in our comments upon a paſſage in any author) the apoſtle did not mean to ſay that Chriſt was equal to God, in the ſtrict ſenſe of the word, that is, not in any point inferior, for he immediately afterwards ſays, "Wherefore God hath highly exalted him." It is obvious to common ſenſe, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>trict ſenſe of the word "equal" to it.</p>
               <p>Some have thought that the firſt part of the goſpel of St. John is a plain and direct refutation of all this ſyſtem of reaſoning.—"In the beginning" has not ſo unlimited a ſenſe as ſome ſhould make us believe. We are told in the firſt part of Geneſis that this world was made, "in the beginning." It muſt have been created, however, a vaſt length of time after the exiſtence of the Almighty himſelf. "The word" by St. John is certainly called "God." But ſtill our Saviour in my opinion is God of God, and not God of himſelf, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and not <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, according to the old learned phraſe. He is ſaid in this very firſt chapter of St. John to be "begotten of the father," which juſtifies my opinion. What is begotten cannot be originally ſelf-exiſtent.</p>
               <p>We ſhould be cautions, while we do not exalt our Saviour to a rank which is too high, that we do not improperly degrade him. He is not equal to the Almighty, but he is more than a man, and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet. It is ſaid of our Saviour in the above mentioned chapter of St. John that "the world was made by him." The conception of Mary, was certainly miraculous. We are told in the firſt chapter of St. Luke. "Then ſaid Mary unto the angel, how ſhall this be, ſeeing I know not a man? And the angel anſwered and ſaid unto her, the Holy Ghoſt ſhall come upon thee, and the power of the higheſt ſhall overſhadow thee: therefore alſo that holy thing which
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:025356_0023_0FCD03799D4B4868"/>ſhall be born of thee ſhall be called the ſon of God." Dr. Prieſtly, and thoſe who would wiſh to conſider the exordium of Luke and other paſſages in ſcripture, which mention the pre-exiſtence of our Saviour, as interpolations, teach a very dangerous principle. By ſuch a conduct we ſhall give an example to others to conſider as<note n="*" place="bottom">Though we ſhould be cautions, how we admit paſſages of ſcripture to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polations, yet it is not impoſſible there may be ſuch things—Sir Iſaac Newton con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends that the following paſſage, in the firſt epiſtle general of St. John, is an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polation. "For there are three that bear record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt; and theſe three are one." Chap 5. ver. 7. Sir Iſaac ſays that in the old manuſcript which is ſuppoſed to contain theſe words, they are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the margin, in a different hand, and probably by a monk. See his Letters to Le Clerc. Dr. Burnet in his "Travels through France, Italy, Germany, and Switz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erland" ſays that he took great pains "to examine all the ancient manuſcripts of the New Teſtament" concerning this doubted paſſage. Burnet tells us Eraſmus ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the paſſage to be ſpurious; and the Doctor, though he wiſhes to belive it authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic, acknowledges that it is ſcarcely to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He ſays "the paſſage is not to be found in the Vatican manuſcript," which be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes to be "of great value" and to be the oldeſt which he ſaw. See Burnet's Travels, Pages 53, 54, 55, duodecimo.—</note> interpolations thoſe paſſages of ſcripture which are inconſiſtent with their views and deſires, and in the end make the ſcripture ſay what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we pleaſe. The paſſages in the New Teſtament, which ſpeak of the ſuperiority of our Saviour to common humanity, are ſo nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, that it would be truly awful to get rid of them as interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations. This, however, would not anſwer the purpoſe of thoſe who degrade the illuſtrious Son and Miniſter of God. They muſt alſo get rid of ſome paſſages in the ancient Prophets. The follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſſage in Iſaiah, which is acknowledged by all the Jews to be genuine, though they interpret it differently from us, and which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not with any reaſon be ſuſpected for an interpolation, is directly againſt thoſe who would level our Saviour to the rank of a mere man. "Therefore the Lord himſelf ſhall give you a ſign, Behold, a virgin ſhall conceive, and bear a ſon, and ſhall call his name Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel." Chap. 7. ver. 14. Immanuel ſignifies God.—By this method of interpreting the ſcripture, which is fair and juſt, we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate the objection, which is made by Jews and Mahometans, that Chriſtians are idolators, for we inculcate the belief of one God, that is, of one ſelf-exiſtent and omnipotent God; though we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that be delegated a vaſt portion of his power to that Son whom he himſelf created.</p>
               <p>Calling alſo the Holy Ghoſt, Almighty, and praying to it, as to the Almighty, is erroneous. The Holy Ghoſt, in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of ſcripture, is nothing more than the Holy Spirit of God, that is, the influence of God. (<gap reason="foreign">

To call the ſpirit of God, God himſelf, to pray to the ſpirit of a being, inſtead of, and in derogation to, the being who bears that ſpirit, muſt be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper. In the liturgy of the church of Rome, in "the lita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our lady of Loretto" we read "God the Father of Heaven, have mercy on us.

In the litany which is in the liturgy of the church of England, we read "O God the Father of Heaven, have mercy upon us miſerable ſinners.

The doctrine of the Trinity has been borrowed, with other doctrines, from the church of Rome, by the church of England. The church of England alſo, in imitation of the church of Rome, inculcates that her prieſts have the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of abſolution. In the "viſitation of the ſick" in the liturgy of the church of England we read "Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath left power to his church to abſolve all ſinners, who truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and believe in him, of his great mercy forgive thee thine of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences; and by his authority committed to me, I abſolve thee from all thy ſins, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt." In ſhort, we have, according to an expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the late celebrated Earl of Chatham, "a Popiſh liturgy." If we examine the hiſtory of England alſo before the glorious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution under William the third, we ſhall find that the church of England followed the church of Rome in the path of perſecution. Sewel, in his hiſtory of the Quakers, ſays, that before the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſometimes more than four thouſand perſons have been at one time confined in England for frequenting meetings, denying to ſwear, &amp;c.—Their goods were ſeized; and they were often kept in cold naſty ground without ſtraw, and for ſeveral days without victuals, through which multitudes immaturely periſhed.—In the times of Elizabeth, and of James the firſt, men were burned for ſentiments which were contrary to the doctrines of the church of England, and eſteemed hereſy. It was at the revolution in 1688, when the diſſenters were allowed to attend their ſeveral meeting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes without the penalties of the law, and when the toleration of religious opinions was conſiderably enlarged. King William (whoſe memory deſerves the higheſt affection and regard) wiſhed, but could not obtain, a liberal toleration. When he came to the crown of England, he earneſtly recommended the cauſe of the diſſenters to the parliament and ſaid, "while he doubted not they would ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently provide againſt Papiſts, he hoped they would leave room for the admiſſion of all Proteſtants that were willing and able to ſerve." He added, "this conjunction in my ſervice will tend to the better uniting you amongſt yourſelves, and the ſtrengthening you againſt your common adverſaries." Much certainly is yet wanting to be done for the ſalutary advancement of toleration. The force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe who are to be admitted into the offices of government, previouſly to take the ſacrament according to the ceremonies of the church of England,<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr Price very properly ranks this as a public iniquity.

               <p>Mr. Burke in his indignation, againſt the prevailing deiſm in France, ſhould have reflected that this has been greatly occaſioned
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:025356_0025_0FCD037C74944BF0"/>by the abſurd and pernicious doctrines of the Roman Catholics.

There are other deiſts who might ſay the ſame thing with Lord Rocheſter. If we conſider the biſhops in England, we ſhall ſometimes find that inſtead of reſembling the meek, virtuous, and humble apoſtles of our Lord, they are proud, ambitious, hard-hearted, and bear a greater reſemblance to Dives who "was clothed in <hi>purple</hi> and <hi>fine linen,</hi> and fared ſumptouſly every day." If the clergy in England could thus make men deiſts, what muſt have been done by the clergy in France? It was a ſaying of the celebrated Dr. Ogden of Cambridge to a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who was admiring the young clergy "Ah! madam, if you had been at the ſhop where the ware is made, you would have leſs reſpect for it." I have been at this ſhop (the Univerſity of Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge) and think the doctor's obſervation contains much truth; for a ſet of more debauched, profligate, and deiſtical men, than the young clergy there, are with difficulty to be met with.

How imperfect in this reſpect is the character of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent miniſter, Mr. Pitt, to that of his enlightened and virtuous fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther! The preſent miniſter has always oppoſed the admiſſion of diſſenters to the offices of government, and contended, with a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of perſecution ſimilar to that of Popery, that none have a right to them but who are of the church of England. In this he has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared as unjuſt as he was great and commendable in his very judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious contention for the abolition of the ſlave trade and for a refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in parliament. From this latter ſcheme, however, he has unhappily for himſelf and for his country apoſtatized. His cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated rival Mr. Fox, with equal talents, has contended for the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition of the ſlave trade, and now contends for the reformation of parliament, and for toleration of the diſſenters. If a dereliction of his irregularities in private life which has been begun ſhould be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried

It was lamentable to ſee a man, who was frequently exerting gigantic talents to ſave the ſtate, as ill-attended almoſt in private life as Cataline who wiſhed to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw it.

               <p>I WILL conſider whether the conſtitution of England, with juſt amendments, would have been a proper model of government for France at this time. I am decidedly of opinion that it would.</p>
               <p>I will firſt conſider whether it would have been wiſe in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of France, at this time to preſerve their monarchy; and after that, whether it would have been wiſe to preſerve their nobility, and to form their new government upon the great outlines of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh conſtitution.</p>
               <p>It has been urged by the writers againſt monarchy, that it is a ſyſtem of government reprobated in ſcripture. I call it a ſyſtem of government, in conformity to the opinion and expreſſion of all learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed writers on government, notwithſtanding an abſurd expreſſion uſed by Mr. Paine, that it is a nullity of ſyſtem. It is a word formed from the compoſition of two Greek words <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and ſignifies a government, or rather the executive part of it, in the hands of one man. In this latter ſenſe it is uſed by Monteſquieu. The monarchy which is reprobated in the firſt book of Samuel, is an abſolute monarchy. Samuel tells the people of Iſrael that your monarch "will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your olive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards, even the beſt of them, and will give them to his ſervants." And again he ſays "He will take the tenth of your ſheep, and ye ſhall be his ſervants." This is in no reſpect ſuch a monarch as the conſtitution of England deſigned the king of that country. The King of England can take no man's field, or his vineyard, or the tenth of his ſheep, at his pleaſure. It is fact, which fell within my own knowledge, that a wealthy and capricious old woman for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time refuſed to ſell, notwithſtanding repeated entreaties, a ſpot of ground which ſhe poſſeſſed, to the preſent king, which
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:025356_0027_0FCD038387468C80"/>he wiſhed to purchaſe at a high price, that he might add it, to his gardens at Richmond. There are inſtances of the king of England being ſued, as a private perſon would be ſued, in the Engliſh courts of law. Bracton the old lawyer ſays that in England "The pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the king is the power of the law." Some of the kings of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland have been fond of calling themſelves "the great ſervant of the commonwealth of England." And though it may be urged, that James the firſt, in particular, who uſed this appellation, was him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf too fond of arbitrary power; yet it ſerves to ſhow, that he would ſometimes utter a language to pleaſe thoſe who were the rational admirers of the Engliſh conſtitution. To return to the argument relative to monarchy being reprobated in ſcripture, I muſt obſerve that in the firſt epiſtle of Peter it is ſaid "ſubmit yourſelves to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ordinance of man for the Lord's ſake; whether it be <hi>to the king as ſupreme;</hi> or unto governors, as unto thoſe that are ſent by him for the puniſhment of evil-doers, and for the praiſe of them that do well." Chap. 2. ver. 13, 14. The meaning of which words muſt be, I think every candid and intelligent perſon will allow, that we ſhould not as Chriſtians endeavour to overſet a government, whether it is monarchical or republican, if that government is rightly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered. A little while after in the ſame chapter St. Peter ſays too "fear God, honour the king."<note n="*" place="bottom">St. Paul alſo tells us to pray for "Kings, and for all that are in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life." 1 Timothy 2.2.</note> How can we honour the king if, according to the notion held out in a vain and ſilly letter written by Mr. Thomas Paine to the Abbé Sieyes, we reduce all kings to the ſtate of private individuals? I therefore am of opinion that the firſt National Aſſembly of France (the conſtituent aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly as it is frequently called) were wiſe in not aboliſhing their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, and I was happy to find that out of near a thouſand mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, only eight were of the ſame antimonarchical principles with Mr. Paine.</p>
               <p>I will now conſider whether it would have been wiſe in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of France to preſerve their nobility. I think it was unwiſe to aboliſh their nobility, as it might inflame the reſentment of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean Nations, leſt ſuch a ſpirit of innovation ſhould reach their dominions, as a nobility well regulated might be of no diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the country, and as it might attach the nobility of France to the new eſtabliſhment of political affairs. In the time of Charles the firſt, the republicans, as they called themſelves, aboliſhed in England, the monarchy in the family of the Stuarts, and the Houſe of Lords.—And yet, ſo ſtrangely inconſiſtent are mankind, they ſuffered the Long Parliament to vote themſelves perpetual, to continue their ſeats in the legiſlature for ever unrevokable by the people. The advocates for this meaſure contended, that the unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted attention to buſineſs would better frame men to be legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators, than one that was diſcontinued at the caprice of others. They would not allow this argument to avail in favour of one branch of the legiſlature, the Houſe of Lords, which they urged in favour of the Houſe of Commons, the whole of the legiſlature, and of the government, at that time. Theſe men, who would not have a monarch from the Houſe of Stuart, ſet up at laſt a monarchy in the Houſe of Cromwell. For names do not ſignify much with men
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:025356_0028_0FCD0384C642CC68"/>of underſtanding. A man may have the power of a monarch with the name of protector. The reſult of all this was that the people of England grew ſick of Long Parliaments which they could not controul, of hypocritical or weak protectors, (for Oliver was the one and Richard Cromwell the other) that they as eagerly deſired their old noble conſtitution again "as the thirſty hart panteth for the water-brooks." Thoſe who have read the Engliſh hiſtory well know that the nobility and the monarch made a common cauſe with the intelligent part of the nation, and at laſt re-eſtabliſhed the ancient form of government. I wiſh, however, to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood when ſpeaking of theſe proceedings, that I am no advocate for the tyrannical meaſures of the firſt or ſecond Charles, but for the Engliſh Conſtitution well altered and well adminiſterd. It may happen in France, as it happened in England, that the diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nobility may league with the diſcontented monarch, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn that government which was eſtabliſhed to their diſadvantage. Whereas, if the people of France had formed a ſyſtem of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſimilar to the Engliſh conſtitution, the monarch would have had no reaſon to be diſcontented, the nobility erected into a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate branch of the legiſlature, and made hereditory counſellors of the kingdom, would have found themſelves honoured with a new conſequence, have found themſelves and their country happier, and would generally have been inclined to ſupport that new ſyſtem of government. Some perſons have a violent averſion to nobility which perhaps may not be ſtrictly defenſible. I confeſs myſelf I ſee no occaſion for them in thoſe countries where they have not before exiſted. Yet in thoſe countries where they already exiſt, I would have the privileges of the order well regulated, and and not the order entirely aboliſhed. Some of their titles may be ridiculous and improper. But I ſee nothing which gives great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence in Earl, which is derived from a Saxon word ſignifying Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, or in Count, which is derived from the Latin word Comes, and fignifies, according to Bracton and Fleta, the fellow and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of a king. Some who call themſelves republicans diſlike the name of Earl, but are fond of Excellency, a very flattering title. It may with ſome appearance of reaſon be urged that taking away the privileges of nobility from a family, which have been gained by the valour, the wiſdom, the integrity of their anceſtors, is as unjuſt as taking away the money which they have gained in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. If it ſhould be obſerved, that titles may do miſchief to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, I will ſay the ſame of immenſe wealth. It may fairly, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, be ſaid that a nobility under proper regulations, may, in a country where a monarchy has been ſome time eſtabliſhed, be of advantage to that country. There is ſomething certainly in blood. There is ſome preſumption that a valiant and generous father will beget a valiant and generous ſon.

               <p>It has been ſaid by the advocates againſt nobility, that titles are harmleſs or abſurd nick-names. If titles are harmleſs, it ſurely then is not worth the while to hazard a dangerous commotion in a ſtate to procure their abolition. Nobility, however, upon the ſyſtem of the Engliſh conſtitution, may not only be harmleſs, it may be advantageous to a monarchy. It may be given as the reward of patriotiſm and valour, and may excite to thoſe noble virtues. An hereditary Houſe of Lords alſo, upon the plan of the Engliſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, might tend to benefit the ſtate, by maintaining a proper
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:025356_0030_0FCCDBC8D18A3FE8"/>balance, between the power of the crown, and the rights of the people. In England, if the conſtitution were properly adminiſtered, this hereditary Houſe of Lords could never render any material in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to the intereſts of the people, as they could paſs no act with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the concurrence of the repreſentatives of the people in the Houſe of Commons.

Mr. De Lolme, in his admirable Eſſay on the Conſtitution of England ſays, "In caſe of a public offence, or even a ſimple breach of the peace, a poet may be committed till he finds bail by any juſtice of the peace: and peers are to be tried by the common courſe of the law, for all offences under felony. With regard to civil matters, they are at all times free from arreſts; but execution may be had againſt their effects in the ſame manner as againſt thoſe of other ſubjects." Chap. 18.

I have no objection to any proper abridgement of the privileges of the nobility in England or in France, but I think there ſhould be a nobility as well as a monarch at this time in France. Where there is a monarch there ſhould of courſe be nobles. It ſeems natural to expect ſuch a gradation in a ſtate. It is reaſonable to wiſh it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the opinion of the ableſt politicians, of Monteſquieu eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, who ſays that in a monarchy "The moſt natural, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate, and ſubordinate power is that of the nobility.

               <p>If the conſtituent aſſembly of France had not made a decree for the abolition of nobility, the late revolution in that country would have found many more advocates in Germany and Spain, where the nobles are particularly fond of their high deſcent. It would have been politic to have attended to theſe prejudices, if they are to be called ſuch. An attention to them would have made the principles of the revolution ſpread more eaſily in Germany, Spain, and other countries of Europe, and would have made it more ſecure at home.

In theſe points I agree with the celebrated Mr. Necker, whom I hold in many reſpects to be a good man, and an able politician, I do not know that I can ſay I altogether co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incide with him, but I do conſiderably. If theſe things are not attended to, the new raiſed government may be like the houſe of Job, which, as we read in ſcripture, was ſmitten in its four corners, and levelled by a mighty wind from the wilderneſs. The French may in vain boaſt of the millions which they can bring into the field in ſupport of the revolution, for ſome of thoſe millions may prove like the elephants in ancient battles, which would ſometimes turn upon thoſe who led them on. The accuſtomed prejudices of the French are not eaſily eradicated; and in ſome future time, if they are not well managed, they may curſe the National Aſſembly, and tear the air with the ſound of Vive le Roy.

               <p>I admire alſo the abolition of lettres de cachet, of arbitrary impoſts, of the game-laws, of tithes, of religious houſes, and of the power of that heretic the Pope. In ſhort, I will obſerve, that there are many things which I admire, and many things which I diſapprove in the conduct of the French Revolutioniſts. I am neither led by Mr. Burke nor by Mr. Paine. I would wiſh to make neither of theſe men my Moſes, from whom I am to receive the law, and whoſe ſentiments I am to adopt.—This, however, I think is fairly to be ſaid in favour of the new French Government, that if it has errors, the people who are now free, may alter thoſe er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors at a future and convenient time. They may alter their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, by aſſimilating it to the Engliſh conſtitution, in appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an hereditary Houſe of Lords, and in the reſtoration of the conſtitution of 1789.—It has been ſaid that the queſtion, whether the conſtitution of England, with juſt amendments, would be a proper model of government for France at this time, is no queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at all that it will not admit of a doubt, that all mankind will agree in their opinion about it. In anſwer to which I will obſerve, that the National Aſſembly determined that they would not adopt the Engliſh conſtitution with or without amendments as a model of government for the people of France. The matter, therefore, has been a queſtion with them, it has admitted of a doubt.</p>
               <p>It has been ſaid that the Engliſh have no conſtitution, and that they ſhould call a convention of the people to make one.—There is to be ſure no conſtitution in England written, like the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the States of America. Cuſtom, however, has eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a regular method of political proceeding in England, which is as binding as any written conſtitution whatever. The common law of England is founded in this manner upon cuſtom, and is not written down. It is called the lex non ſcripta, the unwritten law; and the ſtatute law, the lex ſcripta, the written law.—Yet no man will ſay that the unwritten law, founded on cuſtom, is not as prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the written law.—The conſtitution of England, however, does not, like the common law, merely depend upon cuſtom, but is
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:025356_0032_0FCD038F456BD140"/>corroborated by the written law. There are various ſtatutes which explain what the conſtitution is, which deſcribe its limits. There is a Bill of Rights, which I cannot agree with Mr. Paine to be a Bill of Wrongs.—</p>
               <p>If it ſhould be obſerved of the French nobility, that they do not merit, from their own virtue or the virtue of their anceſtors, to be erected into a ſeparate and hereditary branch of the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; I will anſwer, if we conſult the Hiſtory of France, we ſhall find that the nobility of France have ſometimes ſhown themſelves to be true friends to their country and to the intereſts of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, though they have ſometimes acted in an oppoſite charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. In the conteſts between Catholics and the Hugonots the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility have taken different ſides. We find, however, the name of Rochefaucault and ſome other French noble names, frequently on the ſide of virtue and glory. There is an hereditary valour and integrity in ſome of their illuſtrious families. Henry the IV. of France uſed to ſay, "I have greatly prevailed againſt my enemies "by the ſword of my brave and generous nobility."—Many of the French nobility have alſo very powerfully contributed in the preſent day to the freedom of their country. I am an advocate, if an hereditary Houſe of Lords ſhould be erected, that only thoſe peers ſhould be admitted who would abjure the ancient tyranny, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage to ſupport the new ſyſtem of freedom.</p>
               <p>There would have been a fine opportunity of adopting at this time in France the Engliſh conſtitution without its defects. They might have had no biſhops in their Houſe of Peers, no rotten bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs (through which, in England, one man alone will elect two members of parliament, while ten thouſand or more electors, as in Weſtminſter, can ſend but the ſame number to parliament) they might have had in every reſpect a pure repreſentation of the people; they might have had annual parliaments, as was formerly the caſe in England, or at leaſt biennial, with an univerſal toleration to all religious ſects. If the new government had been thus framed, which is conſiderably according to the plan of Mr. Mounier, it is ſaid that many of the emigrant nobility, would have returned with a determination to ſupport the new conſtitution.</p>
               <p>If the Engliſh conſtitution had been in any manner adopted in France, the Engliſh government would have been more inclined to ſupport the revolution. Some, however, ſay that the French revolutioniſts need not fear the reſentment nor court the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of England nor of all Europe. They have numbers ſufficient to baffle all opponents. If we were to grant this, yet I would be an advocate, for the adoption of the Engliſh conſtitution in ſome meaſure in France. It ſeems ſuited to the genius of the country, as they have a monarchy and a nobility. It would tend to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal quiet and proſperity of the kingdom. It would prevent aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring and ambitious men from deluging the land with blood in their attempts to poſſeſs the crown. It would chaſtiſe anarchy, as well as prevent ambition. I will make a quotation from a very able law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer, Sir William Blackſtone. He ſays, when ſpeaking of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh government, "Thus every branch of our civil polity ſupports and is ſupported, regulates and is regulated by the reſt: for the two houſes naturally drawing in two directions of oppoſite intereſt, and the prerogative in another ſtill different from them both they
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:025356_0033_0FCD039303ED0140"/>mutually keep each other from exceeding their proper limits; while the whole is prevented from ſeparation, and artificially connected together by the mixed nature of the crown, which is a part of the legiſlative, and the ſole executive magiſtrate. Like three diſtinct powers in mechanicks, they jointly impel the machine of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in a direction different from what either, acting by itſelf, would have done; but at the ſame time, in a direction partaking of each, and formed out of all; a direction which conſtitutes the true line of the liberty and happineſs of the community." Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone's Commentaries, Vol. 1. page 155.</p>
               <p>Mr. Burke in many parts of his pamphlets ſpeaks with high ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of the Engliſh conſtitution. He will not recommend, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the adoption of it in France, leſt ſuch a conſtitution ſhould be unfavourable to the power of the Roman Catholic clergy in France. Their intereſt ſeems to be very near his heart. He ſays in his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond pamphlet (a letter to a member of the National Aſſembly, in anſwer to ſome objections to his book on French Affairs) "I do not adviſe an Houſe of Lords to you." Soon after he ſays "I, whoſe leading principle it is in a reformation of the ſtate, to make uſe of exiſting materials, am of opinion, that the repreſentation of the clergy, as a ſeparate order, was an inſtitution which touched all the orders more nearly than any of them touched the other; that it was well fitted to connect them, and to hold a place in any wiſe monarchical commonwealth." That monarchy and nobility have a connexion with each other I have often heard, but I do not ſee that a ſtate religious eſtabliſhment has any neceſſary connexion with a monarchy. It has been ſaid that the great number of the French nobility would prevent their being eſtabliſhed into an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary Houſe of Lords, like the nobility of England. This is a circumſtance that might be eaſily remedied. Only thoſe who would engage to ſupport the new government might be admitted to their Houſe of Peers. If there ſhould be too many of theſe, it might be determined by lot, which ſhould firſt ſucceed, and after an extinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome titles by death, the others might in the courſe of time ſucceed. Or an Houſe of Peers might be made of the princes of the blood, and of the higher order of nobility, who had an hereditary right to ſeats in the parliaments of France. Thoſe who would not abjure or affirm (for a choice in theſe points ſhould be allowed, or religious liberty will be incomplete) againſt the ſupremacy of the Pope, ſhould not be admitted. Nor would this be unjuſt. For he who wiſhes to make the Pope ſupreme ruler over his country, wiſhes to give the liberty and independence of his country into the hands of a foreign power, and is conſequently a traitor and an enemy to that country. Mr. Locke ſays "That church can have no right to be tolerated by the magiſtrate, which is conſtituted upon ſuch a bottom, that all thoſe who enter into it, do thereby, ipſo facto, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver themſelves up to the protection and ſervice of another prince. For by this means the magiſtrate would give way to the ſettling of a foreign juriſdiction in his own country, and ſuffer his own people, to be liſted as it were, for ſoldiers againſt his own government. Nor does the frivolous and fallacious diſtinction between the court and the church, afford any remedy to this inconvenience; eſpecially when both the one and the other are equally ſubject to the abſolute authority of the ſame perſon; who has not only power to perſuade
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:025356_0034_0FCD0393C4FC0BF8"/>the members of his church to whatſoever he liſts, either as purely religious, or as in order thereunto, but can alſo enjoin them on pain of eternal ſire." See Locke's Firſt Letter on Toleration, 2d. Vol. quarto, page 374. A ſalutary reſtraint, and no other, ſhould be put upon Roman Catholics, where fears are rationally to be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of their overturning the government. But where no ſuch fears can rationally be entertained, then I think they ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the ſame political privileges with others. Mr. We<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If that be the caſe, or if there ſhould be no more than 160, 000, the penal laws againſt them might prudently be relaxed.</p>
               <p>If an invaſion of France were to be attempted upon the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of a manifeſto which was publiſhed ſome time ago by the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant princes at Coblentz, to reſtore the monarchy to its former uncontrouled deſpotiſm, and the Roman Catholic Church to its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive and tyrannical domination, then I think every Frenchman, in the juſt defence of his liberties, ſhould have the ſame gallant ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit with my heroic relation, the celebrated John Earl of Crawford, (who, however, was ſometimes too fond of war) of whom it is ſaid in a claſſical elegy on his death,<note n="*" place="bottom">This Elegy was written by a German nobleman, and is prefixed to the Life of Earl Crawford written by Rolt.</note>

               <p>I think with Mr. Burke, that the National Aſſembly deſerved no encomium for raiſing a ſtatue to the memory of Rouſſeau. He was in ſeveral reſpects a wild and vicious writer, though for ſome things which he wrote, he deſerved applauſe. He was enthuſiaſtic, eloquent, and generally perhaps diſintereſted.—His Eloiſa is a moſt pernicious book. It would be difficult to find a more wicked and pernicious book, except it be the Sorrows of Werter.<note n="†" place="bottom">There are ſome good obſervations upon the Sorrows of Werter, a book in which the worſt crimes are applauded or extenuated, and of which there ſeemed to be a frantic admiration, in the Rev.

His talents certainly were ſplendid. They have been over-rated and over-praiſed however; and talents, if improperly exerted, ſhould not be admired. He would have done ſervice to mankind by ridicul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuperſtition, if he had not attacked religion.</p>
               <p>The French have made a violent and abrupt overthrow of their government, which has induced ſeveral to wiſh the ſame method of proceeding in England. The beſt way of reforming the Engliſh government, is not by the dangerous method of a convention, entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to model the government anew, but by gradual reformations, while adhering to the great outlines of the conſtitution. It would be wiſe, however, to make neceſſary alterations in the government as ſoon as poſſible, to prevent the danger of commotions. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of the hereditary ſucceſſion might deluge the land with blood, and afterwards leave matters in a worſe ſtate. If the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent King, or any of his children after him, ſhould be removed from the throne, after a civil conteſt, the ſucceſsful general on the ſide of the people will probably become a favourite of the people and be raiſed to power. For the cry will be among them, we cannot do without a head: and it will be lucky if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a limited, they do not vex their country with a deſpotic monarch. De Lolme in his admirable eſſay on the Engliſh conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, ſpeaks ſenſibly of things in ſuch a ſituation. "The power thus given away is already grown very great, before thoſe by whom it was given ſo much as ſuſpect it; and he himſelf who enjoys that power, does not know its full extent; but then, on the firſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity that offers, he ſuddenly pierces through the clond which hid the ſummit from him, and at once ſeats himſelf upon it. The people on the other hand, no ſooner recover fight of him, than they ſee their favourite become their maſter, and diſcover the evil only to find that it is paſt remedy." Book II. Chap. II.</p>
               <p>The people of England have known one Cromwell, and they will be very cautious how they ſuffer another to riſe.

He became at laſt, however, a tyrant, and his reflexion upon magna carta, was as arrogant and abſurd, as it was indecent. There is ſomewhat in his character for the kings of England to imitate while they deteſt. He made the Engliſh name formidable at the courts of tyrants. The inquiſition at Liſbon had ſeized and confined his miniſter. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands redreſs from the court of Portugal. The anſwer returned is that the inquiſition ſeized the man, and the king has nothing to do with the inquiſition.

All the civil wars in France aroſe from the hereditary ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, or by the imperfection of the hereditary form, which admits of regencies, or monarchy at nurſe. With reſpect to England, its Hiſtory is full of the ſame misfortunes. The conteſts for ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion between the houſes of York and Lancaſter laſted a whole cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury; and others of a ſimilar nature have renewed themſelves ſince that period. Thoſe of 1715 and 1745 were of the ſame kind." If we attend to the Hiſtory of Rome under the emperors, we ſhall find that the Roman empire was frequently deluged with blood on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the conteſted elections to the empire. The greateſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs attended the elections of the popes, the deys of Algiers, and of all the elective princes in the world.

If we read Davila's Hiſtory of the Civil Wars in France, we ſhall find that "the hereditary ſyſtem, or the imperfection of the hereditary form," have had nothing to do with them. The civil war which aroſe for the ſucceſſion in the houſes of York and Lancaſter was to be ſure bloody and long.

The ſucceſſion is now indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable, upon the true principles of the Engliſh Conſtitution, in the illuſtrious houſe of Brunſwick. To make it diſputable, would hazard ſuch another bloody contention as that between the houſes of York and Lancaſter. The wars which aroſe in 1715 and 1745, were not merely about the hereditary ſucceſſion to the throne. The diſpute in thoſe years was conſiderably upon the point whether po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery or proteſtantiſm ſhould be eſtabliſhed in Great Britain. The houſe of Brunſwick were not elevated to the throne of Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain for being Germans or foreigners; but for being the next in ſucceſſion in the proteſtant line. Has Mr. Paine never read, or is he willing to forget, that the preſent king of Great Britain, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from the daughter of James the Firſt of England?—Mr. Paine ſays, "Poland, though an elective monarchy, has had fewer wars than thoſe which are hereditary." This ſeems not to be the truth. On the contrary, the unhappineſs of Poland from her elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive monarchy, has become proverbial. The poet ſays:

               <p>The Magna Carta of England ſecures ſome of the rights of the pooreſt ſubjects, as well as of the firſt nobility, by whom it was principally gained. Did not ſome of the old Saxon nobility that were ſettled in England (to whom the nobility that came in with William the Conqueror appear with much inferior luſtre) oppoſe the uſurpations of the Norman baſtard, with conſpicuous valour, and heroic perſeverance?

They were driven from England to take ſhelter in Scotland, with the loſs of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe poſſeſſions, for their invincible love of freedom. Did not many of the nobility of England and Scotland procure the expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of James the Second, and eſtabliſh the revolution under William the Third? did they not drive the pretender and his popiſh adherents from England in 1745?—Are not ſome of them now conſpicuous as manly and enlightened advocates for the general intereſts of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind? Some, however, I will allow to be remarkable for their vices. The expreſſion of Mr. Burke relative to nobility, that it is "the Corinthian pillar of poliſhed ſociety" is not in my idea liable to juſt ridicule. It is an elegant expreſſion which contains ſome truth.</p>
               <p>The Engliſh conſtitution with three different branches of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeems ſuited to the genius of the Engliſh and French nation. I am not ſuch a bigot to it, however, as to ſuppoſe that no form of government can be good which does not reſemble it. A republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can form of government is beſt ſuited to the genius of the Americans. It would be unwiſe to attempt the introduction of a nobility into the United States. It might be productive of the worſt conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. They have never had a nobility, and therefore no injury ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures to the deſcendants of nobility, in eſtabliſhing a government without them. The republican form may be beſt ſuited to the Cantons of Switzerland, and other countries. In ſhort, where a monarchical or a republican form of government has been ſome time eſtabliſhed, it appears wrong to introduce a change, from a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy to a republic, or from a republic to a monarchy.</p>
               <p>It would not be unwiſe, perhaps, in the Engliſh government to form a houſe of peers, mingled with the Scotch and Iriſh nobility, and a houſe of commons freely and equally elected from the three kingdoms. If this ſyſtem of conſolidation ſhould be inconvenient to Ireland on account of its ſeparation by ſea (which inconvenience has been thought too much of by many) it might happily be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in regard to Scotland. The treatment of Scotland is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly what cannot be defended. Why, in the name of common juſtice, and of common ſenſe, is not Scotland, proportionably as well repreſented as England? Scotland ſends to parliament 45 mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and England above 500. Is England ſo much ſuperior, that ſhe merits more than ten times as numerous a repreſentation? The peers of Scotland have not loſt their right to be hereditary coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors of the kingdom. Scotland made a treaty with England as an
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:025356_0039_0FCD03A196190350"/>independent nation. It was never conquered. It could not, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, from the daring temper of its inhabitants be ever conquered. The poet beautifully, and with ſome truth, calls it

               <p>If all the Scotch peers, inſtead of ſixteen, were to ſit in the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh houſe of peers, there would be a greater chance, though ſome of them may now act upon independent principles, of their being generally leſs influenced by the miniſter. In 1707, when the 22d article of the treaty of union came to be debated in relation to the number of repreſentatives to be ſent from Scotland to the parliament <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

If all the Scotch peers were to be allowed a ſeat in the Britiſh Houſe of Peers, and the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives from Scotland to the Houſe of Commons more numerous "it would infuſe" (according to an admired expreſſion of the late Lord Chatham) "a new portion of vigour into the conſtitution." It is ſaid that in the multitude of counſellors is ſafety. In the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of repreſentatives there is not only a greater chance of talents but of public virtue. It is obvious to common ſenſe that it is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier to corrupt a few than a great many. In ſhort, the union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween England and Scotland ſhould be upon a juſt and liberal plan of conſolidation, without any partial, but with fair advantages to both parties. It is this which ſhould beſt ſecure, what every good man muſt wiſh, the uninterrupted union and concord between the two nations, which tends to their mutual glory. It was well ſaid of England and Scotland by the celebrated Lord Lyttleton, "whom God hath joined together let no man put aſunder."</p>

Thoſe who wiſh for the independence of Ireland upon England, that the cauſe of liberty may be advanced, are miſtaken. If Ireland were at preſent inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of England, the cauſe of liberty would be materially inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Some ſay there are eight or nine Roman catholics to one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant in Ireland. The prevailing opinion is that the Roman ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholics to the proteſtants are as three to one. If therefore Ireland were made independent of England, the Roman catholics would have the aſcendancy, the proteſtants would be obliged to fly the country, or another maſſacre might be made of them ſuch as hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in the time of Charles the Firſt. Some proteſtants have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that the ſpirit of the Roman catholics is at preſent ſo mild as not to give much occaſion for dread. If they were but for a ſhort time under the mild dominion of ſome of the Roman catholics in Ireland, they would find ſuch corporal exerciſe as they would with reluctance try again. They have ſometimes put the proteſtants upon horſes with ſaddles full of pricks. It is a notorious fact that in Ireland not long ago a proteſtant ſchool-maſter was ſeized by the Roman catholics, who cut out his tongue, and cut off both his hands. Government very properly allowed him, though diſabled from attending to the ſchool, the ſalary which he formerly enjoyed. In a Dublin paper of October 11th, 1791, it is ſaid, "By a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from Armagh dated on Wedneſday laſt, we are informed that as yet there is no proſpect of the unhappy animoſities which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail in that quarter being terminated, notwithſtanding the various proſecutions that have taken place at the late aſſizes. Religious intolerance prevails there with as unrelenting a zeal as ever diſgraced this country at the commencement of the preſent century. Why ſhould they act in a manner diſgraceful enough to juſtify the reproach, that bigotry had fled from France to take refuge in Ireland?" There are a ſet of Roman catholics in Ireland called de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, who ſay that the whole country belongs to the pope, and who will not ſuffer, wherever they can exert their blind and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable fury, a proteſtant to live unmoleſted. There are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of veracity now living in Ireland who remember when a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant was roaſted alive by the Roman catholics. I wiſh to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, however, when ſpeaking of Ireland, that I am no advocate for its being oppreſſed, but for its being connected with England upon terms advantageous to both countries.</p>
               <p>Mr. Paine ſays, that it is wrong to give the king of Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a million a year for his civil liſt. The ſalaries of embaſſadors, of the judges, and various other public expences, are paid out of this. Though it is not reaſonable to expel kings from their thrones, without ſufficient cauſe, yet they ſhould be reſtrained from tyranny, and in ſome meaſure from extravagance. A proper ſum of money ſhould be allowed to them for the decent ſupport of their dignity; but it is ſhameful in ſovereigns wantonly to conſume the goods of the earth in capricious exceſſes, as Mary Queen of Scots, (whom the celebrated reformer, John Knox, called a whore and a papiſt,) who uſed to have a bath of white wine.

               <p>Mr. Burke, though he is no advocate for the principles of the Engliſh conſtitution, being adopted in France, has ſome merit for the praiſes which be beſtows upon it.

Think of a man, like the univerſal patriarch in Milton (who had drawn up before him in his prophetic viſion the whole ſeries of the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which were to iſſue from his loins,) a man capable of placing in review, after having brought together, from the eaſt, the weſt, the north, and the ſouth, from the coarſeneſs of the rudeſt bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bariſm to the moſt refined and ſubtle civilization, all the ſchemes of government which had prevailed amongſt mankind, weighing, meaſuring, collating, and comparing them all, joining fact with theory, and calling into council, upon all this infinite aſſemblage of things, all the ſpeculations which have fatigued the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings of profound reaſon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

Let us then conſider, that all theſe were but ſo many preparatory ſteps to qualify a man, and ſuch a man, tinctured with no national prejudice, with no domeſtic affection, to admire, and to hold out to the admiration of mankind, the Conſtitution of England!" Monteſquieu calls the Engliſh Conſtitution "a beautiful ſyſtem." He ſays alſo, "It was a curious ſpectacle, to behold the vain efforts of the Engliſh to eſtabliſh a Democracy." A curious ſpectacle it was indeed, (ſuch as the French are now going to exhibit,) and I hope they

And Dr. Price, ſays, that one of the bleſſings of England is "that being in poſſeſſion of the forms of an excellent conſtitution of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, any changes or improvements neceſſary to correct abuſes and to give perfect liberty, may be grafted upon them without tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult or danger; whereas, other countries, wanting theſe forms, and being under the neceſſity of erecting a new conſtitution on the ruins of an old one, cannot acquire liberty without ſetting every thing afloat, and making their eſcape from ſlavery through the dangers of anarchy." It has been doubted by ſome, whether the wit of man could frame a better government for England than the Engliſh conſtitution. It is certain, however, that the wit of man could contrive a hundred things worſe.</p>
               <p>To return again to the affairs of France, I muſt obſerve the proceedings there have been ſo violent, that they portend ſome new revolution to be at hand. The execution of the king was unjuſt, and highly impolitic. It was expreſsly declared by the conſtitution of 1791 (the only one that, I have conſidered, in this pamphlet, as I think it the only form of government yet pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed to the world, which would probably give laſting happineſs to the people of France,) that "the perſon of the king is ſacred and inviolable." See Chap. 2. Sect. 1. It was alſo declared in the ſame ſection, "if the king put himſelf at the head of an army, and direct the forces of it againſt the nation, or if he do not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe by a formal act, any ſuch enterprize, undertaken in his name, he ſhall be held to have abdicated." If, therefore, the king had done what was laid to his charge by the convention, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Louis the Sixteeth of France was ſimilar in his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter to James the Second of England. He was led, by Roman catholic prieſts, like James. He ſhould in the ſame manner have been depoſed, but not murdered, and the French crown, in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of what was done in England, ſhould have been ſettled on the next heir who was leſs attached to the court of Rome. The repreſentatives of the people of France were not free, at the time of the king's death. They were controuled by the Jacobin So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and the vote for his execution was probably forced at the
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:025356_0043_0FCD03ABC6C82138"/>point of the bayonet. There is not liberty in that country, where the repreſencatives of the people are controuled by any but the people themſelves. The Jacobin Society had all the bad points of tyranny in them; they were ſecret, cruel, permanent, and not reſponſible. Mr. Necker, before the king's death, publiſhed a ſmall pamphlet, the circulation of which was prevented in France, in which he declared there was a ſolemn agreement between the convention and the king, to which he was a witneſs, that in caſe of the king's acting contrary to the conſtitution, his perſon could not be endangered. Mr. Necker declares that the king would not have accepted the ſovereignty under the conſtitution, if this had not been clearly ſtipulated.</p>
               <p>Many of the French are inimical to Mr. Necker, from ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that he wiſhed to introduce a government in France, ſimilar to the government in Geneva.

is a deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded advocate, (as may be made to appear, by various quotations from his writings,) for a monarchical government in France. He repeatedly obſerves that a republic can never be happily eſtabliſhed there. He ſays in his "Eſſay on the True Principles of Executive Power in Great States," with much reaſon and truth. "The National Aſſembly of France, who were deſirous, at whatever price, to obtain glory, and who now find themſelves diſappointed, had a path open before them, by which they might infallibly have arrived at the firſt object of their wiſhes. How ſplendid a part would have been aſſigned to them in the drama of nations, if when occupied in framing a code of laws for a great people, they had concentrated their ſcattered ideas, and had ranged themſelves, ſo to ſpeak, round the moſt diſtinguiſhed political conſtitution of Europe, with the noble deſign of taking it for their model, and copying ſuch parts of it as were applicable to France, and of which experience had evinced the utility! The Engliſh, for it will be preſumed that it is of their government I ſpeak, would them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have been eager to point out the corrections of which their political ſyſtem ſtood in need, and every nation of the earth, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive to the ſcrutiny which would have preceded the moſt auguſt of adoptions, would have felt a conſciouſneſs that their intereſts were diſcuſſed by anticipation, ſince a ſimilar political liberty once eſtabliſhed among two rival nations, and theſe the firſt nations in Europe, this double example of liberty, without diſorder, would have acquired ſuch an authority, that, forcibly conveying with it the tide of opinions, it would have formed the deſtiny of the world."

This could be effected, an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged democrat might ſay, by making the government of England ſimilar to the republic eſtabliſhed in France. For the obtaining which end, he would, perhaps, recommend the murder of all the royal family, and of all the nobility. Without the perpetration of this diabolical wickedneſs, (which would bring the vengeance of Heaven and of man upon all concerned in it) the erection of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracy would be as abſurd in England as in France. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in both countries have been accuſtomed to a king and nobility, and would never reſt ſatisfied with their abolition. There would never be peace in either country from the attempts which would be made to reſtore their power, and therefore it ſeems the part of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to correct but not to extirp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Late political writers, however, of the firſt reputation, think with Cicero, that a conſtitution ſimilar to that of England would be beſt for all the nations in the world. Machiavel ſays of monarchy, ariſtocracy, and democracy, "the wiſeſt legiſlators therefore, being aware of theſe defects, never eſtabliſhed any one of them in particular, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived another that partakes of them all, conſiſting of a prince, lords, and commons, which they looked upon as more firm and ſtable, becauſe every one of theſe members would be a check upon the other: and of thoſe legiſlators, Lycurgus certainly merits the higheſt praiſe, who conſtituted an eſtabliſhment of this kind at Sparta, which laſted above eight hundred years, to his own great honour as well as the tranquillity of the citizens. Very different was the fate of the government eſtabliſhed by Solon at Athens, which being a ſimple democracy only, was of ſo ſhort a continuance, that it gave way to the tyranny of Piſiſtratus, before the death of the legiſlator: and though indeed the heirs of that tyrant were expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about forty years after, and the Athenians not only recovered their liberty, but re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

See Sidney's Diſcourſes on Government, Vol. 2. page 233. Afterwards he ſays, in the ſame page, "As for democracy, I believe it can ſuit only with the convenience of a ſmall town, accompanied with ſuch circumſtances as are ſeldom found." I do not know that I can thoroughly accede to the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of Machiavel and Sidney, but will repeat, what I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore obſerved, that it is in my opinion impolitic, where a monarchy or a republic has been eſtabliſhed, to change from one to the other.

               <p>He was one of the moſt amiable of mankind. He was deſcended of a very illuſtrious family in France, who were famous for their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to civil and religious liberty. He was a philoſopher of no common ingenuity; humble, humane, juſt, and diſintereſted; a friend to ſcience, liberty, and mankind. He was one of the firſt to ſtart up in oppoſition to that horrible ſyſtem of deſpotiſm with which his country was oppreſſed; and laboured indefatigably in the formation of that excellent conſtitution which was begun in 1789, and accepted by the king in 1791. This is a conſtitution from which all the nations of the world may draw ſalutary princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of government; though, it muſt be confeſſ, it would have been more complete with a well-regulated Houſe of Lords.

The being impaled alive was not the only cruelty and indelicacy which ſhe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered. William the Third carried on his deſigns againſt James the Second of England; he overturned a formidable tyranny and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed liberty, without aſſaſſination. There was no occaſion for it in France.</p>
               <p>The French have been very injudicious in attacking the various nations of Europe. We were told by ſome, that the wars which had deſolated the earth had ariſen from the ambition of kings; yet no ſooner do we ſee a republic attempted in France, than the nation aims at inceſſant contention and bloodſhed, with or without reaſon, than it becomes like Iſhmael "a wild man, whoſe hand was againſt every man, and every man's hand againſt him." The French ſhould have remained quiet, for ſome time at leaſt, and have eſtabliſhed a good conſtitution of government. In this ſituation they would have done more by the pen in recommending the rational principles of liberty to the nations of Europe than by the ſword. Inſtead of this, they have attempted (as Mr. Necker ſays) to inſtruct the world, "with the trumpet of diſcord, and from the towers of Babel."</p>
               <p>Whatever may be the political upſhot of the conteſt in France, the Roman catholic religion will never be again eſtabliſhed there, or not eſtabliſhed long, according to its former tyrannical ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority. The prophecies, agreeably to the interpretation of various proteſtant commentators of repute, ſignify that the time for the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter abolition of the Papal power is near at hand. This appears highly probable to an intelligent mind from the preſent ſituation of things in the world. To the ſacred prophecies, it becomes us, our Saviour ſays, to ſubmit. It is alſo well obſerved by a wiſe man in modern times, "the authority of emperors, kings, and princes, is human. The authority of counſels, ſynods, biſhops, and preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians, is human. The authority of the prophets is divine, and comprehends the ſum of religion, reckoning Moſes and the apoſtles among the prophets; and <hi>if an angel from Heaven preach any other goſpel,</hi> than what they have delivered, <hi>let him be accurſed.</hi> Their writings contain the covenant between God and his people, with inſtructions for keeping this covenant; inſtances of God's judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon them that break it; and predictions of things to come. While the people of God keep this covenant, they continue to be his people: when they break it, they ceaſe to be his people or church, and become <hi>the ſynagogue of ſatan, who ſay they are Jews, and are not.</hi> And no power on earth is authorized to alter this covenant."
