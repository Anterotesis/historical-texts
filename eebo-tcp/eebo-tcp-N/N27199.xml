            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>A REQUEST was made to me ſome years ago by my pupils, to publiſh the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing lectures. I declined complying with it, becauſe I did not think them fit for the public eye; but a more importunate applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the gentlemen who attended them laſt year, has prevailed upon me to commit them to the preſs in their preſent imperfect ſtate. The reader will ſoon perceive, that I diſclaim being the author of the great and original con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception upon which they are founded. I have done but little more than carry the hod, to aſſiſt in completing part of a fabric, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of which were laid by two of the moſt diſtinguiſhed maſter builders in medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine of the eighteenth century.</p>

               <pb n="vi" facs="unknown:036255_0004_100865D6A12CAD00"/>
I have endeavoured to render the facts and principles contained in theſe lectures, intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible to gentlemen of all profeſſions as well as to phyſicians. This attempt to diffuſe medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal knowledge more generally, has been made neceſſary, by the controverſies about ſyſtems of medicine, and remedies, which now di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the phyſicians of every part of the world. They can never be ſettled, but by men who do not trade in phyſic, and who will not be actuated in deciding upon medical queſtions, by an improper competition for intereſt, or fame.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>MY buſineſs in this chair is to teach the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of medicine. They have been divided into Phyſiology, Pathology, and Therapeutics. The objects of the firſt are, the laws of the human bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in its healthy ſtate. The ſecond includes the hiſtory of the cauſes, and ſeats of diſeaſes. The ſubjects of the third, are the remedies for thoſe diſeaſes. In entering upon the firſt part of our courſe, I am met by a remark delivered by Dr. Hunter in his introductory lectures to his courſe of anatomy. "In our branch (ſays the Doctor) thoſe teachers who ſtudy to captivate young minds with ingenious ſpeculations, will not leave a repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:036255_0008_100865E1C98A3708"/>
behind them that will outlive them, half a century. When they ceaſe from their labours, their labours will be buried along with them. There never was a man more followed, and admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in phyſiology, than Dr. Boerhaave. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the veneration in which he was held. And now, in the ſpace of forty years,—his phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ology is—it ſhocks me to think, in what a light it appears."<note n="*" place="bottom">Lect. xi. p. 98.</note> Painful as this premonition may be to the teachers of phyſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, it ſhould not deter them from ſpeculating upon phyſiological ſubjects. Simple anatomy is a maſs of dead matter. It is phyſiology which infuſes life into it. A knowledge of the ſtructure of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man body, occupies only the memory. Phyſiology introduces it to the higher, and more noble faculties of the mind. The component parts of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, may be compared to the materials of a houſe, lying without order in a yard. It is phyſiology, like a ſkilful architect, which connects them together, ſo as to form from them an elegant, and uſeful build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The writers againſt phyſiology, reſemble in one particular, the writers againſt luxury. They for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get that the functions they know, and deſcribe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the ſcience of phyſiology; juſt as the declaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers againſt luxury, forget that all the conveniences
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:036255_0009_100865E42E598E08"/>
which they enjoy beyond what are poſſeſſed in the moſt ſimple ſtage of ſociety, belong to the luxuries of life. The anatomiſt who deſcribes the circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the blood, acts the part of a phyſiologiſt, as much as he does, who attempts to explain the functions of the brain. In this reſpect Dr. Hunter did honor to our ſcience; for few men ever explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that ſubject, and many others equally phyſiolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical, with more perſpicuity and eloquence, than that illuſtrious anatomiſt. Upon all new and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult ſubjects, there muſt be pioneers. It has been my lot to be called to this office of hazard, and drudgery; and if in diſcharging its duties, I ſhould meet the fate of my predeceſſors, in this branch of medicine, I ſhall not periſh in vain. My errors, like the bodies of thoſe who fall in forcing a breach, will ſerve to compoſe a bridge for thoſe who ſhall come after me, in our preſent difficult enterpriſe. This conſideration, aided by juſt views of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and extent of moral obligation, will overba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance the evils anticipated by Dr. Hunter, from the loſs of poſthumous fame. Had a prophetic voice whiſpered in the ear of Dr. Boerhaave in the evening of his life, that in the ſhort period of forty years, the memory of his phyſiological works would periſh from the earth; I am ſatisfied, from the knowledge we have of his elevated genius and
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:036255_0010_100865E67ABB1090"/>
piety, he would have treated the prediction with the ſame indifference, that he would have done, had he been told, that in the ſame time, his name ſhould be eraſed from a pane of glaſs, in a noiſy and vulgar country tavern.</p>
               <p>The ſubjects of the lectures I am about to deliver, you will find in a ſyllabus which I have prepared, and publiſhed, for the purpoſe of giving you a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinct view of the extent, and connection of our courſe. Some of theſe ſubjects will be new in lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures upon the inſtitutes of medicine, particularly thoſe which relate to morals, metaphyſicks, and theology. However thorny theſe queſtions may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, we muſt approach and handle them; for they are intimately connected with the hiſtory of the faculties, and operations of the human mind; and theſe form an eſſential part of the animal oeconomy. Perhaps it is becauſe phyſicians have hitherto been reſtrained from inveſtigating, and deciding upon theſe ſubjects, by an erroneous belief that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long excluſively to another profeſſion; that phyſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy has ſo long been an obſcure, and conjectural ſcience.</p>
               <p>In beholding the human body, the firſt thing that ſtrikes us, is its LIFE. This, of courſe ſhould
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:036255_0011_100865E8021B5A38"/>
be the firſt object of our inquiries. It is a moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant ſubject; for the end of all the ſtudies of a phyſician is to preſerve life; and this cannot be perfectly done, until we know in what it conſiſts.</p>
               <p>I include in animal life as applied to the human body, <hi>motion</hi>—<hi>ſenſation</hi>—and <hi>thought.</hi> Theſe three, when united, compoſe perfect life. It may exiſt without thought, or ſenſation; but neither ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor thought, can exiſt without motion. The loweſt grade of life, probably exiſts in the abſence of even motion, as I ſhall mention hereafter. I have preferred the term <hi>motion</hi> to thoſe of oſcil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, or vibration which have been employed by Dr. Hartley in explaining the laws of animal matter; becauſe I conceived it to be more ſimple, and better adapted to common apprehenſion.</p>
               <p>In treating upon this ſubject, I ſhall firſt conſider animal life as it appears in the waking, and ſleeping ſtates in a healthy adult, and ſhall afterwards in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the modification of its cauſes, in the foetal, infant, youthful, and middle ſtates of life, in certain diſeaſes, in different ſtates of ſociety, in different climates, and in different animals.</p>
               <p>I ſhall begin, by delivering three general propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="unknown:036255_0012_100865EA6BD20098"/>
I. Every part of the human body (the nails and hair excepted) is endowed with ſenſibility, or exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability, or with both of them. By ſenſibility is meant the power of having ſenſation excited by the action of impreſſions. Excitability denotes that property in the human body, by which motion is excited by means of impreſſions. This property has been called by ſeveral other names, ſuch as, irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability, contractility, mobility, and ſtimulability. I ſhall make uſe of the term excitability, for the moſt part, in preference to either of them. I mean by it, a capacity of imperceptible, as well as obvious motion.—It is of no conſequence to our preſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries, whether, this excitability be a quality of animal matter, or a ſubſtance. The latter opinion has been maintained by Dr. Girtanner, and has ſome probability in its favor.</p>
               <p>II. The whole human body is ſo formed, and connected, that impreſſions made in the healthy ſtate upon one part, excite motion, or ſenſation, or both, in every other part of the body. From this view, it appears to be an unit, or a ſimple and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſible quality, or ſubſtance. Its capacity for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving motion, and ſenſation, is variouſly modified by means of what are called, the ſenſes. It is exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:036255_0013_100865ED8AD46A48"/>
and internal. The impreſſions which act upon it, ſhall be enumerated in order.</p>
               <p>III. Life is the EFFECT of certain ſtimuli acting upon the ſenſibility, and excitability which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in different degrees, over every external, and internal part of the body. Theſe ſtimuli are as neceſſary to its exiſtence, as air is to flame. Animal life is truly (to uſe the words of Dr. Brown) "a forced ſtate." I have ſaid, the <hi>words</hi> of Dr. Brown; for the opinion was delivered by Dr. Cullen in the Univerſity of Edinburgh in the year 1766, and was detailed by me in this ſchool, many years before the name of Dr. Brown was known as a teacher of medicine. It is true, Dr. Cullen afterwards deſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it; but it is equally true, I never did; and the belief of it, has been the foundation of many of the principles, and modes of practice in medicine which I have ſince adopted. In a lecture which I deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the year 1771, I find the following words, which are taken from a manuſcript copy of lectures given by Dr. Cullen upon the inſtitutes of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine. "The human body is not an automaton, or ſelf-moving machine; but is kept alive, and in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the conſtant action of ſtimuli upon it." In thus aſcribing the diſcovery of the cauſe of life which I ſhall endeavour to eſtabliſh, to Dr. Cullen; let it not be ſuppoſed, I mean to detract from the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:036255_0014_100865EF0F384938"/>
genius, and merit of Dr. Brown. To his intrepidity in reviving, and propagating it, as well as for the many other truths contained in his ſyſtem of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine poſterity, I have no doubt, will do him ample juſtice, after the errors that are blended with them, have been corrected, by their unſucceſsful applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the cure of diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>Agreeably to our laſt propoſition, I proceed to remark, that the action of the brain, the diaſtole, and ſyſtole of the heart, the pulſation of the arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, the contraction of the muſcles, the periſtaltic motion of the bowels, the abſorbing power of the lymphatics, ſecretion, excretion, hearing, ſeeing, ſmelling, taſte, and the ſenſe of touch, nay more, thought itſelf, are all the effects of ſtimuli acting upon the organs of ſenſe and motion. Theſe ſtimuli have been divided into external, and internal. The external are light, ſound, odors, air, heat, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, and the pleaſures of the ſenſes. The inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſtimuli are food, drinks, chyle, the blood, a certain tenſion of the glands, which contain ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed liquors, and the exerciſes of the faculties of the mind; each of which I ſhall treat in the order, in which they have been mentioned</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of external ſtimuli. The firſt of theſe is light. It is remarkable that the progenitor of the human
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:036255_0015_100865F19FF06FF8"/>
race was not brought into exiſtence until all the lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries of heaven were created. The firſt impulſe of life, was probably imparted to his body by means of light. It acts chiefly through the medium of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of viſion. Its influence upon animal life is fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, compared with ſome other ſtimuli to be mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hereafter; but it has its proportion of force.—Sleep has been ſaid to be a tendency to death; now the abſence of light we know invites to ſleep, and the return of it excites the waking ſtate. The late Mr. Rittenhouſe informed me, that for many years he had conſtantly awoke with the firſt dawn of the morning light, both in ſummer and winter. Its influence upon the animal ſpirits ſtrongly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates its connection with animal life, and hence we find a cheerful and a depreſſed ſtate of mind in many people, and more eſpecially in invalids, to be intimately connected with the preſence or abſence of the rays of the ſun. The well known pedeſtrian traveller Mr. Stewart in one of his viſits to this city informed me, that he had ſpent a ſummer in Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land in the latitude of 69° during the greateſt part of which time the ſun was ſeldom out of fight. He enjoyed he ſaid during this period, uncommon health and ſpirits, both of which he aſcribed to the long duration, and invigorating influence of light. Theſe facts will ſurpriſe us leſs when we attend to the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:036255_0016_100865F4265C1D38"/>
of light upon vegetables. Some of them loſe their colour by being deprived of it; many of them diſcover a partiality to it in the direction of their flowers; and all of them diſcharge their pure air only while they are expoſed to it.<note n="*" place="bottom">"Organization, ſenſation, ſpontaneous motion and life, exiſt only at the ſurface of the earth, and in places expoſed to <hi>light.</hi> We might affirm the flame of Prometheus's torch was the expreſſion of a philoſophical truth that did not eſcape the ancients. Without light, nature was lifeleſs, inanimate and dead. A benevolent God by producing life has ſpread or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganization, ſenſation and thought over the ſurface of the earth." Lavoiſſier.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Sound has an extenſive influence upon human life. Its numerous artificial and natural ſources need not be mentioned. I ſhall only take notice, that the currents of winds, the paſſage of inſects through the air, and even the growth of vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, are all attended with an emiſſion of ſound; and although they become imperceptible from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit; yet there is reaſon to believe they all act upon the body, through the medium of the ears. The exiſtence of theſe ſounds, is eſtabliſhed by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of perſons who have aſcended two or three miles from the earth in a Balloon. They tell us that the ſilence which prevails in thoſe regions of
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:036255_0017_100865F74AD479E8"/>
the air is ſo new and complete, as to produce an awful ſolemnity in their minds. It is not neceſſary that theſe ſounds ſhould excite ſenſation, or percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in order to their exerting a degree of ſtimulus upon the body. There are a hundred impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons daily made upon it, which from habit, are not followed by ſenſation. The ſtimulus of ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the ſtomach, and of blood upon the heart and arteries, probably ceaſe to be felt, only from the influence of habit. The exerciſe of walking, which was originally the reſult of a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate act of the will, is performed from habit without the leaſt degree of conſciouſneſs. It is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate for this, and many other parts of phyſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, that we forget what paſſed in our minds the firſt two or three years of our lives. Could we recollect the manner in which we acquired our firſt ideas, and the progreſs of our knowledge with the evolution of our ſenſes, and faculties; it would relieve us from many difficulties, and controverſies upon this ſubject. Perhaps this forgetfulneſs by children, of the origin and progreſs of their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, might be remedied by our attending more cloſely to the firſt effects of impreſſions, ſenſation, and perception upon them as diſcovered by their little actions; all of which probably have a mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as determined as any of the actions of men or women.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="unknown:036255_0018_100865F99AC5A728"/>
The influence of ſounds of a certain kind in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing excitement, and thereby increaſing life, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied. Fear produces debility which is a tendency to death.—Sound obviates this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and thus reſtores the ſyſtem to the natural, and healthy grade of life. The ſchool boy and the clown, invigorate their feeble and trembling limbs, by whiſtling or ſinging as they paſs by a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try church yard, and the ſoldier feels his departing life recalled in the onſet of a battle by the noiſe of the fife, and of the poet's "ſpirit ſtirring drum." Intoxication is frequently attended with a higher degree of life than is natural. Now ſound we know will produce this with a very moderate portion of fermented liquor; hence we find men are more eaſily and highly excited by it at public entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments where there is muſic, loud talking, and hallooing, than in private companies where there is no auxiliary ſtimulus added to that of the wine. I wiſh theſe effects of ſound upon animal life to be remembered; for I ſhall mention it hereafter as a remedy for the weak ſtate of life in many diſeaſes, and ſhall relate an inſtance in which a ſcream ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly extorted by grief, proved the means of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſcitating a perſon, who was ſuppoſed to be dead, and who had exhibited the uſual recent marks of the extinction of life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="unknown:036255_0019_100865FB1EF8C5A0"/>
I ſhall conclude this head by remarking that perſons, who are deſtitute of hearing and ſeeing, poſſeſs life in a more languid ſtate than other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and hence ariſe the dulneſs, and want of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits which they diſcover in their intercourſe with the world.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Odors have a ſenſible effect in promoting animal life. The greater healthineſs of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, than cities, is derived in part from the efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via of odoriferous plants which float in the atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere in the ſpring and ſummer months, acting upon the ſyſtem, through the medium of the ſenſe of ſmelling. The effects of odors, upon animal life, appear ſtill more obvious in the ſudden revival of it, which they produce in caſes of fainting. Here the ſmell of a few drops of hartſhorn, or even of a burnt feather, has frequently in a few minutes reſtored the ſyſtem, from a ſtate of weakneſs bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering upon death, to an equable and regular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of excitement.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Air acts as a powerful ſtimulus upon the ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem through the medium of the lungs. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent parts of this fluid, and its decompoſition in the lungs, will be conſidered in another place. I ſhall only remark here, that the circulation of the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:036255_0020_100865FD66438458"/>
blood has been aſcribed by Dr. Goodwin excluſively to the action of air upon the lungs and heart. Does the external air act upon any other part of the body beſides thoſe which have been mentioned? It is probable it does, and that we loſe our ſenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and conſciouſneſs of it, by habit. It is certain children cry, for the moſt part, as ſoon as they come into the world. May not this be the effect of the ſudden impreſſion of air upon the tender ſurface of their bodies? And may not the red color of their ſkins, be occaſioned by an irritation excited on them by the ſtimulus of the air? It is certain it acts powerfully upon dinudated animal fibres; for who has not obſerved a ſore, and even the ſkin when deprived of its cuticle, to be affected, when long expoſed to the air, with pain, and inflammation?—The ſtimulus of air, in promoting the natural ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the alimentary canal, cannot be doubted. A certain portion of it ſeems to be neceſſarily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the bowels in a healthy ſtate.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Heat is an uniform and active ſtimulus in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting life. It is derived, in certain ſeaſons and countries, in part from the ſun; but its principal ſource is from the lungs, in which it appears to be generated by the decompoſition of pure air, and from whence it is conveyed by means of the circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, to every part of the body. The extenſive
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:036255_0021_10086600E0EB7998"/>
influence of heat upon animal life, is evident from its decay and ſuſpenſion during the winter in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain animals, and from its revival upon the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and action of the vernal ſun. It is true, life is diminiſhed much leſs in man, from the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and abſence of the ſun, than in other ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals; but this muſt be aſcribed to his poſſeſſing reaſon in ſo high a degree, as to enable him to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the abſtraction of heat, by the action of other ſtimuli upon his ſyſtem.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Exerciſe acts as a ſtimulus upon the body in various ways. Its firſt impreſſion is upon the muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. Theſe act upon the blood veſſels, and they upon the nerves and brain. The neceſſity of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe to animal life is indicated, by its being kindly impoſed upon man in paradiſe. The change which the human body underwent by the fall, rendered the ſame ſalutary ſtimulus neceſſary to its life, in the more active form of labor. But we are not to ſuppoſe, that motion is excited in the body by exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe or labor alone. It is conſtantly ſtimulated by the poſitions of ſtanding, ſitting, and lying upon the ſides; all of which act more or leſs upon muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular fibres, and by their means, upon every part of the ſyſtem.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="16" facs="unknown:036255_0022_100866032A710D20"/>
7. The pleaſures we derive from our ſenſes have a powerful and extenſive influence upon human life. The number of theſe pleaſures, and their proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate cauſe, will form an agreeable ſubject for two or three future lectures.</p>
               <p>We proceed next to conſider the internal ſtimuli which produce animal life. Theſe are</p>
               <p>I. FOOD. This acts in the following ways. 1. Upon the tongue. Such are the ſenſibility and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citability of this organ, and ſo intimate, is its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection with every other part of the body; that the whole ſyſtem is invigorated by aliment, as ſoon as it comes in contact with it. 2. By maſtication. This moves a number of muſcles and blood veſſels ſituated near the brain and heart, and of courſe imparts impreſſions to them. 3. By deglutition, which acts upon ſimilar parts, and with the ſame effect. 4. By its preſence in the ſtomach, in which it acts by its quantity and quality. Food, by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the ſtomach, ſtimulates the contiguous parts of the body. A moderate degree of diſtention of the ſtomach and bowels is eſſential to a healthy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement of the ſyſtem. Vegetable aliment, and drinks, which contain leſs nouriſhment than animal food, ſerve this purpoſe in the human body. Hay acts in the ſame manner in a horſe. Sixteen
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:036255_0023_10086604AEAAF1F8"/>
pounds, of this light food, are neceſſary to keep up ſuch a degree of diſtention in the ſtomach and bowels of this animal, as to impart to him his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral grade of ſtrength and life. The <hi>quality</hi> of food, when of a ſtimulating nature, ſupplies the place of diſtention from its quantity. A ſingle onion will ſupport a lounging Highlander on the hills of Scotland for four and twenty hours. A moderate quantity of ſalted meat, or a few ounces of ſugar, have ſupplied the place of pounds of leſs ſtimulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing food. Even indigeſtible ſubſtances, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main for days, or perhaps weeks in the ſtomach, exert a ſtimulus there, which has an influence upon animal life. It is in this way the tops of briars, and the twigs of trees, devoid not only of nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing matter, but of juices, ſupport the camel in his journeys through the deſerts of the Eaſtern coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. Chips of cedar poſts, moiſtened with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, have ſupported horſes for two or three weeks, during a long voyage from Boſton to Surinam; and the indigeſtible cover of an old Bible, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the life of a dog, accidentally confined in a room at New Caſtle upon Tyne, for twenty days. 5. Food ſtimulates the whole body by means of the proceſs of digeſtion which goes forward in the ſtomach. This animal function is carried on in part by fermentation, in which there is an extrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:036255_0024_1008660700E35B20"/>
of heat, and air. Now both theſe, it has been remarked, exert a ſtimulus in promoting animal life.</p>
               <p>Drinks when they conſiſt of fermented or diſtill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed liquors, ſtimulate from their quality; but when they conſiſt of water, either in its ſimple ſtate, or impregnated with any ſapid ſubſtance, they act principally by diſtention.</p>
               <p>II. The chyle acts upon the lacteals, meſenteric glands, and thoracic duct, in its paſſage through them; and it is highly probable, its firſt mixture with the blood in the ſubclavian vein, and its firſt action on the heart, are attended with conſiderable ſtimulating effects.</p>
               <p>III. The blood is a very important internal ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus. It has been diſputed whether it acts by its quality, or only by diſtending the blood veſſels. It appears to act in both ways. I believe with Dr. Whytt, that the blood ſtimulates the heart and arteries by a ſpecific action. But if this be not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, its influence in diſtending the blood veſſels in every part of the body, and thereby imparting extenſive and uniform impreſſions to every animal fibre, cannot be denied.—In ſupport of this aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it has been remarked, that in thoſe perſons
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:036255_0025_1008660A5FBD6978"/>
who die of hunger, there is no diminution of the quantity of blood in the large blood veſſels.</p>
               <p>IV. A certain TENSION of the glands, and of other parts of the body, contributes to ſupport ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal life. This is evident in the vigor which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to the ſyſtem, by the fulneſs of the ſeminal veſicles and gall bladder<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by the diſtention of the uterus in pregnancy. This diſtention is ſo great, in ſome inſtances, as to prevent ſleep for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny days and even weeks before delivery. It ſerves the valuable purpoſe of rendering the female ſyſtem leſs liable to death during its continuance, than at any other time. By increaſing the quantity of life in the body, it often ſuſpends the fatal iſſue of pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monary conſumption, and enſures a temporary victory over the plague and other malignant fevers; for death, from thoſe diſeaſes, ſeldom takes place until the ſtimulus, from the diſtention of the uterus, is removed by parturition.</p>
               <p>V. The exerciſes of the faculties of the mind have a wonderful influence in increaſing the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of human life. They all act by <hi>reflection</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, after having been previouſly excited into acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by impreſſions made upon the body. This view, of the <hi>reaction</hi> of the mind upon the body, accords with the ſimplicity of other operations in
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:036255_0026_1008660CA75D3D70"/>
the animal oeconomy. It is thus the brain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pays the heart for the blood it conveys to it, by reacting upon its muſcular fibres.—The influence of the different faculties of the mind is felt in the pulſe, in the ſtomach, and in the liver, and is ſeen in the face, and other external parts of the body. Thoſe which act moſt unequivocally in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting life, are the underſtanding, the imagination, and the paſſions. Thinking belongs to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and is attended with an obvious influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon the degree and duration of life. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe ſtudy has often rendered the body inſenſible to the debilitating effects of cold, and hunger. Men of great and active underſtandings, who blend with their ſtudies, temperance and exerciſe, are generally long lived. In ſupport of this aſſertion, a hundred names might be added to thoſe of Newton and Franklin. Its truth will be more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſtabliſhed by attending to the ſtate of human life in perſons of an oppoſite intellectual character. The Cretins, a race of idiots in Valais in Swiſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, travellers tell us, are all ſhort lived. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon language juſtifies the opinion of the ſtimulus of the underſtanding upon the brain, hence it is common to ſay of dull men, that they have ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ideas enough to keep themſelves awake.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="unknown:036255_0027_1008660E29EE6000"/>
The imagination acts with great force upon the body, whether its numerous aſſociations produce pleaſure or pain. But the paſſions pour a conſtant ſtream upon the wheels of life. They have been ſubdivided into emotions and paſſions properly ſo called. The former have for their objects preſent, the latter, future good and evil. All the objects of the paſſions are accompanied with deſire or averſion. To the former belong chiefly, hope, love, ambition, and avarice; to the latter—fear, hatred, malice, envy, and the like. Joy, anger, and terror, belong to the claſs of emotions. The paſſions and emotions have been further divided into ſtimulating and ſedative. Our buſineſs at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent is to conſider their firſt effect only upon the body. In the original conſtitution of human nature, we were made to be ſtimulated by ſuch paſſions and emotions only as have moral good for their objects. Man was deſigned to be always under the influence of hope, love, and joy. By the loſs of his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, he has ſubjected himſelf to the dominion of paſſions and emotions of a malignant nature; but they poſſeſs, in common with ſuch as are good, a ſtimulus which renders them ſubſervient to the purpoſe of promoting animal life. It is true, they are like the ſtimulus of a diſlocated bone in their operation upon the body, compared with the action of antagoniſt muſcles ſtretched over bones, which
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:036255_0028_10086610749A85B0"/>
gently move in their natural ſockets. The effects of the good paſſions and emotions, in promoting health and longevity, have been taken notice of by many writers. They produce a flame, gentle and pleaſant, like oil perfumed with frankincenſe in the lamp of life. There are inſtances likewiſe of perſons who have derived ſtrength, and long life from the influence of the evil paſſions and emotions that have been mentioned. Dr. Darwin relates the hiſtory of a man, who uſed to overcome the fatigue induced by travelling, by thinking of a perſon whom he hated. The debility induced by diſeaſe, is often removed by a ſudden change in the temper. This is ſo common, that even nurſe; predict a recovery in perſons as ſoon as they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come peeviſh and ill-natured, after having been patient during the worſt ſtage of their ſickneſs. This peeviſhneſs acts as a gentle ſtimulus upon the ſyſtem in its languid ſtate, and thus turns the ſcale in favour of life and health. The famous Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min Lay of this ſtate, who lived to be eighty years of age, was of a very iraſcible temper. Old Elwes was a prodigy of avarice, and every court in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope furniſhes inſtances of men who have attained to extreme old age, who have lived conſtantly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the dominion of ambition. In the courſe of a long inquiry, which I inſtituted ſome years ago into the ſtate of the body and mind in old people, I did

not find a ſingle perſon above eighty, who had not poſſeſſed an active underſtanding, or active paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Thoſe different and oppoſite faculties of the mind, when in exceſs, happily ſupply the place of each other. Where they unite their forces, they extinguiſh the flame of life, before the oil which feeds it is conſumed.</p>
               <p>In another place I ſhall reſume the influence of the faculties of the mind upon human life, as they diſcover themſelves in the different purſuits of men.</p>
               <p>I have only to add here, that I ſee no occaſion to admit, with the followers of Dr. Brown, that the mind is active in ſleep, in preſerving the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of life. I hope to eſtabliſh hereafter the opinion of Mr. Locke, that the mind is always paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive in ſound ſleep. It is true it acts in dreams; but theſe depend upon a morbid ſtate of the brain, and therefore do not belong to the preſent ſtage of our ſubject; for I am now conſidering animal life only in the healthy ſtate of the body. I ſhall ſay preſently, that dreams are intended to ſupply the abſence of ſome natural ſtimulus, and hence we find they occur in thoſe perſons moſt commonly, in whom there is a want of healthy action in the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:036255_0030_10086615689D7218"/>
ſyſtem induced by the exceſs, or deficiency of cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomary ſtimuli.</p>
               <p>Life is in a languid ſtate, in the morning. It acquires vigor by the gradual, and ſucceſſive ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of ſtimuli in the forenoon. It is in its moſt perfect ſtate about midday, and remains ſtationary for ſome hours. From the diminution of the ſenſibility and contractility of the ſyſtem to the action of impreſſions, it leſſens in the evening, and becomes again languid at bedtime. Theſe facts will admit of an extenſive application here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after in our lectures upon the practice of phyſic.</p>

               <p>The ſtimuli which have been enumerated, when they act collectively, and within certain bounds, produce a healthy waking ſtate. But they do not always act collectively, nor in the determined and regular manner that has been deſcribed. There is in many ſtates of the ſyſtem, a deficiency of ſome ſtimuli, and in ſome of its ſtates, an apparent abſence of them all. To account for the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:036255_0031_10086617B6E86198"/>
of animal life under ſuch circumſtances, two things muſt be premiſed, before we proceed to take notice of the diminution, or abſence of the ſtimuli which ſupport it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The healthy actions of the body in the wak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtate, conſiſt in a proper degree of what has been called excitability, and excitement. The former is the medium on which ſtimuli act in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the latter. In an exact proportion, and a due relation of both, diffuſed uniformly through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out every part of the body, conſiſts good health. Diſeaſe is the reverſe of this. It depends <hi>in part</hi> upon a diſproportion between excitement and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citability, and in a partial diſtribution of each of them. In thus diſtinguiſhing the different ſtates of excitement and excitability in health and ſickneſs, you ſee I diſſent from Dr. Brown, who ſuppoſes them to be uniform and equable, in the morbid, as well as the healthy ſtates of the body.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is a law of the ſyſtem, that the abſence of one natural ſtimulus is generally ſupplied by the increaſed action of others. This is more certainly the caſe, where a natural ſtimulus is abſtracted <hi>ſuddenly;</hi> for the excitability is thereby ſo inſtantly formed and accumulated, as to furniſh a highly ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and moveable ſurface for the remaining ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:036255_0032_1008661ACD1B06B8"/>
to act upon. Many proofs might be adduced in ſupport of this propoſition. The reduction of the excitement of the blood veſſels, by means of cold, prepares the way for a full meal, or a warm bed, to excite in them the morbid actions which take place in a pleuriſy or a rheumatiſm. A horſe in a cold ſtable eats more than in a warm one; and thus counteracts the debility which would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be induced upon his ſyſtem, by the abſtraction of the ſtimulus of warm air.</p>
               <p>Theſe two propoſitions being admitted, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed next to inquire into the different degrees and ſtates of animal life. The firſt departure from its ordinary and perfect ſtate, which ſtrikes us, is in</p>
               <p>I. Sleep: This is either natural or artificial. Natural ſleep is induced by a diminution of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement, and excitability of the ſyſtem by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued application of the ſtimuli which act upon the body in its waking ſtate. When theſe ſtimuli act in a determined degree, that is, when the ſame number of ſtimuli act with the ſame force, and for the ſame time, upon the ſyſtem; ſleep will be brought on at the ſame hour every night. But when they act with uncommon force, or for an unuſual time, it is brought on at an earlier hour.
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:036255_0033_1008661C5011E828"/>
Thus a long walk, or ride by perſons accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a ſedentary life, unuſual exerciſe of the underſtanding, the action of ſtrong paſſions, or emotions, and the continual application of unuſual ſounds ſeldom fail of inducing premature ſleep. It is recorded of Pope Ganganelli, that he ſlept more ſoundly, and longer than uſual, the night after he was raiſed to the papal chair. The effects of unuſual ſounds in bringing on pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mature ſleep, is further demonſtrated by that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant inclination to retire to bed at an early hour, which country people diſcover the firſt and ſecond days they ſpend in a city, expoſed from morning till night to the noiſe of hammers, files and looms, or of days, carts, waggons, and coaches rattling over pavements of ſtone.—Sleep is further haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by the abſence of light, the ceſſation of ſounds, and labor, and the recumbent poſture of the body on a ſoft bed.</p>
               <p>Artificial ſleep may be induced at any time by certain ſtimulating ſubſtances, particularly by opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um. They act by carrying the ſyſtem beyond the healthy grade of excitement, to a degree of indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect debility which Dr. Brown has happily called the ſleeping point. The ſame point may be induc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſyſtem at any time by the artificial ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:036255_0034_1008661F69603190"/>
of the uſual ſtimuli of life. For example. Let a perſon ſhut himſelf up at mid-day in a dark room, remote from noiſe of all kinds, let him lie down on his back upon a <gap reason="illegible: torn page" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> in a temperate ſtate of the atmoſphere, and let him ceaſe to think upon intereſting ſubjects, or let him think only upon one ſubject, and he will ſoon fall aſleep. Dr. Boerhaave relates an inſtance of a Dutch phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician who having perſuaded himſelf that waking was a violent ſtate, and ſleep the only natural one of the ſyſtem; contrived by abſtracting every kind of ſtimulus in the manner that has been mentioned, to ſleep away whole days and nights, until at length he impaired his underſtanding, and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly periſhed in a public hoſpital in a ſtate of idiot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm.</p>
               <p>In thus anticipating a view of the cauſe of ſleep, I have ſaid nothing of the effects of diſeaſes of the brain in inducing it. Theſe belong to another part of our courſe. The ſhort explanation I have given of its cauſe, was neceſſary in order to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the hiſtory of animal life, in that ſtate of the ſyſtem, more intelligible.</p>
               <p>At the uſual hour of ſleep there is an abſtraction of the ſtimuli of light, ſound and muſcular motion.
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:036255_0035_10086620ECA323A8"/>
The ſtimuli which remain, and act with an increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed force upon the body in ſleep are,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The heat which is diſcharged from the body, and confined by means of bed clothes. It is moſt perceptible when exhaled from a bed fellow. Heat obtained in this way, has ſometimes been employed to reſtore declining life to the bodies of old people. Witneſs the damſel who lay for this purpoſe in the boſom of the king of Iſrael. The advantage of this external heat will appear further, when we conſider how impracticable, or imperfect ſleep is, when we lie under too light covering in cold weather.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The air which is applied to the lungs during ſleep probably acts with more force than in the waking ſtate. I am diſpoſed to believe that more air is phlogiſticated in ſleep than at any other time, for the ſmell of a cloſe room in which a perſon has ſlept one night, we know, is much more diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able than that of a room under equal circumſtances, in which half a dozen people have ſat for the ſame number of hours in the day time.—The action of decompoſed air on the lungs and heart was ſpoken of in a former lecture. An increaſe in its quantity muſt neceſſarily have a powerful influence upon animal life during the ſleeping ſtate.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="30" facs="unknown:036255_0036_100866238438FE60"/>
3. Reſpiration is performed with a greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion, and contraction of the muſcles of the breaſt in ſleep than in the waking ſtate; and this cannot fail of increaſing the impetus of the blood in its paſſage through the heart and blood veſſels. The increaſe of the fulneſs and force of the pulſe in ſleep, is probably owing in part to the action of reſpiration upon it. In another place I hope to elevate the rank of the blood veſſels in the animal oeconomy, by ſhewing that they are the fountains of power in the body. They derive this preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence from the protection and ſupport they afford to every part of the ſyſtem. They are the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual centinels of health and life; for they never partake in the repoſe which is enjoyed by the muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and nerves. During ſleep, their ſenſibility ſeems to be converted into contractility, by which means their muſcular fibres are more eaſily moved by the blood, than in the waking ſtate. The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of ſenſibility in ſleep is proved by many facts to be mentioned hereafter; and the change of ſenſibility into contractility will appear, when we come to conſider the ſtate of animal life in infancy and old age.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Aliment in the ſtomach acts more powerfully in ſleep, than in the waking ſtate. This is evident from digeſtion going on more rapidly when we are
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:036255_0037_10086626B1D06D18"/>
awake than when we ſleep.—The more ſlow the digeſtion, the greater is the ſtimulus of the aliment in the ſtomach. Of this we have many proofs in daily life. Labourers object to milk as a breakfaſt; becauſe it digeſts too ſoon, and often call for food in a morning, which they can feel all day in their ſtomachs. Sauſſages, fat pork, and onions are generally preferred by them for this purpoſe. A moderate ſupper is favourable to eaſy and ſound ſleep; and the want of it in perſons who are accuſtomed to that meal, is often followed by a reſtleſs night. The abſence of its ſtimulus is probably ſupplied by a full gall bladder (which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways attends an empty ſtomach) in perſons who are not in the habit of eating ſuppers.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The ſtimulus of the urine, accumulated in the bladder during ſleep, has a perceptible influence upon animal life. It is often ſo conſiderable as to interrupt ſleep; and it is one of the cauſes of our waking at a regular hour in the morning. It is moreover a frequent cauſe of the activity of the underſtanding and paſſions in dreams; and hence we dream more in our morning ſlumbers when the bladder is full, than we do in the beginning, or middle of the night.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="32" facs="unknown:036255_0038_10086628F22FFDF0"/>
6. The faeces exert a conſtant ſtimulus upon the bowels in ſleep. This is ſo conſiderable as to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it leſs profound, when they have been accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulated for two or three days, or when they have been depoſited in the extremity of the alimentary canal.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The partial and irregular exerciſes of the underſtanding and paſſions in dreams have an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional influence in promoting life. They occur only where there is a deficiency of other ſtimuli. Such is the force with which the mind acts upon the body in dreams, that Dr. Brambilla, phyſician to the emperor of Germany, informs us, that he has ſeen inſtances of wounds in ſoldiers being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed, and putting on a gangrenous appearance in conſequence of the commotions excited in their bodies by irritating dreams. The ſtimulating paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions act through the medium of the will; and the exerciſes of this faculty of the mind ſometimes extend ſo far as to produce actions in the muſcles of the limbs, and occaſionally in the whole body, as we ſee in perſons who walk in their ſleep. The ſtimulus of loſt often awakens us with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or pain, according as we are diſpoſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, or diſobey the precepts of our Maker. The angry and revengeful paſſions often deliver us in like manner, from the imaginary guilt of murder.
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:036255_0039_1008662A7B745640"/>
Even the debilitating paſſions of grief, and fear, produce an indirect operation upon the ſyſtem that is favourable to life in ſleep, for they excite that diſtreſſing diſeaſe called the night mare, which prompts us to ſpeak, or halloo, and by thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigorating reſpiration, reſtores the languid circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the blood in the heart and brain. Do not complain then, gentlemen, when you are beſtrode by this midnight hag. She is kindly ſent to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent your ſudden death. Perſons who go to bed in good health, and are found dead the ſucceeding morning, are ſaid moſt commonly to die of this diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>I cannot diſmiſs the ſubject of the ſtimulating effects of dreams, without taking notice of an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Dr. Darwin which is connected with it. He ſuppoſes dreams are never attended with vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition. The facts which have been mentioned, prove, that the will frequently acts with <hi>more</hi> force in them, than in the waking ſtate.</p>
               <p>I proceed now to inquire into the ſtate of animal life in its different ſtages. I paſs over for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent its hiſtory in generation. It will be ſufficient only to remark in this place, that its firſt motion is produced by the ſtimulus of the male ſeed upon the female ovum. This opinion is not originally mine.
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:036255_0040_10086632210BCEF0"/>
You will find it in Dr. Haller.<note n="*" place="bottom">"Novum foetum a ſeminis maſculi <hi>ſtimulo</hi> vitam con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepiſſe." Elementa Phyſiologiae, vol. viii. p. 177.</note> The pungent taſte which Mr. John Hunter diſcovered in the male ſeed, renders it peculiarly fit for this purpoſe. No ſooner is the female ovum thus ſet in motion, and the foetus formed, than its capacity of life is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,</p>
               <p n="1">1. By the ſtimulus of the heat which it derives from its connection with its mother in the womb.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By the ſtimulus of its own circulating blood.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By its conſtant motion in the womb after the third month of pregnancy. The abſence of this motion for a few days, is always a ſign of the indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition or death of a foetus. Conſidering how ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a child is accuſtomed to it, it is ſtrange that a cradle ſhould 'ever have been denied to it after it comes into the world.</p>
               <p>II. In infants there is an abſence of many of the ſtimuli which ſupport life.—Their excretions are in a great meaſure deficient in acrimony, and their mental faculties are too weak to exert much influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:036255_0041_1008663F9176B400"/>
upon their bodies. But the abſence of ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus from thoſe cauſes, is amply ſupplied</p>
               <p n="1">1. By the very great excitability of their ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tems to thoſe of light, ſound, heat, and air. So powerfully do light and ſound act upon them, that the author of nature has kindly defended their eyes and ears from an exceſs of their impreſſions by imperfect viſion, and hearing, for ſeveral weeks after birth. The capacity of infants to be acted upon by moderate degrees of heat is evident from their ſuffering leſs from cold than grown people. This is ſo much the caſe, that we read in Mr. Umfreville's account of Hudſon's Bay, of a child that was found alive upon the back of its mother after ſhe was frozen to death. I before hinted at the action of the air upon the bodies of new born infants in producing the red color of their ſkins. It is highly probable, (from a fact former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mentioned) that the firſt impreſſion of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere which produces this redneſs is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with pain, and this we know is a ſtimulus of a very active nature. By a kind law of ſenſation, impreſſions, that were originally painful, become pleaſurable by repetition, or duration. This is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably evident in the impreſſion now under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, and hence we find infants at a certain age, diſcover ſigns of an increaſe of life by their
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:036255_0042_1008662CC6DE9F08"/>
delightful geſtures, when they are carried into the open air. Recollect further gentlemen, what was ſaid formerly, of excitability, predominating over ſenſibility in infants. We ſee it daily, not only in their patience of cold, but in the ſhort time in which they ceaſe to complain of the injuries they meet with from falls, cuts, and even ſevere ſurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal operations.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Animal life is ſupported in infants by their ſucking, or feeding, nearly every hour in the day, and night when they are awake. I explained for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly the manner in which food ſtimulated the ſyſtem. The action of ſucking, ſupplies by the muſcles employed in it, the ſtimulus of maſtication.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Laughing and Crying, which are univerſal in infancy, have a conſiderable influence in promoting animal life, by their action upon reſpiration, and the circulation of the blood. Laughing exiſts under all circumſtances, independently of education or imitation. The child of a negro ſlave born only to inherit the toils and miſery of its parents, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives its maſter with a ſmile every time he enters his kitchen, or a negro-quarter. But laughing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts in infancy under circumſtances ſtill more unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to it, an inſtance of which is related by Mr. Bruce. After a journey of ſeveral hundred
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:036255_0043_1008663465023288"/>
miles acroſs the ſands of Nubia, he came to a ſpring of water ſhaded by a few ſcrubby trees. Here he intended to have reſted during the night, but he had not ſlept long, before he was awakened by a noiſe which he perceived was made by a ſolitary Arab equally fatigued, and half famiſhed with himſelf, who was preparing to murder and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him. Mr. Bruce ruſhed upon him, and made him his priſoner. The next morning he was joined by a half ſtarved female companion, with an infant of ſix months old in her arms. In paſſing by this child, Mr. Bruce ſays it laughed and crowed in his face, and attempted to leap upon him. From this fact it would ſeem as if laughing was not only characteriſtic of our ſpecies, but that it was early and intimately connected with human life. The child of theſe Arabs had probably ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſeen a ſmile upon the faces of its ferocious parents, and perhaps had never, (before the ſight of Mr. Bruce), beheld any other human crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>Crying has a conſiderable influence upon health and life in children. I have ſeen ſo many inſtances of its ſalutary effects, that I have ſatisfied myſelf that it is as poſſible for a child to "cry and be fat," as it is to "laugh and be fat."</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="38" facs="unknown:036255_0044_1008663626A00FC0"/>
4. As children advance in life, the conſtancy of their appetites for food, and their diſpoſition to laugh, and cry, leſſen, but the diminution of theſe ſtimuli ſupplied by exerciſe. The limbs, and tongues of children are always in motion. They continue likewiſe to eat oftener than adults. A cruſt of bread is commonly the laſt thing they aſk for at night, and the firſt thing they call for in the morning. It is now they begin to feel the energy of their mental faculties. This ſtimulus is aſſiſted in its force, by the diſpoſition to prattle which is ſo univerſal among children. This habit of converting their ideas into words as faſt as they riſe, follows them to their beds, where we often hear them talk themſelves to ſleep in a whiſper, or to uſe leſs correct, but more ſtriking terms, by <hi>thinking aloud.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Dreams act at an early period upon the bodies of children. Their ſmiles, ſtartings, and occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſcreams in their ſleep appear to ariſe from them. After the third or fourth year of their lives, they ſometimes confound them with things that are real. From obſerving the effects of this miſtake upon the memory, a ſenſible woman whom I once knew, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad her children to tell their dreams, leſt they ſhould contract habits of lying, by confounding imaginary, with real events.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="39" facs="unknown:036255_0045_10086638704A84B0"/>
6. New objects whether natural or artificial, are never ſeen by children without emotions of pleaſure which act upon their capacity of life. The effects of novelty upon the tender bodies of children may eaſily be conceived, by its friendly influence upon the health of invalids who viſit foreign countries, and who paſs months, or years in a conſtant ſucceſſion of new and agreeable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions.</p>
               <p>III. From the combination of all the ſtimuli that have been enumerated, human life is generally in exceſs from fifteen to thirty-five. It is during this period, the paſſions blow a perpetual ſtorm. The moſt predominating of them is the love of pleaſure. No ſooner does the ſyſtem become inſenſible to this ſtimulus, than ambition ſucceeds it in,</p>
               <p>IV. The middle ſtage of life. Here we behold man in his moſt perfect phyſical ſtate. The ſtimuli which now act upon him are ſo far regulated by prudence, that they are ſeldom exceſſive in their force. The habits of order the ſyſtem acquires in this period, continue to produce good health for many years afterwards, and hence bills of mortality prove that fewer perſons die between forty and fifty-ſeven; than in any other ſeventeen years of human life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="unknown:036255_0046_1008663B79BD6AF8"/>
V. In OLD AGE the ſenſes of ſeeing, hearing and touch are impaired. The venereal appetite is weakened, or entirely extinguiſhed. The pulſe becomes ſlow, and ſubject to frequent intermiſſions, from a decay in the force of the blood veſſels; Exerciſe becomes impracticable, or irkſome, and the operations of the underſtanding are performed with languor and difficulty. In this ſhattered and declining ſtate of the ſyſtem, the abſence and diminution of all the ſtimuli which have been mentioned are ſupplied,</p>
               <p n="1">1. By an increaſe in the quantity, and by the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar quality of the food which is taken by old people. They generally eat twice as much as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in middle life, and they bear with pain the uſual intervals between meals. They moreover prefer that kind of food which is ſavoury and ſtimulating. The ſtomach of the celebrated Parr, who died in the one hundred and fiftieth year of his age, was found full of ſtrong, nouriſhing ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By the ſtimulus of the faeces which are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently retained for five or ſix days in the bowels of old people.</p>

3. By the ſtimulus of fluids rendered preterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally acrid by age. The urine, ſweat and even the tears of old people, poſſeſs a peculiar acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Their blood likewiſe loſes part of the mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which is natural to that fluid; and hence the difficulty with which ſores heal in old people; and hence too the reaſon why cancers are more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in the decline, than in any other period of human life.</p>
               <p n="4">4. By the uncommon activity of certain paſſions. Theſe are either good or evil. To the former be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long an increaſed vigor in the operations of thoſe paſſions which have for their objects the Divine Being, or the whole family of mankind, or their own offspring, particularly their grand-children. To the latter paſſions belong, malice, a hatred of the manners and faſhions of the riſing generation, and above all, avarice. This paſſion knows no holidays. Its ſtimulus is conſtant, though varied daily by the numerous means which it has diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of increaſing, ſecuring, and perpetuating pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty. It has been obſerved that weak mental impreſſions produce much greater effects in old people than in perſons in middle life. A trifling indiſpoſition in a grand-child, an inadvertent act of unkindneſs from a friend, or the fear of loſing a few ſhillings, have in many inſtances produced
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:036255_0048_1008662F0D038718"/>
in them a degree of wakefulneſs that has continued for two or three nights. It is to this highly exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſtate of the ſyſtem that Solomon probably al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes, when he deſcribes the graſshopper as bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſome to old people.</p>
               <p n="5">5. By the paſſion for talking, which is ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, as to be one of the characteriſtics of old age. I mentioned formerly, the influence of this ſtimulus upon animal life. Perhaps it is more neceſſary in the female conſtitution than in the male; for it has long ago been remarked, that women who are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry taciturn, are generally unhealthy.</p>
               <p n="6">6. By their wearing warmer clothes, and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring warmer rooms, than in the former periods of their lives. This practice is ſo uniform, that it would not be difficult in many caſes to tell a man's age by his dreſs, or by finding out at what degree of heat he found himſelf comfortable in a cloſe room.</p>
               <p n="7">7. By dreams. Theſe are univerſal among old people. They ariſe from their ſhort and imperfect ſleep.</p>
               <p n="8">8. It has been often ſaid that "We are once men, and twice children." In ſpeaking of the ſtate of
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:036255_0049_10086642F4F4BF58"/>
animal life in infancy, I remarked that the contrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility of the animal fibres, predominated over their ſenſibility in that ſtage of life. The ſame thing takes place in old people, and it is in conſequence of the return of this infantile ſtate of the ſyſtem, that all the ſtimuli which have been mentioned act upon them with much more force than in middle life. This ſameneſs, in the predominance of excita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility over ſenſibility in children and old people, will account for the ſimilarity of their habits with reſpect to eating, ſleep, exerciſe, and the uſe of fermented or diſtilled liquors. It is from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of excitability in old people, that ſo ſmall a quantity of ſtrong drink intoxicates them; and it is from an ignorance of this change in their conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that many of them become drunkards after paſſing the early and middle ſtages of life with ſober characters.</p>
               <p>Life is continued in a leſs imperfect ſtate in old age, in women than in men. The former ſew, and knit, and ſpin, after they loſe the uſe of their ears and eyes; whereas the latter, after loſing the uſe of thoſe ſenſes, frequently paſs the evening of their lives in a torpid ſtate in a chimney corner. It is from the influence of moderate and gently ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulating employments, upon the female conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that more women live to be old, than men,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:036255_0050_1008664544D1B420"/>
and that they rarely ſurvive their uſefulneſs in domeſtic life.</p>
               <p>Hitherto the principles I am endeavouring to eſtabliſh, have been applied to explain the cauſe of life in its more common forms. Let us next inquire, how far they will enable us to explain its continuance in certain morbid ſtates of the body, in which there is a diminution of ſome, and an appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent abſtraction of all the ſtimuli, which have been ſuppoſed to produce animal life.</p>
               <p>I. We obſerve ſome people to be blind, or deaf and dumb from their birth. The ſame defects of ſight, hearing, and ſpeech, are ſometimes brought on by diſeaſes. Here animal life is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of all thoſe numerous ſtimuli, which ariſe from light, colors, ſounds, and ſpeech. But the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of theſe ſtimuli is ſupplied,</p>
               <p>I. By increaſed ſenſibility and excitability in their remaining ſenſes. The ears, the noſe, and the fingers, afford a ſurface for impreſſions in blind people which frequently overbalances the loſs of their eyeſight. There are two blind young men, brothers, in this city, of the name of Dutton, who can tell when they approach a poſt in walking acroſs a ſtreet, by a peculiar ſound which the ground
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:036255_0051_10086646C81D83C0"/>
under their feet emits in the neighbourhood of the poſt. Their ſenſe of hearing is ſtill more exquiſite to ſounds of another kind. They can tell the names of a number of tame pidgeons, with which they amuſe themſelves in a little garden, by only hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them fly over their heads. The celebrated blind philoſopher Dr. Moyſe can diſtinguiſh a black dreſs on his friends, by its ſmell; and we read of many inſtances of blind perſons who have been able to perceive colors by rubbing their fingers up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. One of theſe perſons mentioned by Mr. Boyle, has left upon record an account of the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic quality of each color as it affected his ſenſe of touch. He ſays, black imparted the moſt, and blue, the leaſt perceptible ſenſe of aſperity to his fingers.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By an increaſe of vigor in the exerciſe of the mental faculties. The poems of Homer, Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton and Blacklock, and the attainments of Sander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in mathematical knowledge, all diſcover how much the energy of the mind is increaſed by the abſence of impreſſions upon the organs of viſion.</p>
               <p>II. We ſometimes behold life in idiots in whom there is not only an abſence of the ſtimuli of the underſtanding and paſſions; but frequently from the weakneſs of their bodies, a deficiency of the loco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motive
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:036255_0052_100866496D5433C8"/>
powers. Here an inordinate appetite for food, or venereal pleaſures, or a conſtant habit of laughing, or talking, or playing with their hands and feet, ſupply the place of the ſtimulating ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the mind, and of general bodily exerciſe. Of the inordinate force of the venereal appetite in idiots we have many proofs. The Cretins are much addicted to venery; and Dr. Michaelis tells us that the idiot whom he ſaw at the Peſaiac falls in New-Jerſey, who had paſſed ſix and twenty years in a cradle, acknowledged that he had venereal deſires, and wiſhed to be married, for the Doctor adds, he had a ſenſe of religion upon his fragment of mind, and of courſe did not wiſh to gratify that appetite in an unlawful manner.</p>
               <p>III. How is animal life ſupported in perſons who paſs many days, and even weeks without food, and in ſome inſtances without drinks? Long faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is uſually the effect of diſeaſe, of neceſſity, or of a principle of religion. When it ariſes from the firſt cauſe, the actions of life are kept up by the ſtimulus of diſeaſe. The abſence of food when accidental, or ſubmitted to as a means of producing moral happineſs, is ſupplied,</p>
               <p n="1">1. By the ſtimulus of a full gall bladder. This ſtate of the receptacle of bile, has generally been
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:036255_0053_1008664C915BC578"/>
found to accompany an empty ſtomach. The bile is ſometimes abſorbed, and imparts a yellow co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor to the ſkin of perſons who ſuffer or die of famine.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By increaſed acrimony in all the ſecretions and excretions of the body. The ſaliva becomes ſo acrid by long faſting, as to excoriate the gums, and the breath acquires not only a foetor, but a pungency ſo active, as to draw tears from the eyes of perſons who are expoſed to it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By increaſed ſenſibility and excitability in the ſenſe of touch. The blind man mentioned by Mr. Boyle who could diſtinguiſh colors by his fingers, poſſeſſed this talent only after faſting. Even a draught of any kind of liquor deprived him of it. I have taken notice in my account of the yellow fever in Philadelphia in the year 1793, of the effects of a diet bordering upon faſting for ſix weeks, in producing a quickneſs and correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in my perceptions of the ſtate of the pulſe, which I had never experienced before.</p>
               <p n="4">4. By an increaſe of activity in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and paſſions. Gameſters often improve the exerciſes of their minds when they are about to play for a large ſum of money, by living for a
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:036255_0054_1008664F1CB05088"/>
day or two upon roaſted apples and cold water. Where the paſſions are excited into preternatural action, the abſence of the ſtimulus of food is ſcarcely felt. I ſhall hereafter mention the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the deſire of life, upon its preſervation under all circumſtances. It acts with peculiar force when faſting is accidental. But when it is ſubmitted to as a religious duty, it is accompanied by ſentiments and feelings which more than ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance the abſtraction of aliment. The body of Moſes was ſuſtained, probably without a miracle, during an abſtinence of forty days and forty nights, by the pleaſure he derived from converſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his Maker "Face to face, as a man ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his friend."<note n="*" place="bottom">Exodus xxxiii. 11. xxxiv. 28.</note>
               </p>
               <p>I remarked formerly that the veins diſcover no deficiency of blood in perſons who die of famine. Death from this cauſe ſeems to be leſs the effect of the want of food, than of the combined and exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive operation of the ſtimuli, which ſupply its place in the ſyſtem.</p>
               <p>IV. We come now to a difficult inquiry, and that is, how is life ſupported during the total ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction of external and internal ſtimuli which
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:036255_0055_100866509F8BF550"/>
takes place in aſphixia, or in apparent death, from all its numerous cauſes?</p>
               <p>I took notice in a former lecture, that ordinary life conſiſted in the excitement, and excitability of the different parts of the body; and that they were occaſionally changed into each other. In apparent death from violent emotions of the mind, from the ſudden impreſſion of miaſmata, or from drowning, there is a loſs of excitement; but the excitability of the ſyſtem remains for minutes, and in ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances for hours afterwards unimpaired, provided the accident which produced the loſs of excite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment has not been attended with ſuch exertions as are calculated to waſte it. If for example, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhould fall ſuddenly into the water, without bruiſing his body, and ſink before his fears, or exertions had time to diſſipate his excitability; his recovery from apparent death might be effected by the gentle action of heat, or frictions upon his body, ſo as to convert his accumulated excitability gradually into excitement. The ſame condition of the ſyſtem takes place when apparent death oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs from freezing, and a recovery is accompliſhed by the ſame gentle application of ſtimuli, provided the organization of the body be not injured, or its excitability waſted, by violent exertions previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to its freezing. This excitability is the
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:036255_0056_100866532425A598"/>
vehicle of motion, and motion when continued long enough produces ſenſation, which is ſoon fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by thought; and in theſe, I ſaid formerly, conſiſts perfect life in the human body.</p>
               <p>For this explanation of the manner in which life is ſuſpended, and revived in perſons apparently dead from cold, I am indebted to Mr. John Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who ſuppoſes, if it were poſſible for the body to be <hi>ſuddenly</hi> frozen by an inſtantaneous abſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of its heat, life might be continued for many years in a ſuſpended ſtate, and revived at pleaſure; provided the body were preſerved conſtantly in a temperature barely ſufficient to prevent reanima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and never ſo great, as to endanger the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of any organic part. The reſuſcitation of infects that have been in a torpid ſtate for months, and perhaps years, in ſubſtances that have preſerved their organization, ſhould at leaſt defend this bold propoſition from being treated as chimerical. The effuſions even of the imagination of ſuch men as Mr. Hunter, are entitled to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. They often become the germs of future diſcoveries.</p>
               <p>In that ſtate of ſuſpended animation which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs in acute diſeaſes, and which has ſometimes been denominated a <hi>trance:</hi> the ſyſtem is nearly in
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:036255_0057_100866562ED0E4D0"/>
the ſame excitable ſtate that it is in apparent death from drowning, and freezing. Reſuſcitation in theſe caſes is not the effect as in thoſe which have been mentioned of artificial applications made to the body for that purpoſe. It appears to be ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous; but it is produced by impreſſions made upon the ears, and by the operations of the mind in dreams. Of the action of theſe ſtimuli upon the body in its apparently lifeleſs ſtate, I have ſatisfied myſelf by many facts. I once attended a citizen of Philadelphia, who died of a pulmonary diſeaſe in the 80th year of his age. A few days before his death he begged that he might not be interred until one week after the uſual ſigns of life had left his body, and gave as a reaſon for this requeſt, that he had when a young man, died to all appearance of the yellow fever in one of the Weſt-India iſlands.—In this ſituation he diſtinctly heard the perſons who attended him, fix upon the time, and place, of burying him. The horror of being put under ground alive, produced ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſing emotions in his mind, as to diffuſe motion throughout his body, and finally excited in him all the uſual functions of life. In Dr. Creighton's eſſay upon mental derangement there is a hiſtory of a caſe nearly of a ſimilar nature. "A young lady (ſays the Doctor) an attendant on the princeſs of—, after having been confined to her bed
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:036255_0058_1008665875D72460"/>
for a great length of time, with a violent nervous diſorder, was at laſt, to all appearance, deprived of life. Her lips were quite pale, her face reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the countenance of a dead perſon, and her body grew cold. She was removed from the room in which <hi>ſhe died,</hi> was laid in a coffin, and the day for her funeral was fixed on. The day arrived, and according to the cuſtom of the country, fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſongs and hymns were ſung before the door. Juſt as the people were about to nail on the lid of the coffin, a kind of perſpiration was obſerved on the ſurface of her body. She recovered. The following is the account ſhe gave of her ſenſations; ſhe ſaid, "It ſeemed to her as if in a dream, that ſhe was really dead; yet ſhe was perfectly conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of all that happened around her. She diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly heard her friends ſpeaking and lamenting her death at the ſide of her coffin. She felt them pull on the dead clothes, and lay her in it. This feeling produced a mental anxiety which ſhe could not deſcribe. She tried to cry out, but her mind was without power, and could not act on her body. She had the contradictory feeling as if ſhe were in her own body, and not in it, at the ſame time. It was equally impoſſible for her to ſtretch out her arm or open her eyes, as to cry, although ſhe continually endeavoured to do ſo. The inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal anguiſh of her mind was at its utmoſt height
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:036255_0059_10086659F89E5E98"/>
when the funeral hymns began to be ſung, and when the lid of the coffin was about to be nailed on. The thought that ſhe was to be buried alive was the firſt which gave activity to her mind, and enabled it to operate on her corporeal frame."</p>
               <p>Where the ears loſe their capacity of being act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon by ſtimuli, the mind by its operations in dreams, becomes a ſource of impreſſions which again ſet the wheels of life in motion. There is an account publiſhed by Dr. Arnold in his obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations upon inſanity,<note n="*" place="bottom">Vol. ii. p. 298.</note> of a certain John Engel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breght a German, who was believed to be dead, and who was evidently reſuſcitated by the exerciſes of his mind upon ſubjects which were of a delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and ſtimulating nature. This hiſtory ſhall be taken from Mr. Engelbreght's words. "It was on Thurſday noon (ſays he) about 12 o'clock when I perceived that death was making his approached upon me from the lower parts upwards, inſomuch that my whole body became ſtiff. I had no feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing left in my hands and feet, neither in any other part of my whole body, nor was I at laſt able to ſpeak or ſee, for my mouth now becoming very ſtiff, I was no longer able to open it, nor did I feel it any longer. My eyes alſo broke in my
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:036255_0060_1008665B80ABB120"/>
head in ſuch a manner that I diſtinctly felt it. For all that, I underſtood what they ſaid, when they were praying by me, and I diſtinctly heard them ſay, feel his legs, how ſtiff, and cold they have become. This I heard diſtinctly, but I had no perception of their touch. I heard the watchman cry 11 o'clock, but at 12 o'clock my hearing left me. After relating his paſſage from the body to heaven with the velocity of an arrow ſhot from a croſs bow, he proceeds, and ſays that as he was twelve hours in dying, ſo he was twelve hours in returning to life. "As I died (ſays he) from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath upwards, ſo I revived again the contrary way from above to beneath, or from top to toe. Being conveyed back from the heavenly glory, I began to hear again ſomething of what they were praying for me, in the ſame room with me. Thus was my hearing, the <hi>firſt</hi> ſenſe I recovered. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this I began to have a perception of my eyes, ſo that by little and little, my whole body became ſtrong, and ſprightly, and no ſooner did I get a feeling of my legs and feet, than I aroſe and ſtood firm upon them with a firmneſs I had never enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before. The heavenly joy I had experienced, invigorated me to ſuch a degree, that people were aſtoniſhed at my rapid, and almoſt inſtantaneous recovery."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="unknown:036255_0061_1008665F9D956CE0"/>
The explanation, I have given of the cauſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſcitation in this man, will ſerve to refute a belief in a ſuppoſed migration of the ſoul from the body in caſes of apparent death. The imagination, it is true, uſually conducts the whole mind to the abodes of happy or miſerable ſpirits, but it acts here in the ſame way that it does when it tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports it in common dreams, to numerous and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant parts of the world.</p>
               <p>There is nothing ſupernatural in Mr. Engel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breght being invigorated by his ſuppoſed flight to heaven. Pleaſant dreams always ſtimulate and ſtrengthen the body, while dreams which are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with diſtreſs, or labour debilitate, and fatigue it.</p>

               <p>Let us next take a view of the ſtate of animal life in the different inhabitants of our globe, as varied by the circumſtances of civilization, diet, ſituation and climate.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="unknown:036255_0062_10086661EC5770C0"/>
I. In the Indians of the northern latitudes of America, there is often a defect of the ſtimulus of aliment, and of the underſtanding and paſſions. Their vacant countenances, and their long and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſting taciturnity, are the effects of the want of action in their brains from a deficiency of ideas; and their tranquillity under all the common cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of irritation, pleaſure or grief, are the reſult of an abſence of paſſion; for they hold it to be diſgraceful to ſhew any outward ſigns of anger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> joy, or even of domeſtic affection. This account of the Indian character, I know is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that which is given of it by Rouſſeau, and ſeveral other writers, who have attempted to prove that man may become perfect and happy, without the aids of civilization and religion. This opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is contradicted by the experience of all ages, and is rendered ridiculous by the facts which are well aſcertained in the hiſtory of the cuſtoms and habits of our American ſavages. In a cold climate they are the moſt miſerable beings upon the face of the earth. The greateſt part of their time is ſpent in ſleep, or under the alternate influence of hunger and gluttony. They moreover indulge in vices which are alike contrary to moral and phyſical happineſs. It is in conſequence of theſe habits, that they diſcover ſo early the marks of old age, and that ſo few of them are long-lived. The
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:036255_0063_100866636F1D2840"/>
abſence and diminution of many of the ſtimuli of life in theſe people is ſupplied in part, by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent exertions with which they hunt, and carry on war, and by the extravagant manner with which they afterwards celebrate their exploits, in their ſavage dances and ſongs.</p>
               <p>II. In the inhabitants of the torrid regions of Africa, there is a deficiency of labor; for the earth produces ſpontaneouſly nearly all the ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance they require. Their underſtandings and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are moreover in a torpid ſtate. But the abſence of bodily and mental ſtimuli in theſe people, is amply ſupplied by the conſtant heat of the ſun, by the profuſe uſe of ſpices in their diet, and by the paſſion for muſical ſounds which ſo univerſally characteriſes the African nations.</p>
               <p>III. In Greenland the body is expoſed during a long winter to ſuch a degree of cold as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the pulſe to 40, or 50 ſtrokes in a minute. But the effects of this cold in leſſening the quantity of life, are obviated in part by the heat of cloſe ſtove rooms, by warm clothing, and by the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar nature of the aliment of the Greenlanders, which conſiſts chiefly of animal food, of dried fiſh, and of whale oil. They prefer the laſt of thoſe articles in ſo rancid a ſtate, that it imparts a
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:036255_0064_10086665AE53A268"/>
faetor to their perſpiration which, Mr. Crantz ſays, renders even their churches offenſive to ſtrangers. I need hardly add, that a diet poſſeſſed of ſuch diffuſible qualities, cannot fail of being highly ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulating. It is remarkable that the food of all the northern nations of Europe is compoſed of ſtimulating animal, or vegetable matters, and that the uſe of ſpiritous liquors is univerſal among them.</p>
               <p>IV. Let us next turn our eyes to the miſerable inhabitants of thoſe eaſtern countries which compoſe the Ottoman empire. Here we behold life in its moſt feeble ſtate, not only from the abſence of phyſical, but of other ſtimuli which operate upon the inhabitants of other parts of the world. Among the poor people of Turkey there is a general deficiency of aliment. Mr. Volney in his travels tells us "That the diet of the Bedouins ſeldom exceeds ſix ounces a day, and that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of ſix or ſeven dates ſoaked in butter-milk, and afterwards mixed with a little ſweet milk, or curds."—There is likewiſe a general deficiency among them of ſtimulus, from the operations of the mental faculties; for ſuch is the deſpotiſm of the government in Turkey, that it weakens not only the underſtanding; but it annihilates all that immenſe ſource of ſtimuli which ariſes from the exerciſe of the domeſtic and public affections. A
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:036255_0065_100866685E628C98"/>
Turk lives wholly to himſelf. In point of time, he occupies only the moment in which he exiſts; for his futurity, as to life and property, belongs altogether to his maſter. Fear is the reigning principle of his actions, and hope and joy ſeldom add a ſingle pulſation to his heart. Tyranny even impoſes a reſtraint upon the ſtimulus which ariſes from converſation, for "They ſpeak (ſays Mr. Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney) with a ſlow feeble voice, as if the lungs wanted ſtrength to propel air enough through the glottis to form diſtinct articulate ſounds." The ſame traveller adds, that "They are ſlow in all their motions, that their bodies are ſmall, that they have ſmall evacuations, and that their blood is ſo deſtitute of ſeroſity, that nothing but the greateſt heat can preſerve its fluidity." The defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of aliment, and the abſence of mental ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muli in theſe people is ſupplied,</p>
               <p n="1">1. By the heat of their climate.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By their paſſion for muſical ſounds and fine clothes, and</p>
               <p n="3">3. By their general uſe of coffee and opium.</p>
               <p>The more debilitated the body is, the more forcibly theſe ſtimuli act upon it. Hence accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

to Mr. Volney, the Bedouins, whoſe ſlender diet has been mentioned, enjoy good health; for this conſiſts not in ſtrength, but in an exact proportion being kept up between the excitability of the body, and the number and force of the ſtimuli which act upon it.</p>
               <p>V. Many of the obſervations which have been made upon the inhabitants of Africa, and of the Turkiſh dominions, apply to the inhabitants of China, and the Eaſt Indies. They want in many inſtances the ſtimulus of animal food. Their minds are moreover in a ſtate too languid to act with much force upon their bodies. The abſence and deficiency of theſe ſtimuli are ſupplied by,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The heat of the climate in the ſouthern parts of thoſe countries.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By a vegetable diet abounding in nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, particularly rice and beans.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By the uſe of tea in China, and by a ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating coffee made of the dried and toaſted ſeeds of the datura ſtramonium, in the neighbourhood of the Indian coaſt. Some of theſe nations likewiſe chew ſtimulating ſubſtances, as too many of our citizens do tobacco.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="unknown:036255_0067_1008666D57FFA958"/>
Among the poor and depreſſed ſubjects of the governments of the middle and ſouthern parts of Europe, the deficiency of the ſtimulus of whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome food, of clothing, of fuel, and of liberty, is ſupplied in ſome countries by the invigorating influence of the Chriſtian religion upon animal life; and in others, by the general uſe of tea, coffee, garlic, onions, opium, tobacco, malt liquors, and ardent ſpirits. The uſe of each of theſe ſtimuli ſeems to be regulated by the circumſtances of cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate. In cold countries where the earth yields its increaſe with reluctance, and where vegetable ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ſcarce, the want of the ſtimulus of diſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which that ſpecies of food is principally calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to produce, is ſought for in that, of ardent ſpirits. To the ſouthward of 40° a ſubſtitute for the diſtention from mild vegetable food is ſought for, in onions, garlic and tobacco. But further, a uniform climate calls for more of theſe artificial ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muli than a climate that is expoſed to the alternate action of heat and cold, winds and calms, and of wet and dry weather. Savages and ignorant people likewiſe require more of them than perſons of civilized manners, and cultivated underſtandings. It would ſeem from theſe facts that man cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt without <hi>ſenſation</hi> of ſome kind, and that when it is not derived from natural means, it will always be ſought for in ſuch as are artificial.</p>
               <p>

In no part of the human ſpecies, is animal life in a more perfect ſtate than in the inhabitants of Great Britain,<note n="*" place="bottom">Haller's Elementa Phyſiologiae, vol. viii. p. 2. p. 107.</note> and the United States of America. With all the natural ſtimuli that have been menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, they are conſtantly under the invigorating influence of liberty. There is an indiſſoluble uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between moral, political and phyſical happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and if it be true, that elective and repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative governments are moſt favourable to indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual, as well as national proſperity, it follows of courſe, that they are moſt favourable to animal life. But this opinion does not reſt upon an induc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion derived from the relation, which truths up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all ſubjects bear to each other. Many facts prove, animal life to exiſt in a larger quantity and for a longer time, in the enlightened and happy ſtate of Connecticut, in which republican liberty has exiſted above one hundred and fifty years, than in any other country upon the ſurface of the globe.</p>
               <p>It remains now to mention certain mental ſtimuli which act nearly alike in the production of animal life, upon the individuals of all the nations in the world. They are,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The deſire of life. This principle ſo deeply, and univerſally implanted in human nature, acts
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:036255_0069_100866734188C6C8"/>
very powerfully in ſupporting our exiſtence. It has been obſerved to prolong life. Sickly tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers by ſea and land, often live under circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the greateſt weakneſs, till they reach their native country, and then expire in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of their friends. This deſire of life often turns the ſcale in favor of a recovery in acute diſeaſes. Its influence will appear, from the difference in the periods in which death was induced in two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who were actuated by oppoſite paſſions with reſpect to life. Atticus, we are told, died of volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary abſtinence from food in five days. In Sir Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Hamilton's account of the earthquake at Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bria, we read of a girl who lived eleven days without food, before ſhe expired. In the former caſe, life was ſhortened by an averſion from it; in the latter, it was protracted by the deſire of it. The late Mr. Briſſot in his viſit to this city, informed me that the application of animal magnetiſm (in which he was a believer) had in no inſtance cured a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe in a Weſt India ſlave. Perhaps it was ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered inert by its not being accompanied by a ſtrong deſire of life; for this principle exiſts in a more feeble ſtate in ſlaves than in freemen. It is poſſible likewiſe the wills and imaginations of theſe degraded people may have become ſo paralytic by ſlavery, as to be incapable of being excited by the impreſſion of this fanciful remedy.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="64" facs="unknown:036255_0070_10086675873FE560"/>
2. The love of money ſets the whole animal machine in motion. Hearts which are inſenſible to the ſtimuli of religion, patriotiſm, love, and even of the domeſtic affections, are excited into action by this paſſion. The city of Philadelphia between the 10th and 15th of Auguſt 1791, will long be remembered by contemplative men, for having furniſhed the moſt extraordinary proofs of the ſtimulus of the love of money upon the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man body. A new ſcene of ſpeculation was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced at that time by the ſcrip of the bank of the United ſtates. It excited febrile diſeaſes in three perſons who became my patients. In one of them, the acquiſition of twelve thouſand dollars in a few minutes by a lucky ſale, brought on madneſs which terminated in death in a few days.<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Mead relates upon the authority of Dr. Hales, that more of the ſucceſsful ſpeculators in the South Sea Scheme of 1720 became inſane, than of thoſe who had been ruined by it.</note> The whole city felt the impulſe of this paroxyſm of avarice. The ſlow and ordinary means of earning money were deſerted, and men of every profeſſion and trade, were ſeen in all our ſtreets haſtening to the coffee houſe, where the agitation of countenance, and the deſultory manners, of all the perſons who were intereſted in this ſpecies of gaming, exhibited a truer picture of a bedlam, than of
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:036255_0071_100866770AC09040"/>
a place appropriated to the tranſaction of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantile buſineſs. But further, the love of money diſcovers its ſtimulus upon the body in a peculiar manner in the games of cards and dice. I have heard of a gentleman in Virginia who paſſed two whole days and nights in ſucceſſion at a card table, and it is related in the life of a noted game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in Ireland, that when he was ſo ill as to be unable to riſe from his chair, he would ſuddenly revive when brought to the hazard table, by hearing the rattling of the dice.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Public amuſements of all kinds, ſuch as a horſe race, a cockpit, a chaſe, the theatre, the circus, maſquerades, public dinners and tea par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, all exert an artificial ſtimulus upon the ſyſtem, and thus ſupply the defect of the rational exerciſes of the mind.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The love of dreſs is not confined in its ſtimulating operation to perſons in health. It acts perceptibly in ſome caſes upon invalids. I have heard of a gentleman in South Carolina, who always relieved himſelf of a fit of low ſpirits by chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his dreſs; and I believe there are few people who do not feel themſelves enlivened, by putting on a new ſuit of clothes.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="66" facs="unknown:036255_0072_1008667895C30B80"/>
5. Novelty is an immenſe ſource of agreeable ſtimuli. Companions, ſtudies, pleaſures, modes of buſineſs, proſpects, and ſituations with reſpect to town, and country, or to different countries, that are <hi>new,</hi> all exert an invigorating influence upon health and life.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The love of fame acts in various ways; but its ſtimulus is moſt ſenſible and durable in military life. It counteracts in many inſtances the debilitat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing effects of hunger, cold and labor. It has ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times done more, by removing the weakneſs which is connected with many diſeaſes. In ſeveral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances it has aſſiſted the hardſhips of a camp life, in curing pulmonary conſumption.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The love of country is a deep ſeated principle of action in the human breaſt. Its ſtimulus is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo exceſſive, as to induce diſeaſe in perſons who recently migrate, and ſettle in foreign coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.—It appears in various forms; but exiſts moſt frequently in the ſolicitude, labors, attachments, and hatred of party ſpirit. All theſe act forcibly in ſupporting animal life. It is becauſe newspapers are ſuppoſed to contain the meaſure of the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or miſery of our country, that they are ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting to all claſſes of people. Thoſe vehicles of intelligence, and of public pleaſure or pain, are
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:036255_0073_1008667CC680D350"/>
frequently deſired with the impatience of a meal, and they often produce the ſame ſtimulating effects upon the body.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The different religions of the world, by the activity they excite in the mind, have a ſenſible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon human life. Atheiſm is the worſt of ſedatives to the underſtanding, and paſſions. It is the abſtraction of thought from the moſt ſublime, and of love, from the moſt perfect of all poſſible objects. Man is as naturally a religious, as he is a ſocial, and domeſtic animal; and the ſame violence is done to his mental faculties, by robbing him of a belief in a God, that is done, by dooming him to live in a cell, deprived of the objects and pleaſures of ſocial and domeſtic life. The neceſſary and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable connection between the texture of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man mind, and the worſhip of an object of ſome kind, has lately been demonſtrated by the atheiſts of Europe, who after rejecting the true God, have inſtituted the worſhip of nature, of fortune, and of human reaſon; and in ſome inſtances, with cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the moſt expenſive and ſplendid kind. Religions are friendly to animal life, in proportion as they elevate the underſtanding, and act upon the paſſions of hope and love. It will readily occur to you, that Chriſtianity when believed, and obeyed, according to its original conſiſtency with itſelf, and
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:036255_0074_1008667F0B84C6B8"/>
with the divine attributes, is more calculated to produce thoſe effects, than any other religion in the world.—Such is the ſalutary operation of its doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, and precepts upon health and life, that if its divine authority reſted upon no other argument, this alone would be ſufficient to recommend it to our belief. How long mankind may continue to prefer ſubſtituted purſuits and pleaſures, to this invigorating ſtimulus, is uncertain; but the time we are aſſured will come, when the underſtanding ſhall be elevated from its preſent inferior objects, and the luxated paſſions be reduced to their origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal order.—This change in the mind of man, I believe, will be effected only by the influence of the Chriſtian religion, after all the efforts of human rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to produce it, by means of civilization, philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, liberty, and government, have been exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to no purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Thus far, gentlemen, we have conſidered animal life as it reſpects the human ſpecies; but the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples I am endeavouring to eſtabliſh, require that we ſhould take a view of it in animals of every ſpecies, in all of which we ſhall find it depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame cauſes, as in the human body.</p>
               <p>And here I ſhall begin by remarking, that if we ſhould diſcover the ſtimuli which ſupport life in
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:036255_0075_100866808E7D59C0"/>
certain animals, to be fewer in number, or weaker in force than thoſe which ſupport it in our ſpecies; we muſt reſolve it into that attribute of the Deity which ſeems to have delighted in variety in all his works.</p>
               <p>The following obſervations apply more or leſs, to all the animals upon our globe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They all poſſeſs either hearts, lungs, brains, nerves, or muſcular fibres. It is as yet a contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy among naturaliſts whether animal life can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt without a brain; but no one has denied, muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular fibres, and of courſe contractility, or excita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to belong to animal life in all its ſhapes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They all require more or leſs air for their exiſtence. Even the ſnail inhales it for ſeven months under ground, through a pellicle which it weaves out of ſlime, as a covering for its body. If this pellicle at any time become too thick to admit the air; the ſnail opens a paſſage in it for that purpoſe. Now air we know acts powerfully in ſupporting animal life.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Many of them poſſeſs heat equal to that of the human body. Birds poſſeſs ſeveral degrees beyond it. Now heat, it was ſaid formerly, acts with great force, in the production of animal life.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="70" facs="unknown:036255_0076_10086682DF704760"/>
4. They all feed upon ſubſtances more or leſs ſtimulating to their bodies. Even water itſelf, che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtry has taught us, affords an aliment not only ſtimulating, but nouriſhing to many animals.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Many of them poſſeſs ſenſes, more acute and excitable, than the ſame organs in the human ſpecies. Theſe expoſe ſurfaces for the action of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal impreſſions, that ſupply the abſence, or defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of mental faculties.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Such of them as are devoid of ſenſibility, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs an uncommon portion of contractility, or ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple excitability. This is moſt evident in the Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus. When cut to pieces, it appears to feel little or no pain.</p>
               <p n="7">7. They all poſſeſs locomotive powers in a greater or leſs degree, and of courſe are acted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the ſtimulus of muſcular motion.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Moſt of them appear to feel a ſtimulus, from the gratification of their appetites for food, and for venereal pleaſures, far more powerful than that which is felt by our ſpecies from the ſame cauſes. I ſhall hereafter mention ſome facts from Spalanzani upon the ſubject of generation, that will prove the ſtimulus, from venery, to be ſtrongeſt in
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:036255_0077_10086686346B47F0"/>
thoſe animals, in which other ſtimuli act with the leaſt force. Thus the male frog during its long connection with its female, ſuffers its limbs to be amputated, without diſcovering the leaſt mark of pain, and without relaxing its hold of the object of its embraces.</p>
               <p n="9">9. In many animals we behold evident marks of underſtanding, and paſſion. The elephant, the fox and the ant, exhibit ſtrong proofs of thought<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and where is the ſchool boy that cannot bear teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to the anger of the bee, and the waſp?</p>
               <p n="10">10. But what ſhall we ſay of thoſe animals, which paſs long winters in a ſtate in which there is an apparent abſence of the ſtimuli of heat, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and the motion of the blood. Life in theſe animals is probably ſupported,</p>
               <p n="1">1. By ſuch an accumulation of excitability, as to yield to impreſſions, which to us are impercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By the ſtimulus of aliment in a ſtate of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion in the ſtomach, or by the ſtimulus of ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment reſtrained from digeſtion by means of cold; for Mr. John Hunter has proved by an experiment
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:036255_0078_10086688A4E20440"/>
on a frog, that cold below a certain degree, checks that animal proceſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By the conſtant action of air upon their bodies.</p>
               <p>It is poſſible life may exiſt in theſe animals, during their hybernation, in the total abſence of impreſſion and motion of every kind. This may be the caſe where the torpor from cold, has been <hi>ſuddenly</hi> brought upon their bodies. Excitability here, is in an accumulated, but quieſcent ſtate.</p>
               <p n="11">11. It remains only under this head to inquire; in what manner is life ſupported in thoſe animals which live in a cold element, and whoſe blood is ſometimes but a little above the freezing point? It will be a ſufficient anſwer to this queſtion to remark, that heat and cold are relative terms, and that different animals according to their organiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, require very different degrees of heat for their exiſtence. Thirty-two degrees of it are probably as ſtimulating to ſome of theſe cold blooded animals (as they are called) as 70°, or 80° are to the human body.</p>
               <p>It might afford additional ſupport to the doctrine of animal life, which I have delivered, to point
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:036255_0079_1008668A287F3BB8"/>
out the manner in which life and growth are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in vegetables of all kinds. But this ſubject belongs to the profeſſor of botany, and natural hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Barton.</note> who is amply qualified to do it juſtice. I ſhall only remark, that vegetable life is as much the offspring of ſtimuli as animal, and that ſkill in agriculture conſiſts chiefly in the proper applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them. The ſeed of a plant, like an ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal body, has no principle of life within itſelf. If preſerved for years in a drawer, or in earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſtimulating influence of heat, air and water, it diſcovers no ſign of vegetation. It grows, like an animal, only in conſequence of ſtimuli acting upon its <hi>capacity</hi> of life.</p>
               <p>From a review of what has been ſaid of animal life in all its numerous forms and modifications; we ſee that it is as much an effect of impreſſions upon a peculiar ſpecies of matter, as ſound is of the ſtroke of a hammer upon a bell, or muſic, of the motion of the bow upon the ſtrings of a violin. I exclude therefore the intelligent princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Whytt, the medical mind of Stahl, the healing powers of Cullen, and the vital principle of John Hunter, as much from the body, as I do an intelligent principle from air, fire, and water.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="unknown:036255_0080_1008396F38540370"/>
It is no uncommon thing for the ſimplicity of cauſes, to be loſt in the magnitude of their effects. By contemplating the wonderful functions of life, we have ſtrangely overlooked the numerous and obſcure circumſtances which produce it. Thus the humble but true origin of power in the people, is often forgotten in the ſplendor and pride of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments. It is not neceſſary to be acquainted with the preciſe nature of that form of matter, which is capable of producing life, from impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made upon it. It is ſufficient for our purpoſe, to know the fact. It is immaterial moreover whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this matter derive its power of being acted upon wholly from the brain, or whether it be in part inherent in animal fibres. The inferences are the ſame in favour of life being the effect of ſtimuli, and of its being as truly mechanical, as the movements of a clock from the preſſure of its weights, or the paſſage of a ſhip in the water, from the impulſe of winds, and tide.</p>
               <p>The infinity of effects from ſimilar cauſes, has often been taken notice of in the works of the Creator. It would ſeem as if they had all been made after one pattern. The late diſcovery of the cauſe of combuſtion, has thrown great light upon our ſubject. Wood and coal are no longer believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to contain a principle of fire. The heat and
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:036255_0081_10086690C5434270"/>
flame they emit, are derived from an agent alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether external to them. They are produced by a matter which is abſorbed from the air, by means of its decompoſition. This matter acts upon the prediſpoſition of the fuel to receive it, in the ſame way that ſtimuli act upon the human body. The two agents differ only in their effects. The former produces the deſtruction of the bodies upon which it acts; while the latter excite the more gentle, and durable motions of life. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon language in expreſſing theſe effects is correct, as far as it relates to their cauſe. We ſpeak of a coal of fire being <hi>alive,</hi> and of the <hi>flame</hi> of life.</p>
               <p>The cauſes of life which I have delivered, will receive conſiderable ſupport, by contraſting them with the cauſes of death. This cataſtrophe of the body conſiſts in ſuch a change induced on it by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, or old age, as to prevent its exhibiting the phaenomena of life. It is brought on,</p>
               <p n="1">1. By the abſtraction of all the ſtimuli which ſupport life. Death, from this cauſe, is produced by the ſame mechanical means that the emiſſion of ſound from a violin is prevented by the abſtraction of the bow from its ſtrings.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By the exceſſive force of ſtimuli of all kinds. No more occurs here than happens from too much
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:036255_0082_1008669248B850A8"/>
preſſure upon the ſtrings of a violin preventing its emitting muſical tones.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By too much relaxation, or too weak a texture of the matter which compoſes the human body. No more occurs here than is obſerved in the extinction of ſound by the total relaxation, or ſlender combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the ſtrings of a violin.</p>
               <p n="4">4. By an error in the place of certain fluid, or ſolid parts of the body. No more occurs here, than would happen from fixing the ſtrings of a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin upon its body, inſtead of elevating them upon its bridge.</p>
               <p n="5">5. By the action of poiſonous exhalations, or of certain fluids vitiated in the body, upon parts which emit moſt forcibly the motions of life. No more happens here than occurs from enveloping the ſtrings of a violin in a piece of wax.</p>

7. Death is produced by a preternatural rigidity, and in ſome inſtances by an oſſification of the ſolid parts of the body in old age; in conſequence of which they are incapable of receiving and emitting the motions of life. No more occurs here, than would happen if a ſtick, or pipe-ſtem were placed in the room of catgut, upon the bridges of the violin. But death may take place in old age with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a change in the texture of animal matter, from the ſtimuli of life loſing their effect by repetition, juſt as opium from the ſame cauſe, ceaſes to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce its uſual effects upon the body.</p>
               <p>Should it be aſked, what is that peculiar organi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation of matter, which enables it to emit life, when acted upon by ſtimuli, I anſwer, I do not know. The great Creator has kindly eſtabliſhed a witneſs of his unſearchable wiſdom in every part of his works, in order to prevent our forgetting him, in the ſucceſsful exerciſes of our reaſon. Mohammed once ſaid "that he ſhould believe himſelf to be a God, if he could bring down rain from the clouds, or give life to an animal." It belongs excluſively to the true God to endow matter with thoſe ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar properties, which enable it under certain circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, to exhibit the appearances of life.</p>

I cannot conclude this ſubject, without taking notice of its extenſive application to medicine, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphyſics, theology and morals.</p>
               <p>The doctrine of animal life which has been taught, exhibits in the</p>
               <p>Firſt place, a new view of the nervous ſyſtem, by diſcovering its origin in the extremities of the nerves on which impreſſions are made, and its termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in the brain. This idea is extended in an ingenious manner by Mr. Valli in his treatiſe upon animal electricity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It diſcovers to us the true means of promoting health and longevity, by proportioning the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and force of ſtimuli to the age, climate, ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, habits and temperament of the human body.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It leads us to a knowledge of the cauſes of all diſeaſes. Theſe conſiſt in exceſſive, or preternatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral excitement in the whole, or a part of the human body, accompanied <hi>generally</hi> with irregular motions, and induced by natural, or artificial ſtimuli. The latter have been called very properly by Mr. Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>irritants.</hi> The occaſional abſence of motion in acute diſeaſes, is the effect only of the exceſs of impetus in their remote cauſes.</p>

4. It diſcovers to us that the cure of all diſeaſes depends ſimply upon the abſtraction of ſtimuli from the whole, or from a part of the body, when the motions excited by them, are in exceſs; and in the increaſe of their number and force, when motions are of a moderate nature. For the former pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, we employ a claſs of medicines known by the name of ſedatives. For the latter, we make uſe of ſtimulants. Under theſe two extenſive heads, are included all the numerous articles of the Materia Medica.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It enables us to reject the doctrine of innate ideas, and to aſcribe all our knowledge of ſenſible objects to impreſſions acting upon an <hi>innate</hi> capacity to receive ideas. Were it poſſible for a child to grow up to manhood without the uſe of any of its ſenſes, it would not poſſeſs a ſingle idea of a mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial object; and as all human knowledge is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of ſimple ideas, this perſon would be as deſtitute of knowledge of every kind, as the groſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt portion of vegetable, or foſſil matter.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The account which has been given of animal life, furniſhes a ſtriking illuſtration of the origin of human actions, by the impreſſion of motives upon the will. As well might we admit an inherent principle of life in animal matter, as a ſelf deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:036255_0086_1008669BD12D1C28"/>
power in this faculty of the mind. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives are neceſſary not only to conſtitute its <hi>free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> but its <hi>eſſence;</hi> for without them, there could be no more a will than there could be viſion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out light, or hearing without ſound. It is true, they are often ſo obſcure as not to be perceived; and they ſometimes become inſenſible from habit, but the ſame things have been remarked in the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of ſtimuli; and yet we do not upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count deny their agency in producing animal life. In thus deciding in favor of the neceſſity of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, to produce actions, I cannot help bearing a teſtimony againſt the gloomy miſapplication of this doctrine by ſome modern writers. When proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtood, it is calculated to produce the moſt comfortable views of the divine government, and the moſt beneficial effects upon morals, and human happineſs.</p>
               <p n="7">7. There are errors of an impious nature, which ſometimes obtain a currency, from being diſguiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by innocent names. The doctrine of animal life that has been delivered, is directly oppoſed to an error of this kind, which has had the moſt bane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful influence upon morals and religion. To ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a principle to reſide neceſſarily, and conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the human body, which acted independently of external circumſtances, is to aſcribe to it an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute,
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:036255_0087_1008669D52F98370"/>
which I ſhall not connect, even in lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, with the creature man. Self exiſtence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs only to God.</p>
               <p>The beſt criterion of the truth of a philoſophical opinion, is its tendency to produce exalted ideas, of the Divine Being, and humble views of ourſelves. The doctrine of animal life which has been deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, is calculated to produce theſe effects in an eminent degree, for</p>
               <p n="8">8. It does homage to the Supreme Being, as the governor of the univerſe, and eſtabliſhes the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his univerſal, and particular providence. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a principle of life in the human body, and we open a door for the reſtoration of the old Epicure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an or atheiſtical philoſophy, which ſuppoſed the world to be governed by a principle called na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and which was believed to be inherent in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry kind of matter. The doctrine I have taught, cuts the ſinews of this error; for by rendering the <hi>continuance</hi> of animal life, no leſs than its commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the effect of the conſtant operation of divine power and goodneſs, it leads us to believe that the whole creation is ſupported in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>

9. The view that has been given of the depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſtate of man for the bleſſing of life, leads us to contemplate with very appoſite and inexpreſſible feelings, the ſublime idea which is given of the Deity in the ſcriptures, as poſſeſſing life "within himſelf." This divine prerogative has never been imparted but to one being, and that is, the Son of God. This appears from the following declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. "For as the Father hath life in himſelf, ſo hath he given to the Son to have life <hi>within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf."</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">John v. verſe 26.</note> To this plenitude of independent life, we are to aſcribe his being called the "life of the world," "the prince of life," and "life" itſelf, in the New Teſtament. Theſe divine epithets which are very properly, founded upon the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of our Saviour's exiſtence, exalt him infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly above ſimple humanity, and eſtabliſh his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature upon the baſis of reaſon, as well as revelation.</p>
               <p n="10">10. We have heard that ſome of the ſtimuli which produce animal life, are derived from the moral, and phyſical evils of our world. From be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding theſe inſtruments of death thus converted by divine ſkill into the means of life, we are led to believe goodneſs to be the ſupreme attribute of the
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:036255_0089_100866A33B282A40"/>
Deity, and that it will appear finally to predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in all his works.</p>
               <p n="11">11. The doctrine which has been delivered, is calculated to humble the pride of man; by teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him his conſtant dependence upon his Maker for his exiſtence, and that he has no pre-eminence in his tenure of it, over the meaneſt inſect that flutters in the air, or the humbleſt plant that grows upon the earth. What an inſpired writer ſays of the innumerable animals which inhabit the ocean, may with equal propriety be ſaid of the whole hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man race. "Thou ſendeſt forth thy ſpirit, and they are created. Thou takeſt away their breath—they die, and return to their duſt."</p>
               <p n="12">12. Melancholy indeed would have been the iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue of all our inquiries, did we take a final leave of the human body in its ſtate of decompoſition in the grave. Revelation furniſhes us with an elevating, and comfortable aſſurance that this will not be the caſe. The preciſe manner of its re-organization, and the new means of its future exiſtence, are unknown to us. It is ſufficient to believe, the event will take place, and that after it, the ſoul and body of man will be exalted in one reſpect, to an equality with their Creator. They will be immortal.</p>
