            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Surely there is a Difference even in this Life between thoſe that ſerve the LORD and thoſe that ſerve him not. All other Places of the Colony ſeem to be like <hi>Egypt,</hi> where was Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but <hi>Ebenezer,</hi> like the Land of <hi>Goſhen,</hi> wherein was great Light. For near four Miles did I walk in almoſt one continued Field with a moſt plentiful Crop of Corn, Peaſe, Potatoes, &amp;c. growing upon it; all the Produce of a few Months Labour—But GOD gives the Labourers a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Bleſſing: They are unanimous; the Weak help the Strong, and all ſeem hearty for the common

Good. In a few Years the <hi>Saltzburghers</hi> I believe will be a flouriſhing People. Their Land is tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable good, and lies very near the River. They already provide Food, and e're long will be capable of providing Raiment for themſelves. I ſhall ſend 'em up Cotton, and Spinning-Wheels, and a Loom to begin a Manufactory; and next Year I hope their own Land will produce enough Flax, Cotton &amp;c. to carry it on. I had ſweet Communion with their Miniſters—Our Siſter, or Orphan-Houſe there, is bleſſed by their Means; and yeſterday was ſet apart as a Day of Thankſgiving, for ſome Aſſiſtances lately ſent the dear Lambs from <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> and <hi>Savannah</hi>—The People ſeem very grateful. They willingly received me into their little, but cleanly Huts, and ſeemed proud when I would accept any Thing from their Hands. Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be God, certainly ſome Bleſſings are in Store for <hi>Georgia;</hi> as I ſaid formerly, ſo I ſay again, they who help the <hi>Saltzburghers</hi> will do a good Work; they want Aſſiſtance. <hi>LORD, raiſe them up Benefactors for thy Mercies ſake.</hi>

                  <hi>Monday, June</hi> 30. For theſe ten Days laſt paſt have had frequent Communications from above, both by Way of Humiliation and Exaltation. God has often been pleaſed ſince my Return to make himſelf known in our Sanctuary, and cauſed a mighty Power to attend the Word preached both in publick and private. I have been much refreſh'd with a Packet of Letters from Engliſh Friends.—Providence ſeems to ſmile upon the Orphan-Houſe and to proſper every Thing that I take in Hand. A wealthy, moral, civilized Planter of <hi>South-Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina</hi> came lately to ſee us, and God I believe has been pleaſed to give him a true Knowledge of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and a true Faith in his dear SON JESUS CHRIST.—His Wife alſo was much quickn'd, having been wrought upon by God ſome time laſt Winter; ſhe was a great Admirer of Archbiſhop <hi>Tillotſon,</hi> but having her Eyes now opened to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern ſpiritual Things, can no longer take up with ſuch Huſks, fit only for carnal, unawakened, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing Reaſoners to eat. With this happy Pair (hearing both by Letters, and otherwiſe that <hi>Charles-Town</hi> People were in great Expectation of ſeeing me before I went to the Northward, and that God had been pleaſed to Work by my late Miniſtry among them) I and a dear Friend left <hi>Savannah</hi> this Morning, in a large Boat, built up one another in the Way, arrived at <hi>Beaufort</hi> in <hi>Port-Royal</hi> about Midnight. Our Friend and his Wife went to a Relation's Houſe, but my Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and I choſe to continue in the Boat, where our Lord was pleaſed to cauſe us to lye down and ſleep in Peace and Safety. <hi>Bleſſed, forever bleſſed

Never I believe was ſuch a Preparation-Sermon preach'd before. I could not help thinking the Preacher was of the ſame Spirit with Biſhop <hi>Gardner</hi> in Queen <hi>Mary'</hi>s Days. After Sermon he ſent his Clerk to deſire me not to come to the Sacrament, till he had ſpoke with me—I immediately retired to my Lodging, rejoicing that I was accounted worthy to ſuffer this further Degree of Contempt for my dear Lord's Sake. <hi>Bleſſed Jeſus lay it not to the Commiſſary's Charge.</hi> Amen and Amen</p>

                  <hi>Wedneſday, July</hi> 9. Found myſelf ſtill weaker than before, but was ſtrengthned to preach under a Tree near Mr. <hi>Chanler'</hi>s Meeting-Houſe about 10 in the Morning. The Houſe being now too ſmall to contain the Congregation, People ſeemed to come from all Parts, and the Word, (as I was told) came with a convincing Power—Having changed my Linnen, which I am obliged to do after every Sermon by Reaſon of my prodigious Sweating, I haſtened away for <hi>Charles-Town,</hi> but my Body was ſo exceeding weak and the Sun ſhone ſo intenſely hot, that five Miles before I reached Town, I call'd in at a publick Houſe, and lay for a conſiderable Time, almoſt breathleſs and dead, but God poured ineffable Comforts into my Soul, and being thereby ſtrengthned in the inner Man, I once more ſet forward with my dear Fellow-Travellers, reach'd Town about four and preach'd about ſix at the uſual Place, and with much more Freedom and Power, then could any Ways be expected, conſidering the great Weakneſs of my Body: <hi>I can do all Things, thro' Chriſt ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me; I thank thee holy Father Lord of Heaven and Earth, that I have ſo often the Sentence of Death within myſelf Oh!

                  <hi>Saturday, July</hi> 12. Went over the Water on Thurſday, read Prayers and preach'd at the Requeſt of the Church. Wardens, Veſtry, at Chriſt's Church.
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:004848_0006_100E0196383A1AA0"/>
Returned in the Evening to <hi>Charles-Town,</hi> preach'd twice there Yeſterday, and went this Morning to <hi>John's-Iſland,</hi> about 20 Miles up the River, whither I was invited by Colonel <hi>Gibs;</hi> he receiv'd me and my Friends moſt hoſpitably, provided ſeveral Horſes, Chairs, &amp;c. for us, and his Family: We rode very pleaſantly to the Church—There was a great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation; God ſtrengthned me to read Prayers; and preach'd twice with much Freedom. About four we returned to the Colonel's—I eat with ſome Appetite—Was enabled to give a warm and cloſe Exhortation to the Rich that ſat about me, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Charles-Town</hi> in the Evening with my dear Friends, praiſing and bleſſing God. Glory be to his moſt holy Name, Dagon ſeems daily to fall before the Ark. A laſting Impreſſion I am perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is made on many Hearts, and God I believe will yet ſhew that he hath much People in <hi>Charles-Town</hi> and the Countries round about. <hi>Lord thou haſt viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them with thy Judgments, melt them down now with thy Mercies. Stretch out the golden Scepter of thy Favour, and bruiſe them no more with thy Iron Rods; even ſo Lord Jeſus.</hi> Amen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sunday, July</hi> 13. Preach'd this Morning with much Power, and collected in the Evening for my poor Orphans; great Numbers ſtood without the Doors, and it raining very hard in Time of divine Service, many of 'em were driven away; however God cauſed the other People's Hearts to deviſe liberal Things. Upwards of 50. <hi>l.</hi> Sterl. were col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected on the Occaſion; moſt ſhewed a great Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs to aſſiſt me, and the Lord was pleaſed much to enlarge my Heart, to give Praiſe unto his Name.
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:004848_0007_100E0198070E7138"/>
In the Morning I went to Church, and heard the Commiſſary preach. But had ſome infernal Spirit been ſent to draw my Picture, I think it ſcarcely poſſible he could paint me in more horrid Colours. I think if ever, then was the Time that all manner of Evil was ſpoke againſt me falſly for Chriſt's ſake; The Commiſſary ſeem'd to ranſack Church-Hiſtory for Inſtances of Enthuſiaſm and abuſed Grace; he drew a Parallel between me, and all the <hi>Oliverians,</hi> Ranters, Quakers, French Prophets, till he came down to a Family of the <hi>Dutarts</hi> who lived (not many Years ago) in <hi>South-Carolina,</hi> and were guilty of the moſt notorious Inceſts, and Murders. To the Honour of God's free Grace be it ſpoken, whilſt he was repreſenting me thus, I felt the bleſſed Spirit ſtrengthning and refreſhing my Soul, God at the ſame Time gave me to ſee what I was by Nature, how I had deſerved his eternal Wrath, and therefore I did not feel the leaſt Reſentment againſt the Preacher; no, I pitied, I prayed for him, and wiſh'd from my Soul, that the Lord would convert him, as he did once the Perſecutor <hi>Saul,</hi> and let him know, that 'tis Jeſus whom he perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutes. In the Evening many came as I was inform'd, to hear what I would ſay, but as the Commiſſary hinted that his Sermons ſhou'd be printed, and as they were full of invidious Falſhoods, I held my Tongue, and made little or no Reply. <hi>Father forgive him for he knows not what he does.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Saturday, July</hi> 19. Preach'd all this Week twice every Day at <hi>Charles-Town,</hi> except on Wedneſday and Thurſday Evening, the laſt of which Days I was call'd upon to appear in Court, on the former,

was deſired to go to <hi>James'</hi>s <hi>Iſland</hi> to preach at the Houſe of one Madam <hi>Woodward.</hi> This Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, as ſhe inform'd me her ſelf, was once much prejudiced againſt me, in ſo much, that ſhe tho't it dangerous to come and hear me—But ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving read my Sermons, ſhe changed her Mind; and coming both to Town and <hi>John'</hi>s <hi>Iſland</hi> to hear me preach, was with her Daughter, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gentlewoman much melted down—Being given to Hoſpitality, ſhe provided Food ſufficient for a great Multitude.

After Sermon, God ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled me to ſpeak many Goſpel Truths amidſt a polite Set of People, and at the Requeſt of Madam <hi>Woodward</hi> I ſtaid all Night; this gave me an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of teaching her Family the Way of God more perfectly, and alſo of reſting my weary Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which ſeems to be declining more and more every Day. <hi>Bleſſed be God, if it be conſiſtent with his Glory, and the Good of Souls, I hope it will not be long e're Worms deſtroy it, and my Soul carried to ſee my God.</hi>

                  <hi>Tueſday, July</hi> 15. I appeared according to the Citation, at the appointed Hour and Place; there were very many Spectators, and the Rev. Mr. <hi>Garden,</hi> Commiſſary, the Rev. Mr. <hi>Guy,</hi> the Rev. Mr. <hi>Millichamp,</hi> the Rev. Mr. <hi>Roe,</hi> the Rev. Mr. <hi>Orr,</hi> ſat as Judges, they receiv'd me with good Manners, and after the Clerk of the Court had taken a Minute of their appearing, the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary tender'd to me a Paper, deſiring my Anſwer to thoſe Articles; but I refus'd taking it, till I was ſatisfied of the Authority of the Court in Queſtion, adding, Do you think I would incur a a Premunire of doing what I could not anſwer, or Words to that Effect? He then ſaid they would proceed to cenſure: Upon which I reminded them of the Example of the Magiſtrates, who exceeded
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:004848_0009_100E019BFAAC14A0"/>
their Authority, in condemning and ſcourging St. <hi>Paul,</hi> being a Roman, unheard: At this one of the Clergy ſneer'd; but the Commiſſary replied, We ſhall not go beyond our Power, or ſcourge you. After a ſhort Debate, the Commiſſary ſent his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritor to his Houſe for his Commiſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>n in order to give me Satisfaction; in about a quarter of an Hour he returned with ſeveral Bundles of Papers, out of which the Commiſſary firſt produced his Commiſſion, to act as Commiſſary, from the Biſhop of <hi>London;</hi> I read it, and approv'd of it; but at the ſame Time deſired to be ſatisfied of the Biſhop of <hi>London'</hi>s Authority in this Province, not finding the Royal Authority underwritten, as men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in his publick Citation: Upon this a Latin Commiſſion without a Seal, was ordered to be read by the Clerk of the Court.—I objected that it was in Latin, contrary to our late Act, ordering every Thing to be in Engliſh; and not well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Clerk, as he read it, I deſired the Peruſal of it my ſelf, which was granted. I read it with an audible Voice, and after reading it, I objected, that though there might be a general Power given to the Biſhop to exerciſe eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction in this Province, yet the Extent of that Power was to be determined by particular Acts of Aſſembly. I further urged, that a Court of this Nature was entirely unprecedented in <hi>America,</hi> that I belonged to <hi>Georgia,</hi> a different Province, and was here only as an Itenerate. I alſo added, that my Lord of <hi>London,</hi> (though I preached in the Fields for ſome Months) never attempted to exerciſe ſuch Authority againſt me. The Commiſſary replied, Though I
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:004848_0009_100E019BFAAC14A0"/>
belonged to <hi>Georgia,</hi> yet I had committed Irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities here, and therefore came under his Cognizance, and that what he had to lay to my Charge, might be Crimes of a different Nature.</p>
               <p>Not ſatisfied with my Objections, he ordered the Clerk to minute down that I contumaciouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned the Authority of the Court, but I deſired that Expreſſion might be ſoftned, declaring from my Heart that what I did, proceeded from a real Scruple con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their Authority, urging the Example of King <hi>Charles,</hi> who, before he made Anſwer to his Accusers, inſiſted on knowing the Authority his Judges had to call him to an Account. I further objected that the Commiſſary in <hi>Maryland</hi> &amp; <hi>Penſylvania</hi> were mere Cyphers—That the Truſtees to my Knowledge queſtioned the Biſhop of <hi>London'</hi>s having any Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction in theſe Parts, and that the Governour of <hi>Maryland</hi> acting as Ordinary, had ſummoned his Clergy lately to meet him as ſuch, which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly they did: I therefore upon the whole humbly deſired as a Favour from the Court, that I might have till To-morrow 9 o'Clock, the Time to which the Court was adjourned, to inform my ſelf of the Extent of their eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction in this Province, aſſuring them that upon finding their Authority valid, I would immediately anſwer to any Interrogatories, and would be ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any Sentence they could with Juſtice paſs upon me—Tho' at my firſt aſking, he ſaid, he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged me too far already, yet after ſome Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, Mr. Commiſſary ordered the Clerk to raſe out the former Minute, and to record that upon
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:004848_0010_100E019F05F6CB60"/>
my ſcrupling the Authority of the Court, I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged my Requeſt.</p>
               <p>Our Lord was pleaſed to fulfil his Promiſe made to thoſe that ſhould be called before Rulers, and Governours, for his Name Sake; my Soul was full of Peace; I pitied, but did not feel the leaſt Emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Reſentment againſt my Judges.—The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple behaved pretty quiet, but ſome broke out into a Laughter, ſomething irregular, when I ſaid the Commiſſary in <hi>Penſylvania</hi> and <hi>Maryland</hi> were but Cyphers. This I diſapproved of, and check'd immediately. After the Court was adjourned, and the Commiſſary roſe from his Seat I made my O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beiſance, and returned to my Lodgings, thinking my ſelf more highly honoured by my Lord this Morning, than in any other Part of my Life.—<hi>Lord ſtrengthen me in all my other impending Trials, for thy great Name's Sake,</hi> Amen and Amen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wedneſday, July</hi> 16. Appeared this Morning at the Hour of 10 and exhibited a <hi>Recuſatio Judicis,</hi> i. e. my Exception again the Commiſſary's being my Judge in this Cauſe, having too great Reaſon to believe him prejudiced againſt me.—At firſt the Commiſſary refuſed to read it, inſiſting to know firſt, whither I acknowledged the Authority of the Court.—unwarily I anſwer'd, Yes. But upon the Motion of my Advocate, Mr. <hi>Rutledge,</hi> I recalled my Words, and ſaid I admitted, and ſubmitted to an eccleſiaſtical Court, legally conſtituted. One of the Clergy on the Bench, would have inſiſted on my firſt Anſwer;—But I told him, it was mean ſpirited, and beneath a Court, conſiſting of thoſe that call themſelves Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, to
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:004848_0010_100E019F05F6CB60"/>
catch at an Expreſſion, which I immediately cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected.—Upon this the Bench agreed to alter the Minute agreeable to my laſt Declaration. The Commiſſary then took my Paper, read it to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſaid he would not accept of it. I then ſtood up according to Law, and ſaid, I would go and proteſt againſt all further Proceedings as null and void, and immediately left the Court; upon Mr. <hi>Rutledge</hi> his Advice, I return'd and declared that I appeared <hi>Apud Acta</hi> to the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> and then withdrew a ſecond Time.—We had not gone far from the Place of Judicature, but I was called back by the Apparitor and Regiſter, we returned, and at the Commiſſary's Deſire gave in my Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be read, and filed.</p>
               <p>By this Time Mr. Commiſſary had gotten one Mr. <hi>Graham</hi> an Attorney to appear in Behalf of the Court, who inſiſted on having the Merits of my Exceptions tried in Court, but as according to Law, I had referred them to the Examination of Six Arbitrators, Three nominated by me, and Three by the Commiſſary; Mr. <hi>Rutledge</hi> in my Behalf proteſted againſt all further Proceedings, and againſt my appearing at the next Court 'till my Reference to Arbitrators was complied with, it being quite improbable to imagine that Mr. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary, who muſt be judged, if my Exceptions ſhould be tried by that Court, ſhould allow him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf prejudiced. This <hi>Recuſatio Judicis</hi> I exhibited by the Advice of my Friends, not to quibble with, or evade the Force or Rigour of any Law what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, that I might juſtly fall under: For when the Articles of Impeachment were read, I found
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:004848_0011_100E01A1509BFBD0"/>
myſelf accuſed only of omitting to read the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayer in the Preſbyterian Meeting at ſuch Times as I preached there.—<hi>Oh that my Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries may never have any Thing worſe to lay to my Charge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Spectators were rather more numerous than Yeſterday; they behaved quietly, and were much rejoiced to ſee my Oppoſers reduced to ſuch a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma.—Well ſaid the Pſalmiſt, <hi>The Wrath of Man ſhall turn to thy Praiſe. Great God, the Remainder of it do thou reſtrain, and for thy own Names ſake deliver me from the Hands of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable Men, who out of a miſguided Zeal, and without a Cauſe are mine Enemies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thurſday, July</hi> 17. By Advice of Mr. <hi>Rut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> appeared in Court at the Time of their Meeting, to ſee if my Exceptions were admitted to Arbitration or repelled.—The Court being opened Mr. Commiſſary aſk'd me if I was prepared to anſwer the Articles objected againſt me. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, I could give no Anſwer till my Exceptions were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ferred to Arbitrators. Mr. <hi>Rutledge</hi> ſtood up, and ſpake ſome few Words in Vindication of my Objections, proving by a Book of eccleſiaſtical Law, that my Proceedings were according to the Rules therein preſcribed. The Regiſter was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to read their Reaſons for repelling my Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions; Mr. <hi>Graham</hi> endeavoured to enforce, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving firſt laboured to prove the Juriſdiction of the Court, and to remove the Apprehenſions the Country in general or Diſſenters in particular, might entertain concerning the ill Conſequences of ſuch a Court's being erected. He held on for a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable

Time without Interruption, but Mr. <hi>

                  <hi>Saturday, July</hi> 19. After Evening Meeting, was deſired by the Apparitor to come and wait on Mr. Commiſſary, who was ſitting in Court, I went. He deſired me to depoſite <hi>Ten Pounds</hi> Sterling and to ſwear, that I would lodge my Appeal within a Twelve-month. My Lawyer not being preſent my Friends were too ſollicitous for my Non-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance, but being to leave Town on Monday, and finding the Commiſſary's printed Orders gave him Authority to require it, I took the deſired Oath,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:004848_0012_100E01A34B907EB8"/>
promiſed to leave <hi>Ten Pounds</hi> in a Friend's Hands, but withal moved for a Copy of the Court's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, which was readily complied with.—The Court being ended, the Commiſſary deſired to ſpeak with me: I aſk'd him to go to my Lodgings. He choſe to walk in a Green near the Church: His Spirit was ſomething calmer than uſual, but after an Hour's Converſation, we were as far from agreeing as before. He charged me with ſpeaking Blaſphemy, for ſaying that if it was in my Power, I would place him at the Right Hand of GOD. Upon my deſiring to know wherein the Blaſphemy conſiſted, he replied,—<hi>Where then will you put</hi> CHRIST? I aſked him, why he was guilty of that Fault which he charged me with in accuſing the Methodiſts in general, when he only referred to Things wrote or done by me in particular. He anſwer'd becauſe we were all of one Mind he ſuppoſed.—When I queſtioned him, why he ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cul'd me for making Grimaces in the Pulpit—when he did not come to hear me,—Why ſays he, as I paſſed by one Day, I ſaw you ſpreading out your Hands.—I replied, did not <hi>Paul</hi> do ſo when he began to preach? In ſhort all his Diſcourſe was ſo inconſiſtent, and contrary to the Goſpel of our Lord, that I was obliged to tell him, that I believed him to be an unconverted Man, an Enemy to God, and of alike Spirit with the Perſecutor <hi>Soul.</hi>—At this he ſmiled, and after we had walked for a long while we parted, and God gave me great Satisfaction, that I had delivered my Soul in my private Converſation with the Commiſſary.—<hi>O

                  <hi>Sunday, July</hi> 20.—Preach'd this Morning as uſual, and went afterward to Church, to hear the Commiſſary. His Text was, <hi>Take heed how you hear.</hi> At firſt I thought we ſhould have a peaceable Sermon, eſpecially ſince we had convers'd before ſo amicably, but the Gall ſoon began to flow from his Tongue, tho' not with ſo much Bitterneſs, as the laſt Sunday.—He endeavoured to apologize for his Proceedings, condemned all that followed me, and gave all Hopes of Heaven, that adhered to him, and the Church. In the Evening (tho' I went off my Bed to do it, and was carried in a Chaiſe) the Lord Jeſus ſtrengthned me to take my laſt Farewel of the dear People of <hi>Charles-Town.</hi>—My Soul was full of Tenderneſs for them, and many ſeemed to ſympathize with me. Bleſſed be God for ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me once more among them, tho' the Heat of the Weather, and Frequency of preaching, has per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps given an irrecoverable Stroke to the Health of my Body, yet I rejoice, knowing it has been for the Conviction, and I believe Converſion of many a Soul. Glory be to God on high, the Fields here, as well as elſewhere are now white, ready unto Harveſt.—Numbers are ſeeking after Jeſus—And two or three gracious diſſenting Miniſters, by my Advice, agreed to ſet up a Weekly-Lecture. I adviſed the People, ſince the Goſpel was not preach'd in the Church, to go and hear it in the Meeting-Houſes.—May the Lord be with both Miniſters and People, &amp; cauſe them to preach, and hear as becomes the Goſpel of Chriſt, What makes the Change more
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:004848_0013_100E01A516186328"/>
remarkable in <hi>Charles-Town</hi> People, is, that they ſeemed to me at my firſt coming to be a People wholly devoted to Pleaſure.—One well acquainted with their Circumſtances, and Manners, told me more had been annually ſpent on polite Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, than the Poor's Rate came to, but now the Jewellers and Dancing-Maſters begin to cry out that their Craft is in Danger.—A vaſt Alteration is diſcernable in the Ladies Dreſs.—And ſome, whilſt I have been ſpeaking, have been ſo convinced of the Sin of wearing Jewels, that I have ſeen them with Bluſhes, put their Hands to their Ears, and cover them with their Fans.—But I hope the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation has went farther then Externals. Many moral good ſort of Men, who before were ſetled upon their Lees, have been gloriouſly awakened to ſeek after Jeſus Chriſt, and many a <hi>Lydia'</hi>s Heart hath the Lord opened to receive the Things that were ſpoken.</p>
               <p>Indeed the Word came often like a Hammer and a Fire,—And a Door, I believe, will be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for teaching the poor Negroes.—Several of them have done their uſual Work in a leſs Time, that they might come to hear me.—Many of their Owners who have been awakened, reſolve to teach them Chriſtianity. Had I Time, and proper School-maſters, I might immediately erect a Negro School in <hi>South-Carolina</hi> as well as <hi>Penſylvania;</hi> many would willingly contribute both Money and Land. Every Day almoſt ſomething or other was ſent for my Orphans at <hi>Georgia.</hi> The People were very ſolicitous about my Health when they ſaw me weak, ſent me many ſmall Preſents, and took

Care to ſee the Lawyer who pleaded for me: I feared ſometimes they would be too hot, but I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to ſtop their Reſentments againſt the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary as much as poſſible, and recommended Peace and Moderation to them in moſt of my Diſcourſes. <hi>May the Lord Jeſus reward them for all their Works of Faith and Labours which have proceeded of Love.

ſo ill that I would fain have perſwaded Mr. <hi>Tilly</hi> to preach for me; he peremptorily refuſed, urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that God wou'd ſtrengthen me if I begun.—Upon this I ſtood up, and ſoon found Power com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to me from above; I felt a ſweet mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in my Soul, and e're I had prayed long Mr. <hi>Bull</hi> dropped down as tho' ſhot with a Gun; he ſoon got up and ſat attentively to hear the Sermon, the Power ſoon ſpread abroad, the greateſt Part of the Congregation was under Concern;—Tears trickled down apace.

It was but ſeldom I could Officiate, but when I did, the Lord generally cauſed the Word to come with very great Power. This Morning I expounded early, as uſual, and read Part of the Prayers at 10 o'Clock, but got Mr. <hi>Tilly</hi> to preach, who tho' a Baptiſt Miniſter, joined with us in receiving the Sacrament in the Church of <hi>England</hi> Way; and the King was pleaſed to ſit at his Table; he bro't us into his Banqueting-Houſe, and cauſed it to be a Feaſt of fat Things to our Souls. Many I believe fed on Jeſus in their Hearts with Thankſgiving. After the Ordinance was over, the Lord enlarged my Heart, and I prayed as the Spirit gave me Ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance. I went home much refreſhed in Soul, but ſo weak in Body, that I declined going to publick Worſhip in the Afternoon. In the mean while, God gave me a freſh Supply of Strength; about the Evening when my Friends were ſitting down to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, finding the Power of the Lord come upon me, I began to ſpeak to them of the Things of God. A great Alteration was ſoon diſcernable in moſt of the Company, their Concern gradually increaſed, 'till many burſt into Floods of Tears, and one fell on the Ground. E'er I had done, ſome of my Pariſhioners came up, and the reſt of my Family,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:004848_0017_100E01AE08B969E8"/>
they alſo felt the divine Power. When I had done ſpeaking to them from God, I ſpoke for them in Prayer to God, my Soul was carried as it were out of the Body, and I was enabled mightily to wreſtle with our Lord in their Behalf. He did not let us go without a Bleſſing. The Room was filled with the Cries of thoſe around me, and many I believe at that Time ſought Jeſus ſorrowing. The Concern continued after the Duty was over. Several, were in great Agonies of Soul, and a <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roke</hi> Indian Trader, who providentially was preſent deſired to ſpeak with me, ſaying he never ſaw the like before. Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> alſo of <hi>Port-Royal</hi> who went away on Friday but was forced back and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiated for me the Afternoon at <hi>Savannah</hi> told a Friend, that ſurely God was with us. <hi>Bleſſed be his rich ſovereign and diſtinguiſhing Grace; Lord make me lowly in my own Eyes, and cauſe me ſtill to go on from conquering to conquer. Not unto me, not unto me, but unto thee my King and my God be all the Glory.</hi>

My Hearers both in publick and private, were vaſtly affected, and a ſtrange Woman was ſo touch'd, that ſhe came to me confeſſing her Sins and crying out, What ſhall I do to be ſaved? When I came to converſe with her, I found God had ſtruck her the laſt time I preach'd at <hi>Port-Royal,</hi> and I hope he will now call her effectually by his Grace.—Pleaſed, and I hope in ſome meaſure thankful to the Lord of all Lords, for ſetting ſuch Seals to my Miniſtry.

Juſt at Departure, about 10 at Night I went on Board our Sloop with my other dear Viſitors, in order to go to <hi>Charles-Town,</hi> where by the Advice of Friends the Captain is to take in Freight for <hi>Boſton,</hi> for the Benefit of the Orphan-Houſe. <hi>The Lord preſerve my dear Lambs and Flock in my Abſence, bring 'em into green Paſtures, and lead 'em beſide the Waters of Comfort!</hi>

                  <hi>Fryday, Auguſt</hi> 21. Had a comfortable Paſſage with my dear Friends, found the Sea Air improved my Health, and arrived ſafe at <hi>Charles-Town</hi> about 4 this Afternoon. Many came to the Wharf, and ſaluted me moſt kindly; I retired as ſoon as poſſible to my old Lodgings, and ſpent the Evening moſt ſweetly at the Houſe of Mr. <hi>Fowler,</hi> where I hope many true Diſciples of the bleſſed Jeſus were met together.—<hi>The Lord who once came to the Eleven by Night, and ſaid Peace be unto you, I am perſwaded by his Spirit, ſpoke to many of them, the Lord I believe has made a willing People in this Day of his Power, praiſed be his Name from the riſing up of the Sun, unto the going down of the ſame.</hi> Amen and Amen.</p>

                  <hi>Monday, Sept.</hi> I. Being but weak in Body, (except on Sundays) I have preached only once e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Day.—But I think with greater Power than ever, and with greater Succeſs: I ſcarce know the Time wherein I did not ſee a conſiderable melting in ſome Part or other of the Congregation, and often it ſpread over the whole. Several Times I was ſo weak before I begun to preach, that I tho't it almoſt impoſſible I ſhould go thro' half a Diſcourſe,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:004848_0018_100E01B07708BEC0"/>
but the Lord quickned, enlightned &amp; comforted me above Meaſure.—Out of Weakneſs I became ſtrong, and the Lord manifeſted himſelf in the Sanctuary.—The Audiences were more numerous than ever, and it was ſuppoſed not leſs than 4000 were in, and about the Meeting-Houſe when I preached my Farewell-Sermon.—The Commiſſary, having run his utmoſt length, thought it beſt to ſay no more himſelf.—But he employed one Mr.<hi>Rowe</hi> to preach for him, who told the People, that becauſe of their Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, God had ſent them ſtrong Deluſions that they might believe a Lie. Finding when I was here laſt that Jeſus Chriſt was not preached in the Church, my Conſcience, would not ſuffer me to attend on thoſe that preached there any more. I therefore went to the Baptiſt and Independent Meeting-Houſe, where Jeſus Chriſt I hope was preached in Sincerity.—I likewiſe adminiſtred the Sacrament thrice in a private Houſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Yeſterday was ſev'n-night, Yeſterday and this Morning,—Never did I ſee any Thing more ſolemn, the Room was large and moſt were diſſolved into Tears as tho' they were weeping at their Saviour's Croſs. Surely Jeſus Chriſt was evidently ſet forth before them; many, at their Requeſts ſtood by, that did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, but they wept bitterly; I prayed for them, and all with great Power, and I hope the Lord will cloath 'em with a Wedding-Garment: What was beſt, Baptiſts, Church-Folks, and Preſbyterians all joined together, and received according to the Church of <hi>England</hi> except two, who deſired to have it ſitting, I willingly complied, knowing it was a Thing quite indifferent.—Many others hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:004848_0019_100E01B282DE0A10"/>
how God was amongſt us Yeſterday, deſired I would adminiſter to them to Day.—I did, and our Lord was with us again. Having more Leiſure from my private Studies, by Reaſon my Weakneſs would not permit me to read much<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I had better Opportunities of converſing with and confirming thoſe that were under Convictions, moſt of 'em I found grown in Grace and their Hearts ſoftned by redeeming Love. Mr. <hi>Jonathan Bryan</hi> and Mr.<hi>Bull</hi> came to <hi>Charles-Town,</hi> I hope more eſtabliſhed.—Mr. <hi>Hugh Bryan,</hi> they left ſick at Home, drinking deeply of the Cup of God's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations.—His Wife came with them to <hi>Charles-Town,</hi> a gracious Woman. By my Advice they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned Home with a Reſolution to begin a Negro-School for their Slaves.—A young Stage-Player convinced, when I was laſt at <hi>New-York,</hi> and who providentially came to <hi>Georgia</hi> when M<hi>Jonathan Bryan</hi> was there, is to be their firſt Maſter, the Time would fail me, was I to deſcend to every Particular. Great, very great Alteration is made in the Life, and Manners of moſt of the polite Ladies; the Rooms that were uſually employed for Balls and Aſſemblies were now turned into So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety-Rooms.—Every Night where I was invited to Supper, it became cuſtomary to have the Houſe filled with Company, whom the Lord enabled me to pray with and exhort with great Power, but once I was ſo weak, that I was obliged to be led home: Many came to me in private under the deepeſt Convictions.—Several were eſteemed mad by their Relations. One young Lady in particular for ſome little Time was turned out of Doors, but
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:004848_0019_100E01B282DE0A10"/>
afterwards was recalled again. And one Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who was look'd upon as a very good Man, was convicted of his ſelf Righteouſneſs in an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Manner, and burnt near <hi>Forty Pounds</hi> worth of Books written by ſuch as <hi>Chub, Foſter,</hi> . The care which People expreſſed of my Health and Preſervation was uncommon, they were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſending me in ſomething or other; and ſo loaded our Sloop with Sea-ſtores, that I was obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to ſend part of them to the Orphan-Houſe. How this Work will end, I know not, at preſent there's a comfortable Proſpect that the Lord will gather to himſelf out of <hi>Charles-Town,</hi> a peculiar People zealous of good Works. Being to be abſent from them for a long Seaſon. I exhorted 'em with all my Power to continue in their Grace of God, I forewarned them of their Danger, and told them how they muſt deny themſelves and take up their daily Croſſes, if they wou'd follow Jeſus Chriſt. Having our Sloop freighted, and the Wind favouring us, after Dinner, with ſeveral <hi>Charles-Town</hi> Friends I embark'd for <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to go by Land from thence to <hi>Boſton;</hi> in the Evening we got over the Bar, but the Pilot would not take any Thing for his Trouble. Here I par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with all Friends, except four, two of which (God willing) intend to accompany me during this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion. <hi>Do thou O Lord who claſpeſt the Winds in thy Fiſts, and holdeſt the Waters in the hallow of thine Hand, accept our Thanks, for paſt Mercies.</hi>—<hi>Sanctify our Voyage, and if it be beſt carry us with ſpeed to the Haven where we would be.</hi> Amen and Amen.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sunday, Sept.</hi> 14. Was ſick Part of the Paſſage, but found afterwards the Sea-Air, under God, much improv'd my Health, arrived at <hi>Newport</hi> in <hi>Rhode Iſland,</hi> juſt after the Beginning of Evening Service; we came purpoſely thither firſt with our Sloop: I think it the moſt pleaſant Entrance I ever yet ſaw, almoſt all the Morning the Wind was contrary; but I found a very ſtrong Inclination to pray, that we might arrive time enough to be preſent at publick Worſhip. Once I called the People, but ſomething prevented their coming, at laſt finding my Impreſſion increaſe upon me, I deſired their Attendance immediately: They came with a ſtrong Aſſurance we ſhould be heard. We pray'd the Lord, that he might turn the Wind that we might give him Thanks in the great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and alſo that he would ſend ſuch to us as he would have us to converſe with, and who might ſhew us a Lodging.—Tho' the Wind was a Head, when we begun, yet when we had done praying and came up out of the Cabbin it was quite fair; with a gentle Gale we ſailed moſt pleaſantly into the Harbour, got into publick Worſhip before they had finiſhed the Pſalms, and ſat as I thought undiſcovered.—After Service was over, a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man aſked me whither my Name was not <hi>Whitefield,</hi> I told him yes; he then deſired me to go to his Houſe, and he would take Care to provide Lodgings and Neceſſaries for me, and my Friends. I went,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:004848_0020_100E01B4EE337FD8"/>
ſilently admiring God's Goodneſs in anſwering my Prayers, ſo minutely. Several Gentlemen of the Town ſoon came to pay their Reſpects to me, among whom, was one Mr. <hi>Clap,</hi> an aged diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miniſter, but the moſt venerable Man I ever ſaw in my Life, he looked like a good old Puritan, and gave me an Idea of what Stamp thoſe Men were who firſt ſettled <hi>New-England.</hi> His Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance was very heavenly,—he rejoiced much in Spirit at the Sight of me, and prayed moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately for a Bleſſing on my coming to <hi>Rhode-Iſland.</hi> In the Evening with him, and ſome more Friends, I waited on Mr. <hi>Honeyman,</hi> the Miniſter of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and deſired the Uſe of his Pulpit, at firſt he ſeemed a little unwilling, being deſirous to know what extraordinary Call I had to preach on Week-Days, which he ſaid was diſorderly; I anſwered, St. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorted <hi>Timothy</hi> to be <hi>inſtant in Seaſon, and out of Seaſon;</hi> that if the Orders of the Church were rightly complied with, our Miniſters ſhould read publick Prayers twice every Day, and then it would not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly, at ſuch Times, to give the People a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon: As to an extraordinary Call, I told him I claimed none but that Injunction of the Apoſtle; <hi>As we have Opportunity, let us do Good unto all Men.</hi> He ſtill held out, and did not give any poſitive Anſwer, but at laſt, after he had withdrawn, and conſulted with the Gentlemen, he ſaid if my preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing would promote the Glory of God, and the good of Souls, I was welcome to his Church as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as I would, during my Stay in Town; we then agreed to make uſe of it, at Ten in the Morning,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:004848_0021_100E01B7423DB718"/>
and Three in the Afternoon. After this I went and waited on the Governour, who ſeemed to be a very plain Man, and had a very plain Houſe, which much pleaſed me: By Profeſſion, I think he is a ſeventh Day Baptiſt; he is a Man of good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port as to his Conduct and dealing with the World. After a ſhort Viſit, I returned to take my Leave of Mr. <hi>Honeyman,</hi> and to fetch my Friends who were at his Houſe, waiting for me. We then went to the Houſe of Mr. <hi>Bowers,</hi> who firſt ſpake to me, when coming out of Church; the Houſe was ſoon filled with Company: I expounded and prayed with them for about an Hour, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to a Lodging, the Lord in his good Providence had provided for me; the bleſſed Jeſus was pleaſed ſweetly to manifeſt himſelf to my Soul: A Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of his diſtinguiſhing repeated Mercies quite melted me down, and I called upon all that was within me to praiſe his holy Name. <hi>O Lord, in the Night Seaſon, let me ariſe and give Thanks unto thee, and let my Talking be of thy Loving-kindneſs and tender Mercies all the Day long.</hi>

On Reading it, I could not but think, this was one of thoſe young Miniſters whom God had late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made uſe of in ſuch a remarkable Manner at the Eaſt-End of <hi>Long-Iſland.</hi> I ſent for him, and found he was the Man. My Heart rejoiced. We walked out, and took ſweet Counſel together, and amongſt other Things, he told me that he came to <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> under a full Conviction, that he ſhould ſee me there, and had been waiting for me eight Days; for he ſaid theſe Words were migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily impreſſed upon his Heart, <hi>Is not</hi> Aaron <hi>the</hi> Levite <hi>thy Brother? I know that he can ſpeak well; and alſo behold he cometh forth to meet thee, and when he ſeeth thee, he will be glad in his Heart; and I will be with thy Mouth, and with his Mouth, and will teach you what ye ſhall do.</hi> What render'd this more remarkable was, I had no intention of ſailing into <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> 'till about three Days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I left <hi>Carolina;</hi> and alſo, I had a great Deſire to put in, if I could, at the Eaſt-End of <hi>Long-Iſland,</hi> to ſee this very Perſon, whom the great God now brought unto me. <hi>Lord accept our Thanks, ſanctify our Meeting, and teach us both what we ſhall do for thy own Name Sake.</hi>

Perceived my ſelf a little low in the Morning, but was enabled to read Prayers, and preach with much Flame, Clearneſs and Power, to ſtill greater Auditories than Yeſterday; it being Aſſembly Time, the Gentlemen adjourned, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to attend the Service; and ſeveral Invitations were given me to come to other adjacent Places. The People were exceedingly attentive, Tears trickled down their Cheeks and ſo far prevailed with me by their Importunity, that by the divine Permiſſion, I promiſed to call on them in my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from <hi>Boſton.</hi> When I came home to my Lodgings, the Woman of the Houſe ſaluted me with <hi>Bleſſed art thou of the Lord.</hi> I looked round to ſee the Reaſon of ſuch a Salutation, and on the Couch there lay a young Woman; after a little Converſation, I found ſhe had had a gracious Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the Lord Jeſus made to her Soul when I was ſpeaking theſe Words, <hi>Come ſee a Man that told me all Things that ever I did.</hi> She ſaid, ſhe had often grieved the Spirit of God, but now ſhe believed the Lord was calling her home effectually.

is the laſt Day of the ſix Weeks, and Oh the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God in ſending you juſt now, before my Time was out; or Words to that Effect. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards one or two more came under deep Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, crying out, in the Bitterneſs of their Souls, after the Lord Jeſus.—I prayed with each of them, and exhorted 'em not to reſt till they found reſt in Jeſus Chriſt: In the Evening I went, as I thought privately to a Friends Houſe, but the People were ſo eager after the Word that in a ſhort Time I believe more then 1000 were before the Door beſides thoſe that were within, and filled every Room in the Houſe, I therefore ſtood upon the Threſhold and ſpoke for near an Hour on theſe Words, <hi>Bleſſed are they that hunger and thirſt after Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs for they ſhall be filled.</hi> Bleſſed be God it was a very ſolemn Meeting. Being Night, I could not ſee how the Hearers were affected, but the Lord aſſiſted me in ſpeaking. Glory be to his great Name. Before I retired to Bed, I went, and took my Leave of Mr. <hi>Honeyman,</hi> &amp; had ſome cloſe Talk with him about the New-Birth. The Lord give him an experimental Knowledge of it; he was very Civil, and would have had me ſtaid with him longer, but being to go on a Journey, on the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, after we had converſed about half an Hour, I took my Leave. At my Return to my Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, good old Mr. <hi>Clap</hi> went with me into a Room, and gave me ſomething for my Orphans, and ſpoke many affectionate Things to me. Altho' very old yet he followed me from one End of the Town to the other, ſo that People ſaid I had made Mr. <hi>Clap</hi> young again. Oh what a <hi>Crown of Glory is

the hoary Head when found in the Way of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> He was exceeding deſirous of my coming to <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> again, which I promiſed to do by the divine Permiſſion. For <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> ſeems to be a Place where much Good may be done. They are a very plain People for the Generality; tho' I obſerved there were ſome fooliſh Virgins at Church, covered over with the Pride of Life; I find they are ſadly divided amongſt themſelves, as to outward Things. I think there are no leſs than four different Congregations of Baptiſts; two of the Independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, and one of the Quakers Perſuaſion. Dean <hi>Berkly'</hi>s Name is had in much Reſpect. Amongſt them, the establiſhed Church is in good Order as to Externals: But many of the Head Members, I found ſoon were exceeding great Bigots; they ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very fearful leaſt I ſhould preach in Mr. <hi>Clap'</hi>s Meeting-Houſe, and gloried much in my bringing the good old Man to Church: Nor is there leſs Bigotry, as far as I could find among thoſe of other Communions, all I fear Place the Kingdom of God too much in Meats and Drinks, and have an ill Name abroad for running of Goods. One Day when I ſaid in my Sermon, <q>What will become of you, who cheat the King of his Taxes</q>? The whole Congregation ſeemed ſurprized, and look'd on one another as tho' they ſhould ſay we are guilty. <hi>Lord Jeſus give them to know thee, and the Power of thy Reſurrection, and teach them to render to Caeſar the Things that are Caeſar's and to God the Things that are God's.</hi>

I complied. The Gentlemen received us with much Civility, and after Dinner, I preached in the Meeting-Houſe to more People, than might be expected on ſuch ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Notice. My Heart was much ſhut up in the Excerciſe; I felt and ſaw but little Power, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Gentlemen ſeem'd very thankful. I took my Leave about 4 in the Afternoon, and lay at an Inn about ten Miles farther on the Road.

But being reſolved under God if poſſible to reach <hi>Boſton</hi> that Night, we travel'd on for near fifty Miles, and came to <hi>Boſton</hi> about 8 in the Evening; when we were within four Miles of the Town, the Governour's Son, and ſeveral other Gentlemen, and one or two

Miniſters, waited at a Gentleman's Houſe to give me the Meeting. They received me with great Gladneſs and told me many more would have come, had not a large Funeral been in the Town, or if there had been more certain Notice of my arriving. This rejoiced me, for I think I can ſtand any thing better then this. It favours too much of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Grandure. But I muſt be tryed every Way. The Lord be my Helper. After ſtopping a little while, we went altogether in Company to <hi>Boſton</hi> to the Houſe of one Mr. <hi>Staniford,</hi> Brother in Law to Dr. <hi>Colman,</hi> who long ſince had ſent me an Invitation. Several Miniſters and other Gentlemen came in to pay their Reſpects. My Heart was but low, and my Body weak, but at the Requeſt of one of the Miniſters I gave Thanks to our gracious God for bringing me in Safety, and prayed that my coming might be in the Fulneſs of the Bleſſing of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Peace. We then parted, I eat a little Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and then retired, beſeeching the Lord to raiſe my Heart and make his Power known in the Hearts of his People. <hi>Even ſo Lord Jeſus,</hi> Amen and Amen.</p>

                  <hi>Friday, Sept.</hi> 19. Slept pretty well, and in the Morning perceived freſh Emanations of Divine Light break in upon, and refreſh my Soul. Was viſited by ſeveral Gentlemen, and Miniſters, and went to the Governour's with <hi>Joſiah Willard,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq;</abbr> Secretary of the Province, a Man fearing God, and with whom, (tho' before unknown in Perſon) I have correſponded for ſome Time. The Governour received me, with the utmoſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, he ſeemed to favour the Things which were
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:004848_0025_100DEEEEB11A05C8"/>
of God, and deſired me to come and ſee him as often as I could. At 11 o'Clock I went to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worſhip at the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards waited on the Commiſſary Home who read Prayers. He received me very courteouſly, and it being a Day, whereon the Clergy of the Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Church met, I had the Opportunity of converſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Five of 'em together. I think one of them firſt began with me for calling that <hi>Tennent</hi> and his Brethren faithful Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt? I anſwered, I believed they were. They then queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned me about the Validity of Preſbyterian Ordination? I replied, I believed it was valid. They then urged againſt me a Paſſage in my firſt Journal where I ſaid, <q>That a Baptiſt Miniſter at <hi>Deal,</hi> did not give me a ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory Anſwer, concerning his Miſſion.</q> I anſwered, Perhaps my Sentiments were altered. And is Mr. <hi>Weſley</hi> altered in his Sentiments too ſaid one, for he was very ſtrenuous for the Church, and againſt all other Forms of Government when he was at <hi>Boſton.</hi> I anſwered, he was then a great Bigot, but God had ſince enlarged his Heart, and I believed he was like minded with me, as to this Particular. I then urged, that a Catholick Spirit was beſt, and that a Baptiſt Miniſter had commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated with me lately at <hi>Savannah:</hi> And I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ſays another Clergyman, you wou'd do him as good a Turn, and communicate with him. I anſwered, yes. I then urged, that it was beſt, to preach up the New-Birth, and the Power of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and not to inſiſt ſo much on the Form, for People would never be brought to one Mind, as to
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:004848_0025_100DEEEEB11A05C8"/>
that, nor did Jeſus Chriſt ever intend it. Yes, but ſays Dr. <hi>Cutler,</hi> he did. How do you prove it? <hi>Why,</hi> ſays he, <hi>our Lord prayed, that all might be one even as thou Father, and I are one.</hi> I reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that was ſpoken of the inward Union of the Souls of Believers with Jeſus Chriſt, and not of the outward Church. <hi>That cannot be,</hi> (ſays Dr. <hi>Cutler</hi>) <hi>for how then could it be ſaid, That the World might know, that thou haſt ſent me?</hi> He then taking it for granted, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> was the only true apoſtolical Church, drew a Parallel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Jewiſh, and our Church, urging, <hi>How God required all Things to be made according to the Pattern given on the Mount.</hi> I anſwer'd; Before the Parallel could be juſt, it muſt be proved, that every Thing enjoined in our Church was as much a divine Inſtitution as any Rite or Ceremony under the Jewiſh Diſpenſation. I added farther, That I ſaw regenerate Souls among the Baptiſts, among the Preſbyterians, among the Independants, and among the Church Folks; all Children of God, and yet all born again in a different Way of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and who then can tell which is the moſt evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical? <hi>What,</hi> ſays the Commiſſary, <hi>can you ſee Regeneration with your Eyes?</hi> or ſomething to that Purpoſe. Soon after we began to talk of the RIGH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TEOUSNESS OF CHRIST: And the Commiſſary ſaid <hi>Chriſt was to make up the Defects of our Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</hi> I aſk'd him, if Converſion was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantanious? He was unwilling to confeſs it; but having juſt before baptiſed an Infant at publick Worſhip; I aſk'd him, Whether he believed that very Inſtant in which he ſprinkled the Child with
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:004848_0026_100E01C28041F2D0"/>
Water, the Holy Ghoſt fell upon the Child? He anſwer'd, <hi>Yes.</hi> Then, ſays I, according to your own Principles, Regeneration is inſtantanious, and ſince you will judge of the New-Birth by the Fruits, pray watch that Child, and ſee if it brings forth the Fruits of the Spirit. I alſo ſaid, That if every Child was really born again in Baptiſm, then every baptiſed Infant would be ſaved. <hi>And ſo they are,</hi> ſays Dr. <hi>Cutler.</hi> How do you prove that? <hi>Why,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the Rubrick ſays, That all Infants dying af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Baptiſm, before they commit actual Sin, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly ſaved.</hi> I aſk'd, What Text of Scripture there was to prove it? <hi>Here,</hi> ſays he (holding a Prayer-Book in his Hand) <hi>the Church ſays ſo.</hi> We then juſt hinted at Predeſtination: I ſaid, I ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to the 17th Article of the Church in its plain literal Senſe, with all my Heart. We then talk'd a little about finally falling away from Grace. I ſaid, a true Child of God, though he might fall fouly, yet could never fall finally. <hi>But,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the Article ſays, Men, may fall away from Grace given.</hi> But then, ſays I, obſerve what follows, <hi>And by the Grace of God, they may riſe again.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Things of leſs Conſequence paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us; but being engag'd to dine at my Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and finding how inconſiſtent they were, I took my Leave, reſolving they ſhould not have the Opportunity of denying me their Pulpits. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, they treated me with more Civility than any Set of our own Clergymen have done a long While.</p>
               <p>The Commiſſary very kindly urged me to dine with him, but being pre-engaged, I went to my Lodging, and in the Afternoon preached to about
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:004848_0026_100E01C28041F2D0"/>
4000 People in Dr. <hi>Colman</hi>'s Meeting-Houſe, and as afterwards, I was told by ſeveral, with great Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. In the Evening, I exhorted and prayed, with as many as came to my Lodgings, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly rejoiced at the Proſpect there was of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many Souls in <hi>Boſton</hi> to the ſaving Knowledge of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Grant this O Father for thy dear Son's ſake.</hi> Amen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saturday, Sept.</hi> 20. Perceived myſelf grow more and more comfortable both in Body and Soul; Was ſweetly refreſh'd by ſeveral Packets of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſent me from different Parts in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> giving me an Account of the Succeſs of of the Goſpel; tho' was a little caſt down to find ſome Engliſh Friends had thrown aſide the Uſe of Means, and others were diſputing for ſinleſs Perfection, univerſal Redemption. I know no ſuch Thing aſſerted in the Goſpel, if explain'd aright. <hi>Lord, do thou cauſe even this to Work for Good, and give me Grace to oppoſe ſuch Errors, without Reſpect to Perſons, but with Meekneſs, Humility, and Love, Amen, Lord Jeſus,</hi> Amen, and Amen.</p>
               <p>Preached in the Morning with much Freedom and Power, to about 6000 Hearers in Dr. <hi>Sewall</hi>'s Meeting-Houſe, afterwards on the Common to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 8000, and again at Night to a thronged Company at my own Lodgings; and then ſpent the Remainder of the Evening with a few choice Friends in preparing for the Sabbath. <hi>Oh that it may be a Day of heavenly Reſt, ſacred to divine Love. Oh! that we may be always in the Spirit on the Lord's Day!</hi>

                  <hi>Sunday, Sept.</hi> 21. Went this Morning to hear Dr. <hi>Colman</hi> preach; din'd with his Colleague Mr. <hi>Cooper,</hi> and preach'd in the Afternoon to a very thronged Auditory, and with great and viſible Effects at Mr. <hi>Foxcroft'</hi>s Meeting-Houſe: Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after on the Common to about 15,000, and again at my Lodging as uſual, to a greater Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany than before, ſome afterwards came up into my Room, I felt much of the divine Preſence in my own Soul; and though hoarſe, was enabled to ſpeak with much Power, and could have ſpoke I believe 'till Midnight. To ſee the People ſo wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to hear, makes me forget myſelf. <hi>Oh that it may be my Sleep, my Meat, and Drink to do the Will of my heavenly Father! Oh that all who come to hear the Word, may take the Kingdom of God by Force.</hi> Amen and Amen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Monday, Sept.</hi> 22. Preached in the Morning at Mr. <hi>Webb'</hi>s Meeting-Houſe, to about 6000 Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the Houſe, beſides great Numbers ſtanding about the Doors. The Preſence of the Lord was amongſt them. Look where I would around me, viſible Impreſſions were made upon the Auditory; Moſt wept for a conſiderable Time. But what I muſt give the Preference to, was that gracious Seaſon at the New-North, on Wedneſday the 8th of <hi>October,</hi> where there was more of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God through the whole of the Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than ever I had known at one Time through the whole Courſe of my Life. Juſtly might it have been ſaid of that Place, <hi>It was no other than the Houſe of God and the Gate of Heaven.</hi> Oh how dreadful was the Places and yet Oh how
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:004848_0027_100E01C579C0FD08"/>
delightful! The LORD JESUS ſeem'd to be viſibly walking in that his Golden Candleſtick, to try ſome of the many Thouſands that were then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. But Oh, how few were prepared for ſo holy an Inquiſition? I am ſure I know one, who could not but tremble at the Thoughts of it; and who indeed could help crying out, <hi>Wo is me, for I am undone, becauſe I am a Man of unclean Lips, for mine Eyes have ſeen the</hi> KING <hi>the</hi> LORD <hi>of Hoſts.</hi> Indeed my own Soul was ſo deeply abaſed and overwhelm'd with ſuch unuſual Meltings, that I could have been glad of ſome private Corner in that Houſe to pour out my Soul without Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance to the Audience. The Spirit of God indeed, ſeemed moving upon the Face of the Waters at that Time; and who knows but that to a great many Souls God was pleaſed to ſay, <hi>Let there be Light, and there was Light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Afternoon I went to preach at Mr. <hi>Checkley'</hi>s Meeting-Houſe; but God was pleaſed to humble us by a very awful Providence. For when the Meeting-Houſe was filled with People, tho' there was no real Danger, on a ſudden the People were all in an Uproar, and ſo unacountably ſurprized, that ſome threw themſelves out of the Windows, others threw themſelves out of the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries, and others trampled upon one another ſo that ſome were actually killed, and others dangerouſly wounded. I happened to come in the midſt of the Uproar, and ſaw two or three lying on the Ground in a pitiable Condition: God was pleaſed to give me Preſence of Mind, ſo that I gave Notice. I would immediately preach in the Common. The
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:004848_0028_100E01C70631C8F0"/>
Weather was wet, but above eight Thouſand fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed into the Fields, to whom, I preached from theſe Words, <hi>Go out into the High-Ways &amp; Hedges and compel them to come in.</hi> I endeavour'd, as God ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled me, to improve what had befallen us, and tho' Satan in this has bruiſed our Heels; yet I doubt not but even this will be a Means of bruiſing his accurſed Head. <hi>Lord thy Judgments are like the great Deep, thy Footſteps are not known, juſt and holy art thou, O King of Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Evening perceived myſelf weak in Body ſo that I could not ſay much at the Houſe where I ſupped; but God, by his bleſſed Spirit, greatly refreſhed and comforted my Soul. Bleſſed be God, I find what our Saviour ſays, exceeding true, <hi>He that believeth on me as the Scripture hath ſpoken, out of his Belly ſhall flow Rivers of living Waters.</hi> I drink of God's Pleaſures as out of a River. <hi>Oh that all were made Partakers of this living Water,</hi>—<hi>they would never thirſt after the deadly Pleaſures of this lower World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tueſday, Sept.</hi> 23. Went this Morning with Dr. <hi>Colman</hi> and the Secretary to <hi>Roxbury,</hi> three Miles from <hi>Boſton,</hi> to ſee one Mr. <hi>Walter,</hi> a good old Puritan, who with his Predeceſſor Mr. <hi>Eliot,</hi> commonly called the Apoſtle of the Indians, but now with God, have been Paſtors of that Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation 106 Years. I had but little Converſation with him, my Stay was ſo very ſhort; but I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member he told me, he was glad to hear I ſaid, <hi>Man was half a Devil, and half a Beaſt.</hi> The more People drink into God's Spirit, the more I find they are inclined to debaſe the natural Man.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="unknown:004848_0028_100E01C70631C8F0"/>
About 11 we returned, and I preached in Mr. <hi>Gee'</hi>s Meeting-Houſe, but not to a very crowded Auditory, becauſe People were in doubt where I would preach. Dined at the Secretary's. Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Afternoon at Dr. <hi>Sewall'</hi>s to a thronged Congregation, and exhorted and prayed as uſual at my own Lodging; at neither Place without ſome Manifeſtation of a divine Power accompanying the Word.—<hi>Lord, let thy Preſence always follow me, or otherwiſe I ſhall be but as a ſounding Braſs, or a tinkling Cymbal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wedneſday, Sept.</hi> 24. Went this Morning to ſee and preach at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> the chief College for training up the Sons of the Prophets in all <hi>New-England.</hi> It has one Preſident, four Tutors, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of one hundred Students: It is ſcarce as big as one of our leaſt Colleges in <hi>Oxford;</hi> and as far as I could gather from ſome who well knew the State of it, not far ſuperiour to our Univerſities in Piety and true Godlineſs.—Tutors neglect to pray with and examine the Hearts of their Pupils. Diſcipline is at too low an Ebb: Bad Books are become faſhionable amongſt them:—<hi>Tillotſon</hi> and <hi>Clark</hi> are read inſtead of <hi>Sheppard, Stoddard,</hi> and ſuch like evangelical Writers, and therefore I choſe to preach from thoſe Words, <hi>We are not as many who corrupt the Word of God:</hi> And in the Concluſion of my Sermon, I made a cloſe Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to Tutors and Students. A great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of neighbouring Miniſters attended, as indeed, they do at all other Times, and God gave me great Freedom and Boldneſs of Speech. The Preſident of the College, and Miniſter of the Pariſh, treated
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:004848_0029_100E01C88F7B9B98"/>
me very civilly. In the Afternoon I preached again in the College-Yard, without particular Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to the Students: I believe there were 7000 Hearers:—The Holy Spirit melted many Hearts. The Word was attended with a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Power: And a Miniſter ſoon after wrote me Word, that he believed one of his Daughters was ſavingly wrought upon at that Time. <hi>Lord, add daily to thy Church ſuch as ſhall he ſaved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Paid my Reſpects to the Lieutenant Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, who lives at <hi>Cambridge;</hi> returned in the Evening to <hi>Boſton,</hi> and exhorted and prayed with many People, who were waiting round the Door for a ſpiritual Morſel. I believe our Lord did not ſend them empty away. <hi>Bleſſed Jeſus, Feed them all with the Bread of Life which cometh down from Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thurſday, Sept.</hi> 25. Preached the Weekly-Lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture at Mr. <hi>Foxcroft'</hi>s Meeting-Houſe, but was ſo oppreſſed with ſuch a Senſe of my baſe Ingratitude to my deareſt Saviour, that Satan would fain have tempted me to hold my Tongue, and not invite poor Sinners to Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe I was ſo great a Sinner my ſelf: But God enabled me to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Temptation: And ſince Jeſus Chriſt had ſhewn ſuch Mercy to and did not withdraw his Holy Spirit from me, the chief of Sinners, I was enabled the more feelingly to talk of his Love: And afterwards found that one Stranger in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, was in all Probability, effectually convinced by that Morning's Sermon. After publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, I went at his Excellency's Invitation, and dined with the Governour; moſt of the Miniſters
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:004848_0029_100E01C88F7B9B98"/>
of the Town were invited with me. Before Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the Governour ſent for me up into his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: He wept, wiſh'd me good Succeſs in the Name of the Lord, and recommended himſelf, Miniſters, and People to my Prayers. Immediately after Dinner, at the Governour's Motion, I prayed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly for them all; went in his Coach to the End of the Town, but had ſuch a Senſe of my Vileneſs upon my Soul, that I wondred People did not ſtone me. Croſs'd the Ferry, and preached at <hi>Charleſtown,</hi> a Town lying on the North-Side of <hi>Boſton:</hi> The Meeting-Houſe was very capacious, and quite filled; a gracious Melting was diſcerna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thro' the whole Congregation, and I perceived much Freedom and Sweetneſs in my own Soul; tho' the Damp I felt in the Morning was not quite gone off. <hi>Oh when ſhall I be free from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling-Sin! O Lord deliver me from the Body of this Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Evening I exhorted and prayed as uſual at my Lodging: And bleſſed be God, I found a great Alteration in the Hearers; they now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to melt and weep under the Word. <hi>Oh that the Lord may beat them down with the Hammer of his Word, 'till the Heart of Stone be entirely taken away. Even ſo Lord Jeſus,</hi> Amen and Amen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Friday, Sept.</hi> 26. Preach'd in the Morning at <hi>Roxbury</hi> from a little Aſcent to many Thouſands of People, with much of the divine Preſence amongſt us. Several I think came afterwards to me telling how they were ſtruck at that Time under the Word, and a Miniſter wrote to me thus,</p>

And after I left them God gave me to wreſtle with him in my Chamber in Behalf of ſome dear Friends then preſent, and others that were abſent from us; the Spirit of the Lord was upon them all, it made Interceſſion with Groanings that cannot be uttered. <hi>Oh let them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into thy Ears, O Lord of Sabaoth.</hi>

Collected <hi>l.</hi> 555 for my little Lambs, was taken very ill after Dinner; vomited violently, but was enabled to preach at Dr. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man'</hi>s in the Afternoon to as great if not greater began to queſtion whether

Bleſſed be God; after Sermon, I perceived my ſelf ſomewhat refreſhed. Supped very early.

At which the poor Creatures, as well as many white People, were much affected; and at my Return, gave a Word of Exhortation to a Crowd of People who were waiting at my Lodgings.

Town, but not with much viſible Effect. Din'd with Mr. <hi>Barnard,</hi> one of the Miniſters of the Place. Rode to <hi>Salem,</hi> 4 Miles from <hi>Marblehead,</hi> and preach'd there alſo to about 7000 People: Here the Lord manifeſted forth his Glory. One Man was, I believe, ſtruck down by the Power of the Word. In every Part of the Congregation Perſons might be ſeen under great Concern: One Mr. <hi>Clark,</hi> a good Miniſter, as is granted by all Lovers of God, ſeemed to be almoſt in Heaven. <hi>Salem</hi> is the firſt ſettled, and except <hi>Boſton,</hi> the largeſt Town in all <hi>New-England;</hi> but rather, as far as I could ſee and hear, excells it for Politeneſs. Upon Enquiry, I found the Inhabitants had been ſadly divided about their Miniſter; and God was pleaſed, before I knew their Circumſtances, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect me to a ſuitable Subject. Lord, heal their Diviſions, and grant that with one Heart and one Mind they may endeavour to glorify thy holy Name. After the Exerciſe, I immediately ſet out and got to <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> another large Town, 16 Miles (the Way we went) diſtant from <hi>Salem.</hi> Two or three Gentlemen came to meet me, and I and my Friends were kindly entertain'd at the Houſe of Mr. <hi>R</hi>—<hi>rs,</hi> one of the Miniſters of the Place. <hi>The Lord reward him, and all others a thouſand Fold, who refreſh our Bowels in the Lord.</hi>

                  <hi>Newbury,</hi> another large Town, twelve Miles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> about 3.

Bleſſed be God, his divine Power attends us more and more. Took Ferry immediately after Sermon; went with Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> Miniſter of the Place, who came to meet me in a Chaiſe to <hi>Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> another great Town, 9 Miles from <hi>Newbury.</hi> The Night was both dark, and rainy; but he, with whom the Darkneſs is no Darkneſs, brought us in Safety to <hi>Hampton,</hi> where I was pleaſed to ſee more Plainneſs in Mr. <hi>Cotton'</hi>s Houſe than I had ſeen in any Miniſter's Houſe ſince my Arrival. His Wife was as one that ſerveth. Oh that all Miniſters Wives were ſo: For there is nothing gives me more Offence than to ſee Clergymens Wives dreſſed out in the Pride of Life; they bring a Reproach upon Religion; they generally live up to the utmoſt of their Income, and being above working after their Huſbands Deceaſe, they are of all Women the moſt miſerable. <hi>From ſuch a Wife good Lord of thy infinite Mercy deliver my Soul.</hi>

Town about 14 Miles from <hi>Hampton,</hi> got thither in about an Hour and half; preach'd to a polite Auditory; but ſo very unconcern'd, that I began to question whether I had been ſpeaking to rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal, or brute Creatures. Seeing no immediate Effects of the Word preach'd, I was a little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected; but God to comfort my Heart, ſent one young Man, crying out in great Anguiſh of Spirit, <hi>What ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi> Oh, how does God pity the Weakneſs of his Children, why waſt thou ſo caſt down O my Soul? Croſſed a Ferry immediately after Sermon, and went over a very ſtony Way to <hi>York,</hi> a Town 13 Miles round the Ferry, diſtant from <hi>Portſmouth:</hi> Hither I came to ſee one Mr. <hi>Moody,</hi> a worthy, plain and powerful Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt; though now much impaired by old Age; he has lived by Faith for many Years; wou'd have no ſettled Salary; and has been much deſpiſed by the Haters, and as much reſpected by the true Lovers of the bleſſed Jeſus. He came as far as <hi>Hampton</hi> to meet me, but getting before him in our Night travelling, a Phyſician, his Neighbour, who came alſo to meet me, receiv'd me into his Houſe, and kindly entertain'd us. Some of our Fellow-Travellers loſt their Way, but came to us ſometime after our Arrival at <hi>York.</hi> Here we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and prayed very comfortably together. The Air agreed mightily with my Conſtitution.

                  <hi>Thurſday, October</hi> 2. Was much comforted to hear good Mr. <hi>Moody</hi> tell me, that he believed I ſhou'd preach to an Hundred new Creatures this Morning in his Congregation: and indeed I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve I did; for when I came to preach I could ſpeak little or no Terror, but moſt Conſolation: I preach'd both Morning and Evening. The Hearers looked plain and ſimple, and Tears trick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led apace down moſt of their Cheeks. Indeed we ſaw the Outgoings of the Lord in his Sanctuary. But one Thing put a little Damp upon my Soul, and I hope did me good. Mr. <hi>Moody</hi> has a Son a Miniſter, who was once full of Faith and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt, and walk'd in the Light of God's Countenance, and made full Proof of his Miniſtry, but for theſe two Years laſt paſt, has walked in Darkneſs, and ſaw no Light. He has an inexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Gloomineſs upon his Soul, and cannot apply any of the Promiſes to himſelf. I was informed that he was at Meeting, but dared not ſee me: I was aſſiſted to pray for him, and ſo much the more earneſtly, not knowing but his Caſe might be mine hereafter. <hi>Lord, let me not be high minded, but fear; into thy Hands I commend my Spirit; I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to take no Thought for the Morrow; deal with me as ſhall pleaſe thee. Juſtly mayſt thou take every Thing from me; for I have wretchedly abuſed thy Loving-kindneſs. God be merciful to me a Sinner.</hi>

Left <hi>York</hi> about 4 in the Evening, reach'd <hi>Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> by Night, where I ſupped, converſed, and ſung Pſalms very comfortably with my Friends: The Lord was pleaſed to lift up the Light of his bleſſed Countenance more and more upon my Soul; rightly is Jeſus called <hi>Emanuel,</hi> he is God, not only with, but in us. <hi>Oh that I may never provoke him to depart from me!</hi>

Inſtead of preaching to dead Stocks, I now had Reaſon to believe I was preaching to living Men. People began to melt, ſoon after I began to pray, and the Power encreaſed more and more, during the whole Sermon. The Word ſeemed to pierce through and through, and carried ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions along with it, that many who before had induſtriouſly ſpoken Evil of me, were made aſham'd of themſelves.

Father, I ſubmit; thy Will be done. Viſited I believe a true Diſciple, who had been ſick for a long Seaſon; the Lord has made his Bed in his Sickneſs. He has been enabled to rejoice in Tribulation. Who wou'd but be a Chriſtian? Supped and gave a Word of Exhortation to many People at a Houſe, which I truſt the Lord will viſit with his Salvation.

A little before, I had heard of a Child who was taken ſick juſt after it had heard me preach, and ſaid, He would go to Mr. <hi>Whitefield'</hi>s God; and died in a ſhort Time. This encouraged me to ſpeak to the little Ones. But Oh, how were the old People affected when I ſaid, Little Children, if your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents will not come to Chriſt, do you come and go to Heaven without them. There ſeemed to be but few dry Eyes look where I would. The Word ſmote them, I believe, through and through; and my own Soul was very much carried out. Surely it was the Lord's Paſſover. I have not ſeen a greater Commotion ſince my preaching at <hi>Boſton.</hi> Glory be to God who has not forgotten to be gracious. At the ſame Time was collected <hi>l.</hi> 440. Went with the Governour, who ſeemed more and more affected, in his Coach to my Lodgings.—Snatch'd a few Moments to write a Letter or two; gave a Word of Exhortation to a great Crowd of People, and then ſlipped out privately at a back Door and went and ſupped at a Man's Houſe, whoſe Wife and Siſter, as well as himſelf, I truſt

                  <hi>Thurſday, October</hi> 9. Have been applied to, this and every Morning ſince my return, by many Souls under deep Diſtreſs; and was only grieved that I could not have more Time with them. Preached this Morning the publick Lecture at Dr. <hi>Sewall'</hi>s Meeting-Houſe, which was very much crowded. When I left my Lodgings, I had fixed on, and folded down a particular Text, but when I came near the Meeting-Houſe I found it much impreſſed upon my Heart, that I ſhould preach up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Lord's Conference with <hi>Nicodemus:</hi> I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted a Friend with it. When I came into the Pulpit, I ſaw a great Number of Miniſters ſitting around and before me, and when I came to thoſe Words, <hi>Art thou a Maſter of</hi> Iſrael <hi>and knoweſt not theſe Things?</hi> The Lord enabled me to open my Mouth boldly againſt unconverted Miniſters; to caution Tutors to take Care of their Pupils: And alſo to adviſe Miniſters particularly to examine into the Experiences of Candidates for Ordination. For I am verily perſuaded the Generality of Preachers talk of an unknown unfelt Chriſt. And the Reaſon why Congregations have been ſo dead, is becauſe they have had dead Men preaching to them. Oh that the Lord may quicken and revive them, for his own Names Sake. For how can dead Men beget liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Children? It's true indeed, God may convert People by the Devil if he pleaſes, and ſo he may by unconverted Miniſters. But I believe he ſeldom makes Uſe of either of them for this Purpoſe. No, the Lord will chuſe Veſſels made meet by the

                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> And as for my own Part, I wou'd not lay Hands on an unconverted Man for ten thouſand Worlds. Unſpeakable Freedom God gave me while treating on this Head. After Sermon I dined with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, who ſeemed more kindly affected than ever; and particularly told one of the Miniſter's who had lately began to preach extempore, that he was very glad he had found out a Way to ſave his Eyes. Oh that others wou'd follow him; I believe they would find the Lord ready to help and aſſiſt them. In the Afternoon I preached in the Common to about 15000 People, and collected upwards of <hi>l.</hi> 200 for the Orphan-Houſe. Juſt as I had finiſhed my Sermon a Ticket was put up to me, wherein I was deſired to pray for a Perſon juſt enter'd upon the Miniſtry; but under Apprehenſions that he was not converted. God enabled me to pray for him with my whole Heart; and I hope that Ticket will teach many others not to run before they can give an Account of their Converſion: If they do, they offer God ſtrange Fire. Went to the Funeral of one belonging to the Council; but do not like the Cuſtom at <hi>Boſton</hi> of not ſpeaking at the Grave. When can Miniſters Prayers and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations be more ſuitable, than when the Corps before will ſilently as it were aſſiſt them, and with a kind of dumb Oratory bid the Spectators conſider their latter End. When the Funeral was over, I went as privately as poſſible to the Alms-Houſe and enlarged on theſe Words, <hi>The Poor receive the Goſpel;</hi> for near half an Hour. Then I went to the Work-Houſe, where I prayed with and exhorted a great
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:004848_0037_100DEEF6B52ECAB8"/>
Number of People, who crowded after me, beſides thoſe belonging to the Houſe, for an Hour more. Then hearing there was a conſiderable Number waiting for me at my Lodgings (tho' ſome cryed out, Spare thy ſelf) God ſtrengthned me to go and give them a ſpiritual Morſel; and then I went and eat Bread comfortably at a Friend's Houſe, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I was invited, and ſoon after retired to my Reſt. Oh how ſweet Sleep is after working for Jeſus. <hi>Lord, ſtrengthen me yet a little longer, and then let me ſleep in thee, never to awake in this vain World again. Still I muſt intreat thee, if moſt conducive to thy Glory and the Good of Souls, to make no long tarrying, O my God.</hi>

                  <hi>Saturday, October</hi> 11. Was but weak in Body, and perceived I had taken cold.—But preaching I find a conſtant Remedy againſt all ſlight Indiſpoſitions. Went to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> 4 miles from <hi>Medford</hi> &amp; preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Meeting-Houſe Door, to a great Body of People, who ſtood very attentively, tho' it rained, and were at the latter Part of the Sermon much affected. It being at the Univerſity, I diſcourſed on theſe Words—<hi>Noah the eighth Perſon a Preacher of Righteouſneſs:</hi> And endeavoured to ſhew the Qualifications proper for a true evangelical Preacher of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs. The Lord opened my Mouth, and I ſpoke very plainly to Tutors and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pils. <hi>l.</hi> 100 were collected for the Orphans. After Sermon the Preſident very kindly entertained me and my Friends. About 4 we reached <hi>Boſton.</hi> I preached immediately at Dr. <hi>Sewall'</hi>s Meeting-Houſe, exhorted a great Company afterwards at my Lodgings, and then was employed till near Midnight in ſettling my private Affairs, anſwering Letters, and ſpeaking to Souls under Convictions. One little Girl came to me about eight Years old, under deep Convictions. She, as her Friends told
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:004848_0038_100E01D874B5AED0"/>
me, had been wreſtling for Chriſt: And whilſt ſhe was wreſtling it came to her mind, that Jeſus being in an Agony, prayed yet ſo much the more earneſtly; and that an Angel was ſent from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to ſtrengthen him. This encouraged her to perſevere, and her Soul ſoon received ſome Comfort. Another Miniſter's little Daughter has been quite reſtleſs after Chriſt Night and Day. And a young Man about fourteen came to me crying, ſaying, Sir, I am convicted, but not comforted, O pray for me. <hi>I thank thee holy Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth, that thou haſt hid theſe Things from the wiſe and prudent, and haſt revealed them unto Babes: Even ſo Father, for ſo it ſeemed good in thy Sight.</hi>

                  <hi>Sunday, October</hi> 12. Perceived I was much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh'd in Body and Soul when I roſe in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Spoke to as many as I could that came for ſpiritual Advice. Preach'd with great Power and Affection at Dr. <hi>Sewall'</hi>s Meeting-Houſe, which was ſo exceedingly thronged, that I was obliged to get in at one of the Windows. Dined with the Governour, who came to me after Dinner when I was retir'd; and weeping moſt earneſtly, deſired my Prayers. The Lord be with and in him for Time and Eternity. Went and heard Dr. <hi>Sewall</hi> preach in the Afternoon. Was ſick at Meeting, and alſo after it was over. Went with the Governour in his Coach, to the Common, where I preached my Farewel-Sermon to near 30,000 People. A Sight I have not ſeen ſince I left <hi>Black-Heath,</hi> &amp; a Sight perhaps never before ſeen in all <hi>America.</hi> It being duſkiſh before I had done, the Sight was more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn. Numbers, great Numbers melted into Tears
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:004848_0038_100E01D874B5AED0"/>
when I talked of leaving them. I was very parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular in my Application, both to Rulers, Miniſters and People, commended what was commendable, and blamed what was blame-worthy, and exhorted them ſteadily to imitate the Piety of their Fore-Fathers,—that whether I was preſent or whether I was abſent I might hear of their Affairs, that with one Heart and one Mind they were ſtriving together for the Faith of the Goſpel. After Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon the Governour went with me to my Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, I ſtood in the Paſſage and ſpoke to a great Company, both within and without the Doors.—But they were ſo deeply affected and cried out ſo loud, that I was obliged to leave off praying. The Governour was highly pleaſed to ſee the Power of God. He took his leave in the moſt affectionate Manner, and ſaid he would come and take me in his Coach to <hi>Charleſtown</hi> Ferry the morrow Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. The remainder of the Evening was almoſt intirely taken up in ſpeaking to Souls deeply woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Word. The poor Girl that followed me from <hi>Roxbury</hi> I believe had a ſaving Diſcovery of Jeſus Chriſt this Morning. For when I prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched on theſe Words, THE LORD OUR RIGH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TEOUSNESS; ſhe was enabled to ſay, The Lord <hi>my</hi> Righteouſneſs. Her Soul received Comfort, and ſhe knew her Sins were forgiven her; and was not afraid to die. Poor Creature, I found upon Inquiry, ſhe could not read, which ſhews the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty of God's electing Love, and confirms what the Apoſtle ſays, That the Lord chuſes the fooliſh Things of this World to confound the wiſe. Many offer'd to go with me to <hi>Georgia;</hi> and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:004848_0039_100E01DAB7723E90"/>
I believe will incline me to take her. For ſhe's caſt out in effect already for Chriſt's Sake. Bleſſed be God for what he has done at <hi>Boſton.</hi> I hope a glorious Work is now begun, and that the Lord will ſtir up ſome faithful I Labourers to carry it on. <hi>Boſton</hi> is a large populous Place, very weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy. Has the Form kept up very well; but has loſt much of the Power of Religion. I have not heard of any remarkable Stir in it for theſe many Years. Miniſters and People are obliged to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that the Love of many is waxed cold. Both for the generality ſeem too much conformed to the World. There's much of the Pride of Life to be ſeen in their Aſſemblies: Jewels, Patches, and gay Apparel are commonly worn by the female Sex; little Boys and Girls, I obſerved commonly dreſſed up in the Pride of Life; and the little In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants that were brought to Baptiſm, were wrapped in ſuch fine Things and ſo much Pains taken to dreſs them, that one would think they were brought thither to be initiated into, rather than renounce the Pomps and Vanities of this wicked World.—There are nine Meeting-Houſes of the congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Perſuaſion, one Baptiſt, one French, one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Scotch-Iriſh, there are two monthly and one weekly Lecture, and that too but poorly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; ſeveral Miniſters complained to me of it, I mentioned it in my Sermons, and I truſt God will ſtir up the People more frequently to tread the Courts of the Lord's Houſe. One Thing <hi>Boſton</hi> is remarkable for,—The external Obſervation of the Sabbath; Men in civil Offices have a Regard for Religion: The Governour encourages them, and
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:004848_0039_100E01DAB7723E90"/>
the Miniſters and Magiſtrates ſeem to be more uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted than in any other Place where I have been.—Both were exceeding civil to me during my Stay. I never ſaw ſo little ſcoffing;—Never had ſo little Oppoſition: But one might eaſily foreſee much would hereafter ariſe, when I come to be more particular in my Application to particular Perſons; for I fear, many, many reſt in a Head-Knowledge, are cloſe Phariſees, and having only a Name to live. It muſt needs be ſo when the Power of Godlineſs is dwindled away, and the Form only of Religion is become faſhionable amongſt a People. However no doubt there are few a Names left in <hi>Sardis</hi> that have not defiled their Garments; many Letters came to me as far as I could judge from truly pious People, in which they heavily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of the ſad Degeneracy of their Times, and hoped that God was now about to revive his Work in the midſt o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

They were greatly affected by the Word, followed Night and Day, and were very liberal to my dear Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans. I promiſed, God willing, to viſit them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and intend to fulfil my Promiſe when it ſhall pleaſe God to bring me again from my native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.

Took an affectionate Leave of many dear Friends; eſpecially of my Hoſt and Hoſteſs, who have been exceedingly kind to me and mine; and wept over me at our Departure from them. The Lord reward them a thouſand Fold. Went with the Governour in his Coach to <hi>Charleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town</hi> Ferry. He took me to the Boat, kiſſed me, and with Tears in his Eyes, bid me farewel. About Noon I reached <hi>Concord,</hi> a Town 18 Miles from <hi>Boſton.</hi> Here I preached twice to ſome Thouſands in the open Air, and comfortable preaching it was. The Hearers were ſweetly melted down. My Soul was as it were in Heaven; I ſaw him that was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible. <hi>l.</hi> 45 were collected for the Orphans. The Miniſter of the Town being I believe a true Child of God, I choſe to ſtay all Night at his Houſe, that we might rejoice together. The Lord was with us. The Spirit of the Lord came upon me, and God gave me to wreſtle with him for my Friends, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe then with me. They all felt his Power. Brother <hi>Bliſs,</hi> the Miniſter, broke into Floods of Tears, and we had Reaſon to cry out, It was good for us to be here. <hi>O bleſſed be thy Name O Lord for theſe ſweet Refreſhings in our Way towards the heavenly Canaan.</hi>

Commotion in the Aſſembly. Got to <hi>Marlborough,</hi> eight Miles from <hi>Sudbury,</hi> about 4; preached in the Meeting-Houſe to a large Congregation: At firſt my Heart was dead, and I had but little Freedom, but before I had finiſhed, the Word came with ſuch a Demonſtration of the Spirit, that great Numbers were very much melted down. When I came into the Meeting-Houſe, I turn'd about, and to my Surprize, found Governour <hi>Belcher</hi> there.

As we were going to Meeting, ſays he, Mr. <hi>Whitefield,</hi> do not ſpare Rulers any more than Miniſters, no not the chief of them.

But lately the People of God have complained of Deadneſs, and loſing their firſt Love. However, as ſoon as I mentioned what God had done for their Souls for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, it was like putting Fire to Tinder. The Remembrance of it quicken'd them, cauſed many of them to weep ſorely. When I had taken a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Refreſhment, we croſſed the Ferry to <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thampton,</hi> where no leſs than 300 Souls as was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, were ſavingly brought home to the dear Lord Jeſus about 5 or 6 Years ago.

And when I came to remind them of their former Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences, and how zealous and lively they were at that Time, both Miniſter and People wept much, and the Holy Ghoſt enabled me to ſpeak with a great deal of Power. In the Evening I gave a Word of Exhortation to ſeveral that came to Mr. <hi>Edwards'</hi>s Houſe, my Body was ſomewhat weak, my Appetite almoſt gone, but my Lord, gave me Meat to eat which the World knows nothing of. <hi>Lord evermore give me this Bread.</hi> Amen and Amen.</p>

The Meeting-Houſe was full. God's Power was with me both Times, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at the laſt. My Soul was much carried out in Prayer, and the Lord ſo ſtrenghthen'd me in the inner Man, that I could have preach'd another Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon after I had done. A little after I left <hi>Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> my Horſe coming over a Bridge, threw me over his Head directly upon my Noſe: The Fall ſtun'd me for a while; my Mouth was full of Duſt: I bled

a little, but falling upon ſoft Sand, got not much Damage.

How he has handled the Controverſy, I know not. I think no ſolid Arguments can be brought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend ſuch a Cauſe.—But the beſt of Men are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to err, that we may know they were but Men. A Sermon lately publiſhed by Mr. <hi>Gilbert Tennent,</hi> entitled, <hi>The Danger of an unconverted Miniſtry,</hi> I think unanſwerable. As I was riding to <hi>Windſor</hi> after Dinner, an old Man came up to me ſaying, He knew what I had preached in the Morning was true,—I have felt it, ſays he, I was under the Spirit of Bondage twenty Years, and have received the Spirit of Adoption 23 Years. Another came giving me an Account of his Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences, and the People of God ſeemed much revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at <hi>Windſor,</hi> where I am informed a true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Man is the Miniſter. I preached in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon and with ſuch Freedom, that a young Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter who had heard me ſeveral Times, told me, I had kept the good Wine until now. As ſoon as Sermon was over, I rode about a Mile, croſſed a broad Ferry, walked about a Mile &amp; half, &amp; prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to a thronged Congregation, belonging to old Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> Father to Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> of <hi>Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and I believe a true Diſciple of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. My Body being ſomething weak, I did not ſpeak with that Strength as laſt Night, neither was I ſo much aſſiſted; but it is the Lord, he knows beſt when to diſpenſe, and when to ſuſpend his Aids.

After Exerciſe I ſupped at the Houſe of old Mr. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards;</hi> his Wife was as aged, I believe, as himſelf, and if ſhe was converted, (and I know nothing to the contrary) I fancied I was ſitting in the Houſe of a <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> Indeed I felt great Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in my own Soul, and parted from him and his Son (who came with me ſo far) with ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Regret. But bleſſed be God, we ſhall meet again in Eternity. <hi>Lord grant I may always comfort my ſelf with this Thought!</hi>

This Morning I intended to go and preach at both their Places; as alſo at <hi>Plymouth, Rhode-Iſland,</hi> . but God ſhewed me this Day it was inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with my other Buſineſs, upon many Accounts; and therefore after Prayer, and conſulting with my Friends, I reſolved to go directly to <hi>New-York;</hi> accordingly at Night, after writing a few Letters I rode to <hi>Middletown,</hi> 10 miles from <hi>Wethersfield,</hi> and was entertain'd at the Houſe of Mr. <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> the Miniſter of the Place, and I think an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and one who has been long mourning over the Deadneſs of Profeſſors. <hi>Oh that all Miniſters were like minded.</hi>

Declined preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Morning, becauſe it was wet, the People had no Notice of my coming, and I had much pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Buſineſs on my Hands. Perceived my Health of Body grow better and better. Preached in the Afternoon with Power towards the latter End of the Sermon, and obſerved ſome deeply affected. It being the Time in which the Aſſembly ſat, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, Council and the Gentlemen of the lower Houſe were preſent. After Sermon two young Miniſters, who ſeemed to have ſome Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of divine Things, came to converſe with me, and in the Evening I expounded at my Lodgings to a Room full of People. The Power of the Lord was upon me. I ſpoke with much Weight and Freedom, and had ſweet Fellowſhip with my dear Companions. <hi>Oh who would but travel for Chriſt.</hi>

With him I dined at Mr.<hi>Chap'</hi>s, Rector of <hi>New-Haven</hi> College; about one third as big as that at

                  <hi>Sunday, October</hi> 26. Preached both Morning and Evening to much larger Congregations than before; and in the Afternoon obſerved an eſpecial Preſence of God in the Aſſembly. Many I believe, were comforted and quicken'd by the Holy Ghoſt. The People of God ſent me Word that they were much revived; and one came and told me theſe Words were lately preſſed upon upon her Heart, <hi>The Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is gone, the Spring is at Hand, the Voice of the Turtle is heard in the Land.</hi> Indeed I believe this will be an acceptable Year of the Lord. Before Evening Service the following Note was put into my Hands, by one who came to me a Day or two ago, ſome miles off, under great Diſtreſs, and tho' weak in Body, could not but follow after me. <hi>One ſelf-righteous Phariſee reſting in Duties who hath a

rational Belief of his damned Eſtate, and that he hath never felt the Pangs of the New-Birth, deſires Prayers to that God that hath ſaid, ye muſt be born again.</hi> After Sermon I waited on the Governour, an aged, grave, old Gentleman, well reported of by good Men. I obſerved him to be much affected under the Word; when I came in, he ſaid, <hi>I am glad to ſee you, and heartily glad to hear you.</hi> But his Heart was ſo full that he could not ſpeak much. The Tears trickled down his aged Cheeks like Drops of Rain. <hi>He was thankful to God,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>for ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhings in the Way to our Reſt. Food does us good,</hi> added he, <hi>when we eat it with an Appetite:</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I believe he had fed upon the Word. The Lord ſupport him when his Strength faileth, and bring his gray Hairs with comfort to the Grave. In the Evening I expounded at my Lodgings to a great Number of People, and collected near <hi>l.</hi> 40 for the Orphans. My Soul was much refreſhed to hear how the Children of God were revived by the Word preached. And nothing confirms me more that I have been taught of God, and preach the Truth as it is in Jeſus, than to find our Lord's dear and old Diſciples feeling the Power of the Word wherever I go, and ſaying, <hi>it agrees with their Experiences</hi>—<hi>My Sheep hear my Voice,</hi> ſays our dear Redeemer, a <hi>Stranger will they not hear.</hi> About 8 at Night we left <hi>New-Haven.</hi> The Moon ſhone bright, &amp; after we had rode three miles, we called at a Houſe which as Mr. <hi>Wheelock,</hi> a faithful Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt told me before was full of God. I think they tell me the Mother and three Daughters were conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Perſons. Aſſoon as I came into the Houſe, the Spirit of the Lord came upon me, God gave

me to wreſtle with him. And my Friends ſaid at departing, They were never in ſuch a Houſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Oh it was a ſweet Time indeed! God made his Power to be felt and known. After I had given a Word of Exhortation, <hi>That they would adorn the Goſpel of our Lord in all Things,</hi> we went forward on our Journey and got to <hi>Milford,</hi> 10 miles from <hi>New-Haven,</hi> about 10 at Night. <hi>The Lord's Name be praiſed, from the riſing up of the Sun unto the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down of the ſame.</hi> Amen and Amen.</p>

The Preſence of God was much in the Aſſembly, which was large: Many Miniſters were preſent, &amp; they could not help glorifying God much on my Behalf. Dear Mr. <hi>Mills</hi> who came again to meet me this Morning, was much affected, and as I was riding out of Town a godly Gentleman met me, and with Tears in his Eyes, at length out of the Abundance of his Heart ſaid, I never ſaw God's Preſence in the Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary on this wiſe before; I have experienced the Words you ſpoke, but never heard them ſo well cleared up, nor felt them ſo powerfully ſet home upon my Soul: It has been a bleſſed Time to my Soul.

Was vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited with a great inward Trial, ſo that I was pained to the Heart. Was ſomewhat dejected before I went out of my Lodgings, and ſomewhat diſtreſſed for a Text after I got up into the Pulpit. But the Lord at length directed me to one, but I looked for no Power or Succeſs, being very low by my laſt Night's Trial; notwithſtanding, before I had preach'd half an Hour, the bleſſed Spirit began to move on the Hearers Hearts in a very awful manner. Young, and eſpecially many old People were ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizingly affected, ſo that I tho't they would have cried out. At Dinner the Spirit of the Lord came upon me again, and enabled me to ſpeak with ſuch Vigour againſt ſending unconverted Perſons into the Miniſtry, that two Miniſters, with Tears in their Eyes, publickly confeſſed, they had laid Hands on young

Men without ſo much as aſking them, <hi>Whether they were born again of God or not?</hi> After Dinner, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Heart much enlarged, I prayed, and with ſuch Power, that moſt in the Room were put under Concern. And one old Miniſter was ſo deeply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed, that calling Mr. <hi>Noble</hi> and me out, with great difficulty (becauſe of his weeping) He deſired our Prayers. <hi>For,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I have been a Scholar, and have preached the Doctrines of Grace for a long Time, but I believe I never have felt the Power of them in my own Soul.</hi> O that all unconverted Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters were bro't to make the ſame Confeſſion. I was much affected with his Ingenuity, and after having by Prayer earneſtly recommended him to God, I took Horſe, rejoicing exceedingly in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to ſee how our Lord was getting himſelf the Victory in a Place where Mr. <hi>Davenport,</hi> a Native of <hi>Stanford,</hi> and dear Miniſter of the bleſſed Jeſus, had been ſlighted &amp; deſpiſed. <hi>A Prophet is not without Honour, ſave in his own Country &amp; his Father's Houſe.</hi>

Never ſurely was ſo large a Spot of Ground ſetled in ſuch a Manner, in ſo ſhort a Space as one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years. The Towns thro' <hi>Connecticut,</hi> and Eaſtward towards <hi>York,</hi> in the Province of the <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts-Bay,</hi> near the River Side are large, and well peopled, and exceeding pleaſant to travel thro'.</p>

Every five or ten miles you have a Meeting-Houſe, and I believe there's no ſuch Thing as a Pluraliſt or non-reſident Miniſter in both Provinces. Many, nay perhaps moſt that preach, I fear, do not expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimentally know Chriſt, yet I cannot ſee much worldly Advantage to tempt them to take upon them the ſacred Function. Few Country-Miniſters as I have been informed, have ſufficient allowed them in Money to maintain a Family. God has remarkably in ſundry Times, &amp; in divers manners, poured out his Spirit in ſeveral Parts of both Provinces, &amp; it often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhes my Soul, to hear of the Faith of the good Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers who firſt ſetled in theſe Parts; notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they had their Foibles, ſurely they were a Set of righteous Men: They certainly followed our Lord's Rule, <hi>ſought firſt the Kingdom of God and his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> and behold all other Things God added unto them: Their Seed are now bleſſed in temporal Things eſpecially, &amp; notwithſtanding the riſing Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration ſeem to be ſetled on their Lees, yet I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the <hi>Lord hath left more than ſeven thouſand who have not bowed their Knee to Baal.</hi> The Miniſters and People of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> ſeemed to be more ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and ſerious than thoſe that live near <hi>Boſton,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in thoſe Parts where I went. But I think the Miniſters preaching almoſt univerſally by Notes, is a certain mark they have in a great meaſure loſt the old Spirit of Preaching.—For tho' all are not to be condemned that uſe Notes, yet it is a ſad Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Decay of vital Religion, when reading Sermons becomes faſhionable, where <hi>extempore</hi> preaching did once almoſt univerſally prevail: When the Spirit of Prayer began to be loſt, then Forms of Prayer were invented, and I believe the ſame
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:004848_0049_100E01F2851A6968"/>
Obſervation will hold good as to preaching. As for the Univerſities I believe it may be ſaid, <hi>Their Light is now become Darkneſs,</hi>—<hi>Darkneſs that may be felt;</hi> and is complained of by the moſt godly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. I pray God thoſe Fountains may be purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſend forth pure Streams to water the City of our God. The Church of <hi>England</hi> is at a very low Ebb, and as far as I can find, had People kept their primitive Purity, it would ſcarce have got foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>New-England.</hi> I have many Evidences to prove that moſt of the Churches have been firſt ſet up by immoral Men, and ſuch as would not ſubmit to the Diſcipline of their Congregations, or were corrupt in the Faith.—But I will ſay no more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the poor Church of <hi>England.</hi>—Moſt of her Sons, whither Miniſters or People, I fear hate to be reformed. As for the civil Government of <hi>New-England,</hi> it ſeems to be well regulated, and I think at opening all their Courts, either the Judge or a Miniſter begins with a Prayer. Family Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is I believe generally kept up. The Negroes I think are better uſed in reſpect both to Soul and Body, than in any other Province I have yet ſeen. In ſhort, I like <hi>New-England</hi> exceeding well, and when a Spirit of Reformation revives, it certainly will prevail more than in other Places, becauſe they are more ſimple in their Worſhip, leſs corrupt in their Principles, and conſequently more eaſily brought over to the Form of ſound Words, into which ſo many of their pious Anceſtors were delivered. <hi>Send forth, O Lord, thy Light and thy Truth, and for thy infinite Mercies Sake, ſhew thou haſt a peculiar Delight in theſe habitable Parts of the Earth.</hi> Amen, Lord Jeſus, AMEN.</p>
