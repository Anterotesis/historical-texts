            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>WHen firſt I began the following Lines, I was ſo far from the Leſign of publiſhing them, that I only intended them as a private Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to my Friend J. C. containing my Sentiments relating to the SOCIETY, from an Apprehenſion of the Want of ſuch Examples and Precepts in the Parents and Elders, as riſe from the Experience of the Work of Regeneration, and the total ſubduing the natural Will of Man, and its being brought into compleat Subjection to the Will of God; by which, the Deſire and Inclination being changed, and they created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good Works might glorify God, in living new Lives; Lives of Holineſs and Purity; and ſo might truly exhort the riſing Generation, to be "Followers of them, as they follow Chriſt;" and, from ſuch a Conduct in the World, as proceeds from thence, might "a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn the Doctrine of God, our Saviour, in all Things;" and be as "Lights in the World," and an Honour to the high Profeſſion we make among Men; without which Experience, Endeavours, in Education, are render'd ſaint, and very much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable.</p>
            <p>But when I conſider'd that the Publiſhing the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing Lines, could not be injurious to any; but might be of ſome Advantage to the Religious and
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:006846_0003_102A7D6E1E8B2338"/>Well-inclined (whether old or young) or at leaſt afford them an innocent, if not commendable, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſement, I was induced to publiſh them, that, as my Friend J. C. has ſeaſonably called, more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to the Youth, I might likewiſe remind the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of their Duty alſo; that all might anſwer their Calling, which is to Holineſs, and the End thereof, Eternal Life.</p>
            <p>Innumerable are the Advantages enjoy'd, even in this Life, by ſuch as take the Advice of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, viz. "Seek ye firſt the Kingdom of God, and his Righteouſneſs, and all theſe Things ſhall be added unto you;" and if Mankind were ſo happy, as "to remember their Creator in the Days of their Youth, while the evil Days come not," and knew their Affections limitted, and brought under proper Reſtrictions, by the Operation of the Spirit of God, in their own Hearts, they would, thereby, be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly furniſhed, unto every good Word and Work. This would likewiſe preſerve the Youth in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Converſation, and direct them, even in the Management of the Affairs of this Life, in their firſt ſetting out in the World, particularly in that important Affair of Marriage; and, afterwards, in the Chriſtian and prudent Education of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, &amp;c. the want of which, is the Cauſe of many Evils and Diſadvantages, under which Mankind la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; that this may be as much as poſſible avoided, and that Truth and Righteouſneſs may be propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, and continued, from one Generation to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, is the Deſire of a Well-wiſher to all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, but, more eſpecially, to the Houſhold of Faith.</p>

               <l>Muſt, previous to this kind Attempt, expect</l>
               <l>It will not always have its wiſh'd Effect:</l>

               <l>The Whole, who think they no Phyſician need,</l>
               <l>Will no Advice receive, nor Caution heed;</l>
               <l>The harden'd Sinner, being ſtupid grown,</l>
               <l>Will hate Reproof, and no Miſconduct own,</l>
               <l>And they, who after fading Pleaſure run,</l>
               <l>And blindly them purſue, will Counſel ſhun;</l>
               <l>The Unbelieving will not always be</l>
               <l>Prevail'd upon, their Unbelief to ſee;</l>
               <l>Nor will be apt Inſtruction to receive,</l>

Who doubt their Caſe, and fear it is not right,</l>

               <l>Whoſe ſole Dependance is upon the Lord,</l>
               <l>And cry to Him, that He may Strength afford;</l>
               <l>And may from Evil daily them preſerve,</l>
               <l>That, from his righteous Law, they may not ſwerve.</l>
               <l>Yet for the Sake of thoſe who are but frail,</l>
               <l>On whom Temptations eaſily prevail;</l>
               <l>Or being heedleſs, have no ſolid Thought</l>

               <l>Or being vain, and full of empty Prate,</l>
               <l>Have no juſt Notions of a future State;</l>
               <l>Or being young, not much deprav'd by Sin,</l>

               <l>My private Thoughts, and theſe my Lines expoſe:</l>
               <l>But think it juſt to let my Reader know,</l>

               <l>A ſmall Performance, which I've lately ſeen,</l>
               <l>Which, when I ſaw, I read with ſome Delight,</l>

               <l>And all that walk therein will find Increaſe.</l>
               <l>O may the Youth, of this, their Choice yet make,</l>
               <l>May they, betimes, his friendly Counſel take,</l>
               <l>And what Advice he there does freely give,</l>

               <l>That they thereby may good Examples give,</l>

               <l>And, by their Care, in ev'ry Word and Way,</l>
               <l>May good Inſtructions to their Minds convey:</l>
               <l>For Children, when but young, are quick of Sight</l>
               <l>To ſpy their Parents wrong, or find them right;</l>

               <l>Of Self-denial, and the inward Peace,</l>
               <l>Which, thro' Obedience, daily doth increaſe:</l>
               <l>Leſt, when their childiſh Ways and Years decline,</l>
               <l>With greater Follies their Affections join.</l>
               <l>That, from Experience, Children may be taught</l>
               <l>To ſet ſuch low, uncertain Things, at nought;</l>
               <l>And in their Minds the Principle inſtil</l>
               <l>Of due Submiſſion to the heav'nly Will;</l>
               <l>And daily by Example clearly ſhew</l>
               <l>The various Duties which to Men are due.</l>
               <l>Theſe needful Precepts, frequently impreſt</l>
               <l>With Warmth and Sweetneſs, very oft are bleſt</l>
               <l>With good Succeſs, and may in them create</l>
               <l>A Love to Truth, and teach 'em how to wait</l>
               <l>To know that Pow'r that would their Minds redeem</l>
               <l>From ev'ry Sin, and gain them good Eſteem.</l>
               <l>This, to the Youth, would great Advantage prove,</l>

               <l>Who ſundry Cauſes of Complaint afford:</l>

               <l>Endeavour'd here (tho' briefly) to diſplay,</l>
               <l>How far a certain Sect of Chriſtians are</l>

               <l>In Life, and Conduct, though rais'd up of late,</l>
               <l>And their Beginning of no longer Date</l>
               <l>Than yet ſcarce Ninety Years; if in that Space</l>
               <l>Some have declin'd their Zeal and Love apace,</l>
               <l>Yet, to be juſt, I muſt the Truth declare,</l>
               <l>No other Sect may with them yet compare,</l>
               <l>All Things conſider'd, take them every Way;</l>
               <l>Their Doctrine and OEconomy ſurvey:</l>
               <l>The prudent Care they generally obſerve</l>
               <l>O'er ſuch as from their wonted Practice ſwerve:</l>
               <l>The due Relief they yield unto the Poor:</l>

               <l>Incapable of Stealth (were Men ſo bent)</l>
               <l>Nor to be done without compleat Conſent:</l>
               <l>The great Advances by their Teachers made</l>
               <l>In true Religion, though employ'd in Trade;</l>
