            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.
      </p>
         </projectDesc>
         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HAT is here attempted, is a ſhort Syſtem of <hi>Ethics</hi> or <hi>Morality,</hi> which has been of late called the <hi>Religion of Nature:</hi> by which, I would not be underſtood to mean a Syſtem of Truths and Duties which meer <hi>Natural Reaſon</hi> would ever, of it ſelf, have clearly diſcovered, in the preſent Condition of Mankind, without the Aſſiſtance of <hi>divine Revelation:</hi> for, as I do not believe the human Kind ever were, not even in their original State of Innoceny, without revealed Religion; ſo neither do I believe they would ever ſince have fully diſcovered all theſe Principles of Truth and Duty, by their meer Reaſon without the Help of Revelation.—But what I mean, is, that Syſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem of Truths and Duties, which, though they are not all of them, obvious to our weak Reaſon, without Revelation; yet, when diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered either by the one or the other, do evidently appear, upon due Conſideration, to be founded in the firſt Principles of Reaſon and Nature, and from thence to be capable even of ſtrict Demonſtration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:005794_0004_1026EF8C0D4DA7A8"/>
We know there are a great Number of Truths in <hi>Mathematics</hi> and <hi>natural Philoſophy,</hi> which not one in ten Thouſand of the Bulk of Mankind would ever have thought of, had it not been for ſuch great Men as <hi>Euclid, Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, Archimedes,</hi> and Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton,</hi> &amp;c. which, yet may be ſafely received upon their Authority, and practiſed upon by thoſe who have not Leiſure or Ability to attend to the Reaſons of them: But now they have led the Way, it is not very difficult to thoſe who are capable of thinking, to enter into the Demonſtrations of them.— The Caſe is much the ſame as to moral Truths and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, with regard to the Authority of Prophets and Lawgivers.—It is the Part of the <hi>Phrophet</hi> or <hi>Lawgiver,</hi> as ſuch, to diſcover Truths and enjoin Laws as Rules of Behaviour to the People, who are to receive them upon their Authority:— And it is the Part of the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher,</hi> as ſuch, to enter into the Reaſons and Demonſtrations on which thoſe Truths and Duties are orginally founded. —</p>
            <p>Such a ſhort Delineation of <hi>Morality</hi> may, perhaps, be of ſome Uſe, eſpecially in theſe Times, wherein there is a Sect ariſen, or rather revived, that us continually decrying <hi>Morality,</hi>
               <pb facs="unknown:005794_0005_1026EF8E6FF4E6B8"/>as tho' it were only carnal Reaſon and no Part of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> nor ſcarce conſiſtent with it. — This it may be preſumed they would ſcarcely do, if they rightly conſidered what <hi>Morality</hi> really is. — And on the other Hand; as one Extreme is apt to beget another: It is to be feared there may be another Sect ariſing, or gaining Ground, who out of Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to thoſe abſurd Notions of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> are in Danger, not only of ſetting light by <hi>that,</hi> but even of loſing all ſerious Senſe of the true Extent and Obligations of <hi>Morality</hi> it ſelf; — It is therefore, the Deſign of the following Pages, to endeavour to give a juſt Notion of it, and the Reaſons on which it is founded, and to ſhew its Extent and vaſt Importance, and what Connexion there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>it</hi> and Chriſtianity, — I would only admoniſh this one Thing further; That no Speculation or Demonſtration whatſoever is of any further real Uſe to us, than ſo far forth as it influences, directs or engages us in Life and Practice, on which our Happineſs all depends.</p>

            <div type="introduction">
               <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
               <p n="1">1. MORAL PHILOSOPHY is the Knowledge of the <hi>Moral World,</hi> or the World of intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent free Agents, with a Conduct and Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſuitable thereunto, in the Purſuit of true Happineſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By the World of intelligent free Agents, is indeed meant the whole Syſtem of created Spirits, both Angels and Men, conſidered as being derived from, and under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and Government of Almighty GOD: — But what I mean chiefly to inſiſt upon, is the <hi>Knowledge of our ſelves,</hi> as we are Men, or a moral Syſtem of rational Animals, in all the Relations wherein we ſtand, both with Regard to GOD, our ſelves, and one another, with a Behaviour ſuitable thereunto; (without conſidering us either in our <hi>ceconomical</hi> or <hi>political</hi> Capacities,) being that Part of <hi>Moral Philoſophy,</hi> which is the Foundation of all the reſt, and is uſually termed, <hi>Ethics.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>ETHICS</hi> is the Art of living happily by the right Knowledge of our ſelves and the Practice of Virtue: —
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:005794_0008_1026EF96609FF978"/>our Happineſs being the End, and Knowledge and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue the Means to that End.—</p>
               <p n="4">4. We are ſaid to live happily when we enjoy our ſelves and all that is really good for us in the whole of our Nature and Duration; i. e. conſidered as reaſonable, active and immortal Creatures: — for Happineſs means, that Pleaſure which ariſes in us from our Enjoyment of our ſelves and all that is really good for us, or ſuitable to our Nature in the whole.—</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Enjoyment of our ſelves and all that is truly good, depends upon a good Habit or State of the Soul united with, and delighting in its proper Objects:— And this good Habit is the ſame Thing with <hi>Virtue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Virtue</hi> conſiſts in that Integrity, Firmneſs and Stability of the Soul, whereby we do honeſtly and ſtedfaſtly perſiſt, in Spite of all Temptations to the contrary, in the Love and Practice of <hi>Moral Good,</hi> and the Hatred and Forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of <hi>Moral Evil.—Vice</hi> is the contrary.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <hi>Moral Good</hi> conſiſts in freely chooſing and doing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Truth and right Reaſon dictate as neceſſary to be choſen and done in order to our true Happineſs.—<hi>Moral Evil</hi> the contrary.</p>
               <p n="8">8. There are two Things neceſſary to be conſidered with Reſpect to the Nature of Moral Good, viz. The <hi>Criterion</hi> or Teſt by which in the right Uſe of our Reaſon, we determine what we ought to do or forbear; and the Obligations we thereupon find our ſelves under to the Practice of it.</p>
               <p n="9">9. (1) The <hi>Criterion</hi> or Teſt whereby to determine what we ought to do or forbear, or which thoſe Actions and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearances are, which are to be choſen and done, is the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Good</hi> of them, or that Pleaſure and Happineſs in the whole of our Nature and Duration, which naturally attends them.—For we find by Experience that ſome Things, Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Actions are in the very Nature of them neceſſarily
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:005794_0009_1026EF9805E677B0"/>attended with Pleaſure or Happineſs, and others with Pain or Miſery: And as Pleaſure or Happineſs is what we call <hi>Natural Good;</hi> ſo Pain or Miſery we call <hi>Natural Evil.</hi>—</p>
               <p n="10">10. I ſay, <hi>in the whole of our Nature and Duration,</hi> as we are both <hi>Senſitive</hi> and <hi>Rational,</hi> and <hi>Social</hi> and <hi>Immortal</hi> Creatures: —It muſt therefore be the Good and Happineſs of the <hi>whole human Nature,</hi> and the <hi>whole moral Syſtem,</hi> in <hi>Time</hi> and to all <hi>Eternity:</hi>— Hence, the <hi>Good</hi> of the <hi>Body,</hi> or the Pleaſure of Senſe ceaſes to be good, and hath the Nature of <hi>Evil,</hi> when it is inconſiſtent with the <hi>Good</hi> and Happineſs of the <hi>Soul:</hi>— Which is alſo the Caſe of <hi>private Good,</hi> ſo far forth as is it inconſiſtent with the <hi>Good</hi> of the <hi>Publick:</hi> And <hi>temporal Good,</hi> ſo far forth as it is inconſiſtent with that which is <hi>eternal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. And this our <hi>Good</hi> or Happineſs in the whole, does neceſſarily coincide with, and even reſult from the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> of Things, or Things, Affections and Actions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as being what they really are; for thus to conſider them, is the ſame Thing with conſidering them as being <hi>fitted</hi> and tending or not tending in the <hi>Nature</hi> of them to render our rational, ſocial and immortal Nature int he whole ultimately happy.—So that the <hi>general Good</hi> of <hi>the whole,</hi> the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Fitneſs of Things,</hi> and the <hi>Truth of Things,</hi> or Things conſidered as being what they are, are really coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, and do in Effect come to the ſame Thing in ſettling the <hi>Criterion</hi> of Right and Wrong, or the Teſt whereby we muſt determine what we are to chuſe or avoid, and to do or forbear.</p>
               <p n="12">12. <hi>Moral Good,</hi> therefore, muſt conſiſt in freely chuſing and acting conformable to the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Things;</hi> or to Things, Affections and Actions conſidered as being what they really are, i. e. as tending or not tending to our true Happineſs:— Or,(which is the ſame Thing,) in chuſing and acting according to the <hi>Fitneſs of Things,</hi> or to Things, Affections and Actions, conſidered as fitted in their own Nature to promote our beſt <hi>Good</hi> and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>in the whole.</hi>

13. And this again is the ſame Thing with chuſing and acting according to <hi>right Reaſon,</hi> it being by the right Uſe of our <hi>Reaſon,</hi> that we apprehend Things as being what they really are, and diſcover which thoſe Things, Affections and Actions are, that do in the Nature of them tend to our true Happineſs in the whole, and thereby judge what we muſt do and avoid, and form Rules by which we muſt act in all our Conduct and Behaviour in order that we may be truly happy.</p>
               <p n="14">14. (II.) The <hi>Obligation</hi> we are under, or that which binds or engages us as moral Agents (i. e. as intelligent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious deſigning free Agents) to do, what according to the Truth, Nature and Fitneſs of Things tends to our Happineſs in the whole, and to forbear the contrary, is twofold, <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Internal,</hi> or <hi>External</hi> and <hi>Moral.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15. (1.) The <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Internal Obligation</hi> we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to thoſe Actions and Forbearances ariſes from that great <hi>Law of our Nature,</hi> (which may be called the Law of <hi>Self-Love</hi> or <hi>Self-Eſteem,</hi> and which ariſes from the Conſciouſneſs of our Exiſtence and of Pleaſure or Pain) whereby we are, by the Author of our Being, laid under a Neceſſity of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luing our ſelves and our own <hi>Intereſt,</hi> and of ſeeking and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing our own <hi>Preſervation</hi> and <hi>Well-being</hi> or Happineſs, and whatever we find tends to it or is connected with it; and conſequently, that of the Society to which we belong, with which we find our own is, in the Nature of Things, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily connected.—This Principle makes us mutually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of each other's Eſteem and Good-Will, and puts us upon doing what we know may be pleaſing and advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous to each other, ſo that ſelf and ſocial Good muſt not be conſidered as at all interfering, but as being intirely coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, and ſubſervient to each other.</p>
               <p n="16">16. But while we reſt here and act upon no other Views or Motives than what this <hi>Law of our Nature</hi> ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſts, though what we do may be ſaid, according to the common Acceptation, to be meerly <hi>morally good</hi> or evil, and virtuous or vicious; yet there will be nothing in it,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:005794_0011_1026EF9D7283BB70"/>(however firm and ſtable our Conduct be) that can properly be called <hi>Religion,</hi> which muſt ever enter into the juſt and complete Notion of <hi>Morality;</hi> for this muſt be underſtood to comprehend every Thing that can either direct or influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence our moral Behaviour, and conſequently muſt conſider us in all the Relations wherein we ſtand, and above all, our Relation to the great Author of our Being.</p>
               <p n="17">17. (2.) The <hi>external</hi> and <hi>moral Obligation</hi> we are under to thoſe Actions and Forbearances above-mentioned ariſes from <hi>moral Government,</hi> or the Conſideration that they are the Will and Law of a Superior who aims at our Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in the enjoining of them, to whom we are account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for our Actions, and by whom we ſhall be rewarded or puniſhed, i. e. made to feel Pleaſure or Pain, according as we behave well or ill: So that this Obligation takes it's Force from the former.— And this is twofold, <hi>political</hi> and <hi>religious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="18">18. (1.) The <hi>political Obligation</hi> is the Conſideration that they are the public Will, or the Will and <hi>Law of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety</hi> or Government that we live under (whether indeed it be a Family or a State,) inforced by the Sanctions of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Rewards and Puniſhments. — In this View <hi>moral Laws,</hi> become <hi>political Laws,</hi> and <hi>moral Good, political Good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="19">19. But here again, while we reſt on this Foot, and act only under theſe political Views, with Regard meerly to this World; though we may be ſaid to be meer <hi>moral Men,</hi> (as that Expreſſion is commonly uſed) or <hi>good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealthſmen,</hi> we cannot be ſaid to be <hi>religious,</hi> or what we do to be <hi>Religion;</hi> no not even in thoſe Actions that relate to GOD Himſelf.— But,</p>
               <p n="20">20. (2.) The <hi>religious Obligation</hi> we are under to thoſe Actions and Forbearances which are neceſſary to our Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in the whole, is the Conſideration that they are the Will and <hi>Law of God</hi> our Creator, Preſerver and ſupreme moral Governour, the great Author, Head and Lord of
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:005794_0012_1026EF9FD0830530"/>the whole ſocial Syſtem, inforced by the Sanctions of <hi>eternal Rewards</hi> and <hi>Puniſhments,</hi> to whom we are accountable for all our Behaviour.</p>
               <p n="21">21. For it will appear hereafter that they muſt be the Will and Law of God concerning us, becauſe he, being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly happy and ſelf-ſufficient, can have no Self-End in giving us Being, and in all his Diſpenſations towards us, and that, indeed, he can have no other End than our true Happineſs; and that this muſt be his Intereſt; his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and his greateſt Glory, that his rational Creatures be, in the whole, a happy Syſtem.— And ſince it muſt be his Will that we be happy; whatſoever does, in the Nature of Things, and according to the Conſtitution which he hath made, tend to our true Happineſs, muſt be his <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Law</hi> concerning us, and conſequently our <hi>Duty,</hi> and what is contrary thereunto muſt be Sin.</p>
               <p n="22">22. That therefore, which conſtitutes the Nature of <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> and denominates our Actions or Behaviour <hi>religious,</hi> and makes <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Morality,</hi> in the complete Notion of it, coincident, is, That we forbear whatſoever tends to our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, and do every Thing that tends to our Happineſs in the whole, in Obedience to the Will of GOD, and from a Senſe of Duty to Him, and in View of his All ſeeing Eye, and the Account we are to give of our ſelves to him.</p>
               <p n="23">23. So that, upon the whole it appears, That <hi>true Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality,</hi> in the juſt Extent of it, is the ſame Thing with the <hi>Religion of Nature,</hi> or that <hi>Religion</hi> which is founded on the <hi>Nature</hi> of Things; and that it may be defined, <hi>The Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of our true Happineſs by thinking, affecting and acting ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Laws of Truth and right Reaſon, under a Senſe of the Duty that we owe to Almighty GOD, and the Account we muſt expect to give of our ſelves to him.</hi>

               <p n="24">4. Since therefore <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Duty</hi> are thus neceſſarily connected; it muſt be our Buſineſs in this Eſſay, to ſearch

               <p n="25">25. Now theſe may all be reduced to that grand, ancient Principle of true Wiſdom; <hi>Know thy ſelf,</hi> which muſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply; not meerly the Knowledge of our ſelves ſingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, but alſo in all the Relations wherein we ſtand; for this is the Knowledge of our ſelves in the whole; and, becauſe we are active as well as intelligent Cratures, and our Happineſs depends on Action as well as Thinking, it muſt therefore be underſtood to mean a <hi>practical Knowledge.</hi> — I ſhall therefore explain this Inquiry under theſe <hi>ſix</hi> following Heads, which, in Order the better to bring them down into Life and Action, I chuſe to expreſs in the firſt Perſon, or in the Manner of a Converſation with our ſelves.</p>
               <p n="26">26. Let therefore every one, in Order to the right Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of himſelf and his Duty and Happineſs, thus ſeriouſly reflect and inquire concerning himſelf.— I. <hi>What am I?</hi> — II. <hi>How came I to be what I am?</hi>— III. <hi>For what End was I made and have my Being?</hi>— IV. <hi>What ought I immediately to do and be in Order to anſwer the End of my Being?</hi>— V. <hi>Whether I am what I ought to be?</hi>— If not, VI. <hi>What ought I to do, as a Means, in Order to be and do what I ought, and in Order finally to anſwer the End of my Being?</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. I. IT is <hi>firſt</hi> neceſſary that we diſcover the <hi>Truths</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the <hi>ſpeculative</hi> Part of this Science, relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>GOD</hi> and our <hi>ſelves:</hi>—And, as we take our Riſe to the Knowledge of GOD and his Conduct towards us, from the Knowledge of our ſelves, we muſt therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with this:— And in Order hereunto, let every one ſeriouſly aſk himſelf this Queſtion:—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>What am I?</hi> — And that he may anſwer this Inquiry, let him thus conſider and reaſon with himſelf.—</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As I am certain from the Perceptions and Operations of my own Mind that <hi>I am</hi> or have a Being, ſo I know that I am not a Stock, a Stone or a Tree; for they have mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly no Senſe or Activity; whereas I am conſcious that I can See, Hear, Taſte, Smell, and Feel, and enjoy Pleaſure and ſuffer Pain, and can ſpontaneouſly exert my ſelf and act and move from Place to Place, in Purſuance of the one which I love and delight in, and for avoiding the other which I hate and dread: — all which are much nobler Power and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties than thoſe inanimate Beings are furniſhed with.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Nor yet am I Beaſt, a Horſe, a Dog, or an Ox, &amp;c.— For tho' they appear to ſee, hear, &amp;c. and to feel Pleaſure and Pain as I do, and can move themſelves ſpontaneouſly
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:005794_0015_1026EFA701BE2EA8"/>from Place to Place; yet they have but low grovelling Senſations, Exertions and Enjoyments.— They appear to have no Notion of any thing but the Objects of Senſe, and to have no Appetite, and to be capable of no Enjoyment of any thing but Meat and Drink and the Means of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing their Kind, and theſe only are the Things to which their Exertions and Activity tend.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. With Regard to theſe, they have, indeed, a wonderful Sagacity, and what looks like Deſign and Contrivance; but this does not ſeem to be their own, becauſe they have it originally, and do not acquire it by Teaching, Tryal and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry.— It ſeems therefore to be what we call an <hi>Inſtinct,</hi> by which Word, nothing elſe can be meant, but that they are rather paſſively acted and conducted by ſome other Being; ſome Governing Mind on whom they depend, according to certain Laws of Nature which He hath eſtabliſhed, than that they act from any Principle of Deliberation and Deſign with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in themſelves.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Theſe Senſations, Appetites and Exertions indeed I find I have in common with them; but then I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of vaſtly noble Powers and Faculties than theſe.— For I find I can reflect and look into my own Mind:—I can conſider my ſelf, and my own Powers and Actions and their Objects:—I can compare one Thing with another. —I can abſtract and give general Name:— I can judge of true and falſe, and of right and wrong:—I can deliberate and weigh Things, and reaſon and infer one Thing from another, and reduce them into Method and Order, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their various Relations, Connexions, and Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies: — I can excite Thoughts and Imaginations of Things paſt or abſent and recollect them in my Mind at Pleaſure, and reject or keep them under my Conſideration, as I pleaſe, at leaſt in a good Meaſure, and am at Liberty to ſuſpend judging till I have carefully examined them, and to act or not to act, in Conſequence of my Deliberations as I think fit.— In the Impreſſions of Senſe indeed, I am paſſive, but in all theſe I am evidently active, and can chuſe or refuſe, will or nill, act or not act, from a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:005794_0016_1026EFA9972AFC08"/>of Self-Exertion; which are all truly great and noble Powers.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. I can moreover, in Conſequence of theſe Abilities, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive and project Ends and Means and Reaſons of acting, and Rules to act by, and foreſee much of the Events of my Conduct:—I can give Laws and propoſe Motives to my ſelf or others, and exact an Account of my ſelf or them, and give an Account to my ſelf or others, whether I, or they, do or do not, act according to thoſe Laws.—And I find that as I love or hate Things according as they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeble or diſagreeable to me, ſo I have Hopes or Fears, Joys or Griefs according as I feel, or have in View, Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures or Pains, and am conſcious of having done well or ill and can juſtify and applaud, or accuſe or condemn myſelf or others accordingly.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. From hence I not only know that I have a Being, but alſo, that I have a great Enjoyment of that Being; — that it is very dear to me,—and that I am above all Things deſirous to preſerve and continue it, and to make it as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable and as happy as ever I can:— and am therefore concerned to acquire and enjoy all the Means and Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations that are neceſſary and convenient for that Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; which alſo I have a great Value for in Proportion to their Subſerviency for that End; and am very apt to be diſpleaſed at any one that would deprive me of them.—</p>
                  <p n="8">8. And as I can look back and remember what I have been knowing to in my Time; ſo I can imagine a Time when I was not, and conceive a Notion of a great Number of Ages and Tranſactions before me, and of an endleſs Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Ages and Tranſactions to come: — And not only conceive that I may, but earneſtly deſire, in ſome Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity or other, to bear a Part in them, and to enjoy my ſelf happily through all imaginable Periods of Duration.— So that, though I know there was a Time when I began to be; yet I am ſolicitous that I may never ceaſe to be, and to enjoy myſelf.— All theſe are ſo many Facts, and I
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:005794_0017_1026EFAB37D6B550"/>am conſcious and intuitively certian of them, if I look care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully within my ſelf.— And ſuch are the Properties of <hi>my Soul</hi> or <hi>Spirit,</hi> which is properly <hi>my ſelf,</hi> my reaſonable and active Nature.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. But beſides theſe Things that relate to my <hi>Soul; (my ſelf,</hi> or <hi>ſpiritual Nature;</hi>) I find that I have a wonderfully contrived and admirably uſeful Engine, <hi>my Body,</hi> which I conſtantly carry about me and animate throughout, (being tied and confined to it by the preſent Laws of my Nature) conſiſting of a vaſt Number and Variety of Parts and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, exquiſitely framed and fitted to each other, and to all the Functions, Powers and Exertions of my Soul.— My Eyes to ſee, my Ears to hear, my Tongue to ſpeak, my Hands to handle, and my Feet to walk, &amp;c. (Not to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a Thouſand Inſtances of the moſt wiſe Deſign and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance in all the inward Parts throughout, for all the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of the animal Oeconomy, which are not immediately ſubject to my own Will and Activity.) Upon the Account of which, as well as the abovementioned Powers of my Soul, I muſt confeſs that however I came to be, I am indeed <hi>fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and wonderfully made.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. I alſo find, upon looking about me, a vaſt Variety of ſenſible Objects;— a glorious Heaven above me, and a ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Earth beneath me, furniſhed with a ſurprizing Variety of Inhabitants, all connected, (together with my own Body, one of the moſt curious Machines of them all) in a moſt wonderful Manner one with another.—So that it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt from their mutual Dependance and Subſerviency, that they are contrived and deſigned to conſtitute, as in Fact they do, one harmonious beautiful and uſeful Syſtem; one complete and intire Whole; in which I find every Thing fitted in the beſt Manner, to my own Conveniences and Pleaſures, both for the comfortable Subſiſtence of my Body, and the Entertaimment and Delight of my Soul; but ſo that it was at the ſame Time the manifeſt Deſign of them to excite, engage, direct and employ my own Activity, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which I find I cannot comfortably enjoy either my ſelf or them.</p>

11. I can moreover carry my Thoughts and Imaginations throughout the vaſt Spaces of Heaven and Earth, and have a mighty Curioſity to pry and ſearch out the Secrets and Laws of Nature, and diſcover and conceive of the great Author of it, and what ſort of Behaviour and Conduct is ſuitable to my Nature and the Relation I ſtand in to Him and my Fellow Creatures, as tending to make me and them happy, and as ſuch muſt be amiable, and cannot fail of approving it ſelf not only to my own Reaſon and Conſcience, but alſo to Him and all reaſonable Beings, whoſe Eſteem and Good-will I am very ſolicitous to obtain.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Of which, as I know there are a great Number of my own Kind, ſo I cannot reaſonably doubt but there are others of various Orders above me, which may have other and noble Senſes than thoſe five narrow Inlets that I am ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with and confined to; and far greater and far greater and nobler Abilities, both of Underſtanding and Activity than I am fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with. — Such I can eaſily conceive to be poſſible: and from the various Gradations in Perfection of Being in the ſeveral Tribes below me, it is very probable there may be the like Gradations in the ſeveral Tribes of Beings above me.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. As to thoſe of my own Species, (from which I may form ſome Judgment of them) I find we were evidently made for Society, being furniſhed with the Power of Speech as well as Reaſon, whereby we are rendered capable of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into the Underſtanding of each other's Minds and Sentiments, and holding mutual Intercourſe and Commerce one with another, and jointly conſpiring to promote our common Well-Being; to which we are naturally led by a Principle of Benevolence and ſocial Diſpoſitions and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and by the neceſſary Condition of our Nature, which not only places us in the various Relations of Huſbands and Wives, Parents and Children, &amp;c. but alſo lays us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Neceſſity of mutual Dependance one upon another, which obliges us to enter into mutual Compacts for our Defence and Safety, and for maintaining both private Right and public Order, and promoting the common Good of
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:005794_0019_1026EFB004AE16F0"/>our Species, in the ſeveral Communities to which we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long— In a Word; as I cannot long enjoy my ſelf in a State of Solitude, and have a ſtrong Paſſion for Society; ſo I find in Fact that my true Intereſt and Enjoyment of my ſelf depends on the general Intereſt and good Order of the Community. —Such are my Abilities and Advantages; and ſuch my Condition and Circumſtances and thoſe of the Kind to which I ſtand related.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. But then, if I conſider my ſelf a little further, I find after all, that at beſt, I am attended with very great Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and Imperfections.—I cannot ſubſiſt my ſelf a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor add one Power or Faculty to thoſe I have: And there are certain Bounds, (ſmall compared with what I can eaſily imagine) beyond which I cannot at all extend or exert them.— My Sight and Hearing are very ſcanty; my Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding is but ſmall; my Conceptions are very feeble; my Memory is very brittle; my Attention is very weak; my Knowledge is very confuſed; my Will is very irreſolute, my Power is very infirm, and my Activity can extend to but a very ſmall Compaſs.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. But, which is worſe; I find I am troubled with ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Tendencies in the Frame of My Nature; ſome idle, ſenſual Diſpoſition or other; ſome impetuous Appetite, or ſome untoward Paſſion, which I find it very difficult to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, or keep within reaſonable Bounds, and in Indulgence to which, it is much if I have not contracted ſome ill Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit or other, or at leaſt been guilty of many grievous Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages, for which my own Reaſon and Conſcience have ſadly reproached me, and given me very great Uneaſineſs, and ſometimes terrible Apprehenſions and Forebodings of Vengeance to come, unleſs I repent and reform.— And by comparing my ſelf with others, I find this is what, in Fact, every one finds in ſome Degree or other to be the Caſe with himſelf, and Multitudes I oſerve are much under the Dominion of theſe perverſe Diſpoſitions: Hence the ſad Complaints of the Prevalence of Luſt, Paſſion, Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, Price and Deceit, much obtaining in the World, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting and biaſſing the Minds, perverting the Judgments
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:005794_0020_1026EFB353FBBCE8"/>and Reſolutions of Mankind, and leading them into many Errors and Vices in Practice, to the great Miſchief and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of Society.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. At the ſame Time I find by ſad Experience, that I amd daily liable to many Infirmities and Diſeaſes, Pains and Miſeries, Loſſes and Diſappointmets, and perpetual Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty, with Reſpect to my Life and Health, and every Thing about me, and muſt expect, in a little Time, to quit my preſent State of Being, and reſign to the common Fate of a Diſſolution, which is called <hi>Death</hi> that ghaſtly King of Terrors, who is inceſſantly making his Approaches towards me in one Shape or other.— Such a ſtrange Mixture is hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature!— Such an unhappy Creature is Man!

                  <p n="1">1. II. I Proceed now to the next Inquiry: Let every one then, in the <hi>ſecond</hi> Place, ſeriouſly aſk himſelf this Quaſtion, <hi>How came I to be, and to be ſuch a poor imperfect and ſinful Being as I am?</hi>—For we cannot have a right Knowledge of our ſelves without conſidering, not only what we are in our ſelves, but alſo how we ſtand vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly related, and particularly, without looking to the Cauſe of our preſent Being and Limitations.— And in Anſwer to this Queſtion, Let us conſider and reaſon with our ſelves in the following Manner.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="23" facs="unknown:005794_0021_1026EFB4F185FA80"/>
2. I know that I am made, becauſe I have a Being and did begin to be.— It is certain that I could not come into Being by meer <hi>Chance;</hi> for that is nothing but an emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Name, which we uſe only to cover our Ignorance or Inadvertence:— And it is no leſs certain that I did not make myſelf, for that would imply, to be and not to be at the ſame Time: Nor have I Power to continue my ſelf in Being ſo much as one Moment; nor can I a Moment ſecure my Health, or any of my Enjoyments:— So that I find I am wholly a limited and dependent Being.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is therefore certain, that I muſt have had a Cauſe: for an Effect without a Cauſe can have no Meaning: there muſt then be ſome other Being on whom I depend.—And ſince there cannot be an Effect without a Cauſe, it is evident that the Cauſe of my Being muſt have Powers capable of producing ſuch an Effect: otherwiſe there would ſtill be an effect without a Cauſe, than which nothing can be more abſurd.— It is evident that my Parents could not be the adequate Cauſes; they could, at moſt be only the Occaſions of my Being: for it never was in their Power, that I ſhould be at all, or being that I ſhould be ſuch as I am; nor could they continue me a Moment in Being, Health or Eaſe.— It is therefore plain that I muſt look higher for an adequate Cauſe, both of my Exiſtence and Subſiſtence.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is moreover manifeſt that no Cauſe can give what it has not, or, which is the ſame Thing, produce an Effect more noble than it ſelf; for then again, there would be an Effect without a Cauſe, or ſomething produced by no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, which is impoſſible.— So that what is deſtitute of Perception, Conſciouſneſs and Intelligence, cannot produce a perceptive, conſcious, intelligent Being: What has no Principle of Deliberation, Liberty and Activity cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a conſiderate, free, active Being, &amp;c. It is therefore evident that the Being who brought me into Being, muſt himſelf be poſſeſs'd of Powers analogous to thoſe I experience in my ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="24" facs="unknown:005794_0022_1026EFB7501DD6D8"/>
5. Since, therefore, I know I have ſome conſiderable Degrees of Underſtanding, Knowledge, Will, Force and Activity, with Freedom of Deliberation, Choice and Deſign, and the Powers of Self-Exertion and Self-Determination, together with ſome Senſe of Benevolence, of right and wrong, and of Equity and Iniquity, and ſome Diſpoſition to do the one, and avoid the other: It is from hence evident that the Almighty Being who made me, whom I call GOD, being the glorious Cauſe on whom I depend, muſt Himſelf have <hi>Underſtanding, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Will, Force</hi> and <hi>Activity;</hi> muſt have <hi>Liberty, Choice, Deliberation</hi> and <hi>Self-Exertion;</hi> and muſt be a Being of <hi>Equity, Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> and all other moral Perfections which are implied in theſe, and comprehended under the Term <hi>Holineſs.</hi>— And as I am thus truly made by him, and in ſome Meaſure to reſemble him; he muſt therefore be ſtrictly and properly my Parent, or the <hi>Father of my Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. Now what I thus argue from my ſelf to the Cauſe of my Being, muſt be equally true of every other intelligent active Being that knows he had a Beginning of Exiſtence, and is limited and dependent, however ſo perfect, as well as of me.— From whence it is plain, that this univerſal Cauſe muſt be poſſeſſed of the higheſt Powers and Perfections that do any where obtain; and that he muſt hold them intirely independant of any other Being whatſoever:— And having all other Beings intirely dependant upon him, it is evident that he cannot be under the Power of any other Being to limit or controul him;— ſo that he muſt hold, poſſeſs and enjoy <hi>all poſſible Perfection</hi> in and of himſelf <hi>without</hi> any poſſible <hi>Limitation</hi> or Imperfection.— And ſince all other Beings do thus by the Neceſſity of their Nature derive from him and depend on him, he alone muſt be the <hi>neceſſarily exiſtent</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note n="†" place="bottom">See Dr. <hi>Clark</hi>'s and <hi>Burnet's, Boyle</hi>'s Lectures on this Head.</note> and muſt be the univerſal <hi>Father of Spirits:</hi> And was accordingly by the wiſeſt of the ancient Philoſophers ſtiled, <hi>The Father of the Univerſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">
                     <pb n="25" facs="unknown:005794_0023_1026EFBA52852660"/>
7. In this Method of Reaſoning it is evident, that the Cauſe of my Being and Powers, and thoſe of all other Spirits, or intelligent, active Beings, muſt neceſſarily be <hi>infinite, eternal,</hi> and <hi>unchangeable.</hi>— For if he be out of the Power of any other Being to limit or controul him, his Knowledge, Power and Activity cannot be confined to any Point of Space or Duration, nor liable to any Change: So that, as there never was a Time when he could begin to be, ſo it is impoſſible he ſhould ever ceaſe to be, or ever be altered from what he is: And for the ſame Reaſon that he can't but be preſent here or there, or to any particular, aſſignable Place or Point of Space, he can't but be every where elſe or <hi>omnipreſent.</hi> And hence it is plain, that all Things paſt, preſent, and to come, in all Parts of the Univerſe, muſt at once be preſent and <hi>perfectly known</hi> to him, and ſubject to his Almighty Power; i. e. He muſt be <hi>omniſcient</hi> and <hi>omnipotent.</hi> Nor can there be more than <hi>one</hi> ſuch Being, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is thus evident that he alone muſt <hi>neceſſarily</hi> exiſt, and that <hi>all poſſible Perfections</hi> are neceſſarily united in him.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. What I have thus argued from my own Exiſtence. Powers and Faculties, and thoſe of every other intelligent, active Creature, may be alſo demonſtrated from the Exiſtence of every ſenſible Thing, that I ſee, hear and feel, from without me.— I know that I am not the Cauſe of any of thoſe Impreſſions that are made on my Senſes; Light, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, Sounds, tangible Qualities, &amp;c. — I am ſure they do not depend on my Will and Activity, for I am intirely paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive in the Reception of them.—Nor can they be without a Cauſe; nor yet from any ſenſleſs, inert or unactive Cauſe, for that is a Contradiction in Terms. — They muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be the conſtant Effects of an intelligent Cauſe, intimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſent with me, and inceſſantly active upon me, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually produces all theſe Senſations in my Mind, correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the Archetypes in his all-comprehending Mind, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to certain ſtable Laws, or fixed Rules which he hath eſtabliſhed to himſelf, and which are commonly called the Laws of Nature.— When therefore, I conſider the whole Syſtem of theſe ſenſible Objects that ſurround me, and under the Impreſſion of which I continually live, I muſt conclude
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:005794_0024_1026EFBCA61D7628"/>that I <hi>live and move and have my Being</hi> in him who is the perpetual and invariable Author of them.<note n="†" place="bottom">V. Bp. <hi>Berkley</hi>'s Dialogues, P. 78, 79, &amp;c.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. I find theſe ſenſible Objects are all firmly connected toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; Things viſible with Things tangible, and all the various Combinations of them, one with another, ſo as to conſtitute one moſt beautiful and uſeful Whole, which we call the <hi>Natural World;</hi> in all which, I do manifeſtly ſee the moſt wiſe Deſign and the moſt exquiſite Contrivance; from whence I gather that they muſt be the Effect of a moſt wiſe and deſigning Cauſe. — And I do evidently experience that they are all contrived in the beſt Manner to render them ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to all the Purpoſes of my Subſiſtence and Well-being, and that of the whole rational and moral Syſtem which we call the <hi>moral World;</hi> from whence I muſt conclude the glorious Cauſe of them to be, not only an infinitely <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>powerful,</hi> but moreover an infinitely <hi>kind</hi> and <hi>benevolent Being.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. I do not, indeed, find upon a cloſe Examination of them, that there is any neceſſary Connexion between them; for Inſtance, between what I ſee or hear, and what I feel: The one appears to be only and meerly the Sign, and not the Cauſe of the other, being all alike meer paſſive Perceptions in our Minds; ſo that the Connexion between them, tho' ſtable, is intirely arbitrary; as arbitrary as that between the Sound <hi>Man</hi> and the Thing ſignified by it: From whence I gather, that I muſt neceſſarily conſider the one with regard to the other, to have the Nature of a wonderful Language,<note n="*" place="bottom">Minute Philoſopher, Dial. 4.</note> whereby the great Author of Nature is continually preſent with me; and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering himſelf and his Mind and Will to me; (and that in a ſtable and invariable Manner, which I can always depend upon;) and as it were ſpeaking to me, and directing me how to act and conduct my ſelf in the Affairs of Life; and thereby diſplaying, not only his infinite <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> but alſo his marvellous <hi>Goodneſs</hi> before me, and making me a continual Partaker of it.—From whence it is evident, that he muſt be, not only a Being of infinite
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:005794_0025_1026EFBE48C68560"/>Wiſdom, Power and Goodneſs, but at the ſame time a Being of the moſt ſtable Truth and invariable Integrity.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. I do moreover ſee and feel a vaſt Variety of Motions, on the Laws of which, moſt wiſely contrived, depends the whole Order, Harmony and Uſefulneſs of the natural World. — But it is certain that nothing which is Corporeal can move it ſelf, being meerly paſſive and inert: and yet it is no leſs evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that Motion implies Force and Activity in the Mover:<note n="*" place="bottom">Mens agitat molem. <hi>Virg.</hi>
                     </note> and this implies the Power and Preſence of an Agent, ſince nothing can act where it is not: — from whence it manifeſtly follows, that in all the wiſely contrived Motions of Nature, as well as all other Objects of Senſe, both in the Heavens above, and in the Earth below, we conſtantly ſee and feel the univerſal Preſence of that moſt wiſely deſigning and moſt powerfully active, all-comprehending Mind who both begins and continues Motion, and is the glorious Father and Author of all Things.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Furthermore, as I obſerve all theſe ſenſible Objects about me are connected together in a wonderful Manner, into one moſt beautiful and uſeful Syſtem, and made ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to my Subſiſtence and Well-being and thoſe of my Species in this Manſion allotted to us; ſo I obſerve this <hi>Globe</hi> we live on, to be, no leſs wonderfully connected with the <hi>Sun,</hi> and the other <hi>Planets,</hi> with us ſurrounding and depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon him, ſo that they all make one intire Syſtem; the other Globes being probably deſigned for Uſes analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gous to this of ours.— And as the prodigious Number of <hi>Fixed Stars</hi> ſeem to be of the ſame Nature, ſo it is probable, they are deſigned for the like Purpoſes with thoſe for which I find our <hi>Sun</hi> is manifeſtly fitted and deſigned, and may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently have Globes like our's depending upon them. — If ſo; as this gives me a ſtupendous Idea of the vaſt Extent and Variety of the mighty Works of God; ſo it muſt give me an aſtoniſhing Apprehenſion of his excellent <hi>Greatneſs, Majeſty</hi> and <hi>Glory,</hi> who is equally preſent with them all, and does alike diſplay his infinite <hi>Wiſdom, Power</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs</hi> in them to all the admiring Beholders; having his whole vaſt.
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:005794_0026_1026EFBFE9B7E2C8"/>
                     <hi>Family of Heaven and Earth,</hi> alike depending upon him, and deriving their All from him, in <hi>all Places of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="13">13. Now, it being evident from all that has been ſaid, that this glorious Being whom I call my <hi>GOD,</hi> muſt be a Being of all poſſible Perfection; it is plain that he muſt have an intire and abſolute <hi>Sufficiency</hi> in and of himſelf to his own Happineſs, and therefore cannot need any of his Creatures, or any Thing they can do to make him happy, nor can any Thing they can do make him otherwiſe.— And from his abſolute <hi>Independency,</hi> and their continual and intire Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon him, I muſt conclude, that he is not only the <hi>Almighty Creator</hi> and <hi>moſt high Poſſeſſor of Heaven and Earth;</hi> but moreover, that he is the continual <hi>Preſerver</hi> of all his Creatures, and conſequently, that the Moment he ſhould ceaſe to will the Continuance of their Exiſtence, they muſt unavoidably ceaſe and drop into nothing.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. Nor can it, I think, be conceived that the infinitely wiſe, powerful, juſt and good Author of my Being, and that of all other Beings, would neglect me, and take no further Care of me or them: I cannot imagine but that he muſt look after me, and ſee what Uſe I make of the Being, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Advantages that he hath given me, and take Care to conduct me to the End he deſigned in giving them to me, and that in a Manner ſutable to that Nature which he hath given me.—It cannot therefore be, but, that he muſt <hi>govern</hi> me as a reaſonable and moral Agent, and this by Laws and Motives ſuggeſted to my Reaſon and Conſideration, and to my Hopes and Fears: and that in Conſequence of this, he will call me to an Account, and ſee how I have conducted my ſelf in the Uſe of the Abilities and Talents which he had committed to my Truſt, and whether I have endeavoured to anſwer the End of my Being in Conformity to the Laws of that reaſonable and ſelf-active Nature which he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon me, and make me fare well or ill, according as my Behaviour ſhall be found to have been good or bad. — That this is fit and reaſonable to be expected my own Conſcience ſtrongly ſuggeſts: and that Happineſs or Miſery
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:005794_0027_1026EFC279BC3278"/>will be the Effect of Virtue or Vice, the Nature of the Things themſelves loudly proclaims. — It cannot therefore be but that, as he is my Almighty <hi>Creator</hi> and <hi>Preſerver,</hi> ſo he muſt be my ſupreme <hi>King</hi> and <hi>moral Governor.</hi> And what is thus reaſonable to think with regard to my ſelf, muſt be equally true with Reſpect to all other Creatures: — GOD muſt therefore be the univerſal <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Lord</hi> of the whole Univerſe, which is his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> in which he moſt wiſely and uncontroulably preſides and orders all Things for the Good of the whole, in a Manner ſuitable to the beſt Intereſt of each Nature. I cannot therefore doubt but that he will in the whole and Reſult of Things, bring Good out of Evil and make Evil it ſelf ſubſervient to Good, and even overrule the Sins and Follies of his Creatures ſo as to anſwer the beſt Ends.—</p>
                  <p n="15">15. If now it be inquired, <hi>How I came to be ſuch an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, frail, ſinful Being as I am?</hi>— Or how it could be that the GOD that made me, who is himſelf the moſt perfect and beſt of Beings ſhould make me ſuch an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, ſinful and miſerable Creature as I find my ſelf to be? — To this I muſt anſwer in the following Manner. — That GOD ſhould make me ſuch a very imperfect, (or leſs perfect) Creature as I am, compared with others, or with what I can eaſily imagine, I ſee no Reaſon to doubt; inaſmuch as my Being it ſelf and every Perfection of it and Advantage attending it, muſt be his ſovereign free Gift, and what he was in no wiſe obliged to beſtow.— He is the ſovereign Lord of his Favours, and muſt therefore be intirely at Liberty to beſtow ſuch Degrees of Being and Perfections, and ſuch Advantages, greater or leſs as he thinks fit: and it appears in Fact, that he hath delighted in a boundleſs Variety in all his Works.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. Indeed that he ſhould, without any known, voluntary Fault of mine, put me into a Condition that is, in the whole, worſe than not to be, or that he ſhould, in giving me my Being, lay me under an abſolute Neceſſity of being finally ſinful and miſerable: This would be very hard indeed; — But this I muſt think impoſſible, as being what I cannot
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:005794_0028_1026EFC6351DC740"/>reconcile with his Attributes above demonſtrated<note n="†" place="bottom">See <hi>W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="17">17. And as to my being ſo very <hi>ſinful</hi> a Creature as I confeſs I am: — This I cannot aſcribe to GOD: — For ſince the formal Notion of <hi>Sin</hi> conſiſts in the known voluntary Oppoſition of our Wills to the Will of GOD, or the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution which he hath made, it muſt be the Fault of my Will and not of his: and accordingly my own Conſcience tells me, whenever I do amiſs, that I my ſelf. (and not He) am the Cauſe, and true Author of all the Wickedneſs I commit. — If therefore, inſtead of being obedient to the Author of my Being, and making a good Uſe of my Liberty, and of the Powers and Advantages he hath given me, and thereby further improving them; I make a bad Uſe of them by voluntarily acting contrary to his Will, and thereby ſink my ſelf into a worſe Condition; nay though it were into a worſe Condition than not to be, it is wholly owing to my ſelf, and not to him that made me.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. If now I ſhould aſk, Why has God made me at all peccable, or capable of Sin? — This would be the ſame as to aſk, Why has he made me capable of Duty? or, Why has he made me a free Agent? — But this would be a ſtrange Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion: for without Liberty, I ſhould be deſtitute of one of the chief Excellencies of my rational Nature, and ſhould not be capable of either Duty or Sin: — for as Sin conſiſts in a free and voluntary Diſobedience; ſo Duty conſiſts in a free and willing Obedience to the known Will of God. — So that without ſuch a Liberty as would render me capable of Sin,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:005794_0029_1026EFC7D94C6120"/>there could have been no ſuch Thing as either Virtue or Vice, Praiſe or Blame; nor can either the one or the other obtain, but in Proportion to the Knowledge we have, or may have, of what we ought to do, and the Powers we are furniſhed with either to do or forbear.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. And laſtly, As to the many Pains, Calamities, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries to which I am liable: — I muſt think, that as I am a Sinner I need a Courſe of Diſcipline; — That it is fit, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Evil ſhould attend moral Evil, as the beſt Means for the Cure of it; — and that therefore God, not only juſtly, but wiſely and kindly inflicts theſe Calamities, as being the fitteſt Means that could have been uſed to diſengage me from thoſe Objects that are moſt apt to enſnare and miſlead me, and thereby to deſtroy the Power of Sin, and bring me to Repentance and Reformation: — and at the ſame Time they give me Occaſion and Opportunity for the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of ſeveral Virtues of very great Uſe towards the perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of my reaſonable and active Nature, which otherwiſe could have had no Place; and lead to the Hopes of a better Life hereafter.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. Thus it appears to me, that without any Imputation either upon the Wiſdom, Power, Juſtice or Goodneſs of GOD, I can ſufficiently account for all the Sin and Miſery that obtain in the World.—But if there were ſome untoward Appearances in the Conduct of Providence that I could not account for, they ought not to be admitted as any juſt Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections againſt what has been antecedently demonſtrated:— Eſpecially ſince I am not qualified to be a competent Judge. — I ſee but a ſmall Part, a ſhort Scene, of the vaſt Drama, and therefore cannot make a good Judgment of the whole: — So that what to me may have the Appearance of Evil, may in the whole have the Nature of Good.— And it becomes me to have an implicit Faith in the infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Power, Juſtice and Goodneſs of the Deity above de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated, that it will prove ſo in the Whole and Reſult of Things.— And that this Expectation may appear the more reaſonable, I proceed now to the next Inquiry.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. III. LET every one then in the <hi>third</hi> Place, ſeriouſly conſider and inquire with himſelf, <hi>For what End was I thus brought into Being, and am thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ſubſiſted by Almighty GOD?</hi>— And for the Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of this Queſtion, let him thus think and reaſon with himſelf. —</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That I was not made at all adventures, without any Contrivance and Deſign, but muſt have been made for ſome End or other, I cannot doubt, ſince I have already found that he who gave me my Being, muſt himſelf be a Being of all poſſible Perfections, and conſequently muſt be a moſt kind, wiſe and deſigning Cauſe: Eſpecially, ſince I do alſo find in Fact ſo many, and ſuch manifeſt Tokens of the wiſeſt and moſt benevolent Deſign and Contrivance in my whole Frame and every Thing about me.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Being therefore made by a moſt wiſe, and good Cauſe, I muſt neceſſarily have been made for ſome wiſe and good End.— And having demonſtrated that the Being who made me has an infinite Sufficiency within himſelf for his own Happineſs, independant of any other Being, it is manifeſt, that whatever good End he had in giving me my Being, it could not be to ſerve himſelf of me, or to promote any Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to himſelf by me.— This were a Thought infinitely too mean to entertain of him who is <hi>GOD All-ſufficient,</hi> that it could be poſſible for him to ſtand in Need of Me, or of any Thing <hi>I</hi> could do or ſuffer in order to his own Happineſs. —</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Moreover, ſince it has been evidently diſcovered, that the Author of my Being is infinitely perfect, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:005794_0031_1026EFCCB050D1F8"/>perfectly juſt and good; perfectly equitable and benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent; it is hence evident, that he could not give me my Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with any malevolent Deſign; much leſs with a Deſign that I ſhould be abſolutely and unavoidably miſerable not could he deſign Miſery, for me in the whole, but in Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of my perſonal, voluntary Demerit, and perſiſting in wilful Rebellion againſt him;— for this would be ſo far from conſiſting with Juſtice and Benevolence, that it would be the ſevereſt Cruelty imaginable!— A Thought which we ſhould abhor to entertain of the beſt of Beings, and remove at an infinite Diſtance from him.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Indeed in Caſe of wilful Rebellion perſiſted in, it is fit and right, and even neceſſary for the Good of the whole, (being the moſt effectual Means to ſecure the Obedience of his Creatures, which is neceſſary for their general Good and Happineſs) that Puniſhment ſhould be inflicted upon thoſe that rebel, and obſtinately oppoſe their Wills to the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution he has made, and the Ends of his Government, in Proportion to their ſeveral Crimes and Miſdemeanours. — And indeed Miſchief and Miſery, does, in the Nature of Things, neceſſarily reſult from Sin and Vice.— But it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſuppoſed, that their Miſery could be GOD's primary and abſolute Deſign, or that he ſhould intend their Rebellion, or lay them under a Neceſſity of ſinning, that they might be miſerable;— for this would, in Effect, be, to will Miſery for Miſery's Sake; which to him is infinitely impoſſible!</p>
                  <p n="6">6. On the contrary, ſince GOD is evidently a moſt kind and benevolent Being, and could therefore have no other than kind and benevolent Ends in giving Being to his rational Creatures, it is plain that his primary Intention muſt have been ſo far from that of making them to be miſerable, that he muſt have made them with a Deſign that they might be happy in the Participation and Enjoyment of his Goodneſs, in Proportion to their ſeveral Capacities.—Now the Queſtion is, what is requiſite to the Happineſs of theſe Creatures? — It is plain that they cannot enjoy any Thing elſe, unleſs they are in a Condition firſt to enjoy themſelves: It is no leſs plain that they cannot enjoy themſelves, unleſs they act
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:005794_0032_1026EFCFB619EA20"/>according to the Law of their Nature; for otherwiſe they act inconſiſtent with themſelves:— and by doing ſo, they do a Violence to their own Nature: And in this Caſe they can't but be miſerable.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Since, therefore, GOD has made them to be intelligent, free, active Creatures, their Happineſs muſt immediately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the right Uſe of the Powers he has given them: i. e. It muſt depend upon, conſiſt in the free and vigorous Exertion of their own Underſtanding and Activity, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the great Law of their Nature, which is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Senſe of their own Reaſon and Conſciences.— It muſt therefore have been his Deſign that they ſhould be happy by Means of their own Activity, and by their freely acting reaſonably, or conformable to the right Dictates of their own Reaſon and Underſtanding, and conſequently that they ſhould cultivate and improve their Reaſon in the beſt Manner they can, under the Circumſtances in which he has placed them, in order to make a right Judgment how they ought to act and conduct themſelves, to the beſt Advantage for their own Happineſs.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. It may indeed be truly ſaid that <hi>GOD made all Things for his own Glory.</hi>— But then wherein does his Glory conſiſt? — It cannot, ſure, conſiſt in the Diſorder, Confuſion and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of his Creatures:— This is impoſſible, nor can it conſiſt meerly in being applauded by them:—It is indeed fit and right in itſelf, and for our Good, and therefore he requires it, that we ſhould daily acknowledge him to be what he is, our Creator, Preſerver and Benefactor: and nothing can be of greater Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to us than that we live under an habitual Senſe of this:— But it would be a moſt unworthy Thought of him, to imagine that he made us for the Sake of being applauded by us, or that he requires even theſe juſt Acknowledgments for his own Sake, as though we or our Services could be any Advantage to him. — This would be to make him a moſt ſelfiſh Being indeed: Eſpecially if we ſhould imagine that he could aim at Applauſe or Glory, at the Expence of our unavoidable, exquiſite and endleſs Miſery: This would be a horrid Thought.</p>
                  <p n="9">
                     <pb n="35" facs="unknown:005794_0033_1026EFD15A373268"/>
9. No: So far from this, that I muſt conceive the Glory of GOD to conſiſt in the Communication of Perfections an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogous to his own, and in the diſplaying his Goodneſs to his Creatures, and making them happy in the Participation of it, in Proportion to their ſeveral Capacities, and this in Conſequence of their acting according to the Law of their ſeveral Natures. — For ſince he was pleaſed to give them a Being, it cannot be but that, as the tender Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his own Off-ſpring, he muſt account it his greateſt Intereſt and Glory, to ſee them as happy as may be, conſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the Intereſt of the whole (to which it is fit, every Individual ſhould reſign) and take Pleaſure in every Thing that contributes to their Happineſs, and abhor whatſoever is deſtructive to it, and inconſiſtent with it, as his greateſt Diſhonour.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. For ſince he that wills the End muſt will the Means neceſſary to that End, it is plain that, ſince GOD can't but will their Happineſs in the whole, as their End, and his greateſt Glory, it muſt be his Will and Law concerning them, that they avoid every Thing that does in the Nature of it, tend to make them miſerable, and that they do every Thing that does, in the Nature of it, tend to make them happy.— So that the Glory of GOD and our Happineſs with the Means neceſſary to it, and his Diſhonour and our Miſery with the Means which tend to that, muſt neceſſarily be coincident and be in Effect one and the ſame Thing.—</p>
                  <p n="11">11. And, ſince Sin and Vice does, in the Nature of it, tend to make us miſerable; being contrary to all that is right and reaſonable; contrary to the Attributes and Will of GOD, to the Senſe of our own Minds, and to all the Intereſts of Society; and muſt therefore do a perpetual Violence to our reaſonable and ſocial Nature, and conſequently be moſt odious in the Sight of all intelligent Beings, as being unavoidably attended with Horror and Confuſion both perſonal and ſocial.— And, ſince, on the other Hand, a virtuous and dutiful Temper and Behaviour does, in the Nature of it, tend to our Happineſs; becauſe it conſiſts in doing all that is right and reaſonable; all that is agreeable to the Attributes and Will of GOD, to
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:005794_0034_1026EFD3B23ED2D0"/>the Senſe of our own Minds, and to all the Intereſts of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety and therefore muſt neceſſarily be moſt amiable in the Sight of all reaſonable Beings, as being attended with uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Harmony, Peace and Joy, both within and without, with Regard both to GOD and Man: It is hence manifeſt, that GOD's greateſt Glory muſt conſiſt in our purſuing our own Happineſs by avoiding the one, and doing the other.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. But now to return.— Since I am convinced, from the above Method of Reaſoning, that my Well-being and Happineſs muſt have been GOD's End in giving me my Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I muſt, for the ſame Reaſon, be perſwaded, that it muſt be a Happineſs ſuitable to that Nature which he hath given me in the whole of it:— And conſequently, ſince, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides an animal and ſenſitive, he has moreover given me a rational, an active and ſocial Nature; as my ſuperior and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Character, it is plain, he muſt have deſigned me, not meerly for a ſenſual and animal, but chiefly for a rational, active and ſocial Happineſs.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. It cannot, therefore, be ſuppoſed to be an End worthy of GOD and agreable to the Nature which he hath given me, in the whole of it, that I ſhould have been brought into Being only to eat, and drink, and ſleep, and enjoy the carnal Gratifications of the animal Life, and that my Reaſon and other ſuperiour Powers ſhould be deſigned only to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to theſe inferiour Pleaſures, (and in Effect to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me more a Beaſt than I ſhould have been without them;) — and that after a few Days ſpent in theſe low, grovelling Purſuits and Enjoyments, I ſhould then be utterly extinct, ceaſe and be no more. — Theſe ſhort-lived animal Enjoyments are indeed Ends ſuitable to the Nature of a meer Beaſt, and for which he is truly better qualified than I am: — but if theſe could be ſuppoſed all the Ends that I was made for, the noble Powers of Reaſon, Reflection, Conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Self-Exertion and Self-Determination muſt have been given me in vain; nay indeed to the worſt Purpoſes; for in this Caſe they can only ſerve to make me more wretched than I ſhould have been without them, as they ſerve only to make me more exquiſitely ſenſual, and, at the ſame Time ſenſible of my Wretchedneſs,</p>
                  <p n="14">
                     <pb n="37" facs="unknown:005794_0035_1026EFD6B6F1D390"/>
14. At leaſt this is certain, that theſe noble Powers render me capable of a vaſtly higher End and nobler Happineſs: — But when I conſider the wretched Circumſtances of my Condition in this Life, it is plain that ſuch a Happineſs can be but a little while, and but very imperfectly enjoyed, in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſhort and uncertain State, amid ſo many Sins and Follies, Embarraſments and Perplexities as I am, at beſt, unavoidably attended with here.— Since therefore I am evidently made for ſuch an Happineſs, and that it can't attain to any tolerable Degree of Perfection here; I muſt conclude that my Exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſhall undoubtedly reach beyond this ſhort and uncertain Life, and extend forward to Eternal Ages. — Without this Concluſion, I cannot ſee how I ſhall ever attain to any End worthy of the Wiſdom and Goodneſs of the GOD that made me, and ſuitable to the ſuperiour Nature and Powers which he hath given me, and the ſuperiour Happineſs I am evidently capable of. —</p>
                  <p n="15">15. And that I may live on in ſpite of what is vulgarly called Death, and am capable of proceeding on to a nobler and more perfect kind of Life, I cannot doubt when I conſider the vaſtly different Natures of Spirit and Body whereof I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt (the one perceptive, conſcious and ſelf-active, the other meerly ſenſleſs, inert and paſſive;) ſo intirely different, that I cannot conceive of any neceſſary Connection between them: I can conceive of no other than a meer arbitrary Connection, depending only on the Laws of their Union, which in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſo different, can be no other than the meer Will of God, ſo that the Soul being of a Nature intirely different from the Body cannot be capable of any corporeal Laws or Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and conſequently cannot be liable to any ſuch Change or Diſſolution as Bodies are, i. e. being an active, ſimple, unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, indiviſible Subſtance, it muſt be naturally indiſcerpible, and conſequently incorruptible. — I cannot therefore imagine how the Diſſolution of the Body ſhould affect the Exiſtence of the Soul, any more than the putting off an old Garment to put on a new one, ſhould affect the Exiſtence of the Body. — ſo that I cannot conſider my Body as being my ſelf.<note n="†" place="bottom">

                  <p n="16">16. Inaſmuch, therefore as I am a Spirit of an incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Nature, and know that I have Powers capable of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime and noble Pleaſures of Contemplation and Virtue, which yet cannot, in any Meaſure, attain to their Perfection here; I muſt believe, that if I am not wanting to my ſelf, they ſhall attain to it hereafter.— I can indeed, with much Labour and Struggle make ſome little Proficiency in my preſent State: — But when I have done ſo, and am capable and deſirous of proceeding further, muſt I ceaſe and be no more?— Can it be thought that the tender <hi>Father of my Spirit,</hi> would, after all my Pains, daſh me to nothing, and at once fruſtrate all my Labours?—Can there, in this Caſe, any wiſe and good Reaſons be conceived for putting an End to my Being and my Hopes together?— On the contrary, would not this ſeem extremely hard and unreaſonable, and conſequently ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly inconſiſtent with the Conduct of him who is a Being perfectly reaſonable and equitable?— I find in my ſelf an eager Appetite and earneſt Aſpiration after Immortality, that I may be capable of an endleſs Enjoyment of thoſe noble and immortal Pleaſures, which I cannot diſengage my ſelf from. — Now I do not find any Appetite, no, not of the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Kind, nor in the moſt deſpicable Creature, but that GOD has provided a ſutable Object correſpondent to it;— Can I then imagine that he would create ſuch a noble Appetite in ſo noble a Creature as Man, and have provided no Object ſutable and correſpondent to that?— It cannot be!</p>
                  <p n="17">17. This Reaſoning is abundantly confirmed to be right, when I conſider further,<note n="*" place="bottom">See this Argument finiſhed in the beſt Manner, by Mr. <hi>Wollaſton,</hi> Rel. Nat. Pag. 200—210.</note> that in my preſent Situation, a long and laborious Courſe of ſtedfaſt perſiſting in the Cauſe of Truth and Virtue in Spite of the ſtrongeſt Solicitations to the
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:005794_0037_1026EFDAAA3A3610"/>contrary, is, many Times contemned, diſregarded, and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſly oppreſſed, without any Redreſs, and perſecuted even to Death it ſelf; and that as long a Courſe of unreſtrained Indulgence to the vileſt and moſt miſchievous Vices is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently attended with uninterrupted Proſperity to the very laſt. — I cannot therefore doubt, from the Wiſdom, Power, Holineſs, Juſtice and Goodneſs of GOD, but that the Time muſt come, when he will bring Good out of all this Evil, and <hi>theſe crooked Ways ſhall be made ſtrait,</hi> and that he who can't but love Virtue, as being his own Likeneſs, will regard it and make it in the whole eventually happy, even above and beyond its natural Tendency: — And that he who can't but hate Vice, as being contrary to his Nature, will eventually puniſh it with due Severity and make it very miſerable, which indeed it cannot but be in the Nature of the Thing if ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. The chief Difficulty that lies in the Way of this Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion, of a future State, is the <hi>Inconceivableneſs</hi> of it. — But this, I think, can be no reaſonable Objection. — For who that had never ſeen any thing but the univerſal Death of a ſevere and horrid Winter, could conceive any thing of the exquiſite Beauties and admirable Productions of a fine Spring and Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer? — Indeed, I can no more conceive how my Soul is now united to my Body, and perceives and acts by means of it, and by a meer Thought, can move it's unweildy Limbs at Pleaſure, than I can conceive how it can exiſt, perceive, and act, after what we call Death, without this groſs tangible Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine, to which it is at preſent confined. — I can however a little aſſiſt my Imagination in forming ſome glimmering Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that future State from this eaſy Suppoſition of a Man born blind and deaf, who, at the ſame Time has the Senſes of feeling, taſting, and ſmelling.<note n="†" place="bottom">Guardian No. 27.</note> Now to this Man the tangi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble World, with the various Objects of Taſte and Smell, is all the World that he can have any Notion of, any more than I can conceive of the future State of my Being, and of thoſe <hi>Things which Eye hath not ſeen, nor Ear heard, nor have they entered into the Heart of Man to conceive.</hi> — I who have the viſible World about me, and the Perception of various Sounds,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:005794_0038_1026EFDC50C7D278"/>am to this Man, what I may ſuppoſe Angels and other Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are to me: He can no more conceive of the viſible World that I converſe with, than I can conceive of the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual World, or the future State of my Being. — Now let me only conceive this Man to be deprived of the Senſes of Feeling, Taſting and Smelling, and he is dead; intirely dead to all the World that he ever had any Notion of. But then imagine his Eyes and Ears to be open'd, and to have this glorious Show of viſible Objects, Light and Colours, with all their various Modifications, ſet before him, with a no leſs, wonderful Variety of Harmonious Sounds; I muſt needs conceive him to have intirely a new World open upon him, to which he was before an utter Stranger. He is indeed dead to the dark tangible World, but he has exchanged it for a new viſible, World. — Such a Change is very conceivable; but it can't be imagined that, what we call Death, can be a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; nor can I believe it will be ſo great a Change, it being highly probable that ſeeing, hearing, and ſome neceſſary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Feeling are common to both our preſent and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture State, and a Fund to begin with (together with our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual and moral Accompliſhments) when we enter upon that new Condition; wherein I can conceive that other, and more exquiſite Senſes may be added to theſe, and not only theſe Senſes, but alſo our Underſtanding, Memory and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity advanced to a much greater Perfection than they had bofore. — And becauſe our Happineſs muſt imply Society and Commerce with each other, and with the external World about us; it cannot be imagined but that we ſhall go off, and be always attended with fine, ſenſible Vehicles,<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  <p n="19">19. Furthermore, to add another Reſemblance: — I ſee here a Multitude of deſpicable Worms, confined to a ſlow Motion, and a few low, grovelling Senſations and Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which, after a ſhort Period of ſeeming Death, by a wonderful Transformation, turn into beautiful Winged Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, and waft themſelves, at Pleaſure, through the Air, and
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:005794_0039_1026EFE039C137A0"/>enjoy Pleaſures they were before uncapable of. — Now may it not reaſonably be thought that theſe Creatures were deſigned to be Emblems of my own Caſe?— I am here like them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to a little Compaſs of Ground, and a few ſlow Motions, feeble Exertions, and low, and comparatively mean Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.— But if I ſhall have acted my Part well, in Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to what Powers and Advanges I now enjoy, may I not reaſonably hope, after my ſeeming Death, to paſs into a new and glorious State, compared with which, my preſent Enjoyments are, in a Manner contemptible, and my preſent Life little better than a Dream?—May I not hope that when I am freed from this groſs, unweildy Body, and from my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Limitations and Confinements, and from all my preſent Diſeaſes, Sins and Temptations, to have my Powers greatly enlarged, and to be furniſhed with a pure Aethereal Vehicle; and in that Capacity, to ſhift the Scene at Pleaſure, and traverſe through the vaſt Fields of<note n="†" place="bottom">

                  <p n="20">20. Upon the whole, therefore, as I cannot think the true End of my Being, eſpecially of that ſuperior Nature which is my peculiar Character, can be anſwered meerly by living this wretched, ſhort and uncertain Life that is allotted to me here, ſo I muſt be perſwaded, that I am deſigned for ſome other and nobler Condition of Being hereafter, and cannot avoid having <hi>Hopes full of Immortality.</hi> — So that the only conſiſtent Notion I can form of this Life muſt be this; — that, as it is the firſt Stage of my Being, ſo it is deſign'd only for a State of Childhood, Diſcipline and Probation in order to another and better State hereafter, which, in the Reſult, is to be a State of perfect Manhood and Retribution. — And
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:005794_0040_1026EFE1DCBF92C8"/>conſequently, in Order to qualify my ſelf for that happy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, it muſt be my greateſt Care; and the moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Buſineſs of my Life, while I continue here, to acquire and improve my ſelf in, all thoſe Accompliſhments both of Knowledge and Virtue, and that both perſonal and ſocial, wherein the Perfection and Happineſs of my ſuperior, rational and immortal Nature conſiſts, which alone, I can carry with me into that future State; and which alone can enable me to enjoy my ſelf and my Friends, and above all my GOD, who is my ſupreme and ſovereign Good, in whoſe Favour, with theſe Accompliſhments, I ſhall be ſecure from all Evil, and in in the Enjoyment of a vaſt, an unſpeakable and endleſs Felicity! — Thus it appears, That the true and ultimate End of my Being, can be nothing ſhort of this; That I may be eternally happy in the Enjoyment of GOD and all that is good, and in the Perfection of Knowledge and Virtue, which alone can render me capable thereof.</p>

HAVING thus conſidered the Nature of <hi>my Being,</hi> and of that <hi>glorious Cauſe</hi> whom I derive, and on whom I depend, and diſcovered from <hi>his Attributes</hi> what muſt have been the great End of that Being and Nature which he hath given me; I proceed now, from the <hi>Truths</hi> I have diſcovered in the <hi>firſt</hi> or <hi>ſpeculative Part</hi> of this <hi>Eſſay,</hi> to deduce the <hi>Duties</hi> that reſult from them, which conſtitute the <hi>ſecond</hi> or <hi>practical</hi> Part of it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And, in general; from the Nature and End of my Being, which I have diſcovered, I muſt conclude, that it is my <hi>Duty</hi> in Faithfulneſs to <hi>my ſelf;</hi> i. e. to that Nature and thoſe Powers, which are given me, as being a reaſonable, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and immortal Creature, and in Faithfulneſs to that glorious Being who is the Author and Preſerver of them, to be freely engaged and active my ſelf, in endeavouring to anſwer his End in the Beſtowment of them; which, from the Nature of the thing, I find is to be accompliſhed by Means of my own Activity. — And ſince I am accountable to him for all the Powers and Talents he hath beſtowed upon me, and muſt expect that he will call me to Account for them, and ſee what Regard I have had to his End in the Beſtowment of them; it is neceſſary that I be, above all Things, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned ſo to act and conduct my ſelf, as to be able to give
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:005794_0042_1026EFE7716A19C8"/>a good Account of my ſelf to him. — And in Order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, I proceed to the</p>
                  <p n="3">3. IV. <hi>Fourth Inquiry;</hi> and aſk my ſelf, in the next Place, <hi>what I ought to be?</hi> — or, which is the ſame Thing, <hi>what I ought to do</hi> in order to anſwer the End of my Being? — or what are the neceſſary Means, which do in the Nature of the Thing directly tend to the Accompliſhment of it? — And for the Reſolution of this Inquiry, it will be needful more particularly to conſider the End it ſelf, which is God's End, and for the ſame Reaſon muſt be mine: for from the Nature of the End, we may, in ſome good Meaſure, diſcover what are thoſe Means, whether more immediate or remote, that do naturally tend to the Attainment of it. —<note n="†" place="bottom">Quoties quid fugiendum ſit, aut, quid petendum, voles ſcire, and ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum Bonum &amp; Propoſitum totius Vitae reſpice, <hi>Sen.</hi> Ep. 71.</note> To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, therefore, I muſt reaſon in the following manner.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The ultimate End of my Being, is, that my rational and immortal Nature may be compleatly and endleſly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. — The Happineſs of the <hi>rational Nature</hi> conſiſts in that Pleaſure and Satisfaction that naturally attends its being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious to it ſelf of its Union with its proper Objects. — The proper Object of the <hi>Underſtanding</hi> is <hi>Truth,</hi> and that of the <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Affections</hi> is <hi>Good.</hi> — ſo that the higheſt Happineſs of our Nature muſt conſiſt in that Pleaſure that attends our <hi>Knowledge of Truth,</hi> and our <hi>chuſing</hi> and <hi>delighting</hi> in <hi>Good;</hi> and conſequently the Purſuit of theſe, muſt, in general be the great <hi>Duty</hi> of my Life.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. GOD is Truth and Goodneſs it ſelf, and the great Source of all that Truth and Good that is every where to be found in all his Works. — Therefore GOD, himſelf, with all the Truth and Good that is contained in him and derived from him, ſo far forth as I can attain to the practical Knowledge of it, muſt neceſſarily be the proper Object of my rational and active Powers, i. e. the Powers of my reaſonable and immortal Nature. — And conſequently my <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Happineſs</hi> muſt conſiſt in knowing, chuſing, loving and acquieſcing in him, and in reſembling or being like him as far as I am able: — In a Word, in the Contemplation and Love of him, and all that
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:005794_0043_1026EFE9F6ECF578"/>Truth and Good which flows from him, and in forming the Temper of my Soul and the Conduct of my Life conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thereunto. — And this being my true Perfection and Happineſs, muſt neceſſarily be his Will and Law who wills my Happineſs as his End in giving me my Being and in all his Diſpenſations towards me.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. From hence it follows, that my Duty and Happineſs muſt conſiſt, in general, in the Union of my Will with his; in ſincerely chuſing what he chuſes, and delighting in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he delights in, and in reſigning to the whole Syſtem or Conſtitution which he hath eſtabliſhed, both natural and moral: — and, conſequently, in treating every Perſon and Thing as being what it really is, and what he hath made it, as he himſelf does; and in governing my ſelf, in my whole Temper and Conduct, by all thoſe Rules which promote the general Weal of the whole Syſtem as GOD does himſelf.— And all this I muſt do, with a hearty Well-Meaning, in a deſigned Compliance with his Will, and from a Senſe of Duty to him, and ſtedfaſtly perſevere in ſuch a Conduct in ſpite of all Temptations to the contrary. — This is what is implied in the general Duties of <hi>Sincerity</hi> and <hi>Integrity.—</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. I muſt therefore, in order hereunto, duly exerciſe my Underſtanding in acquainting my ſelf with the whole Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Things, and in making a juſt Eſtimate among the ſeveral Kinds and Degrees of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil;</hi> and always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a <hi>greater</hi> Good before a <hi>leſs,</hi> and a <hi>leſſer Evil</hi> before a <hi>greater.</hi> — And becauſe the <hi>Soul</hi> is more excellent than the <hi>Body;</hi> — the Intereſt of the <hi>whole Community</hi> greater than that of any one <hi>Individual;</hi> — and <hi>Eternity</hi> of vaſtly more Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance than <hi>Time:</hi> — I muſt therefore, willingly ſuffer <hi>bodily Evils</hi> to avoid <hi>Spiritual; — Private</hi> to prevent <hi>publick,</hi> — and <hi>Temporal,</hi> to ſecure againſt thoſe that are <hi>Eternal.</hi> — And I muſt chearfully reſign the Goods of the <hi>Body</hi> to thoſe of the <hi>Soul, — Private</hi> Goods to thoſe of the <hi>Publick,</hi> — and the Goods of <hi>Time</hi> to thoſe of <hi>Eternity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. And that I may deſcend to Particulars: — Since my Happineſs depends on my conducting right in the whole,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:005794_0044_1026EFEB99C39C90"/>as I am variouſly ſituated, I muſt conſider my ſelf in all the ſeveral Relations wherein I ſtand, and affect and behave my ſelf ſutably to them, that I may be happy in each of them. —<note n="†" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Scott</hi>'s Diviſion, Part 1.</note> Particularly, I. My <hi>first</hi> Relation is to my ſelf, which obliges me to behave my ſelf ſutably to that rational and immortal Nature which GOD hath given me, that I may be happy in that: and this is called <hi>Human Virtue,</hi> or Virtue due from me to that human Nature whereof I conſiſt— II. my <hi>ſecond</hi> Relation is to GOD my <hi>Maker, Preſerver</hi> and <hi>Governour,</hi> which obliges me to be have my ſelf ſutably towards ſuch a glorious Being as he is on whom I depend, that I may be happy in him: and this is called <hi>divine Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi> or Virtue due to the Deity. — III. My <hi>third</hi> Relation is to the reſt of my Species, of the ſame rational and immortal Nature with my ſelf, which obliges me to behave ſutably towards ſuch a Syſtem of Beings as they are, that I may be happy in them, and they in me: And this is called <hi>ſocial Virtue,</hi> or Virtue due to Society.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Theſe Relations and the Duties correſpondent to them, are ſaid to be, in the general Nature of them, of immutable and eternal Obligation, becauſe it is, in general, impoſſible for me ever to ſtand otherwiſe ſituated than I do, viz. To my ſelf, my Maker, and my Fellow-Creatures; or if it were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that Fact ſhould ceaſe, it is, and always was, and ever will be, impoſſible to conceive of ſuch a Being as I am, and ſo ſituated, but that theſe Obligations of Duty will neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily take hold of me.— And, as Sincerity implies the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of theſe Duties, as well in the inward Temper of my Heart, as the outward Actions of my Life; ſo I muſt conſider it as my firſt Care, to lay a good Foundation within, and to aim at nothing but the Truth and Right of the Caſe upon all Occaſions, ſince in the right Performance of theſe Duties conſiſts the higheſt Perfection and Happineſs of my reaſonable and immortal Nature.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. I. It is, therefore, neceſſary in Order <hi>to be what I ought to be,</hi> that I firſt begin at home, and conſider what are the Duties that I owe to my ſelf, which are call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>human Virtues,</hi> and are due to that human, reaſonable and immortal Nature which GOD hath given me, as being neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to its Happineſs within it ſelf.— And I the rather begin with theſe, becauſe they are neceſſary in order to both the other Branches.— And</p>
                  <p n="2">2. (I.) From what has been ſaid, it is plain, that the firſt Duty incumbent upon me as a reaſonable, active Creature, in order to anſwer the End of my Being, is, to cultivate and improve the <hi>Reaſon</hi> and Underſtanding which GOD hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me to be the great Law of my Nature;— to ſearch and know the <hi>Truth,</hi> and find out wherein my true Happineſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, and the Means neceſſary to it, and from thence the Meaſures of <hi>right</hi> and <hi>wrong,</hi>—and to diſcipline and regulate my Will, Affections, Appetites and Paſſions according to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Truth, that I may freely and readily embrace the one and reject the other in order that I may be truly happy. — And this Virtue is called <hi>moral Wiſdom</hi> or <hi>Prudence,</hi> and ſtands in Oppoſition to <hi>Indiſcretion</hi> and <hi>Incogitancy.—</hi> And,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. (2.) Becauſe <hi>Pride</hi> conſiſts in a miſerable Deluſion, in thinking of Things otherwiſe than as being what they really are, and particularly in having too great an Opinion of our ſelves, which is a Temper utterly deſtructive to all true Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement and Proficiency either in Knowledge or Virtue, and odious in the Sight both of GOD and Man;—and ſince I am conſcious of ſo many Sins and Infirmities, and other hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Conſiderations with Reſpect both to Body and Mind and every Thing about me;— it is in the next Place incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent

                  <p n="4">4. (3.) As our Reaſon and Conſideration is manifeſtly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us to make a juſt Eſtimate of Things, and to preſide over our inferious Powers, and to proportion our ſeveral <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites</hi> and <hi>Paſſions</hi> to the real Nature and intrinſick Value of their reſpective Objects: ſo as not to <hi>love</hi> or <hi>hate, hope</hi> or <hi>fear, joy</hi> or <hi>grieve,</hi> be pleaſed or diſpleaſed at any Thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the real Importance of it to our Happineſs or Miſery, in the whole of our Nature and Duration:—It muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, be my Duty to maintain a due Ballance among them; to keep them within their proper Bounds, and to take Care that they do not exceed or fall ſhort of the real Nature and Meaſure of their ſeveral Objects; and eſpecially ſo as not to ſuffer them to tempt or hurry me on to treſpaſs upon any of the Duties that I owe either to GOD or Man.— This is the Office of that Virtue which is called <hi>Moderation,</hi> and ſtands in Oppoſition to all <hi>ungoverned Luſts and Paſſions.</hi>— Particularly,</p>
                  <p n="5">5. (4.) Becauſe <hi>animal Appetites</hi> and <hi>fleſhly Luſts,</hi> (I mean the Appetites to Meat and Drink and other carnal Pleaſures, i. e. whatſoever is of the <hi>concupiſcible</hi> Kind) <hi>do war againſt the Soul,</hi> and an immoderate Indulgence to them does ſenſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize and enervate, and by Conſequence miſerably debaſe and weaken its noble and ſuperior Powers and alienate them from their proper Objects, and at the ſame Time, extremely hurt the Temperature and Health of the Body; it muſt therefore be my Duty to maintain a perpetual War with them, to curb and reſtrain them, to <hi>keep them under, and bring them into Subjection,</hi> and regulate them by the Ends deſigned by GOD and Nature in planting them in us; which is the Office of the Virtues called <hi>Temperance</hi> or <hi>Sobriety</hi> and <hi>Chaſtity,</hi> which ſtand in Oppoſition to all <hi>Intemperance</hi> and <hi>Debauchery.</hi>—</p>

6. (5.) Becauſe the turbulent Paſſions of <hi>Anger, Grief</hi> and <hi>Fear,</hi> (i. e. Diſpleaſure and Uneaſineſs at what we already feel or imagine, and anxious Apprehenſions of what may ſeem impending, or whatever elſe is of the iraſcible Kind) are apt to warp and biaſs our Minds, and diſable them for a right Judgment and Conduct; to deſtroy the Peace and Tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of our Minds and create a wretched Tumult within our own Breaſts, and frequently prompt us to injurious Words and Actions; it muſt, therefore, be my Duty to keep them alſo, as far as may be, under the due Government of my Reaſon, and not to ſuffer them much to ruffle and diſquiet me, much leſs to tyrannize over me or diſable me for any Duty I owe either to GOD or Man; which is the Office of thoſe Virtues that are called <hi>Meekneſs, Patience</hi> and <hi>Fortitude,</hi> which ſtand in Oppoſition to <hi>Wrath, Hatred, Impatience</hi> and <hi>Puſillanimity.</hi>

<pb n="50" facs="unknown:005794_0048_1026EFF5E25C3808"/>it muſt therefore be the moſt important Duty of my Life, while I continue in this preſent Condition, to be in a good Meaſure diſengaged from this World and from my Body and Time, and to provide, in the beſt Manner I can, for that endleſs State which is before me; and, in order hereunto, to be daily improving my Soul in Knowledge and Virtue, eſpecially the following Virtues both divine and ſocial, and to be diſciplining and training up myſelf in all thoſe Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments and Qualifications, which alone I can carry with me when I am called off from this preſent Stage, and which will prepare me to be everlaſtingly happy in the Life to come.— This Duty is called, the <hi>Care of the Soul,</hi> in Oppoſition to the exceſſive, <hi>Love</hi> to the <hi>World</hi> and the <hi>Body.</hi> — And thus much for the Duties we owe to our ſelves.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. (1.) Becauſe GOD is a Being of all poſſible Perfection and Excellency; the Maker, Preſerver and Governor of the whole World, on whom I do intirely depend for all my Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments here, and all my Hopes to all Eternity, and to whom
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:005794_0049_1026EFF783FB68C0"/>I am accountable for all that I think, ſpeak, and do; It is therefore, my Duty, in general, to own and acknowledge him, and to live under a deep, ſerious, and habitual Senſe of him, as ſuch, and to obey and pleaſe him in all my Behaviour, — This Duty is called the <hi>Knowledge</hi> or <hi>Acknowledgement</hi> of GOD, and ſtands in Oppoſition to <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> and the <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Neglect</hi> of him.— And,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. (2.) Becauſe GOD is a Being of the higheſt Perfection and Excellency, and therefore infinitely amiable in himſelf, and at the ſame Time infinitely kind and benevolent to me and all the World, and is continually doing Good to me and providing every Thing needful for my Subſiſtence and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and by what he is, and has done for me hitherto, has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me all the Reaſon in the World to believe, that, if I faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully endeavour to pleaſe him, he will not fail to make me for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever as happy as my Capacity will admit of; it muſt therefore be my Duty to delight in him as my chief Good; to prefer him and his Service before all Things, and to be wholly devoted to him both in the ſincere Intentions of my Heart, and the whole Conduct of my Life. — This Duty is called the <hi>Love of God,</hi> and ſtands in Oppoſition to <hi>Hatred</hi> or <hi>Averſion</hi> to him and his Service.— And</p>
                  <p n="4">4. (3.) Since God is infinitely ſufficent to all the Purpoſes of my Happineſs; has infinite Wiſdom to direct him, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to enable him, and Goodneſs to diſpoſe him to ſecure me from every Thing that can hinder my Well-being, and to ſecure to me whatſoever is requiſite to my Happineſs; it muſt therefore be my Duty to confide in him in the way of well-doing, with an intire Acquieſcence in his all-wiſe and powerful Goodneſs; in one Word, in his Allſufficiency. — This Duty is called <hi>Truſt</hi> or Confidence in GOD, in Oppoſition to all <hi>Diſtruſt</hi> or <hi>Diffidence.</hi> — And,</p>
                  <p n="5">5. (4.) Becauſe GOD is thus infinitely benevolent, wiſe and powerful, and can't but know what is beſt for me infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely better than I do my ſelf, and can't be miſled or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouled in any Diſpoſitions he is pleaſed to make concerning me, and will not fail to bring Good out of Evil, and to
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:005794_0050_1026EFF9F1799E70"/>bring about the beſt Ends by the fitteſt Means, and can't but conſult the beſt Good, in the whole in all his Commands and Diſpenſations; in every Thing he requires me either to do or ſuffer; it muſt, therefore, be my Duty to be intirely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to him, and to have my Will always united with his. This is the Duty of <hi>Submiſſion</hi> or <hi>Reſignation</hi> to GOD, in Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to <hi>Untowardneſs</hi> and <hi>Rebellion.</hi>— And,</p>
                  <p n="6">6. (5.) Becauſe GOD is the incomprehenſibly great and tremendous, moral Governour of the World; as there is nothing that I may not hope for from his Goodneſs that is really for my beſt Good, if I faithfully endeavour to obey and pleaſe him; ſo on the other Hand, from his Diſpleaſure, I can't but expect the ſevereſt Puniſhments if I live in Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to his Will, who is conſtantly preſent with me, and ſees all the Tempers of my Heart and Actions of my Life, and will in a little Time call me to Account for them; It muſt therefore be my Duty, to think and ſpeak of him in the moſt reverent Manner, to <hi>ſet him ever before me,</hi> and to be, above all Things, concerned not to diſpleaſe him, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitouſly careful to approve my ſelf to him in all that I do. This Duty is called <hi>Reverence</hi> or the <hi>Fear of GOD,</hi> in Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to all <hi>Irreverence</hi> and <hi>Diſregard</hi> towards him. —</p>
                  <p>And,</p>
                  <p n="7">7. (6.) Since GOD is himſelf, infinitely holy, true, juſt and good; and ſince it is evident from the intelligent, free, active Nature that he hath given me, that I am capable of ſome good Degree of Reſemblance or Likeneſs to him; and ſince, by how much the more I reſemble him, by ſo much the more perfect and happy, I muſt neceſſarily be; I muſt, therefore, think it my Duty to be as like him as ever I can, <hi>Holy as he is Holy, Righteous as he is Righteous, True</hi> and <hi>Faithful, Kind</hi> and <hi>Merciful</hi> as he is.— This Duty is called the <hi>Imitation</hi> of GOD, in Oppoſition to <hi>Unholineſs,</hi> or being <hi>unlike</hi> to him.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. (7.) And <hi>laſtly,</hi> Since GOD is that Being from whom we receive all that we enjoy, and on whom we depend for all that we want, both for Time and Eternity; and as it is fit
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:005794_0051_1026EFFCF52940C0"/>that we live under a deep and habitual Senſe of this our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon him; ſo it muſt be our Duty in order hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, every Day that we live, moſt gratefully to <hi>praiſe</hi> him for every thing we receive, and <hi>pray</hi> to him for all that we want.— And becauſe we cannot do this with any Meaning, without that Love, Truſt, Reſignation, Reverence and Imitation, which I have demonſtrated to be our Duties towards him; Therefore, theſe Tempers and Diſpoſitions muſt ever be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to attend all our Prayers and Praiſes, which I compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend under the general Name, of <hi>Devotion</hi> or the <hi>Worſhip</hi> of GOD in Oppoſition to all <hi>Profaneſs, Irreligion, Superſtition</hi> and <hi>Idolatry.</hi>

And inaſmuch as Mankind do thus depend upon GOD, and receive innumerable Favours from him, not only in their ſingle, but alſo in their ſocial Capacity;— and as there is a peculiar Fitneſs in it, as we are all Children of the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Parent, the great <hi>Father of Spirits,</hi> that we ſhould, not only, ſeverally, but jointly as Brethren, pay our Homage, and teſtify our grateful Senſe of this our Dependance upon him; and as our joint Performance of this Duty does open Honour to him in the World, and has, at the ſame Time, a natural Tendency, the more ardently to affect our Hearts with Devotion to him, as well as to unite us the more ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in mutual Benevolence one towards another; It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>fit, right, and our bounden Duty,</hi> to whorſhip GOD, not only in private, but alſo, jointly, in our Families and in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Communities, upon ſuch ſtated Seaſons, and in ſuch Forms, Geſtures and other Circumſtances, as are generally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon, to be moſt expreſſive of Reverence, Duty and Devotion to him.— This is the great Duty of <hi>public Worſhip;</hi> to the honourable Support of which, we ought, both for GOD's Sake and our own, jointly and liberally to contribute.

                  <p n="1">1. III. I Proceed now in the third Place to the Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Relation we ſtand in to one another.— In Purſuance of which, it is neceſſary that I ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly conſider what is due to that Relation; or what thoſe <hi>Duties</hi> are which I owe to my <hi>Fellow-Creatures,</hi> and eſpecially thoſe of my <hi>own Species,</hi> which are comprehended under the general Name of <hi>ſocial Virtues,</hi> which conſiſt in general in treating, or behaving towards them as being what they and I are, in Order that I may be happy in them and they in me.— And as to theſe,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. (1.) Since, as I have above obſerved, being furniſhed with the Powers of Reaſon and Speech, and ſocial Affections we are evidently made for Society;— and ſince, by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of our Nature, we are placed, not only, in a State of Dependance on GOD Almighty, our common heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Parent, but alſo in a State of mutual Dependance on each other for our Well-being and Happineſs, (for that, in many Caſes, we cannot well ſubſiſt without each other's Help, and, by the good or ill Uſe of our Powers, we are capable of being, either very uſeful, or very miſchievous to each other;)—and ſince, by the Powers of Reflection and Reaſoning we are enabled to place our ſelves in each other's Stead, and to make a Judgment, from what we feel within our ſelves, how we ſhould wiſh to be uſed by others, and to diſcover what is beſt in the whole for our common Safety and mutual Advantage;—It is, from all theſe Conſiderations, manifeſt, that, in general, it muſt be our Duty to conſider our ſelves as ſuch, and ſo ſituated and related, as in Fact we are, and to have a hearty Good-Will towards one another as Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and to enter into mutual Compacts for promoting our
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:005794_0053_1026F000EDB70C78"/>common Intereſt and Safety, and to reſign every one his own private Advantage to that of the Community in which his own is beſt ſecured, and to make the common Good the Standard by which to judge of his own Duty and Intereſt, and be inflexibly governed by it.—This Diſpoſition in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral is called <hi>Benevolence</hi> and <hi>publick Virtue,</hi> in Oppoſition to <hi>Selfiſhneſs</hi> and <hi>Malevolence.</hi> — And with Regard to Particulars,—</p>
                  <p n="3">3. (2) Inaſmuch as I have many Things which I call <hi>my own,</hi> to which I have a <hi>Right,</hi> being poſſeſſed of them, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the free Gift of GOD, or by my own Activity and Induſtry with his Bleſſing, and find they are greatly uſeful to my Comfort and Well-being, and feel a great Pleaſure in the unmoleſted Enjoyment of them, and Trouble in being deprived of them:— And when I am moleſted or deprived by any one, without having juſtly forfeited them by my own Miſconduct, I feel a ſtrong Senſe of Injury, and muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, by Reflection, conclude that every other Perſon hath the ſame Senſe of Injury in the like Caſe, as I have; it muſt therefore be my Duty not to do Injury to others in any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, whether it relates to their Souls, Bodies or Eſtates, &amp;c. as I would wiſh to ſuffer no Injury from them in any of theſe Reſpects. — This Diſpoſition is called <hi>Innocence</hi> and <hi>Inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiveneſs,</hi> in Oppoſition to <hi>Injuriouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Miſchievouſneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. (3.) Particularly; Since I know that I can't endure to be hurt in my Perſon, either in Soul or Body; to be rob'd of my Liberty, Eſtate, Wife or Children; to be belied or miſrepreſented in my Name or Reputation, and to be deceived and impoſed upon, or any wiſe oppreſſed in my Dealings  as I muſt conclude it to be wrong to treat others ill, in any of theſe or the like Inſtances; ſo, on the other Hand, for the ſame Reaſon that I think it right, that, in Subordination to the publick Senſe and Intereſt, every one ſhould allow me the quiet and peaceable Enjoyment of my own; my Innocence, Life, Limbs, Liberty, Eſtate, Wife, Children, &amp;c. And ſpeak nothing but the Truth to me and of me, and deal equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably, fairly and faithfully with me, and, in every Reſpect, treat me as being what I am and have; I muſt think it right
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:005794_0054_1026F003601EB7A0"/>and my Duty accordingly to treat others, in all theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, as I would wiſh to be treated by them in the like Circumſtances.—And this Duty is called <hi>Juſtice,</hi> which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends <hi>Exemplarineſs, Equity, Truth</hi> and <hi>Faithfulneſs,</hi> in Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to all Inſtances of <hi>Injuſtice;</hi> ſuch as, <hi>Tempting</hi> to Sin, <hi>Murder, Maiming, Oppreſſion, Stealth, Robbery, Adultery, Fornication, Lying, Defamation, Cheating</hi> and all <hi>Deceitfulneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. (4.) For the like Reaſons; ſince I feel a great Delight in being well reſpected, duly valued, well ſpoken of and kindly treated by others, I muſt think it my Duty to treat others with all ſuch Acts and Inſtances of Kindneſs and good Uſage as I ſhould, in my Turn, reaſonably expect and take Pleaſure in receiving;—to be ready to all good Offices in my Power, to others, whether Neighbours or Strangers, whether to their Souls or Bodies;—to ſay the beſt, and put the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt favourable Conſtruction upon what they ſay or do, and to conduct towards them with Affability and Courteſy. And, as I find a great Solace under Pain and Diſtreſs in the Pity and Aſſiſtance of others; ſo I muſt think it my Duty to have the like Sentiments of Compaſſion and Tenderneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them in the like Circumſtances, whether of Mind, Body or Eſtate, and ſhould act unnaturally if I did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute all that I could, conſiſtent with other Obligations, to their Comfort and Relief.—Thus, by reflecting and conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelves in each other's Circumſtances, our Love to our ſelves becomes the Foundation of our Love to others, and cauſes us to take Pleaſure in their Enjoyments, and in communicating Pleaſure to them;—to delight in doing good Offices, and in ſpeaking kindly to them and of them,—and to ſympatize with them in their Calamities, and be ready to relieve them.—All which are implied in the general Duty of <hi>Charity,</hi> which therefore comprehends <hi>Candour, Affability, Hoſpitality, Mercy, Tenderneſs</hi> and <hi>Beneficence,</hi> in Oppoſition to all Inſtances of <hi>Uncharitableneſs;</hi> ſuch as, <hi>Cenſoriouſneſs, Moroſeneſs, Envy, Cruelty, Ill-nature,</hi> and <hi>Hard-heartedneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. (5.) Inaſmuch as it is manifeſt from what was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved under the firſt general Head of the Duty which we owe to Society, that it is incumbent upon us to do all we
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:005794_0055_1026F0067493ABC8"/>can to promote the Weal of our Fellow-Creatures and to have a principal Zeal for the general Good, on which our own Welfare does very much depend;— And ſince there may be ſeveral Things in our Power, even above and beyond what meer Juſtice and Humanity requires, wherein we may be uſeful to others and to the Public; I muſt therefore think it my Duty to be of a free and generous Spirit as far as I am able, to be forward and ready to every good Work, and to delight in doing Good as GOD himſelf does, wherein-ſoever I may be uſeful in promoting his Honour and the Good of Mankind; and this from a Senſe of Gratitude to him for all I enjoy.— This Virtue is called <hi>Liberality, Genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,</hi> and <hi>Magnificence,</hi> in Oppoſition to <hi>Covetouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardlineſs,</hi> or a <hi>grudging narrow</hi> and <hi>contracted Spirit.</hi>— And for any Favours received either of GOD or Man, <hi>Gratitude</hi> is indiſpenſibly due to the Benefactor, in Oppſition to an <hi>ungrateful Spirit,</hi> which is extremely baſe and odious.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. (6.) Since the Peace and Quietneſs of Society, which are neceſſary to its Happineſs, depends not only upon our avoiding every Thing that is injurious, and doing every Thing that is juſt, benevolent and generous; but alſo upon every one's being contented in his own Station, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully endeavouring to diſcharge the Duties of it, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termedling in Affairs that do not belong to his Province; and upon every one's being of a Peace-making and forgiving Spirit; I muſt therefore think it my Duty to keep within my own Sphere, and mind my own Buſineſs, and do the Duty that belongs to my own Station; and if I have done any Wrong, to repair the Injury and make Reſtitution and aſk Forgiveneſs, as well as to be of a forgiving Spirit towards others, as I would hope GOD to be ſo towards me; and, in a Word, to do all that I can for preſerving and promoting Friendſhip, good Neighbourhood and the public Tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. — Theſe Duties are called <hi>Quietneſs, Peaceableneſs, Friendlineſs</hi> and <hi>Forgiveneſs,</hi> in Oppoſition to <hi>Ambition, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, Unfriendlineſs,</hi> and <hi>Irreconcileableneſs.—</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. (7.) And, laſtly, Since, according to the preſent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of our Nature, it cannot be but that various particular
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:005794_0056_1026F008C9283D00"/>Relations muſt obtain, as being neceſſary for the Subſiſtence and Well-being of our Species, both in Mind, Body and Eſtate, ſuch as, Huſband and Wife, Parents, and Children, Maſters and Servants, Magiſtrates and Subjects, Teachers and Learners, &amp;c. It muſt be my Duty, which ſoever of theſe Conditions I am placed in, to behave my ſelf ſutably to it. —If I am a <hi>Huſband</hi> or <hi>Wife,</hi> I muſt be tenderly loving and faithful.— If I am a <hi>Parent,</hi> I muſt be tender of my help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Offspring and provide for them in the beſt manner I can, both for Body and Soul. — And if I am a <hi>Child</hi> I muſt be dutiful and obedient to thoſe from whom I derive and on whom I depend. — If I am a <hi>Maſter</hi> I muſt be juſt and kind to my Servant: — and if I am a <hi>Servant</hi> I muſt be dutiful and faithful to my Maſter. — If I am a <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> I muſt be zealous for the public Good, and faithful, upright and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial in my Adminiſtration:—and if I am a <hi>Subject,</hi> I muſt be ſubmiſſive and orderly, in Obedience to Law and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.— If I am a <hi>Teacher</hi> I muſt be ready and faithful to guide and inſtruct; and if I am a <hi>Learner,</hi> I muſt be willing to be guided and ready to follow the Inſtructions that are given me, and to reward the Labours of thoſe that have the Care of me.— In a Word, If I am in any <hi>ſuperior</hi> Station of Life, I muſt be treatable and condeſcending, and if in an <hi>inferior</hi> Condition, I muſt be modeſt, reſpectful and decent in all my Deportment; and whatſoever Situation in Life I am placed in, I muſt take Care to act up to my Character whatever it be; both in thoſe leſſer Societies, founded in Nature, which are called <hi>Families,</hi> and in thoſe larger Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties founded in Compact, called <hi>Civil Governments,</hi> to which all <hi>Honour, Submiſſion</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> is due in all Things law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and honeſt, in Oppoſition to all Inſtances of <hi>Turbulence, Faction</hi> and <hi>Rebellion,</hi>—And thus much for our Duties to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Society.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. V. Of the <hi>ſubordinate Duties</hi> or <hi>Means</hi> for the more ready and faithful Diſcharge of the Duties above explained.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. HAVING thus deduced from the great Principles of Truth above demonſtrated the principal Branches of moral Duty founded on them, both towards <hi>GOD, our ſelves,</hi> and our <hi>Neighbours;</hi> I proceed now to enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merate the chief of thoſe <hi>ſubordinate Duties,</hi> which are to be performed as Means for begetting, improving and perfecting in us thoſe <hi>moral Virtues.</hi>—And this will be done in Anſwer to the two laſt of thoſe great Inquiries, viz.—V. <hi>Whether I am what I ought to be?</hi>— And VI. If not, <hi>What I ought to do as a Means in Order to be and do what I ought, and in Order finally to anſwer the End of my Being?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>firſt</hi> of thoſe two laſt Inquiries will put us upon the great Duty of <hi>Self-Examination,</hi> which is a Duty of very great Importance to us; for if we do not examine and truly <hi>know our ſelves,</hi> how ſhall we be able to rectify what is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs, that we may be in a Capacity of giving a good Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of our ſelves at laſt?— And as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſays, <hi>Illi mors gravis incubat, Qui nimis notus amnibus, Ignotus moritur ſibi.</hi>—</p>
                  <p n="3">3. (1.) Let this then be the <hi>firſt</hi> Rule in Order to anſwer the Demands of theſe laſt Queſtions, and the firſt Means in Order to become what I ought to be, viz.—To inure myſelf to a Habit of <hi>ſerious Conſideration;</hi> to ſuſpend acting till I have well weighed the Importance of Things, that I may be under Advantage to make a wiſe Choice; and according to <hi>Pythagoras</hi>'s Advice to his Diſciples, to enter frequently into my own Heart, and take a daily and exact Survey of my whole Life;—to deal faithfully with my ſelf, and to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:005794_0058_1026F00C27BF1068"/>to think of my Temper and Behaviour as being what it really is, <hi>without Partiality, and without Hypocriſy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. (2.) And as the Knowledge of my ſelf is of ſo great Importance, Let it be the next Rule, that I entertain and cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate within my ſelf a great Senſe of the <hi>Dignity</hi> of my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and immortal Nature, and a great <hi>Reverence</hi> for it as ſuch, which would make me always careful to do nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy or miſbecoming it in all its Relations:—Let me eſpecially have a great Reverence for the Senſe of my own <hi>Conſcience</hi> as the Voice of GOD himſelf, that I may take Care not to live in any Courſe whatſoever, for which my own Reaſon and Conſcience ſhall reproach me.—</p>
                  <p n="5">5. (3.) Since I depend wholly on GOD, and he is ever preſent with me, a conſtant Witneſs and Spectator of all my Behaviour, in the inward Temper and Thoughts of my Heart, as well as all the outward Actions of my Life, and that I muſt expect to give an Account of my ſelf to him; It muſt be my next Rule to endeavour to poſſeſs my ſelf habitually of a great and <hi>reverend Senſe of GOD,</hi> that I may be careful to do nothing unworthy of his Preſence and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection, and the Relation I ſtand in to him, and ſeriouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to guard and diſcipline my Thoughts and Affections as well as my Words and Actions in ſuch a Manner as that they may not be diſpleaſing to him, but may gain his Favour and Approbation.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. (4.) If, upon a due Survey of my Temper and Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, I find I have acted an unreaſonable and vicious Part, my own Conſcience will not ceaſe to reproach me for it; ſo that I cannot fail of feeling a great Deal of Remorſe and Uneaſineſs upon reflecting on my Miſconduct: And if I am ſorry as I ought to be, I ſhall hate and abhor it, as being contrary to GOD and all that is right and reaſonable, and never be eaſy till I reform and return to my Duty and be governed by my Reaſon and Conſcience, and every wiſe and good Conſideration for the Time to come:—And herein conſiſts the Nature of true <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Reformation.</hi>

7. (5.) If I truly repent of my paſt Miſconduct, I ſhall be very watchful againſt all thoſe Temptations that I find my ſelf expoſed to, either from my own Luſts and Paſſions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, or from the Solicitations of a corrupt and degenerate World without me:—I ſhall avoid all ill Places and bad Company where I am moſt liable to Danger, and conſider every Thing as my worſt Enemy that has a Tendency to miſlead me from a ſtedfaſt Courſe of virtuous Behaviour.—</p>
                  <p>And,</p>
                  <p n="8">8. (6.) I ſhall be more eſpecially upon my Guard, againſt thoſe particular Failings that my own <hi>Conſtitution</hi> is peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incident to, whether of the concupiſcible or iraſcible kind, viz. Self-Conceit, Luſt, Covetouſneſs, Intemperance, Anger, Impatience, Revenge, &amp;c.—There being, perhaps, ſcarce a Perſon to be found, but has ſome particular Tendency to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſome one Vice more than another, founded in the very Frame of his Nature, which affords Matter and Occaſion for particular Humiliation and Diſcipline.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. (7.) If I find I have any ſuch particular Tendency, and have contracted any vicious Habit, I muſt inure my ſelf to <hi>Self-Denial</hi> and <hi>Mortification</hi> till I have got the Aſcendant of it, and never content my ſelf till I have gained and maintain the Maſtery of my ſelf, ſo as to be at Liberty to follow the Dictates of my Reaſon and Conſcience, and to act up to the Dignity of my rational Nature, and my Relation to GOD, and my Fellow-Creatures, and ſo become what <hi>I ought to be.</hi>—</p>
                  <p n="10">10. (8.) In Order that I may diſcipline my ſelf to a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs in denying my ſelf Things unlawful, and at the ſame Time, to tame and ſubdue my Luſts and Paſſions, it is very fit and uſeful that I ſhould frequently practiſe Self-Denial in Things lawful and indifferent; and eſpecially that I ſhould, by <hi>Faſting,</hi> deny my ſelf ſuch Meaſures or Kinds of Food and Drink &amp;c, as might otherwiſe be lawfully indulged; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly ſuch as have a peculiar Tendency to inflame my Luſts and Paſſions.</p>
                  <p n="11">
                     <pb n="62" facs="unknown:005794_0060_1026F0127B2C9EE0"/>
11. (9.) I muſt not content my ſelf in any certain Pitch of Virtue, to which <hi>I</hi> imagine my ſelf to have attained, but muſt preſs forward and <hi>perſevere</hi> in a continual Struggle and perpetual Warfare throughout my whole Life, and be daily endeavouring to make all poſſible Proficiency in Virtue, till I gain the utmoſt Facility and Readineſs in every virtuous Practice that the Frailty of my Nature will admit of.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. (10.) In order to my being the more ſtrongly engaged in the faithful Diſcharge of my Duty in conforming to all theſe moſt reaſonable Laws, I muſt endeavour to keep up in my Mind an habitual Senſe of their moſt weighty Sanctions, <hi>viz.</hi> The glorious Rewards and tremendous Puniſhments at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending our Obedience or Diſobedience; there being una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable and exquiſite Pain and Miſery neceſſarily connected with every Vice, ariſing from the Remorſe and Reproaches of our own Minds and the fearful Apprehenſions of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Diſpleaſure, together with the natural Fruits or Effects of it upon our ſelves:—And, on the other Hand as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and unſpeakable Pleaſure and Happineſs neceſſarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with the Practice of every Virtue, ariſing both from the natural Fruits and Effects thereof, and from the Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation and Applauſes of our own Minds and the joyous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of the Favour and Friendſhip of Almighty GOD both in Time and to all Eternity.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. By theſe Means I ſhall at length be ſo inured to the Love and Practice of every Virtue, in the Perfection of which, the Happineſs of Heaven it ſelf conſiſts, that I ſhall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to quit this preſent Stage, and to give a good Account of my ſelf to GOD, being, in ſome good Meaſure, quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for that perfect State of Virtue and conſummate Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, which is to be expected in the future State of my Exiſtence: according to that excellent Saying of the wiſe Man, <hi>The Path of the Juſt is like the ſhining Light, which ſhineth more and more unto the perfect Day.</hi>

                  </head>
                  <p n="1">1. THUS I have given a brief Repreſentation of the chief Principles of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Morality,</hi> or a ſmall Sketch of the great and important Truths and Duties of <hi>Moral Philoſophy,</hi> which is called the <hi>Religion of Nature,</hi> all which appear to me ſtrictly demonſtrable from the firſt Principles of Reaſon, as being founded in the Nature of Things; and have moſt, if not all of them, been in ſome Meaſure diſcovered by Men of Genius in the Heathen World, who were deſtitute of Revelation, though perhaps ſomewhat enlightned by ancient Tradition from the Beginning. — I would, now only add a few Words to ſhew the <hi>Connection</hi> between them and <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> or <hi>Reveal'd Religion,</hi> which is to be conſidered only as a further Means for our Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to beget, improve and perfect in us, all the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of an honeſt Heart and good Life.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For however evident theſe Truths and Duties may be to a ſerious, thinking and conſiderate Perſon, who has Means of Information, and Leiſure to give a proper Attention to them; yet ſuch, and ſo many, are the Cares and Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and the Pleaſures and Amuſements of this Life, which do unavoidably engage the Attention of the general Rate and Bulk of Mankind, that it is hardly to be expected that they ſhould ever attain to the diſtinct practical Knowledge of them in their preſent Condition, without Aſſiſtance from above. — So that an expreſs Revelation is highly expedient, or rather neceſſary as a Means to render them, in any tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Meaſure capable of anſwering the End of their Being; eſpecially conſidering that no Philoſopher or Teacher, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſufficiently atteſted Commiſſion from GOD, even if he could diſcover all theſe <hi>Laws of Nature,</hi> could have Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:005794_0062_1026F0166FA08528"/>enough to enjoin them as the <hi>Laws of GOD;</hi> and that this would be the moſt direct and compendious Method of anſwering this End. —</p>

And, indeed, conſidering that the Wiſdom, Power and Goodneſs of GOD are ſuch as could not fail to enable and diſpoſe him to do all that was fit and neceſſary to conduct the Creatures which he had made (and would not deſert,) to that Happineſs which muſt have been the End of their Being; I cannot doubt but that even the firſt Parents of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, upon their firſt coming into Being and in their State of Innocence, being then perfect Strangers to every Thing, and having every Thing to learn, that related to their Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being, muſt, in ſome Manner or other, have been taught by GOD himſelf, many Things relating to Language, Food, the Origin of Things, Philoſophy, Religion &amp;c. (at leaſt ſo much as was neceſſary for them to begin with) in order to their Well-being and Happineſs. — And when they had ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt him, and fallen into a State of Mortality and Miſery, it is natural to conclude, from the ſame Goodneſs and Compaſſion of the <hi>Father of Mercies,</hi> that he would take Pity of them and teach them, (what they could no otherwiſe know,) in what Method and upon what Terms they ſhould be pardoned and reſtored to his Favour, and how they ſhould ſo conduct for the future as to be accepted with him. — All this, is, alſo, very agreeable to the moſt ancient authentic Account we have of the Origin of Mankind.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Accordingly we have abundant Evidence both from Propheſy and Miracles, and undoubted Tradition ever ſince; That GOD, (after a Series of introductory Inſtructions, Revelations and Inſtitutions from the Beginning,) did at length ſend a glorious Perſon, under the Character of <hi>his own Son,</hi> into our Nature, who had had inexpreſſible <hi>Glory with him before the World was;</hi> being the <hi>Brightneſs of his Glory, and the expreſs Image of his Perſon,</hi> and by whom he viſibly diſplayed and exerted his <hi>Almighty Will and Authority</hi> in the Creation and Government of the World, and <hi>in whom dwelt the Fulneſs of the Godhead bodily</hi> in his incarnate State. — This glorious Perſon GOD ſent among us to act as a
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:005794_0063_1026F019AAC0A808"/>Mediator between him and us. — For as we are Sinners, it was very fit he ſhould treat with us by a Mediator, and as we are Men, it was no leſs proper that he ſhould do it by one that ſhould appear in our own Nature, and converſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly among us, that he might the better inſtruct us by his Example as well as his Precepts.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And as this was fit in it ſelf, ſo accordingly the Fact was, that in this incarnate State, he abundantly prov'd by his <hi>Miracles</hi> that he was indeed <hi>a Teacher come from GOD,</hi> and being cloathed with Divine Authority, he taught us all the great Principles of moral Truth and Duty, above demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, much more perfectly than ever they had been known before, and in a Manner and Language, admirably ſuted to make the ſtrongeſt Impreſſions upon the Minds of Men, not only of the more thinking, but even of the general Rate and the loweſt Sort of the human Kind; and enjoined them upon us, under the moſt weighty Sanctions and affecting Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, as the Will and Law of GOD concerning us; and at the ſame Time ſet us a moſt amiable Example that we ſhould <hi>follow his Steps.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. And, as it was highly expedient, that we ſhould be ſtrongly affected with a Senſe of the Heinouſneſs of Sin, as the moſt effectual Means to bring us to Repentance, and, at the ſame Time, have ſufficient Security of Pardon upon our Repentance; it pleaſed GOD to appoint that his Son, (voluntarily ſubmitting to it,) ſhould die for both theſe Purpoſes; — that he ſhould die in our Stead, as a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> for the Atonement of our Sins, and to ſet before us an Emblem of the Greatneſs of our Guilt, and the Heinouſneſs of our Sins in order to induce us to repent of them and forſake them; and to purchaſe and enſure <hi>Pardon</hi> and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance for us upon our Repentance and Reformation: which merciful Purpoſe and Intention he had exhibited from the Beginning by the Inſtitution of Sacrifices<note n="†" place="bottom">See Ld. <hi>Forbes</hi>'s Thoughts concerning Religion, on theſe Subjects.</note>. — Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly the bleſſed JESUS was graciouſly pleaſed to ſubmit to a moſt painful and ignominious Death, for our Sakes, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:005794_0064_1026F01C05C5E3D8"/>
                     <hi>his Soul an Offering for our Sins,</hi> as the true Antitype of all the ancient Sacrifices.— And, thereupon (having pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed a Right ſo to do,) he did, in GOD's Name, promiſe and aſcertain <hi>Pardon</hi> to our ſincere Repentance and Return to our Duty, and the Acceptance of our faithful, though very weak, Endeavours, to yield a ſtedfaſt and perſevering Obedience to all his holy Laws for the Time to come.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. And becauſe of our great Weakneſs and Inability to repent, reform and obey, without GOD's Help, amid ſo many Temptations to the contrary, he has alſo, for CHRIST'S Sake, ſent his <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> (by whom he has always immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately exerted his <hi>Almighty Power</hi> in the Creation and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the World,) and promiſed his gracious <hi>Aſſiſtance</hi> to enable us to withſtand the Temptations that lie in our Way; to mortify our Luſts and vicious Habits, and to comply with all the Duties incumbent upon us:— who accordingly is ever ready to aſſiſt us in all our honeſt and faithful Endeavours, and to render them effectual for the Renovation of our Souls, and enabling us to bring forth <hi>Fruits meet for Repentance,</hi> even all the Fruits of a ſincere, univerſal and perſevering Obedience to the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. And ſince as Things now ſtand, we cannot have much elſe in View beſides a ſhort and uncertain Life, attended with many Calamities and Death at the End of it, and ſhould otherwiſe be generally attended with much Uncertainty about a future Life; CHRIST has, moreover, by his Sufferings and Death in our Behalf, taken away the Curſe and Sting of our Calamities and Diſſolution, and turned them into a Bleſſing and made them a Means of promoting our greateſt Good: and, has by his triumphant <hi>Reſurrection</hi> and <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> opened to us the glorious Views of a bleſſed <hi>Immortality,</hi> both in Body and Soul, and aſcertained to us an <hi>eternal Life</hi> of unſpeakable Happineſs to be beſtowed upon us, in Conſequence of our final Perſeverance in Well-doing, conformable to his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. And in the mean Time; as we could not, without In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction from above, ſufficiently know what Manner of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi>
                     <pb n="67" facs="unknown:005794_0065_1026F01DA1554788"/>and Service would be acceptable to GOD; it was very needful that CHRIST ſhould teach us how to worſhip and adore him acceptably, even in <hi>Spirit and in Truth.</hi>— And as GOD has been pleaſed to derive down all his Bleſſings and Favours to us by the <hi>Mediation</hi> of his bleſſed <hi>Son</hi> and the <hi>Influence</hi> of his <hi>Holy Spirit;</hi> ſo it is fit, as he hath taught us, that all our Worſhip and Service, our Prayers and Praiſes, ſhould be offered up to him, by the Aſſiſtance of his Holy Spirit, and through the Mediation of his dear Son, as the Condition of their obtaining Favour and Acceptance with him.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. And, <hi>laſtly,</hi> As every Thing that concerns the Weal of Mankind, is beſt promoted ſocial Combinations; ſo GOD has by his Son JESUS CHRIST, appointed that we do jointly combine, or unite together in promoting our true Happineſs, which is the chief End of our Being, and live in the conſtant Exerciſe of <hi>ſocial Religion</hi> and Worſhip for that Purpoſe. — And therefore, he has inſtituted <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> as a Rite of our Admittance into this Society, repreſenting and obliging us to all Purity and Holineſs in Heart and Life: — and the holy <hi>Euchariſt</hi> as a Means for keeping up a lively Senſe of his Sufferings and Death, and of the mighty Obligations we are under to be faithful to him who is the great <hi>Author and Finiſher of our Faith,</hi> and to perſevere in Love and Unity one with another as Brethren and Fellow-Members of that holy Community of all good Men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, whereof he is the Head. — And he has, moreover appointed an <hi>Order of Men</hi> to adminiſter theſe ſacred Rites, and to preſide in the Exerciſe of this ſocial Religion and Worſhip, and explain and inculcate the <hi>Divine Philoſophy</hi> which he hath taught us, in order to qualify and prepare us for that eternal Happineſs which he hath provided and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained to us.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Now, therefore, all thoſe who do firmly believe all the great Truths of this <hi>Holy Religion</hi> whether <hi>Natural</hi> or <hi>Revealed:</hi> i. e. whether founded in <hi>Nature,</hi> or meerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on <hi>Revelation;</hi> and under the Influence of them, do, by <hi>Faith,</hi> look for Aſſiſtance and Acceptance only through
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:005794_0066_1026F01FF6503490"/>his Mediation and in the Method which he hath preſcribed; and conformable to his Inſtructions, do heartily <hi>repent</hi> and forſake their Sins and return to their Duty, and faithfully live and act in all their Behaviour both towards GOD and Man, from a Senſe of Duty to GOD their great Creator, and JESUS CHRIST their great Lawgiver and Mediator, and perſevere <hi>faithful to the Death</hi> in <hi>Obedience</hi> to the Will and Law fo GOD, made known to them by this great Prophet, his viſible Repreſentative and Vicegerent; as they are ſaid to be true <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and to belong to that heavenly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity which is called his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> (whereof he is the Head, Lord and <hi>King</hi>) even while they continue in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent State; ſo they ſhall through his Merits and Mediation, be accepted with him here; and inconceiveably and forever happy with him, in his glorious Kingdom in the Life to come.</p>

            <p>O Thou Almighty Being upon whom depends the Exiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the World and every Creature therein; by whom all Things are governed and conducted to their ſeveral Ends; and by whoſe good Providence I have been moſt kindly preſerved and provided for, from the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of my Life to this Moment, and enjoyed many undeſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Advantages and Favours, both for Body and Soul, and eſpecially the ineſtimable Advantages of Chriſianity: I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech Thee graciouſly to accept my moſt grateful Senſe and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of all thy Bounty and Beneficence towards me, (and particularly the Preſervation of the Night, [Day] paſt) <hi>Let my Soul praiſe Thee while I live, and all that is within me bleſs thy holy Name.</hi>

I humbly beg Leave to command my ſelf to thy gracious Protection and Conduct (this Day [Night] and) at all Times: Suffer none of thy Creatures to injure me, no Misfortune to befall me, nor me to hurt my ſelf by any Error or Miſconduct of my own;— and vouchſafe me clear and distinct Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and a right Judgment in all Things, together with all virtuous Tempers and Diſpoſitions, and ſo much Health and Proſperity as may be truly good for me in this preſent State of Probation.— Grant that I may, at leaſt, paſs my Time in Peace with Contentment and Tranquility of Mind; and, that, having faithfully diſcharged my Duty to Thee my GOD, to my Family and Friends, and to my Country and all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and endeavoured to improve my ſelf in all virtuous Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits and uſeful Knowledge, I may at laſt make a calm and decent Exit, and happily find my ſelf in a better State; a State of unmixed and endleſs Happineſs in the Life to come.—</p>
