            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE time in which we live, is diſtinguiſhed by great and extraordinary events; it is an age of intrigue and diſſimulation, of folly and jealouſy, of revolutions and convulſions. All the paſſions of the human heart are in a ferment, and every rational be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the throne to the cottage is agitated by the pictureſque circumſtances of the day. Although re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved upwards of three thouſand miles from the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinary theatre of Europe, our public and private Councils are influenced, biaſſed and ſometimes deranged by foreign intrigue, domeſtic ambition, and impaſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed factions. The ſword of the Revolution is ſcarcely returned to its ſcabbard, and the ſacred wounds of our patriots are ſtill open and bleeding. Yet plans are organized, at this early hour, to blaſt the proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and undermine the liberties of our country. By pecuniary doceurs, emigration and flatteries, the cauſe of monarchy has taken root in the hearts of the ignorant and the unwary. But there is an enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſpirit in our country to reſiſt its progreſs. 1776 is not yet forgotten, and ſilent millions are in readineſs to ſacrifice their lives on the altar of public liberty; they have ſworn to ſupport the Conſtitution of their choice, and to preſerve it inviolable from the machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:037170_0003_100CD670177D8108"/>
of ambition, and the ſport of arbitrary power. We are not yet ripe enough for unconditional ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mition. Liberty is not yet deſpoiled of her charms, nor ſlavery deprived of it horrors, and the yeomanry are not yet prepared to render up homage, and feed on a ſcanty pittance in miſery and in tears. Until you can corrupt the moral features of man, he regards his liberty as the inſeparable companion of his life.</p>
            <p>You have vainly endeavoured to repel the charge of monarchiſm which has a thouſand times been reiter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated from Newhampſhire to Georgia. Although the Anglo-European feels himſelf at home in your ſociety, experience affords a leſſon of caution to the genuine American. The proceedings of the General Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion bear witneſs againſt you, eſtabliſh beyond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy, your attatchment to arbitrary government, and the information of the Attorney General of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryland, marks you out as the daring enemy of repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licaniſm. In this ever memorable diſgrace Morris took a part, under the diſappointed expectation of baſking and fattening in the ſunſhine of courtly favour. When all your ſchemes proved abortive: When you found it impoſſible to raiſe a Guelph to the throne, did you not aſſert that the Conſtitution would anſwer your purpoſe, as it opened a latitude for the encroachments of arbitray power? Whilſt Secretary of the Treaſury, was it not your earneſt endeavour to aſſimilate our government to that of Great-Britain? She offered you a ſyſtem of Finance that has drawn tears from miſerable millions, and you ſervilely adopted it. The evil conſequences of this adoption, are not yet fully felt, although it has filled this infant republic with ſtock-jobbers, ſpeculators, and peculators. Although it has robbed the hoary ſoldier of his labours, and left him to wander with his family and his wounds on an
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:037170_0004_100CD6719D01FAC8"/>
unfeeling world, whilſt the friends of Moloch and of George are ſeated in triumph, and environed with wealth. But this is not the only evidence that juſtifies the opinion of the Preſident. Whoever has analized your character, and drawn aſide the veil of diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, muſt feel an irreſiſtible conviction that nature has made ambition the principle lever of all your actions. What a painful mortification to be excluded from the Councils of your country! Cannot we here draw forth the motives that originated your illiberal attack on the character of the Preſident, who had too much judgment and independence to ſubmit to the leading ſtrings of the ex-Secretary? Here was diſappointed am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition; here was abundant reaſon to libel Mr. Adams, and injure the cauſe of his party; here is a clue to that myſterious character, whoſe power, if equal to his will, would beſtride the world.</p>
            <p>The firſt prominent charge againſt Mr Adams, is, his inability to adminiſter the government; that he has an imagination "ſublimated and eccentric" that his judgment is defective, and that he is incapable of a ſteady adherence to any ſyſtematic plan of conduct. How is this eſtabliſhed? You have underſtood, but cannot vouch for its authenticity, that Mr. Adams was the friend and advocate of annual enliſtments, and argued the propriety of changing the commander in chief every year. On evidence ſo ſlender, no man ſhould be convicted, if, however, they really were his ſentiments, they demonſtate a prudent jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy ſo eſſentially neceſſary in revolutionary times; he ſaw in the hiſtory of other ages and nations, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive evils that had reſulted from the unlimited and unconditional grant of power. A ſtanding ſoldery will become attatched to their chief, and an ambitious chief, when a favourable opportunity occurs, will
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037170_0005_100CD6732F83F4A8"/>
ſtrike at the vitals of his country, and riot on the grave of public happineſs. The days of Caeſar with their tragical features are ſtill freſh in our memories, they will plead to the lateſt ages, the folly and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy of a permanent military, and a permanent leader. It is further urged, that our country was deficient in characters qualified to command, and that Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton was alone capable of uniting the intereſts of the country, and combining together a naked, ill-fed, and undiſciplined ſoldiery. This ſuggeſtion is palpably falſe, and unworthy of a ſerious refutation. I feel a veneration for Waſhington, and emotions of gratitude for his diſintereſted exertions which no tongue can adequately expreſs. But at the time of his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the chief command, his principles and milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry virtues were little known. A circumſtance that juſtified the want of too implicit confidence on the part of Mr. Adams.</p>
            <p>Your obſervations relative to a certain private jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of Mr. Adams, are ſurpaſſingly trivial and low, they demonſtrate the imbecility of your cauſe, and point out the baſe malignity of your heart. The inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent with madam Vergennes, on which you have commented as if it was a matter of moment, is not ſuſceptible of the turn you have given it, without a groſs and violent diſtortion of common ſenſe. You, perhaps might have ſucceeded better on that occaſion, if any thing more had been <hi>neceſſary than a pecuniary gratification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The letter of Mr. Adams to Tench Coxe, which has given riſe to ſo many illiberal comments, was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently written in ſome jocular moment. The ſtyle is ſimple, unaffected, and ſeemingly as if not intended, announces ſome very important truths and well au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticated facts. The circumſtance of the Pinckney's
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037170_0006_100CD6D35BAA65C0"/>
having been ſchool fellows of the Marquis of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marthan, is not of ſo very trifling and indifferent a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Prejudices formed at an early period of life ſeldom forſake us, they modify character, and give an unchangeable colouring to the moral atributes of man.</p>
            <p>Is the ſuſpicion of Mr. Adams reſpecting Britiſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence without reaſonable foundations? Has not Great-Britain from the earlieſt times, endeavoured to anſwer her purpoſe by intrigue and by money when incapable by the force of arms? Is it forgotten what was attempted on a member of Congreſs during the revolutinary war? Have not the Councils of France been diſtracted and continually annoyed by theſe baſe engines of national corruption? Have not the leading characters in adminiſtration uniformly evinced the warmeſt affection for the court of St. James, when the Ambaſſadors of France were rejected and deſpiſed? Have you not in common with your party occaſional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forgotten that you was an American, and warmly panegeriſed the government of Great Britain? In fine, have not the agents of that country been the inmates of your heart, and acceſſible to the ſecrets of our cabinet? Under circumſtances ſo ſtrong and impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive is there a loop left to hang a doubt on?</p>
            <p>The cloſe of this remarkable letter contains a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy that has long ſince been fulfilled. "The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual acceſſion of foreigners will endanger and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy our peace, if we know not how to govern them; they will moreover corrupt our elections, and tear us to pieces." Will any man who bears the ſmalleſt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration for truth, deny this unhappy fact? The fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſt and the monarchiſt, who meet in more points than they differ, have waged an inveterate warfare with the republican intereſt of this country; in the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037170_0007_100CE0B066ABBC08"/>
city of New-York, in particular, many Engliſhmen, hot from the country of crimes and ſlavery, have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured, with federal aid, to controul and corrupt our elections. Our laws of naturalization have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted theſe vipers in our boſom, and nothing but republican energy has hitherto ſupported the endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered liberty of our country.</p>
            <p>When you became a member of Congreſs, your accute penetration diſcovered ſymptoms of a party already formed, too well diſpoſed to ſubject the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the United States to the management of France, which you reſolved to reſiſt. Was it not at once natural and reaſonable, that we ſhould feel the warmeſt emotions of gratitude towards a power that relieved us in the hour of danger, difficulty, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity? Would it not have been the baſeſt injuſtice, to have forgotten in a moment, the liberal ſervices that were rendered us at that eventful period? There is ground to preſume that you have miſtaken this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt enthuſiaſm, for an undue compliance to foreign power, and that this want of diſcernment originated the party of which you have ſo long been the puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant leader. If this has been the only cauſe of your perſecutions, charge it to your ignorance, and hold yourſelf accountable for the miſchiefs you have invit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on your country, by fomenting diviſions and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting its councils. Wiſhing to derogate as much as poſſible from the merit of Mr. Adams, you hold up Mr. Jay as principal negociator in our firſt treaty with Great-Britain. No certain determination can be formed on this point, but every candid thinker will deny your poſition, if he reflects on Mr. Jays laſt negociation with the ſame power; when an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was formed inexpreſſibly deſtructive to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial intereſt of this country, his friend endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:037170_0008_100CE0B1F8579968"/>
to poultice its defects, but all the ſophiſtry and ravings of Camillus were in vain. Daily experience developes its evils, and many of its warmeſt abettors are now its moſt inveterate enemies.</p>
            <p>Much is ſaid on Mr. Adam's complaint of unfair treatment, in not having been permitted to take an equal chance with Waſhington, by leaving the votes to an uninfluenced current. As this fact is not well authenticated, it will be diſcredited or confided in, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your moral reſpectability; in truth Mr. Adams has long been an honeſt and faithful ſervant of his country, and his ſtrenuous exertions during the revolution, were, perhaps as eſſential to our indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as the more brilliant atchievements of General Waſhington<note n="*" place="bottom">Such is the opinion entertained by the friends of Mr. Adams, and not by the author of this pamphlet, and thoſe who know how to eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate characters.</note>.</p>
            <p>With how much grace and art have you endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to draw a parallel between the character of Pinckney and Waſhington. It is a misfortune for your candidate that he is ſo little known in the world. Has he been an indifferent ſpectator of the intereſting events of the times? Has he willfully excluded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from public affairs, when the difficulties of his country was in want of ſuch ennobling qualifications? Or is he notwithſtanding your encomiums incapable of the duties of a ſtateſman? How many impoſitions have been practiſed in every age and country, through the impulſe of folly, or the intrigue of ambition. If Heliogabilus could inſult the Roman Senate by intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing a horſe to its councils; may not deſigning po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticians have their views in advancing and promoting the election of an animal more particularly diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037170_0009_100CE0B3B6046E20"/>
by the length of his ears, than the energy of his mind.</p>
            <p>From the late public addreſs of Tenck Coxe, what opinion is entertained of you by every honeſt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting American? Has he not proved to the world that you are the zealous friend of monarchical government, and conſequently a dangerous character under any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican ſyſtem? Is it not to be preſumed then, that the man you ſo ſtrenuouſly advocate, has a heart that vibrates in uniſon with your own; that his principles are unfriendly to the general diſpoſition of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and that on every favourable opportunity he would endeavour to fret away the great and eſſential principles of the federal conſtitution? But your ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine expectations are defeated, and the genuine friend of his country, the meritorious Jefferſon is deſtined to preſide over a great and free people: The whole tenor of his life is capable of the moſt rigid ſcrutiny; uninfluenced by intereſt, by flattery, or by money; like Marcus Curius Dentatus, he can point to his turnips and ſpurn at the bribes of the <hi>Samnites.</hi> The moſt flattering encomiums are paſſed on Mr. Pinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for having effected a favorable treaty with the court of Madrid. It is aſſerted that many thorny difficulties exiſted between the two countries, and that his ſucceſsful negociation was therefore deſerving of the higheſt commendation. Every man who is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the circumſtances of theſe times, who recollects the paraliſed condition of Spain, will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine without heſitation, that ſome better teſt is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to eſtabliſh the political conſequence of Mr. Pinckney. It is well known, that the Spaniſh territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, on the Miſſiſippi, was by themſelves conſidered a very precarious tenure, and that if equal advantage had been withheld, a ſpirit beyond the mountains
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:037170_0010_100CE0B6588C12A8"/>
would have juſtified its pretentions under the force of arms. How diſtinguiſhed then is the merit of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly unknown man! This great and ſtriking like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the immortal Waſhington! It is not my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to hold up Mr. Adams as an immaculate character, but candor requires that he ſhould be reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cued from diſguſting calumnies, which envy, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and diſappointed ambition have heaped upon him. His theory of Government is congenial with your own and Mr. Pinckneys' ſentiments; it breathes deſtruction to the freedom and happineſs of man; it ſeeks the aggrandizement of a few, and the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration and debaſement of one moiety of ſociety. When a theory is far advanced in the minds of men, the practice marches quick in the rear, circumſpection and fear may retard its movements, but every favora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble incident for experiment accelerates its progreſs; for many years after the revolution the American people were unſuſpecting and happy, the ſmiles of peace were acceptable after the arduous toils of war. The ſword was forgotten except in ſome innocent evening tale, and the moſt unlimited confidence was repoſed in the leaders of the government, the wildeſt credulity could not have imagined at that early hour, that thoſe who had ſhared in the hardſhips of the ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, were meditating to blaſt the fruits of a glorious revolution. Under ſuch circumſtances, poiſonous and infectious principles were diſſeminated, a conciliatory ſpirit towards Great-Britain was inculcated, and every practicable meaſure purſued to ſoften the reſentment of the American people; to favour the plans of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, gratitude was diſcarded as a virtue, and an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh inveteracy was organized againſt the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of France, under the diſgraceful expectation, that in proportion as our diſſatisfaction with the latter was
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:037170_0011_100CE0B8F7325F00"/>
increaſed, our affection for the former would be invigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated; to this end, the labours of Porcupine and Fenno were uniformly directed, characters who have met their merited doom, and who have been compelled to take a ſeat with the baſeſt and the meaneſt of mankind. The next ſtep was to trample on the ſpirit of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and to pervert it to their ſiniſter purpoſes by unwarrantable conſtructions, that gave energy to the Federal government at the expence of the individual ſtates. Conſtructions that threatened the liberty of the people, and aimed at the conſolidation of the country; both in congreſs and the judiciary depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment theſe, facts have been fully and ſtrongly exempli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. Amidſt all theſe proſpects of Federal republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can villany, our elections were invaded by bribes and by intrigue; the honeſt patriot became an outcaſt, and the daring enemies of the country, monopolized the ſuffrages of a <hi>deluded people.</hi> Men who had ſhared the firſt and higheſt honours of their country, (not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting yourſelf) were peddling at the polls, with the moſt rancorous principles, and the moſt degrading falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods; the crew of the ſhip Ocean was indiſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately murdered to forward the ſucceſs of the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deral candidates, and to leſſen the reſpectability of the republican cauſe; Britiſh agents, contractors and fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors united in your plans, and enjoyed the pleaſing dreams of monarchy, colonization and ſlavery. The points you had gained by ſuch baſe and diſhonorable means gave you a majority in congreſs, and ſaddled the country with alien and ſedition laws, conceived in the ſpirit of a tranſatlantic pattern; laws for which public neceſſity never called, but which ſerved to ſhade and protect the follies and vices of adminiſtration; laws that were intended to hold a certain deſcription of foreigners in awe, and to reſtrain the liberty of the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037170_0012_100CE0BA8DF0BDA8"/>
preſs, the only certain guarantee of public freedom and national happineſs. Take away this grand repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican eſſential, and the elements of ſociety are rooted out forever; but all your projects have proved abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and thoſe connected with you are ſinking into ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retrievable diſgrace. Now is the time, agreeable to your favorite author (Machiaeval) to bring the government back to its original principles. Now is the time to waſh away its impurities, and to render it worthy of the American people.</p>
            <p>Little was it expected that your party would have made an exploſion ſo ſoon. Your ſeeming unity of action, intimated firmneſs, duration and deſign, and perhaps you might have calculated on unchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able perpetuity, if envy, ambition, and the loaves and fiſhes had been out of the queſtion; but there is a truth with which every mind muſt be impreſſed, it is as palpable and glaring as an age of experience can render it, that vice cannot long be conſiſtent, and that ſooner or later it betrays itſelf and expoſes its hedious deformities.</p>
            <p>You frequently ſpeak of the extreme egotiſm of Mr. Adams; but may not the charge be reiterated. In truth, the leading points of your diſſatisfaction with the Preſident, will, on accurate ſelf-examination be diſcovered to be your own contemptible domeſtics, which too often controul and bias you to the moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honorable determinations. What reaſonable ground had you to feel offended with the Preſident; was there none other than a refuſal to conſult you as to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of ſending our envoys to negociate with France? If you had formed a true eſtimate of your own charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if you could have looked into the public ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, you would hardly have undertaken a journey to Trenton, under the plauſible pretence of counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:037170_0013_100CE0BC4C143D48"/>
the ſecretary at war. The Preſident was too well acquainted with your demerits and intrigues, to liſten to your advice; he conjectured with a penetration worthy of a ſtateſman, that ſomething deſtructive was meditated in the dark and gloomy receſſes of your mind. Did he diſtruſt his miniſters? it was becauſe their paſſions had reſolved againſt amicable arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with France, and becauſe he choſe rather to comply with the general wiſh of his country, than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke an unjuſtifiable and deſtructive warfare with one of the greateſt and moſt powerful nations of Europe. By taking umbrage at the conduct of the Preſident, on this occaſion, have you not betrayed an unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able egotiſm, a vanity without bound, and a criminal diſpoſition towards the peace and proſperity of your country?</p>
            <p>Who was it that manfully reſiſted foreign influence, and thereby invited ſo much ungenerous perſecution in the ſubſequent ſtages of his political life? Againſt what great and important character, by whoſe will the deſtiny of nations ſhould be regulated has the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent directed his rancour and reſentment? Who was there to find fault with the conduct of Mr. Adams on his neglecting to confirm Mr. Hamilton as command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in chief after the death of Gen. Waſhington? (Oh! this was a grievous fault! This was a painful ſtroke to the boſom of ambition!) Who has ſacrificed the intereſt of his family to the proſperity of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try? Who has devoted the beſt part of his life to the ſervice of ſociety in counſel and in the field? Who has had the bold inſincerity to declare, that in the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal points of public and private rectitude, above all, in pure and diſintereſted zeal for his country, that he will not ſhrink from a compariſon with any arrogant pretender to ſuperior and excluſive merit? Who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouled
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037170_0014_100CE0BE47563068"/>
the New-York elections, and repreſented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the umpire and leader of the federal party, it was a gentleman by the name of EGO, ſo notorious in every page of your pamphlet. <hi>Is there any thing more in this, than "a harmleſs foible."</hi> In your ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent deſire to be appointed commander in chief, ſome deductions may be made to prove the reſtleſs ambition that lurks in your boſom. Have you not been the ſtrenuous advocate of an extenſive miltary eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Did you not aſſert, and erroniouſly imagine, that the temper of the times was ſuited to commence the exiſtence of a ſtanding army? And was you not convinced from the relative ſituation of our country, that no ſolid advantage would ever be derived from it? What could have been your aim in the propagation of ſuch ſentiments, but perſonal aggrandizement at the painful expence of public liberty and ſocial happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Remember, that at this enlightened period of ſociety, political hypocriſy is liable to detection, and that the diſguſting age of chivalry and vaſſalage is gone. Remember that you are an American citizen, and that every Caeſar has reaſon to tremble at the ides of March. Long degraded and inſulted man has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed his privileges, and vindicated his rights. An ennobling courage has ſucceeded to niggardly ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and villanous oppreſſion has vaniſhed before the intrepid and irreſiſtable march of mind. Imagine yourſelf in Turkey and your principles at home. But in America, neither an age or a century can render them acceptable and congenial with the feelings of a magnanimous people. With an ignorant community chains are tolerable, but in a country where ſcience has beamed, what daring deſpot will meaſure the ſtrength of a peaſants arm. Corruption may venture indirectly to aſſail the integrity of man, but all its
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:037170_0015_100CE0C116024AE8"/>
efforts will be vain; his houſe is built on a rock; thunders may roll their tempeſts, he ſtands unhurt and defies their rage. The cauſe of humanity is hourly gaining ground; encrimſoned Europe is recovering her rights, and the ſlumbering Ottoman begins to feel the nobility of his nature: How under ſuch an atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of human affairs could you have the weakneſs to imagine that your ambitious projects could be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? The uniform experience of mankind has meaſured the baneful conſequences of a ſtanding army. We all know, that as commander in chief of a ſtrong military force, you would have gained an undue influence in ſociety; an influence to which neither your talents or your virtue entitle you; an influence that might have made ſlaves of a few and fawning ſycophants of many. But the ſword and the mytre have loſt their veneration, and the great majority of our country is invulnerable to corruption.</p>
            <p>Your reflections on the official conduct of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident reſpecting our negociations with France, are of a nature too extraordinary to eſcape notice. They confirm beyond the power of denial, the opinion I had long ſince formed of your political character. They demonſtrate your inveterate and deſtructive hoſtility to the government of France. They point out your co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incidence of mind with the Britiſh miniſtry, in inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting the cauſe of republicaniſm, and provoking and encouraging a war of extermination; a war that has been carried on by deception, corruption, and terror. What a happy opportunity unfolded itſelf for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of federal indignation, when General Pinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney was refuſed to be received by the government of France. The friend of Old England, the patronized refugee, and the apoſtate American, united in their reſentment againſt the glorious ſtruggles of a magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:037170_0016_100CE0C2D5364858"/>
people. Here was a lucky moment by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded accuſations againſt France, to cover the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous deformities of a Britiſh miniſtry. Here was a field opened to ſecond the deſigns of an infamous fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the very boſom of our country. Here was an unlimited grant for the impreſſment and butchery of our ſeamen; for the plunder of our ſhips; and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſement of our national character.</p>
            <p>If it ſhould even be conſented that France treated us ill by a refuſal of Pinckney, will not every conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate politician reprobate the conduct of the federal party at that critical juncture? Whilſt their property was waſting under their feet, the moſt degrading delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion induced them to cultivate the punic friendſhip of the haughtieſt and moſt inſidious power in Europe. This was no diſparagement of national honor—this was no wound to national independence. Habitual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion had worn away the delicate ſenſibility of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican character. The refuſal of Mr. Pinckney by France, has covered a multitude of Britiſh ſins, and ſo deep is the attachment of monarchiſm rooted in the hearts of many a federaliſt and anglo-American: So complete their weakneſs and madneſs, that although cloathed in rags and reduced to beggary by ſpoliations on our commerce, the tune of "God ſave the king," is ſtill an ingredient in their morning devotions. Why was it that France would not accept of Mr. Pinckney? Was it becauſe ſhe was indiſpoſed to terms of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to this country? Or will you not rather ſay that the unfeeling tone of your party and of adminiſtration, opened ſome little ground for national reſentment? Our prints were loaded with the moſt unfounded ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies; and a ſtruggle was reprobated the nobleſt in the annals of time, with which the liberty and happineſs of unborn millions is eſſentially connected.
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:037170_0017_100CE0C473EAE0D8"/>
Your diſaffection to their cauſe commenced, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to your own confeſſion, in the year 1792, when Britiſh gold had not yet opened thoſe ſcenes of horror and deſolation, of cruelty and blood, that attended the latter ſtages of their revolution. Your animoſity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them unqueſtionably may be aſcribed to the painful apprehenſion, that a ſpirit was diffuſing itſelf ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to thrones and the debaſing eſtabliſhments of the earth. This was the ſpirit you had reſolved to reſiſt: but the giant ſtrides of liberty are not to be impeded by the effeminate efforts of a pigmy politician. Under circumſtances like theſe, would not France have dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed her importance by the admiſſion of Pinckney, a character whoſe animoſity to republicaniſm can only be equalled by your own? Morris had given them a leſſon of caution, and they too well knew that his mind were compoſed of the ſame hoſtile and ranca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous materials.</p>
            <p>Mr. Pinckney having been rejected by the French government from the ſtrongeſt political reaſons, a commiſſion of three was determined on as the only certain road to an amicable adjuſtment of differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The republicans cheriſhed and ſupported the plan as eſſentially connected with the ſubſtantial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the country. But many federaliſts, notwiht<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding what you have advanced, loudly exclaimed againſt the meaſure, called for war, and encouraged a more intimate connection with perfidious Britain. You are not excluded from this number: your tongue and your pen were both employed to favor its ſucceſs. Cannot this fact be illuſtrated by a circumſtance which among other conſiderations renders you unworthy of executive confidence? Did you not open your budget to the Biſhop of Autun? Was you not duped, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded, and outwitted by an emigrant prieſt? When
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:037170_0018_100CE0C6CB587EC8"/>
he had fully poſſeſſed himſelf of the ſtate of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; when he had learnt that Great-Britain was an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of more affectionate regard than France; was it not to be expected that the prime-miniſter of France would feel a degree of coolneſs towards our envoys? But it was a coolneſs marked with diſcrimination that protected and honored the character of Mr. Gerry. With what affected pride is the name of Pinckney ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of as an efficient member of this commiſſion; when, if his conduct on that occaſion is duly eſtimat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he deſerves to be neglected and forgotten. This was a glorious opportunity to invigorate the cauſe of federaliſm, and ſtrengthen the nerves of the Britiſh faction. "Tribute was demanded as a preliminary to negociation." But remember that federaliſm pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked the demand, and that a ſerious dereliction of republican virtues was truly deſerving of ſuch treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>The capricious conduct of the Preſident in forming the laſt miſſion is certainly very reprehenſible; altho' in the event he acted like a prudent and diſpaſſionate politician, yet many circumſtances connected with the embaſſy, place him in the moſt diſagreeable and unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable light. Suſpended in the air, by conflicting ſentiments and diſcordant perſuaſions, there was a doubtful tendency to heaven or to earth, to negocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or to reſiſtance. Atè hot from hell, had counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with Federaliſm, and unkenneled the dogs of war; but the loud voice of the public called for peace, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt the intereſted remonſtraces of peculating com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſaries and an indolent and uſeleſs ſoldiery. No dangers threatened us at home or from abroad, and the wiſdom of Congreſs diſbanded a military eſtabliſhment that annoyed the tranquillity of ſociety, and that ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitably tended to the degradation of public morals.
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:037170_0019_100CE0CA2457BDD0"/>
The citizen and the ſoldier had already diſſolved their connection, and the meaneſt vices were patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized by the pretended friends of liberty.</p>
            <p>Is it not a matter of ſerious regret, that the laſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cific effort of the Preſident has been crowned with ſucceſs? Is it not an unhappy circumſtance, that a friendly intercourſe ſhould be eſtabliſhed with a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>whom no treaty, no convention can bind?</hi> Is it not an awful conſideration, that a republic ſhould be countenanced, which has ſhaken the thrones of kings, and waged a ſucceſsful war againſt the tyrants and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyers of mankind? Is it not criminal in the higheſt degree, to cultivate the friendſhip of a people, who have looſened the bonds of moral intercourſe, and deſpoiled the venerable altars of the unknown God? Would it not have been more prudent in the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, to have ſuſpended negociation until the re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of the houſe of Bourbon, and the extinction of republican manaiſm and popular licentiouſneſs?</p>
            <p>Every genuine friend to this country feels his ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity enlarged by the eſtabliſhment of republicaniſm in France. If their revolutionary ſtruggle had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſsful, monarchy would, perhaps, have aſſumed a tone inauſpicious to the future liberty of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, for the vicious ariſtocracy of Europe has many kindred ſpirits amongſt us. The innocent and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous ſhades of liberty would ſoon have been invaded by the tyranny of power, and republicaniſm a unit amidſt the empires of the world, might have fallen a victim to irritated deſpotiſm. Another republic is an acquiſition of the higheſt moment to the friends of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity. It is planted on a ſoil that will nouriſh its growth. The ſtrokes of tyranny cannot injure it; for eternity has meaſured its duration. The plains of Europe are whitened with the bones of innocent and
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:037170_0020_100CE0CBCD485460"/>
guilty millions: the fatherleſs and the motherleſs are bewailing their loſs in this ſanguinary war; but yet the purchaſe is cheap. Providence has authoriſed it, and ages of liberty and happineſs are deſtined to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to centuries of miſery, depreſſion, and ſervitude.</p>
            <p>The French republic always felt the warmeſt affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the American people. Even amidſt the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent ſcenes of their revolution, the rights of neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality would never have been violated, if neceſſity had not compelled them—if the toryiſm of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try had not inſulted them—and if our political organs had not ſpoken a language unfriendly to their proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. The breach, however, is cloſed, and an honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able treaty has been negociated, contrary to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Mr. Hamilton—contrary to the wiſhes of non-conſulted miniſters—and, contrary to the ſentiments of a contemptible anglo-American faction. Debilitated Britain mourns the event; and her tranſatlantic agents are proſtrate in the duſt.</p>
            <p>If Mr. Adams had deſcended to conſult his miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, what muſt have been our ſituation? If <hi>your</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſive advice had been received, what would have been the condition of your country? Embroiled in an unprofitable war, commerce would have been at a ſtand, and the cauſe of liberty on the decline. A ſtanding ſoldiery would have gluttonized on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of ſociety, and inſidious vice would have way-laid every ennobling feeling of the breaſt. Theſe would have been days of clover to a federal army, but days of tribulation and ſorrow to the virtuous phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanthropiſt.</p>
            <p>"Another revolution, another conſtitution over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown," was a cogent reaſon againſt opening a nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation. Unſettled in their affairs and capricious in their meaſures, it was impoſſible to calculate on a
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:037170_0021_100CE0CD6299B638"/>
permanent compliance with any convention whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. This is expreſsly the language of the Britiſh miniſtry, and the ſuperficial pretence that ſupports the war in Europe. Furniſh me an inſtance in which the revolutionary government of France has departed from any ſolemn ſtipulation with her neighbours; has ſhe violated the laws of nations in that groſs and diſhonorably way that diſtinguiſhes the cabinet of St. James; has ſhe made power the meaſure of her juſtice, and the umpire of her differences? Has ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected the rights of humanity, or offered an inſult without the ſtrongeſt provocations? No, ever magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous, the fair and immutable principles of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, have been the faithful guardians of her conduct. But it was a degrading miſſion, the honor and intereſt of the country was at ſtake. How delicate is your ſenſibility when the Frenchman pricks with a pin, but how callous is your boſom when the Engliſhman ſtabs at the vitals of your country. In the one caſe reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment boils and vents in calumny; in the other a ſavage joy unfeelingly riots on the public misfortune.</p>
            <p>In your mind the intereſted inducements to accept a place in our adminiſtration are few and feeble, and therefore the conſoling honour of Preſidential reſpect, ought to have been beſtowed on the miniſtry at Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, as an additional compenſation for their political toils. Five thouſand dollars is a niggardly ſalary that muſt inevitably "involve pecuniary ſacrifice to every <hi>honeſt</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">The word "honeſt" ſtands in italics to render it conſpicuous; a circumſtance that leads me to think you have not forgotten yourſelf.</note> man of pre-eminent talents." Recollect that we live in a republican country, and that a national oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy is neceſſary to its exiſtence, that we contracted an immenſe debt, for which our honour and reſources are pledged, and that the funding ſyſtem has not yet
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:037170_0022_100CE0CF861D6E00"/>
convinced the American people that a national debt is a national bleſſing. England may ſquander mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions on miniſters, whilſt her ſtreets are crowded with beggars; a proud and licentious nobility may waſte at entertainments, the hard earned fruits of a tax-ridden peaſantry.</p>
            <p>A ſpectacle of this kind may gladden the heart of a villain, but who that feels as a man, can ſuppreſs the reſentment of his heart?</p>
            <p>Independent of pecuniary conſiderations, public ingratitude is a ſerious ground of complaint. Your own experience has ſhewn how illy the patriot may be requited for the moſt important ſervices. Inſtead of enjoying the affectionate homage of your country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, your conduct has been reviled. "A large har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt of obliquy has been your ſhare, and calumnies more dangerous than a two-edged ſword have been vomited forth againſt a fair and unblemiſhed reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. A reputation which I have the unbluſhing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence to aſſert, will not yield in merit to any arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant pretender whatſoever. The <hi>reſpectable</hi> Picker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the <hi>deſerving</hi> M'Henry, have unfortunately fallen victims to ſimilar evils. After a long and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſtruggle to benefit their country, and to beguile a whiſper from the trumpet of fame, the Preſident has diſmiſſed them as undeſerving of his confidence: and an ungrateful people has loaded them in exile with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of the blackeſt die. The wheel of fortune may recall you with the Pickerings and the M'Henrys, the Daytons, and the Morris's into conſideration again. But until that uncertain hour arrives, conſole yourſelves, if you can, with

            <p>You have adduced a number of ſuperficial argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to prove, that the miſſion ought to have been

ſuſpended agreeable to the wiſhes of our miniſters, and have endeavoured to mark out a line of action that would have been truly degrading to the American character. The unſettled ſituation of French affairs, and the uncertain proſpect of a general peace, were the two great hinges on which your objections turned. But has not the deep-ſighted politician been deceived, and has not a peace been accelerated by the firm de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the Preſident? If your miſerable arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice had been practiſed by furniſhing miniſters abroad with ſecret inſtructions, the ſincerity of our govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would have been queſtioned by other nations, and a jealous vigilance would have retarded the moſt deſirable arrangement; France on a diſcovery would have kept us at a diſtance; and an expenſive military eſtabliſhment would have accumulated the burthens of an already diſſatisfied people. Is it not wonderful, paſſing wonderful! that you ſhould feel yourſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured by the diſreſpect of the Preſident, when your conduct has afforded ſo many circumſtances that tend to the diminution of his confidence? What a morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication to vanity and ambition, to obliterate an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merited compliment from an official report! Surely the Preſident cannot be reproached for his conduct on this occaſion; but M'Henry only, the diſtinguiſhed particeps in your foibles and your follies. If his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment had not been blind to the impreſſions of truth, how could he conſiſtently have eulogized you in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with Waſhington, whoſe name has an alliance with virtue, whilſt your's ſeeks ſhelter under a diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trically oppoſite principle? Was it ill-treatment, then, in the Preſident to diſmiſs a man who poſſeſſed too many demerits for his ſtation, and who abuſed lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage by laviſhing praiſes, where cenſure ſhould have held her dominion? A continuance of ſuch a charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

in office, would have been highly criminal in the Executive, and in the higheſt degree inſulting to the public underſtanding. The intemperate conduct of Pickering throughout the whole of his adminiſtration, has left no ground for public reſpect. His political death can only be lamented by that cordial Britiſh fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of whoſe exiſtence Mr. Adams had but too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny aſſurances. Let the two unfortunate outcaſts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſole themſelves with the conſideration, that it is not unpleaſant to die in company.<note n="*" place="bottom">Louis the 14th when in extremity, and ſurrounded by his friends, declared that it was pleaſant to die in company.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The conduct of the Preſident in the pardoning of Fries and others, is truly meritorious. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cenſure that his enemies have meaſured againſt him, he exerciſed a prerogative of mercy, and reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a number of unfortunate victims to their families, their friends, and the world. Public indignation would have been arouſed by their execution, and conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of an alarming nature would have enſued, in which even government itſelf would have received a wound. The genius of a republic is mildneſs; the wheel, the gibbet, and the guillotine, may anſwer an advantage under the reign of terror; but with freemen they are objects of horror and deteſtation. They ſuit the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitous reign of a Caligula, and not the enlightened period in which you demand their exerciſe. Recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, Sir, that this manly reſiſtance to theſe laws, ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginated in a perſuaſion that they operated unequally, and plundered the public indirectly; that exciſemen and public officers conſumed the greateſt portion of a tax that was collected by threats, by inſults, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion: a tax that expoſed the circumſtances of men by daily viſitations and nocturnal ſearches: a tax that has eminated from the criminal ſentiment, that there is a ſwiniſh multitude who muſt be governed by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception;
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:037170_0025_100CD65A8E5E8720"/>
and who would raiſe up their hands againſt direct application. The public mind, at the time of reſiſtance to the tax, was extremely agitated: it was penetrated with a ſenſe of its injuſtice and the extent of its oppreſſion. The military that was raiſed on that occaſion, was in a tenfold adequate to ſuppreſs the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection. On their approach to Eaſt-Town diſaffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was gone, and only a few ſcattered individuals could be ſeized as the violaters of the laws.<note n="*" place="bottom">It is generally underſtood that an old woman was the principal cauſe of the inſurrection, that ſhe had ſcalded an exciſeman by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, which was repreſented as having been done through intention; the horn of ſtate was immediately blown, and the ſtrong arm of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeized on her huſband.</note> The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of the military was attended with circumſtances of diſgrace, that will only be recorded in the pages of infamy and crimes. Every place they halted at, ſome act of madneſs, licentiouſneſs, or folly, was perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated to the laſting diſhonor of the citizen ſoldier.</p>
            <p>Did the pardon of Mr. Adams under the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that have been mentioned, ſeem like a conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to his political enemies? Can that be deemed a temporiſing ſpirit which is regulated by juſtice and tempered by an amiable clemency? Could he looſe any reſpect as executive magiſtrate, with diſcerning friends, or the warmeſt enemies, by one of the moſt agreeble features of his adminiſtration? That he was at variance with himſelf as well as with ſound policy, is perhaps no more than the vagrant ſentiment of a ſanguinary boſom, and a diſappointed enemy. Cruel meaſures are oftentimes ruinous, and a government is never better eſtabliſhed, than when ſupported by the enlightened will of a country. Barbarity awakens enemies, mercy inſpires friendſhip and ameliorates the heart. That inſurrection has been organized down to the very liberties of Philadelphia, is the ſuggeſtion
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:037170_0026_100CE0D9312C2A50"/>
of guilty apprehenſion, or the extravagant ſentiment of a diſordered imagination. That Mifflin could have advanced ſuch an opinion, will not, cannot be credited; but the dead can be quoted to juſtify a falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, whilſt the living to anſwer certain purpoſes, may injure their memory.</p>
            <p>According to your own confeſſion you have cauſes of perſonal diſſatisfaction with Mr. Adams, which perhaps would have ſunk into oblivion, if he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed you as commander in chief. But were there not characters of older merit in the country, more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of the ſituation than yourſelf, or have they all fallen under the deſtroying hand of time? What has been your conſequence in the field, to juſtify ſuch ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogant pretenſions? Is your body diſtinguiſhed by ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable wounds? Is your experience adequate to a ſtation that calls for extraordinary talents and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plined valour? You are either a ſoldier by experience or by inſtinct; but point out the field where you reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a laurel or merited an ovation. Have you dreamt that you poſſeſſed the martial qualities of a Frederick and a Marlborough, a Turene and a marſhal Saxe? let the hour of vigilance inform you, that your ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination muſt have been intoxicated by the moſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious vanity.</p>
            <p>Having already pointed out ſome extraordinary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in your political creed, it is time to make a near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er approach, and inveſtigate thoſe cardinal points of private rectitude, which your boldneſs has opened to the ſevereſt inveſtigation. It would ſeem from the firmneſs of your aſſertion, that you either have forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the occurrences of late years, or that the moſt fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant violations of morality are not regarded as crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. If old age had worn away the retentive facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of your mind, we might be reduced to believe that ſome of the moſt <hi>tranſporting</hi> and <hi>luxuriant</hi> occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:037170_0027_100CE0DC09F5D5D0"/>
of your life were cancelled from your memory. But as ſuch an opinion is not warranted you are deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tined to appear a hardened offender againſt the rules of propriety, and thoſe delicate ties that embrace our happineſs, and give a zeſt to exiſtence; altho' an inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate enemy to France, have you not proven by your female intrigues, that a ſpirit of gallantry is one of the ſtrongeſt characteriſtics of your heart; fortunately for yourſelf you breathe a northern latitude; in ſome warmer climate, where the paſſions are more inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, your ſenſual deſires would have levelled you with the beaſts of the field; even the froſts of America are incapable of cooling your blood, and the eternal ſnows of Nova Zembla would hardly reduce you to the ſtandard of common propriety.</p>
            <p>What might have been the fate of Reynolds, if you had been commander in chief, and the country in a ſtate of war, when the fair Maria engroſſed your affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Would you not have followed the footſteps of David, and placed this modern Uriah in the front of battle? Is it not probable that your moral elements have derived their character from a peruſal of the lives of Abraham and of Lott, of David and of Solomon, who lived in times when polygamy was countenanced, and when that amiable and valuable ſex was leſs vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and reſpected, than in modern days. But the cuſtoms of the ancients ſhall plead you no excuſe; the loud voice of Nature riſes up againſt you; ſhe repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates in the moſt ſolemn and impreſſive language, a monopoly that lowers and debaſes the human ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and that breathes diſcord and miſery, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a profuſion of every earthly bleſſing. Well might you complain of your poverty, when you reſigned the office of ſecretary of the treaſury: that enchanting calypſo, under the extravagance of your attachment had fingered your purſe; ſhe ſaw into
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:037170_0028_100CE0DEB238FEA0"/>
your weakneſs, and knew how to govern you by the ſtricteſt attentions and the moſt beguiling flatteries. Oh! theſe were ſweet and elyſian days, this was a time that awakened all the ſoft and tender fibres of the heart: the ſhortened hours danced away amidſt the affecting ſmiles of Love and Joy, the little cupids played around, and Sorrow and Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſerted the intereſting manſion of thoſe conge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial ſouls; it was a picture of bliſs and rapture, to which every ſcene hitherto witneſſed was abſolute mockery. It was a ſcene on which the voluptuous Antoniette would have dwelt with the moſt cordial ſatisfaction; it was a ſcene of extacy, the like of which no tongue can tell, and which no eye before had witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. But, alas! pleaſures ſo intenſe are of ephemeron duration; a nipping froſt unexpectedly came, and this once happy pair were ſeparated for ever. The public began to ſmell the rat, and ſee, after a long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion, that the favorite ſinking fund was playing a looſing game. Now public character was at ſtake, and precious confeſſions became neceſſary to ſilence the reſentment of the people. The Cyprian Goddeſs remonſtrated in vain, the unfortunate Maria, was doomed to an expoſure of all others, the moſt poig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and afflicting to female ſenſibility.</p>
            <p>From even this ſlender ſurvey of your private mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, was it not the moſt arrogant preſumption to challenge an inveſtigation. <hi>What becomes of your car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal points, if mankind are permitted to ſpeak the truth?</hi> The human mind is a unit, and it may be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted with firmneſs and with truth, that he who enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains no reſpect for the relations of private life, cannot be truſted with ſafety in a public capacity, if the virtue to reſiſt temptation in the one caſe is not ſufficiently maſculine, there is every reaſon to ſuſpect it will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray its effeminacy in the other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:037170_0029_100CE0E1320AD638"/>After treating you with all the delicacy that was due to your character and performance; after proving by a ſummary of the ſtrongeſt teſtimony, your attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to monarchy; after developing the vain and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious ſpirit that impels your actions; after enumerat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the circumſtances that occaſioned your exploſion; and, after pointing out the immoral features of your private life, I proceed to diſcuſs the merit of the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didates for the preſidency.</p>
            <p>Having no perſonal diſſatisfaction with Mr. Adams, I ſhall treat his character with deference and with can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour. It has long been a received opinion, that he is friendly to monarchiſm and hereditary eſtabliſhments, for the proof and confirmation of which we muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to his writings and confidential converſations. The ſpirit of his defence of the conſtitutions, certainly breathes a tone of mind illy ſuited to the genius of a republican government; although he has not favored us with an open avowal, yet the indirect intimations of his diſpoſition leave no room for the ſmalleſt doubt. In addition to this, let any ingenuous mind weigh the developement of Tench Coxe, and I defy him to pronounce favorably on the political creed of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident. Whether monarchy found him a friend in early life, or whether his ſoul became tainted by his Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean viſits, I will not venture to determine, but there is ground to ſuſpect that the ſplendor and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence of royalty, have had ſome influence on a mind not too well confirmed in a knowledge of the rights of mankind.</p>
            <p>Mr. Adams has very ſlender pretenſions to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency of character; his firſt ſpeech to both houſes of Congreſs, is of a truly equivocal nature. Popularity was evidently his aim, he wiſhed to monopolize as far as he was capable, the friendly diſpoſition of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic. At that particular juncture, it was of ſervice to
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:037170_0030_100CE0E359B567D8"/>
his country, as it leſſoned the bitterneſs of party, and the venom of faction, as it opened a field of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation with a nation which deſerved more of us than intemperate federaliſm had been willing to grant. His firmneſs on ſome occaſions is truly reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectable and particularly manifeſted in the diſmiſſal of Pickering and M'Henry, and in his refuſal to conſult a diſappointed intruder. At other times again his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct is marked with weakneſs, improper compliance, and unneceſſary conceſſions. His underſtanding may have ſuſtained ſome injury by the aſſaults of time, but it never could have been very maſculine or brilliant. His writings bear teſtimony againſt his intellect, they are often confuſed and unmeaning, and tainted with the moſt painful vanity; <hi>ſo much for the Duke of Brain-tree.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next in order is Mr. Pinckney of whom little can be ſaid, as he is little known on the theatre of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive public life. You have called him before the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, and loaded him with the moſt extravagant praiſe. If your ſincerity could not be doubted, he would paſs for one of the brighteſt luminaries of our country. His wiſdom, his firmneſs and his calm deliberation would certainly entitle him to the ſuffrages of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; but the public underſtanding cannot be ſo glar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly impoſed on. Some proof of his worth is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, before he can have a reaſonable ground to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the higheſt magiſtracy of the country. If con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all expectation, he ſhould be raiſed to that eminence, what have not the friends of republicaniſm to apprehend? The reins of government would be held by a private individual in diſgrace, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable office of Preſident would be filled by an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomaton. Principles would be inculcated and diſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated inauſpicious to Liberty. The Conſtitution would receive a wound, and energy would be heaped
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:037170_0031_100CE0E6411C83F0"/>
on energy to cruſh the ſpirit of the people, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnify ambition in its daring invaſions.</p>
            <p>I now come to a character, which miſrepreſentation cannot ſtain, and which the breath of calumny has vainly endeavoured to injure. It is the worthy and venerable Jefferſon, who has walked with dignity in every public and private calling, and whom every honeſt man in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope and America will love and eſteem; the man whoſe mind is illumed with ſcience, and whoſe heart is replete with good; the man who has ſtood firm and unſhaken amidſt the venality of courts, and the temptations of power; the man who endited the Declaration of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence, and who under every ſacrifice grappled his heart to the freedom of his country. Amidſt all the little revolutions and commotions that have occurred under our government, has not the conduct of Jef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferſon been diſtinguiſhed by the moſt exemplary wiſdom and virtue? the love he bore his country out-weighed every private conſideration;— his magnanimous ſoul would not ſtoop to the degrading meaſures of his cotemporaries in office. An enemy to ſycophants, and deaf to flatteries, he merits the confidence of the American. Deep in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearch, and cool in deliberation, a precipitate ſacrifice of the public proſperity can never be apprehended. Waſhington loved him and knew his worth; he felt a ſecurity in his advice, that gave a firmneſs and dignity to the whole of his adminiſtration. If it is of importance to a country that the national character ſhould be reſpected, let us chooſe a man at the head of public affairs; whoſe virtue and whoſe know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is univerſally eſteemed, and who by his unſullied courſe of life, and his patriotic firmneſs, has proved that no party conſiderations can draw him from the duties of his ſtation and the intereſt of his country; could it have been imagined that ſo many miniſters of the goſpel would have riſen up againſt him, and that the ſanctity of the pulpit would have been violated by the tongue of ſlander, and the bittereſt anathemas? could it have been imagined that the duties of religion would have been neglected; that the altar of God would have been deſerted, for the propagation of the baſeſt and meaneſt calumnies? But there are other motives that have given riſe to the diſguſting clamor of theſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natic prieſts: it is not the good of their country, and the cauſe of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, that has induced them to deſert the duties of their ſtation; they are looking forward to thoſe <hi>happy days,</hi> when a meritricious union ſhall be formed between church and ſtate; when public councils ſhall be controuled by a clerical nod, and when the exactions of the titheman ſhall grind the face of the poor.</p>
