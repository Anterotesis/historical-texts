            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AS the tax which has lately been laid on our American colonies is like to come under the review of parliament ſome time this ſeſſion, and as I lately arrived from North America, where I reſided ſeveral years; I beg leave, with all dutiful ſubmiſſion, to give you my ſentiments on that ſubject. If I am ſo happy as to caſt any light upon a queſtion of ſo much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, I am certain of your approbation, and ſhall have rendered the greateſt ſervice in my power to the public.</p>
            <p>From the aſſiduous care of our preſent miniſtry to reſtore commerce and ſatisfaction to every branch of His Majeſty's dominions, there is great reaſon to believe they will recommend a <hi>repeal,</hi> or at leaſt ſome conſiderable <hi>alterations</hi> of the American Stamp-Act; and as ſome weighty arguments now offer againſt that Act, which could not have been foreſeen when it was made, there is the greateſt reaſon to believe the parliament in general will come into one or other of theſe meaſures.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:010402_0003_0F7F74FC45CA6818"/>It is a pity that any who treat of American af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, ſhould ever handle them as if they had no deſire to find out truth, nor any thing elſe in view, than to irritate or ſtir up one part of His Majeſty's dominions againſt another, by affecting to eſpouſe the cauſe of one, while they load the other with the moſt opprobious language; as if it were poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the intereſt of Great-Britain and her co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies could be ſeparated, much leſs oppoſite to one other: I have ever conſidered their connexion like that which ſubſiſts between the natural body and its members; if the members ſuffer, the body muſt ſuffer alſo. For this reaſon, we ſhould not barely conſider how the Stamp-Act may affect our American colonies, but how it muſt affect the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſtrength and proſperity of His Majeſty's do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions: And, purſuing this plan, I hope to prove even to a demonſtration, That</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is for the Intereſt of</hi> Great Britain, <hi>that the Stamp-Act ſhould be repealed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the courſe of this proof, it is hardly neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for me to enquire what <hi>Right</hi> the parliament of Great Britain may have to tax our American colonies; eſpecially as the parliament has, at any time, the <hi>Power</hi> of reſolving that queſtion. Yet, as I ſhall have occaſion to mention the preſent diſpoſition of our coloniſts towards the Stamp-Act, it may not be improper to ſhew, That they have at leaſt the <hi>Appearance</hi> of reaſon for their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:010402_0004_0F7F74FCF3106728"/>I. It is ſaid, The colonies are under great obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to Britain for the expence ſhe has been at, in planting and ſupporting them; in particular, the blood and treaſure we ſpent, during the late war, on <hi>their account,</hi> has brought them greatly in our debt. Hence it is proper they ſhould be taxed, to refund ſome part of thoſe expences.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That a ſtanding army is neceſſary in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, and it is proper they ſhould be taxed for its ſupport.</p>
            <p n="3">III. That Great-Britain being involved in debt, and loaded with taxes, it is proper her colonies ſhould ſupport ſome ſhare of the burthen. I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe one or other of theſe reaſons, (for I have not read the Preamble to the Stamp-Act) induced the parliament to tax our colonies. They ſhall be conſidered in order.—</p>
            <p>It is a general opinion, that our North American colonies are greatly indebted to Britain for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of planting them, and for the blood and treaſure we have ſpent, during the late war, <hi>on their account.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our coloniſts are certainly indebted to the moſt righteous prince that ever ſwayed a ſcepter, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his royal anceſtors, for their enjoyment of every liberty, civil and religious, that might conduce to the proſperity of any people.—And, in return, they have paid the moſt affectionate loyalty, and have ever appeared ready to ſpend the laſt drop of their blood, whenever His Majeſty's ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:010402_0005_0F7F74FD6366AAF8"/>
or the ſafety of his dominions, required their aſſiſtance: But as to pecuniary obligations between them and Great-Britain, I humbly preſume, the Ballance is in their favour.</p>
            <p>There was a time when their fore-fathers<note n="*" place="bottom">In this caſe, as well as when I ſpeak of the virtue, induſtry, or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance of our coloniſts; of the blood they have ſpent during the late war; of their country producing all the neceſſaries of life; of the annual ſum they may be ſuppoſed to pay by a Stamp Act, &amp;c. in general, when I ſpeak of our coloniſts I mean thoſe on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent of America and not thoſe in our Weſt Indian Iſlands, as the latter are a perfect contraſt to the former.</note> in Britain, being neither allowed to enjoy civil or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious liberty, rather than reſiſt the powers that were, requeſted that they might retreat into the wilderneſs of America, and were graciouſly allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to poſſeſs a tract of land, which coſt Great-Britain nothing, and which was really the property and poſſeſſion of its native ſavages: Thither they went, and at the expence of their own money and their own blood, ſubdued the natives, and convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a wilderneſs into a fruitful country, which is now a valuable part of the Britiſh empire. Our parliament ever ſince ſo conducted matters, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions and reſtrictions on their trade, that theſe infant colonies alone have ſerved the purpoſe of <hi>increaſing</hi> our ſubjects, <hi>maintaining</hi> our poor, <hi>ſtrengthening</hi> our navy, <hi>conſuming our manufactures,</hi> and returning us the annual profit of immenſe ſums. Does it hence appear that they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted any debt with Great-Britain? While ſome of us were rolling in affluence and eaſe, others
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:010402_0006_0F7F750461D7F890"/>
wearing themſelves out with diſſipation and vice, and thouſands making a prey of one another; if their fathers, by a ſingular fortitude and virtue, bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the fury of the ſeas, and danger or death in every form, from famine and the ſword, among wild beaſts and ſavages; if they have, by the moſt arduous labour, changed that wilderneſs into a ſource of endleſs wealth to Great Britain, does it from thence follow, that they are under great obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to us? I ſhould think the contrary. But the colonies are ſaid to be greatly in our debt, for the blood and treaſure we have ſpent <hi>on their account,</hi> during the late war. Perhaps even this account is pretty well ſettled; but that we may form a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per judgment on this ſubject, which is ſo often mentioned, it will be neceſſary to review the cauſe and event of that war: The facts are theſe;— our Britiſh North American colonies are extended along the ſhore near 2000 miles, and backwards not 200 miles, upon an average: The limits of theſe colonies are fixed by charter, and ſeveral of them are already full, though not very thick ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled. An immeaſurable territory lies behind theſe colonies, which is not theirs, nor did they ever claim it; their charter gave them no pretenſions to ſuch a claim: It is the territory of Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, never yet located, nor granted to any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſubject. It was natural to ſuppoſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that ſoon as the bounds of her preſent colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies were all peopled, ſhe would alſo divide this
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:010402_0007_0F7F7504FB45F728"/>
wilderneſs into other colonies, which might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a new ſource of riches and power. But the French had perfidiouſly ſurrounded our preſent colonies by a chain of forts, and thereby muſt have cut off all hopes of future increaſe to our domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: in this caſe it was the intereſt of Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, it was abſolutely neceſſary for her to remove the French; and removed they were, by a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ſucceſsful conflict; but did the Britons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone bleed during that war, or did they alone bear the expence? No Sir, brave and generous as the Britons were, the Coloniſts have not been a whit behind them.</p>
            <p>A ſingle colony which was planted about 90 years ago, paid near half a million towards the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral expence: the four New-England colonies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone raiſed and ſupported 20000 men <hi>per annum,</hi> and it appears from good evidence, that they loſt near 30000 men during the ſervice. In general, this war has made ſuch havock from one end to the other of our infant colonies, that the flower of their youth are deſtroyed, and the ſurvivors loaded with taxes, to pay the debts which were then contracted. In return for this profuſion of blood, our coloniſts have obtained the ſecurity of their preſent eſtates; they have alſo acquired per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual honor to the Britiſh arms, and a vaſt additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of empire to the kingdom, whoſe ſubjects they are. But all theſe acquiſitions being chiefly imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, can never help them to pay greater taxes
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:010402_0008_0F7F7506B4DCB700"/>
than formerly; and I confeſs, it does not appear that they have made any other acquiſitions. It is true, that ſeveral French and Spaniſh colonies are added to our dominions upon the continent, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a vaſt extent of wilderneſs, but that is nothing to the preſent coloniſts: their land is <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed,</hi> and not increaſed in value by theſe additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and their trade is <hi>worſe</hi> inſtead of better; for the more land is to be purchaſed on the continent, ſo much the leſs will any purchaſer give for what is now occupied, the greater poſſeſſions we have on the continent of North America, and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter quantity of indigo, rice, tobacco, hemp, flax, furr, and timber that are thence imported, ſo much leſs muſt each colony gain by her trade in theſe arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and theſe are the commodities with which they pay their taxes. Who then have been gainers by our late war in America? The anſwer is plain, Great Britain has gained exceedingly.</p>
            <p>It is long ſince the neat balance of trade with our colonies was <hi>half a million</hi> per annum in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Great Britain, and by our late acquiſitions in America, it muſt ſoon become <hi>a million,</hi> I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend this is more than we gain by our trade in every other part of the world. Thus it appears that ſo much blood and treaſure was ſpent during the late war, on the account, almoſt <hi>the ſole ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Great Britain,</hi> and not of the colonies. And whoever conſiders the coloniſts in a juſt point of view, will confeſs they have done more than
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:010402_0009_0F7F750754BDE408"/>
could have been expected, as they really have done more than was ever required towards the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the late war.</p>
            <p>Every new acquiſition on the continent, muſt be entirely ſubſervient to the purpoſes of Great Britain, as our American coloniſts always have been. Theſe people are in general hardy, temperate and induſtrious, hence they have already opened an immenſe trade, the Profits of which, every ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, centers in this Iſland. As their country pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces every thing in abundance that is neceſſary for the preſervation of life, they might carry on a profitable trade at any foreign market. But this is not proper, nor is it permitted; our parliaments have ſo hedged them in with laws, reſtrictions, and prohibitions, that by their utmoſt induſtry, they can hardly pay their debts; furr is a valuable article, and a trade in hats would have been highly profitable for them; to prevent this, we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited their ſending hats even from one colony to another. This is the caſe of wool, and other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of like conſequence. Copper mines they have in abundance, but we have taken care, by proper regulations, to reap the chief profits ariſing from them; their houſes are univerſally covered with wood, almoſt in the ſhape of flat tiles, hence they have an extraordinary conſumption of nails, but we do not indulge them in the uſe of ſlitting mills, leſt they ſhould make nails for themſelves, and thereby hurt our manufacture. I need
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:010402_0010_0F7F7507EF3910C8"/>
hardly mention that they are not allowed to uſe any foreign manufacture, but as it comes thro' our hands, encreaſed in price by public duties, and the private gain of our merchants, by which means they pay us a pretty heavy tax. Nor need I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that there are numberleſs articles, the produce of their country, which they are not allowed to ſend even to Great Britain, on any account, leſt they ſhould hurt the price of like commodities in this iſland. It would be tedious to mention the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral reſtrictions we have laid on their trade, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions nevertheleſs, which the Americans can eaſily bear, as they are only negative, yet the trade of this iſland could not have flouriſhed if they had been neglected. Thus we have always been able to convert the induſtry and trade of our coloniſts into the riches and ſtrength of their mother coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Now, Sir, as it is plain that our colonies in North America have hitherto ſerved us, or rather they have been taxed by us, to the value of half a million per annum, that they have aſſiſted us at the expence of much blood and treaſure to acquire new colonies, by which <hi>we alone</hi> are to be profited, it ſeems cruel to make them ſuffer again for our advantage, by compelling them to refund our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences in the war.</p>
            <p n="2">II. It is further ſaid, that <hi>a ſtanding army ſhould be ſtationed in our colonies, and they ſhould be taxed for its ſupport.</hi> But I confeſs it does not appear to me why we ſhould tax our Engliſh colonies in
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:010402_0011_0F7F7508A3B5C110"/>
North America, for the ſupport of a ſtanding army; for this army is to be ſtationed there either on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Engliſh colonies, or on account of the French and Spaniſh ones, which we have late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conquered; it is evidently improper that our Engliſh coloniſts ſhould be taxed for the ſupport of an army which is deſigned to keep other co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies in ſubjection. I have heard an old maxim which ſeems founded on juſtice, viz. <hi>He that reaps the profit ſhould alſo bear the expence,</hi> or to this purpoſe, and certainly this maxim may very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be applied to the caſe in hand. Why ſhould the Engliſh North Americans ſupport an army to be ſtationed in Canada, or Penſacola and Mobille, any more than an army which is ſtationed in our other new conqueſts on the coaſts of Guinea? for by the latter they gain more than by the former, and ſurely their having ſpent much blood and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in conquering thoſe colonies, and adding them to the Britiſh dominion, can never be urged as a reaſon for their ſpending all the treaſure they have, or rather all they ever ſhall have, in preſerving them. It appears equally improper for us to tax our Engliſh North American colonies for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of an army to be ſtationed among themſelves; becauſe ſuch an army is no way neceſſary there, but, on the contrary, muſt prove very injurious. If a ſtanding force be neceſſary in theſe colonies, it muſt be for the purpoſes of the civil magiſtrate, <hi>viz.</hi> preſerving peace, and executing juſtice. But
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:010402_0012_0F7F750991A3CAF8"/>
as our ſeveral colonies have a compleat legiſlature, ſubordinate to that of Great-Britain, which has a power of forming militias, raiſing troops, &amp;c. and as they ought to be the beſt judges of their own wants, it would ſeem natural to leave the affair of regular troops to their own option, to be raiſed and paid as they ſhall find moſt convenient, or not to be raiſed at all, unleſs it be requiſite.—A few there have been, ſo little acquainted with the true ſtate of our American colonies, as to ſuppoſe that a ſtanding army is neceſſary there, even to preſerve the obedience of our Engliſh ſubjects to the crown of Great-Britain; but nothing can argue greater ignorance, as our coloniſts have hitherto appeared the moſt loyal of all his majeſty's ſubjects, and no man can be ſo wicked as to ſuppoſe that our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry will ever premeditate ſuch ſchemes of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion as may ſhake that loyalty, and enable him to foreſee that troops may be neceſſary. Whoever recollects that our colonies were in general planted by people who fled from England and Scotland, to eſcape the civil and religious perſecution of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer family, which God in mercy to this nation has baniſhed, may ſee an obvious reaſon why theſe coloniſts ſhould continue inviolably and regularly attached to His preſent Majeſty, and his illuſtrious family.—But we need not inquire into cauſes, while modern facts give ample teſtimony to this truth poſterity will hardly believe, concerning our coloniſts, that when danger was far enough from
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:010402_0013_0F7F750A2E8D1D40"/>
their borders, and ſo many of their youth deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in battle, that volunteers were not to be raiſed by any means; rather than the progreſs of His Majeſty's arms ſhould be retarded, they made laws to impreſs their ſons and brethren by thouſands in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſervice. This was always done upon the firſt notice of His Majeſty's pleaſure, ſignified by ſome miniſter of State: and if this people's loyalty may yet be ſuſpected, there never can any confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence be placed in ſubjects; ſince hitherto every appearance of loyalty has certainly been in favour of the coloniſts. If a ſtanding army ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately be quartered among our Engliſh colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in North America, it will prove the cauſe of a double tax, the moſt grievous of which has been little attended to.</p>
            <p>Our coloniſts can only flouriſh by induſtry, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, and frugality, the moment they forſake theſe virtues, they muſt ceaſe to be profitable ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to themſelves or Great Britain; an ancient kingdom that has an eſtabliſhed commerce may ſuſtain a little vanity, yet the moſt opulent king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms have at length been cruſhed under this weight, and Britain herſelf is ſenſibly injured by her diſſipated ſons; what muſt become of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant colony that has no trade but with Great-Britain, and is obliged to pay the balance, which is always againſt her, by an extraordinary ſhare of diligence. If the inhabitants of this colony ſhould be corrupted in their morals, if they ſhould learn
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:010402_0014_0F7F750B09242A08"/>
diſſipation and idleneſs from an army that has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do, if their ſons and daughters ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come leſs frugal or leſs chaſte by the converſation of men born to affluence, accuſtomed to the vices of an old country and trained up in the army, I fear, if ſuch things ſhould happen to an infant co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, muſt not population be retarded, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants ſoon become unable to pay their debts, and thence uſeleſs ſubjects to Great Britain?</p>
            <p>The third reaſon that I have heard given for the Stamp-act, ſhall now be conſidered, viz. <hi>Great Britain being involved in debt, and loaded with taxes, it is proper her colonies ſhould ſupport ſome ſhare of the Burthen.</hi> As this reaſon has the greateſt air of propriety, and doubtleſs had ſome influence on our late miniſtry, I ſhall take the more notice of it, eſpecially as an anſwer to it brings me to the chief purpoſe of this letter, and what I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed at the firſt to demonſtrate, which was this. <hi>It is for the intereſt of Great-Britain that the Stamp-act in North America be repealed.</hi> If I ſhould be able to prove this, every other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument would be immediately anſwered, for there might chance to be a caſe in which it would be cruel and unjuſt for us to tax a colony, even tho' we could be profited thereby, yet certainly, if that very tax were <hi>injurious</hi> to ourſelves, it would be on every account wrong to eſtabliſh it. And howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver our nation may be loaded with debt, if the Stamp-act ſhould prove injurious to Great Britain,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:010402_0015_0F7F750BAC7FA5B8"/>
               <hi>it muſt increaſe and not diminiſh the burden.</hi> With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out looking forward to a great diſtance, and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning every probable conſequence of the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Stamp-act, it muſt immediately injure Great Britain, by hurting her trade with the colonies: the extent of this injury we ſhall preſently conſider. There are two ways by which our trade with the colonies may be affected. The coloniſts may prove <hi>unwilling</hi> or <hi>unable</hi> to ſupport this trade; in either caſe, it muſt be ruined; and <hi>both</hi> are like to be the conſequence of a Stamp-act. It has never been counted either for the honor or intereſt of any legiſlature to grieve the ſubject, it is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally hurtful, and ſometimes dangerous to grieve them univerſally, and probably no act ever created ſuch univerſal diſquiet as the Stamp-act does in America. It is vain to ſay that any danger can poſſibly ariſe at preſent from our coloniſts endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to reſiſt the Stamp-act by force, they are neither able nor deſirous to contend with their mother-country, they know that we have troops enough on the continent to vex them, and could ſoon viſit them with a fleet that might blow them to atoms, nor does it appear that one perſon of note in the colonies ever thought of reſiſtance, tho' ſome people, ever pleaſed with calumnly and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, would fondly conſtrue ſome rude efforts of the common people into premeditated rebellion, in order to exaſperate our government againſt the unfortunate coloniſts, with the pleaſing proſpect
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:010402_0016_0F7F750C635C46D0"/>
of ſeeing our hands imbrued in the blood of our children. But it muſt prove fortunate for the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loniſts that our government is too juſt and humane not to redreſs their complaints, if this ſhould ſeem for the general good, notwithſtanding the impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent conduct of a few of their ignorant people. A nation which has lately given laws to Europe will never make a point of honor to chaſtiſe a few peaſants. But to return from this digreſſion, it is undoubtedly very eaſy for us to force the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans to comply with the Stamp-Act.</p>
            <p>But no fleet or army can make them <hi>willing;</hi> there is no argument ſo <hi>deciſive</hi> as that from the muzzle of a gun, and yet there is none leſs <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſive.</hi> The Americans muſt always judge ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their own capacities, in ſpite of our troops; and at preſent they certainly judge, that the parliament of Great-Britain has no right, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural or acquired, to tax her coloniſts: they may be miſtaken, but that very miſtake muſt injure our trade, and muſt produce the more fatal effects, the greater appearance of reaſon there is on their ſide. They ſay, this act <hi>deprives</hi> them of their moſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable <hi>charter-privilege,</hi> being taxed by their own repreſentatives, that however trifling we may count this circumſtance, they have purchaſed their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges at the expence or riſque of every thing that is dear to mankind: their fathers, in hopes of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying them, endured every kind of danger and toil in that wilderneſs, where thouſands were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:010402_0017_0F7F750D2E81C6E8"/>
with the ſword, and the reſt worn out with hardſhips are gone to ſleep; that if their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhould now be deprived of thoſe privileges, poſterity will be cautious how they encounter dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to aggrandize the Britiſh nation.—Unhappy coloniſts! deſtined to misfortunes at all events: if they are not vigorous and ſucceſsful, they muſt periſh by famine or the ſword; if they are ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful and proſperous, they muſt be taxed beyond the utmoſt farthing, by men in a diſtant part of the world. It may be replied, that the colonies did not all obtain by charter the excluſive privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of taxing themſelves: but they ſay, it would not follow that the parliament of Great-Britain had a right to tax them; on the contrary, though their charters did not ſecure this privilege to them, it would be improper for the parliament to take that advantage. The matter ſhould only be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by the laws and ſpirit of the Britiſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. — Their charters were granted by Kings, and it is univerſally known, that a Britiſh King may not, that he cannot deprive his ſubjects of their liberties. We have certain conſtitutional <hi>Magna Charta</hi> privileges ſo inviolable and ſacred, that every endeavour of the ſovereign to diminiſh them would be void and null. Britons are taught to believe ſo on this ſide the Atlantic; they would be miſerable if this truth ſhould be called in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Why ſhould <hi>Britiſh Americans</hi> have dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſenſations and judgment?</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:010402_0018_0F7F750DF17D9610"/>Caelum non animum mutant, qui trans mare currunt.</q>
            <p>Doubtleſs, any attempts appearing from any American charter to deprive the ſubject of conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutional privileges, will ever be deemed unjuſt by a Britiſh parliament: perhaps no ſuch attempts have been made. I am not perfectly acquainted with all the charters; but it was proper to mention the circumſtance, as ſome of theſe charters were grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a family that was apt to deſpiſe the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of the ſubject. I believe that a Britiſh King may diſpenſe with ſome obligations in the ſubjects, but cannot enjoin any that are repugnant to our <hi>Magna Charta</hi>—however that be, the coloniſts ſay, they deſire no diſpenſations, nor any liberties greater than their fellow ſubjects in Great Britain, to be taxed by their own repreſentatives, <hi>and only by them,</hi> a privilege which nature, or rather God and nature has granted them, though they had no Charter; that depriving them of this privilege would be a cruel precedent; and by the way, it may have troubleſome conſequences. To eluci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date this matter, let us ſuppoſe it a ſettled rule, that the Britiſh parliament is ever to tax our Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican plantations, let us carry this rule forward a few years, and ſee how it muſt apply.</p>
            <p>At preſent the Britiſh ſubjects in North America, are at leaſt two millions. It is evident from ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate calculations, that they double their number
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:010402_0019_0F7F750EA6EE9550"/>
once every eighteen years,<note n="*" place="bottom">The writer ſaw theſe Calculations in the Hand of a very accurate Gentleman in Rhode Iſland, they included the four New England Governments, where there are the ſmalleſt addition of Foreigners though People increaſe rather faſter than thoſe in the moſt Southern Provinces, where the Inhabitants are more luxurious, leſs healthful and have not ſuch popular forms of Government.</note> without including the additions they receive from other counties. Let us ſuppoſe them only to double in twenty years, then in ſo ſhort a time as forty years they muſt be eight millions, and twenty years more, perhaps twenty five years will make them ſixteen millions. The inhabitants of Great Britain are hardly ſeven millions, and we don't increaſe, except that our commerce with North America has lately encreaſed our numbers. Now I ſhould be pleaſed to hear by what face of juſtice the ſmaller part of the Britiſh empire ſhall tax the greater; how the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives of ſeven millions ſhall undertake to tax ſixteen millions, whom they do not repreſent. The very attempt muſt produce ſuch events as no good ſubject can anticipate without horror. It is dangerous now to eſtabliſh a law which muſt ſoon be changed out of prudence, elſe it will in a little time, fall by its own weight, and perhaps involve the Britiſh empire in its ruin. Two Millions of men, are not to be convinced, they may be forced, but it may prove hard either to force or convince even thrice that number. Some difficulties there are which grow eaſy by cuſtom, and ſome appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent injuries which time obliterates, but the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries received by ſubjects in general, or by ſubject
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:010402_0020_0F7F7510F6297698"/>
depending ſtates from their ſuperiors, are not of this nature, like an unwieldy Burthen they grow more irkſome the longer they are ſupported or like a barbed arrow, they ſtick deeper and hurt more by continuance. The hiſtory of nations will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us how many provinces and ſubordinate ſtates have been loſt by oppreſſion which they found in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable after they had been long accuſtomed to it. I don't mean to inſinuate that a Britiſh par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament has, or ever will deliberately oppreſs our colonies; but in the mean time it muſt be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that our coloniſts are to comfort themſelves with hope alone, for they have no ſecurity of moderate taxes, while they are not their own taxers. The maxim in Great Britain, that a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ſhould only be taxed by his own repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, is evidently founded on juſtice, for when we are taxed by our repreſentatives, in other words, when we are taxed by ourſelves, we can have no temptation to go beyond what is reaſonable or neceſſary, we know our own wants, and feel our own Burthen, and theſe muſt ever be the rule of taxation; but a Britiſh parliament will hardly be allowed to feel for the Inhabitants of North Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, we are ignorant of their abilities, or the ſmall knowledge we have, is founded on very ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial accounts, often falſe ones. It is not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that ſome future parliaments might lay op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive taxes on the coloniſts imagining that we may eaſe our own burthen by loading them. I
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:010402_0021_0F7F75127B29B4C8"/>
hope to prove this impoſſible, but if it ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, the temptation would be dangerous. The ſubject of our daily Prayer is, or ſhould be, <q>Lead us not into temptation.</q> And the wiſeſt earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prince has taught us, <q>that a bribe blinds the underſtanding:</q> Hence I ſhould be ſorry to ſee any number of His Majeſty's ſubjects tempted to oppreſs their fellow-ſubjects, at the diſtance of 3000 miles.</p>
            <p>Did not the brave inhabitants of this iſland complain with a voice that ſhook the baſis of our government, when they where taxed at the ſole pleaſure of their ſovereign, and can the thing be right in America, which was wrong in Great-Britain? Or can that be right on one ſide the Atlantic which was wrong on the other? The Americans indeed are not taxed by the royal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, but they are taxed by a p—t which they have not choſen, nor have they conſented to be taxed by them; and if they are taxed without and againſt their own conſent, they do not ſee where the difference is, whether that tax be laid by the K— or by the p—t.</p>
            <p>Whether the coloniſts reaſon well or ill upon this ſubject, is not my buſineſs to determine; I have only to mention facts. Their reaſons are at leaſt plauſible, this diſcontent is univerſal, and may continue ſo while the Stamp-Act continues, and conſequently muſt infallibly injure our trade. They will never conſent to enrich us, while they
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:010402_0022_0F7F75132262C7B8"/>
think we oppreſs them; they will never treat us with the reſpect due to a parent, while they think we treat them as ſlaves; nor will they carry on a friendly and profitable trade with us, while they think we treat them as aliens, and load them with chains. For theſe reaſons, I think it is our intereſt to repeal the Stamp-Act, rather that grieve ſo many good ſubjects, and cut off the ſource of our own wealth. But if any perſon ſhould think the foregoing reaſons are not concluſive, or that the bad effects of this act upon trade will be trifling and preſently forgotten, there is another reaſon, which I hope will appear demonſtrable: though the Americans ſhould be willing, they will not be able to ſupport their trade as formerly with Great-Britain, while the Stamp-Act continues in force. Various are the accounts of how much the act may produce yearly from our Engliſh colonies on the continent of America; perhaps it may bring us 200,000<abbr>l.</abbr> 
               <hi>per annum;</hi> but it does not by any means follow, that Great-Britain ſhall reap the neat profit of 200,000<abbr>l.</abbr> 
               <hi>per annum</hi> more than ſhe formerly gained by her colonies; on the contrary, I apprehend ſhe may be a loſer of pretty near that ſum. To aſcertain this matter, it is proper to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine all the neceſſary conſequences of the Stamp-Act, and we find the weight of the act conſpiring with the diſpoſition of the people to injure our trade. The weight of the tax gives it a ſtroke which the Americans themſelves cannot prevent.
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:010402_0023_0F7F751999462760"/>
It is expreſly provided, that the money to be raiſed by the Stamp-Act, ſhall be all remitted to Great-Britain in Gold or Silver only: now as the ſum to be raiſed yearly is more than all the money now in the colonies; and as it will be difficult for them to find money enough the next year even to pay their taxes; it is impoſſible they ſhould be able, at the ſame time, to ſend over large ſums to our merchants for Engliſh goods.</p>
            <p>The taxes that are paid in this iſland ſoon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to more than the ſum of our current mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, yet we don't feel any inconveniencies in get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting money to pay new Taxes, becauſe the money being paid in the iſland, ſtays here and circulates to-morrow into the hands that paid it to-day, but this Rule does not apply to the coloniſts, for the money to be paid by taxes, is to be ſent out of their country never to return, and the balance of trade being always in our Favour, they are obliged to ſend us caſh even on that account; a precarious trade with the Spaniards being their principal ſource of money, and that not ſufficient, even when our cutters are removed, to pay their debts with our merchants for Britiſh manufactures, much leſs to pay both for our ſtamps and manufactures. But as the ſtamps <hi>muſt</hi> be paid for, our manufactures muſt fail of courſe, ſince they <hi>cannot</hi> be paid for. This Misfortune ſeems greater, as it is perhaps the only accident that could have prevented our trade with the coloniſts from continuing and encreaſing
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:010402_0024_0F7F751B51526320"/>
for many ages. The colonies produce all the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries of life, and would produce all its luxuries with a little care, the inhabitants have hitherto neglected all ſorts of manufacture, turning their chief Attention to huſbandry. Thus, with wheat, rice, indigo, tobacco, hemp, timber, &amp;c. they paid moſt of their debts. While they conſumed our manufactures, their way of living was perfectly ſuited to our intereſt, who live by trade and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures, it was alſo ſuited to their convenience, hence they would have continued in this tract, for as they are accuſtomed to Huſbandry, and from our New acquiſitions may ſuſtain land enough for that purpoſe, and as huſbandry is the natural em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of all infant countries, nothing but the preſent violent neceſſity, could have turned their attention to manufactures, thus in a few years they would have required more Engliſh Goods than all we make at preſent in this iſland. The dream is pleaſing, but it is like to be more than a dream, for the Stamp-act with the addition of a few Cutters, have done more in one year to promote American manufactures, than the natural progreſs of arts with all the additional arguments of frugality would have produced in an hundred years; not that our coloniſts have already felt the iron hand of neceſſity, but they ſee a Stamp-Act coming from a quarter whence they thought it could not come, perhaps another act may come cloſe at its heels, at this rate it is time for them to <hi>make</hi> thoſe articles
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:010402_0025_0F7F751B83569570"/>
that they ſhall never be able to <hi>purchaſe.</hi> This, at leaſt, Sir, is more than Theory, whoever takes the trouble of enquiring, will find that our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions from North America the laſt year have been almoſt a million ſhort of what they uſually have been; another year muſt deduct another mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, unleſs the act be repealed; but ſuppoſe the act ſhould continue, let us ſee what we ſhall get in return for this damage of trade, not to mention the univerſal uneaſineſs we continue to give to our fellow ſubjects.</p>
            <p>The balance of trade, as was already obſerved, between us and our American colonies (excluding our conqueſts) is computed to be more than half a milion <hi>per ann.</hi> in our favour; by this means a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone we us'd to get <hi>all the money</hi> that our coloniſts had, and if they ſhould ever get more money, we were ſure to get that alſo; for proof of this I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to facts. The Americans always ow'd our merchants greater ſums than all the current money in their country would pay; and tho', during the late war, ſeveral millions were ſent thither to pay the expences of our troops, the coloniſts did not retain that money, for as money increaſed their commiſſions increaſed, ſo that towards the end of the war they conſumed eight or nine hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds worth of Engliſh goods more than at the beginning, and at the peace they were three times as much in our debt as they had been ten years before that, nor had they money enough
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:010402_0026_0F7F751C2A8B0D60"/>
then to pay the third part of that debt. As it is evident that the profits of our trade alone muſt have continued to bring us <hi>all the money</hi> our co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loniſts ſhould ever poſſeſs, I don't ſee how the Stamp Act can poſſibly bring us <hi>more,</hi> ſince the Americans are not able to coin money as our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands increaſe, nor are they like a certain tree which is ſaid to grow ſtronger by heavy burthens; the conſequence is plain, the more we receive for ſtamps, the leſs we ſhall receive for other manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures. Let us now examine whether it be more profitable for Great Britain to receive two hundred and even three hundred thouſand pounds annually by way of tax, or to receive it as the neat profit of trade with a diſtant country. I conceive the latter is moſt profitable, and this follows <hi>a fortiori</hi> if the riches of a nation conſiſt in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry and number of its inhabitants; for the caſe trade ſuppoſes that we obtain as much caſh with the addition of induſtry and numbers. When Great Britain gains 300,000<hi>
                  <abbr>l.</abbr> per ann.</hi> by her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures, it muſt be allowed that ſhe ſells to the amount of 1,500,000<note n="*" place="bottom">We compute that the trade and manufactures of Great Britain have added at leaſt two millions to the number of its inhabitants, then ſuppoſing that only 200,000 people are maintained by manufactu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, vending, &amp;c. goods to the amount of 1,500 000<abbr>l.</abbr> it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that where two millions of additional ſubjects are maintained, the exports of manufactures, &amp;c. ſhould be fifteen millions, which we ſuppoſe is much above the truth. Hence it follows that we muſt loſe more than two hundred thouſand ſubjects by the loſs of trade, which annually brings us 300,000<abbr>l.</abbr> 
                  <hi>per Ann.</hi> eſpecially if that ſum be gained by manufactures.</note>. How many people may

By comparing the increaſe of our nation with that of our manufactures, I ſuppoſe it may employ two hundred thouſand people at leaſt.

                        <p>Repeal the Stamp-act, and we ſhall alſo receive 300,000<abbr>l.</abbr> per ann. not all in our treaſury, but in the hands of the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and induſtrious peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in this iſland, and we ſhall ſave two hundred thouſand of our beſt ſubjects from inevitable perdition.</p>

            <p>To the above account may be added, what all the ſubjects we ſave by the encouragement of trade muſt pay in this Iſland, and the Loſs of them would make a conſiderable deduction from the annual ſum paid to the government. But the loſs of ſubjects we ſhall ſuſtain by this act is not to be confined to Great Britain; our colonies muſt ſuffer alſo; they have hitherto received great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions from Germany and other kingdoms; Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania

alone is ſaid to contain thirty thouſand Germans, who are, without exception, the moſt frugal, temperate, and induſtrious people in North America; they fled thither from oppreſſion, in hopes of becoming freemen, and having ſome hand in legiſlature, and the diſpoſal of their own eſtates; but ſtrangers may think the times are now changed, and may incline to ſtay at home and be tax'd by their own princes, inſtead of going to America to be tax'd by a diſtant Parliament. Nor is this the only loſs our colonies may ſuſtain; the diligence and induſtry of the preſent inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants are alſo in danger of failing, in conſequence of the Stamp-Act, for while nothing tends to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the happineſs, induſtry, wealth and numbers of any people ſo much as perfect freedom, nothing produces the contrary effects ſo much as giving them reaſon to think they have loſt their freedom, and that all their poſſeſſions depend on a precarious footing.</p>
            <p>Altho' ſome of our fellow-ſubjects have treated the Americans with great freedom and contempt, yet it ſhould be remembered that Britain owes her preſent importance and power to them alone; witneſs the vaſt cities along the coaſt of England and Scotland, which are ſprung from contemptible villages only by the American trade, and ſhould that trade unfortunately be ruined, they muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their former contemptible ſtate, and this may be the conſequence of a Stamp Act, inſtead

of that additional treaſure which was at firſt expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>As dark ſcenes are always diſagreable, I ſhould not deſire you to anticipate the light in which Great Britain may appear fifty years hence, if our trade with the colonies ſhould not even continue to increaſe inſtead of decreaſing; but I would juſt obſerve that we have at this inſtant no other trade in the world that can be depended on; the French have rivalled and underſold us in every port of Europe; the kingdom of Portugal, the laſt and beſt market where we could trade to advantage, is juſt now giving us preſages of what we may ſoon expect from that quarter; we may complain of theſe misfortunes, though perhaps it may not be in our power to prevent them. But the loſs of our American trade may be prevented, and by this trade alone, if properly encouraged, Great Britain may continue the miſtreſs of the world, but if that ſhould accidentally be injured, or cut off, by our preſent adminiſtration, Great Britain muſt receive a wound that can never be healed.</p>
            <p>In fine, Sir, I have endeavoured to prove that our Engliſh ſubjects on the continent of America are very little in our debt.—That if the debt were much greater, we ſhould recover no part of it by the late Stamp Act, on the contrary,—That we ſhall loſe, inſtead of gaining by that tax, becauſe the coloniſts being univerſally diſcontent, not without ſome appearance of reaſon, will no longer

conſume our manufactures, and even though they were deſirous of conſuming them as formerly, they cannot poſſibly pay for them under ſo heavy a tax, but whatever ſums we receive in the way of tax, we ſhall loſe at leaſt as much in the way of trade, and with this immenſe loſs of trade we ſhall ſuſtain a ſimilar loſs of our beſt ſubjects. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Repealing the Stamp-Act</hi> is the moſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble way of ſecuring the ſtrength, increaſe and riches of Great Britain and America. If I have ſucceeded in this proof a longer letter is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, if otherwiſe it would be improper.</p>
