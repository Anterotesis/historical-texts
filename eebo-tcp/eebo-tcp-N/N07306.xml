            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <bibl>
                     <hi>DANIEL IV.35.</hi>
                  </bibl>
                  <p>—And He doth according to His Will in the Army of Heaven, and among the Inhabitants of the Earth.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE Doctrine of univerſal Providence is believed and acknowledged by all (I ſuppoſe) who confeſs God to be the Creator of the World; and with very good Reaſon; for if he made it, it was doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs for ſome wiſe Deſigns; and therefore it is neceſſary that he ſhould govern it, that his Deſign in it may be accompliſhed.</p>
            <p>The ſacred Scriptures do every where inſtruct us to give God the Glory of his preſerving and governing Providence, as well as his creating Power.</p>
            <p>He that commanded the World into Being, has cauſed it to continue unto this Day. And as all Things are preſerved by him; ſo he rules and governs them according to his Will. This Doctrine of the univerſal Dominion and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God is here laid down—<hi>He doth according to his Will, in the Army of Heaven,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:009331_0004_1030EBF84BAC0D68"/>
and among the Inhabitants of the Earth</hi>—a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject well worthy of our Contemplation; and not unſeaſonable at this Time.</p>
            <p>The ſurprizing Turns of Providence, and the marvellous Things God has wrought for his People in the Courſe of the late War, which is now bro't to ſo happy and honourable a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, ſo intereſting to us in this Land in particular, and which may with Propriety be commemorated on this Day and Occaſion, have determined my Thoughts to this Subject. For <hi>he hath made his wonderful Works to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered. He has ſhewed his People the Power of his Works, that he might give them the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage of the Heathen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Very apparently is the Government and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God ſeen in the Affairs of War; And not only is Succeſs and Victory in Battle, but the bringing of a troubleſome War to a comfortable and advantageous Iſſue, the Reſult of Providence, which Duty and Gratitude to the ſupreme Ruler of the World requires us to take Notice of, with Wonder and Thankfulneſs. <hi>He maketh Wars to ceaſe to the End of the Earth,</hi> puts an End to the Wars of the Nations, which had turned the Earth into a Stage of bloody Confuſion, and crowns them with Peace. And this he does <hi>that he may be exalted in the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This great Truth is confirmed to us not only <hi>by rational Deductions</hi> (as may he ſhewn here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after) but alſo by <hi>many Paſſages</hi> of the <hi>ſacred Scriptures,</hi> and particularly by the Words be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:009331_0005_1030EBFBD73AE258"/>
us. They were uttered by <hi>King Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar,</hi> one of the moſt <hi>proud</hi> and <hi>abſolute Monarchs</hi> of the World. The God of Heaven had given him a <hi>Kingdom,</hi> or <hi>Empire,</hi> abounding in <hi>Wealth</hi> and <hi>Worldly Glories</hi>; and being fixed at the Top of worldly Honors and Greatneſs, he would alſo be <hi>abſolute and uncontroulable in his Matters, and forgets that there is one above him.</hi> But God would have <hi>the living to know that the Moſt High ruleth in the Kingdom of Men, and giveth it to whomſoever he will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Babylon</hi> and his Flatterers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited that he was <hi>God in Earth, independent, and unaccountable to any.</hi> Tho' he might have ſome Notion of <hi>a ſupreme God,</hi> yet he might alſo think, as ſome of the <hi>Heathen</hi> pretend to believe, that his Government was confined to Heaven: But the great God will have all Men to know that <hi>he rules on Earth too</hi>; that <hi>he ſets up, and debaſes whom he pleaſes.</hi> And at laſt the <hi>ambitious King</hi> is bro't to acknowledge this to the Glory of God. For becauſe he had lived a <hi>brutiſh ſenſual Life,</hi> and becauſe he was in Heart lifted up above the <hi>common Race of Mankind</hi>; therefore he was driven from his magnificent <hi>Palace,</hi> and all <hi>Converſe and Society with Men, to herd with Beaſts, and graze with Oxen.</hi> By this ſtrange Turn of Providence, God would teach him this <hi>Leſſon,</hi> That he is the Giver of all Things; that even Princes are accountable to him; that their <hi>Tenure</hi> is at his Will alone; and that he can alter and alienate the Property of all Enjoyments, <hi>being himſelf the abſolute Lord of all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:009331_0006_1030EC0042F917D8"/>This in Concluſion is freely acknowledged. He who, at laſt, thought himſelf Supreme on Earth, <hi>bleſſed the Moſt High, and praiſed and honoured him that liveth for ever and ever, whoſe Dominion is an everlaſting Dominion, and his Kingdom from Generation to Generation. And all the Inhabitants of the Earth are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted as nothing: And he doth according to his Will in the Army of Heaven, and among the Inhabitants of the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Text then teaches us, <hi>That the glorious God exerciſes an actual Providence over all Things, according to his good Pleaſure.</hi>—He is a great and a univerſal King; His <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Government over all Creatures</hi> is <hi>certain</hi> and <hi>unlimitted</hi>: His <hi>Right of Dominion</hi> cannot be diſputed; and he <hi>actually</hi> governs and influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces all Creatures as ſeemeth him good. He is the <hi>great Lord</hi> and <hi>Inſpector</hi> of the Univerſe; and that not as an idle and unconcerned <hi>Spec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator</hi> of the <hi>Deſigns, Behaviour</hi> and <hi>Actions</hi> of created Beings; but he continually watches over them as their <hi>King, Poſſeſſor</hi> and <hi>Ruler,</hi> to lead and determine them to <hi>ſuch Intentions and Ends</hi> as ſhall tend moſt to his Glory.— His Providential Care and Regard is exerciſed towards all; ſo that the End by him deſigned and appointed, ſhall infallibly be attained.— He doth <hi>according to his Will, every where, among all Creatures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is no earthly Potentate that has ſo <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, abſolutely</hi> and <hi>intirely</hi> the Dominion over, or Diſpoſal of any particular People, or Perſon,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:009331_0007_1030EC01D7040B48"/>
as God has over all <hi>Perſons</hi> and <hi>Things. For his is the Greatneſs, and the Power, and the Glory, and the Victory, and the Majeſty: For all that is in the Heaven, and in the Earth is his; and his is the Kingdom, who is exalted as Head above all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That this important Truth may be ſet in a juſt Light, We ſhall endeavour
<list>
                  <item>In the <hi>firſt Place,</hi> To ſhew what is implied in the Notion of a Providence, or what is intended when God is ſaid to exerciſe a Providence over his Creatures.</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> To conſider the great and univerſal Extent of his Providential Care and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards. And,</item>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I am to conſider what is implied in the Notion of a Providence.—</p>
            <p>God's exerciſing a Providence over his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>principally</hi> intends and implies in it theſe <hi>two Things</hi>: His <hi>ſuſtaining and upholding Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, whereby the Creatures ſubſiſt, and are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in actual Being</hi>; and his <hi>governing and diſpoſing of all Things according to his Will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is the <hi>latter of theſe</hi> that my Text more eſpecially leads to the Conſideration of.</p>
            <p>God exerciſes his <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Creatures, whereby they are <hi>ſupported</hi> and <hi>continued</hi> in their <hi>ſeveral diſtinct Orders.</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:009331_0008_1030EC036731F368"/>
He does in his Providence continually preſerve the Creation, and keep the ſeveral Parts of it <hi>in that Order of Being</hi> which he at firſt deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to keep them in. All Creatures, of what <hi>Kind</hi> or <hi>Nature</hi> ſoever, are upheld in Being by a divine Power. They all live upon God, who is the Fountain of Life to all his Creatures; and therefore frequently ſtyled, <hi>The living God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But he not only ſuſtains and keeps his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in their Beings; but he always <hi>determines</hi> and <hi>orders</hi> them juſt as he pleaſes. He has an <hi>actual Influence</hi> over his Creatures, and <hi>governs</hi> them, and <hi>diſpoſes</hi> of them <hi>as ſeemeth good in his Sight.</hi> He does, as it were, <hi>hold them all in his Hand;</hi> and they are more at his abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Pleaſure and Diſpoſal, than the meaneſt Worm is at ours. He is a moſt ſoverein Lord, and <hi>may,</hi> and <hi>actually does work all Things af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Council of his own Will</hi>: For he has made all Things for himſelf, and <hi>for his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure they are and were created.</hi> The <hi>Potter</hi> has not more the <hi>Power over the Clay,</hi> than God has over his Creatures—</p>
            <p>It is not only true that ſovereign <hi>Dominion</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> belongs to God; but it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that he exerciſes ſuch a Power. His Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are intirely at his <hi>Will</hi>; tho' it be many Ti<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

And let the reaſonable, but ſinful Creature, uſe all his <hi>Policy</hi> and <hi>Strength,</hi> after all, <hi>the Counſel of the Lord that ſhall ſtand.</hi>—He gives <hi>Liberty</hi> or <hi>Reſtraints, permits</hi> or <hi>with-holds</hi> as he ſees meet.

There is no <hi>Event of Providence</hi> but what is according to his <hi>Sufferance</hi> or <hi>actual Diſpoſal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſovereign and all wiſe Providence of God <hi>ſteers, directs</hi> and <hi>marriages</hi> all <hi>Creatures</hi> and <hi>Things.</hi> As the whole Creation was made <hi>by Him</hi> and <hi>for Him,</hi> he will take Care and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully diſpoſe of all Things, ſo that the Honor of his <hi>holy Name</hi> ſhall in the End be vindicated and magnified. For this End he ſuperintends his <hi>Creatures, their Actions</hi> and <hi>Concerns</hi>: and if he pleaſes, he will reſtrain, or even invert the natural Order of Things. He will <hi>make the Wiſdom of the Wiſe Fooliſhneſs.

            <p>Thus we ſee what is intended by the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God: It is that Influence and Power of his, whereby he not only preſerves and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains his Creatures, but governs, reſtrains and orders them as he pleaſes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:009331_0010_1030EC0DA506CE38"/>It may be added here, without the Formality of a diſtinct Head, The Rule according to which he thus watches over, protects and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of his Creatures, is his own Will "which is always directed by infinite Wiſdom, and is the Rule of Goodneſs." <hi>He doth according to his Will</hi>—Nothing beſides is or can be a Rule to him for the Government of the World. His ſovereign Will is the alone Law by which all Creatures ſhall be ordered, determined and diſpoſed. Becauſe he is Lord of all, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is Supreme and Independent, therefore he is not accountable to any for any of his Matters. He may do whatever he pleaſes, <hi>in Heaven, in the Earth, and all deep Places, and none can ſtay his Hand, or may ſay, Wherefore haſt Thou done thus?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There can be nothing binding to God, nor any Thing that can influence him in any of his Operations out of himſelf, and beyond his own Will. His Wiſdom, Juſtice and Holineſs alone muſt determine what is holy, juſt and good, and ſo what is fit to be done in his Kingdom of Providence.</p>
            <p>We may now paſs on, and conſider in the <hi>ſecond Place,</hi> The great and univerſal Extent of God's Providential Care and Influence. <hi>He doth according to his Will, in the Army of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and among the Inhabitants of the Earth</hi>— He is the ſole univerſal Monarch of the World. He is the great Lord and Governor of all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and Things, <hi>whether they be in Heaven, or on the Earth, viſible or inviſible.</hi> As all owe
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:009331_0011_1030EC0F353EA938"/>
their Exiſtence to him; ſo they are all, without Exception, under his reſtraining, preſerving and directing Power and Providence. He has <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared his Throne in the Heavens:</hi> but <hi>his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ruleth over all.</hi> Tho' he manifeſts much more of his Glory and Excellency there; yet his Dominion is by no Means confined thereto, but it reaches to the utmoſt Bounds of the Creation. All Worlds and Creatures are abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely his: And were there as many more, they would be equally and rightfully under his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and actual Government.</p>
            <p>This might be more fully and clearly evinced by conſidering the ſeveral Ranks of Creatures, and Orders of Beings; all which are under the Providential Care and Power of God, and in his Word expreſly ſaid to be ſo—</p>
            <p>Particularly,</p>
            <p>Good Angels are under the divine Providence and Government. They are the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and perfect Creatures; and yet are ſo far from being exempted from his Dominion, that none are more at his Will and Command than they. God exerciſed a ſpecial Act of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence towards them, when he made them in their primitive Rectitude and Felicity. And after a ſufficient Trial of their Obedience, did for the Praiſe of his glorious Grace, confirm them in a State of moſt perfect Bleſſedneſs for ever. This was an Act of ſovereign Dominion and Providence in God; for they as Creatures are mutable and liable to fall from him, and to forfeit his Favour, as others who actually did apoſtatize.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:009331_0012_1030EC10CC4C54A8"/>And now they are intirely devoted to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Will and Pleaſure. They are readily, chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and conſtantly obedient to the Will of God. It is their Delight, and they account it, as indeed it is, their Glory and Honor to adore and worſhip God, and execute his Will. And God makes uſe of them as the Miniſters of his Providence, and the Executioners of his Will in this lower World.— Again,</p>
            <p>The evil Angels are under the powerful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains of divine Providence. Tho' they are apoſtatized from God, and cannot willingly yield themſelves up to his good Pleaſure, yet they are his and he will do with them whatſoever he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, notwithſtanding their high Oppoſition againſt him, and continual Endeavours to free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and others from any Subjection to his Authority and Will. When they had loſt their original Integrity, and ſhewn themſelves impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Enemies to God, his Glory and Dignity, he caſt them out of Heaven, the Seat of the Bleſſed, and plunged them into the Pit of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and Miſery. And tho' they have now an irreconcilable Enmity in their Natures againſt God, his Laws and Government; yet they can effect nothing againſt Him. He curbs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains them as he pleaſes. He holds them as in Chains, and they can go no further than the Limits by him preſcribed. He is able, and does, as he pleaſes, pull down their ſtrongeſt Holds. He binds the ſtrong Man armed, and caſts him out; deſtroys his uſurped, unlawful Power over the Souls of Men. The Son of
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:009331_0013_1030EC19EADF20D0"/>
God when on Earth ſhewed ſuch a divine Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in ejecting him from poſſeſſed Bodies; in not ſuffering him to ſpeak, and in extorting from him a Confeſſion that he was the Son of God.</p>
            <p>Tho' evil Spirits are potent, politick, and nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, yet they can't controul divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the Deſigns of it. They cannot ſtay an Omnipotent Hand. They are ſecurely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in everlaſting Chains under Darkneſs to the Judgment of the great Day. The Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Power of God watches over, and holds them in Horror and Miſery. They are as condemned Malefactors, bound over to the laſt Judgment, when final Vengeance ſhall come upon them. And even now their evil De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and miſchievous Deſigns are reſtrained by a ſuperior Power.</p>
            <p>Furthermore,</p>
            <p>God exerciſes his abſolute Dominion and ſovereign Providence over Men on Earth. The Affairs of the World in general are ordered and determined by Him. His is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and he is the Governor among the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. His Eyes are in every Place, and he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves all Things with the moſt perfect, exact and critical View. And he has an actual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence in all human Affairs and Concerns.</p>
            <p>Particular Nations and Kingdoms are under his Care and providential Rule, and the Civil, Military and Secular, as well as religious and ſpiritual Intereſts of a People are either oppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and loſt, or eſtabliſhed and promoted accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Permiſſion and Will.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:009331_0014_1030EC1B79D684C0"/>He puts the Adminiſtration of Government into what Hands he pleaſes; for all the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Powers that be are ordained of God, or at leaſt ſuffered by him. <hi>Promotion cometh neither from the Eaſt, nor from the Weſt, nor from the South, but God is the Judge, he put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth down one, and ſetteth up another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Kingdoms and Dominions of the World are his, and he giveth them to whom he will. All humane Power is derived from him, whoſe Power and Authority is univerſal, infinite and adorable. The greateſt Potentates of the Earth, who have been ready to imagine themſelves ſovereign and independent, are nevertheleſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his powerful Influence, and are by him made to ſubſerve his Intereſt and Glory, when their very Deſign was to contradict and oppoſe it. That proud and potent King of <hi>Babylon, whoſe Greatneſs reached unto Heaven, and his Dominion to the End of the Earth; all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons trembled before Him; whom he would he ſlew, and whom he would he kept alive;</hi> yet even he, this Child of Pride, is made to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs one higher than himſelf, and to bow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him.</p>
            <p>And this is what every one ſhall finally be made to do. For, the moſt High actually rules in the Kingdoms of this World, and determines the Concerns of particular States and People, according to his own Will and Wiſdom. <hi>He ſtands in the Congregation of the Mighty, and judges among the Gods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:009331_0015_1030EC1D119F0C20"/>Suffer me particularly to obſerve here, that whatever the Circumſtances of a Perſon of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are, they are put into ſuch Circumſtances either in the Courſe of God's common Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or by ſome unuſual Events. For God has the ordering and government both of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and accidental Cauſes and Events.</p>
            <p>Hardly any Thing happens to Men, in the ordinary Courſe of their Lives, but what, if heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully attended to, may teach them that there is a wiſe, juſt and good Providence, which directs and manages thoſe natural Things, which are the immediate Cauſes of their Proſperity, or of their Sorrow and Diſtreſs.</p>
            <p>God does in ſome Meaſure govern the Moral, by the World of Nature. He rewards or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes Men by a wholeſome or peſtilential Air; by fruitful or barren Seaſons. He hinders or promotes their Deſigns by Wind and Weather; by a backward or forward Spring. He makes Nature give Laws to Men, and ſet Bounds to their Paſſions and Intrigues. How often does he by natural Cauſes, overthrow powerful Fleets and Armies, defeat the wiſeſt Counſels, arbitrate the Differences of Princes, and decide the Fate of Kingdoms! Now if God thus go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns Men by Nature, he muſt govern Nature too. For neceſſary cannot be ſuited to the Deſigns and Endeavours of free Agents, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Influence of a wiſe Providence.</p>
            <p>God alſo has the Government of accidental Cauſes and Events. The outward Peace and Comfort, or Miſery of Men, of Families, and
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:009331_0016_1030EC244AE346F8"/>
ſometimes of whole Kingdoms, depends upon ſomething accidental. So that if God did not rule ſuch Things, ſome of the greateſt and moſt remarkable Changes in the World, would be excepted from his Care and Providence.</p>
            <p>Men lay their Schemes as well as they can, and Providence ſeems to favour them too; but by ſome ſecret Cauſe, their Devices are all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed, and their Counſels carried headlong—</p>
            <p>On the other Hand, the moſt unlikely Means ſhall ſometimes attain the End. A People ſhall be raiſed to worldly Glories by a ſurprizing Courſe of Events, as accidental as they are proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous. Does not ſome wonderful Turn of Providence ſometimes highly favour Men, even contrary to all human Probability?</p>
            <p>Again, Some caſual Occurrences fruſtrate the moſt proper Means, and give an unexpected Turn to the Intereſts of Men. What ſhould conquer in a Race, but Swiftneſs? What ſhould win the Battle, but Strength, and Valor, and Marſhal Skill? What ſhould ſupply Men's wants, and get Riches, but Underſtanding and Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in human Affairs? What more likely Way to gain the Favour of others, than a ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Addreſs? Yet the wiſe Man obſerved in his Days, and the Obſervation holds good ſtill, that it is not always thus; <hi>Time and Chance hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth to all</hi>—Some favourable Juncture, and unſeen Accidents are more effectual than all human Strength, Art or Diſcretion.</p>
            <p>Now, however fortuitouſly Things may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, they are brought to paſs by a divine Effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency; and there is ſome wiſe Deſign in them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:009331_0017_1030EC2800005208"/>Many Things befall us which we never looked for, and could not foreſee. Theſe are what we call Contingencies, or Accidents. But with Reſpect to God, there can be no ſuch Thing as Chance. For as he foreknows thoſe Events, which to us are moſt uncertain and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing; ſo he actually governs them.</p>
            <p>But I may not enlarge.</p>
            <p>The various Succeſſions of Peace and War, War and Peace are from Him. The Deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of War, and the Bleſſings of Peace are ordered by Him. War is the Sword of the Lord, which he draws and ſheaths again at his Pleaſure. When he ſees fit he diſturbs the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of the Nations, and calls oppoſing Armies into the Field of Battle, where claſhing Swords, and Garments rolled in Blood, open a moſt diſtreſſing and melancholly Scene.—And then, when the War has accompliſhed that for which it was ſent, he compoſes the Belligerent Powers to Peace,
<q>calls off the Nations from oppoſing and deſtroying one another, and diſbands the moſt furious Armies.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It muſt indeed be allowed that War origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates in the Luſts of Men, and Princes; and that their Pride, Envy, Covetouſneſs, Affectation of undue Dominion, &amp;c. are the ſecondary Cauſes of its Riſe; and all the Horrors that attend it.—Nevertheleſs there is an over-ruling Hand of Providence, diſpoſing and ordering the exact Time of its Beginning, Continuance, and Concluſion—as well as the great and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Events of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:009331_0018_1030EC2B22025450"/>Moreover,</p>
            <p>God in his Providence cares, provides for, and governs particular Perſons. Tho' the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal World be under his conſtant Inſpection, yet no particular Soul is neglected by him. He has as much Reſpect to every individual Perſon, as to the greateſt Man upon Earth, or the World in general. So unſearchable is the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, and ſo unlimited his Power, as that he can and actually does know the State of every Man, and rules and governs him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.—</p>
            <p>All Men, both Good and Bad, are particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly reſpected by him, and either ſucceeded or blaſted in their Enterprizes, according to his Will. Yea,</p>
            <p>He has an Influence into the particular Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of particular Perſons. Every good Action is performed by his efficacious Power, and the immediate Aſſiſtance of his Grace.</p>
            <p>And even evil Actions are done by his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Permiſſion. He ſuffers them to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and yet, by his Providence, ſo directs and over-rules them, as that they will in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion make for his own Glory.</p>
            <p>In a Word,</p>
            <p>The Providence of God extends itſelf to the meane<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> and moſt inconſiderable Creatures. They are not without the Limits of divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence and Care. Yea, the very Hairs of our Head are all numbred by him. Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence reaches to the moſt minute Things, and influences the moſt invaluable Beings in the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:009331_0019_1030EC2CD9414560"/>
World. In ſhort, it reaches to the utmoſt Bounds of the Creation, and extends to all Things.</p>
            <p>We haſten now in the third and laſt Place, to conſider what reaſonable Grounds we have to conclude, that God does actually exerciſe ſuch a Providence.</p>
            <p>It is certain we have ſufficient Grounds of Aſſurance to found our Belief upon, even from the frequent and expreſs Teſtimony of the Word of God. He is there ſaid to be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite and an all-comprehending Being. All Power, and Might and Dominion is aſcribed to him. <hi>His Name is excellent in all the Earth; his Glory is above the Heavens. Of him, and thro' him, and to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are all Things.</hi> He is the great and mighty God. The Lord of Hoſts is his Name. Great in Counſel, and mighty in working. The God of the Spirits of all Fleſh, and nothing is too hard for him. <hi>He forms the Light, and he creates Darkneſs: he makes Peace, and creates Evil; the Lord does all theſe Things. To whom can we liken him, for he is God: his Counſel ſhall ſtand, and he will do all his Pleaſure. He alone is God, and there is none with him. He kills and he makes alive; he wounds and he heals<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neither is there any that can deliver out of his Hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It were eaſy, but it is needleſs to multiply Texts of this Nature and Import, wherein the Excellency, and Majeſty, the Greatneſs and Glory, the Sovereignty and Providence of God are aſſerted, and ſet forth, in the beſt Manner that Words of human Eloquence will allow.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:009331_0020_1030EC2E69621208"/>There are further many rational Grounds to believe the all-diſpoſing Providence of God.</p>
            <p>As his eternal Godhead, almighty Power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and infinite Wiſdom, are manifeſted to his rational and intelligent Creatures; ſo they may alſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably infer his active Providence and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually influencing Power over all the Works of his Hands. There is juſt Reaſon to believe that God rules and governs all his Creatures, and all their Actions.</p>
            <p>This may be argued from his creating all Things for himſelf. That God is the Maker of all Things, is as true as that he is God. For except we allow him to be the original Cauſe, the Creator and Former of all Things, we ſhall by Conſequence deny him to be the only ſelf-exiſting, and independent Being. If any Thing could exiſt and act without him, then he is not the all-perfect Being: and ſo not truly God.</p>
            <p>It therefore muſt, and eaſily will be granted, that in the Beginning God made the Heavens and the Earth; and that without him was not any Thing made that was made; that all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Limits of the Creation, from the moſt glorious Angel to the meaneſt Inſect; yea, to the leaſt Atom of Duſt, was commanded into Being by his all-powerful Word.</p>
            <p>And as all Things were made by him, ſo for him. He hath made all Things for himſelf. His own Glory was the principal and laſt End in all his Works of Creation. In whatever God does, his only Rule is his own Will, and his End is the Manifeſtation of his glorious Excellencies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:009331_0021_1030EC38B71ED318"/>Now, ſee if this Conſideration will not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily infer his providential Rule and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over all Things? Can any Man believe God the Creator of all Things, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as every one muſt do, that he made all for himſelf; and yet diſbelieve his actual Power and Providence over all? It cannot certainly be beneath the Majeſty of God to regard and take Care of the meaneſt Creatures, ſince it was not unworthy of him to exert his almighty Power in giving them Being at firſt. And it muſt certainly be inconſiſtent with the Wiſdom of God to create ſuch a Variety of Beings for his own Glory, and then intirely deſert them, and take no Care that the End were actually attained.</p>
            <p>We may be aſſured, that ſince God made all Things for the Diſplay of his glorious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections in them, he will ſo reſtrain, direct and influence them, as that this End ſhall certainly be ſecured.</p>
            <p>If God be the Maker of all Things, and his own Honor was his End therein; then he is the Lord and ſovereign Diſpoſer of all. This is a plain and undeniable Conſequence.</p>
            <p>Nor is it any reaſonable Objection againſt this, that a Multitude of the moſt excellent Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Angels and Men, have fallen from their original State of Perfection, and are now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come unwilling and unable actively to glorify God. For he by his Power can, and in his Providence actually does ſo over-rule them and their Actions, as that the great End ſhall be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. For <hi>God will be glorified in them that
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:009331_0022_1030EC3A9A916C10"/>
periſh, as well as in them that are ſaved</hi>—</p>
            <p>I ſhall only add,</p>
            <p>A divine Providence may be argued from Miracles, or Works above the Power of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Agents. Thoſe Operations and Events which exceed the meer Force and Power of Nature, will neceſſarily infer ſome ſuperior and moſt powerful Being, who interpoſes when he pleaſes, and hinders or inverts the natural Courſe and Tendency of the Creatures.</p>
            <p>That there have been ſuch extraordinary Works or Events, we have all poſſible Reaſon to believe. He that will n<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> give his Aſſent to the Truth of ſuch Facts, becauſe he was never an Eye-witneſs of them, may, as well, and with as much Reaſon, reſolve to believe nothing at all, but what he has had a Perſonal Knowledge of.</p>
            <p>Allowing then that there have been ſuch mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Works as never could have been effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but by a divine Power, We may be aſſured that God exerciſes a ſovereign Power and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence over the World; that he acts his Will and Pleaſure among all Creatures; that he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits them to act, or obſtructs and hinders ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Will. If he did not watch over and govern the World, to what can we impute thoſe wonderful and miraculous Things which we find recorded in the Scriptures of Truth? They were manifeſtly contrary to the known eſtabliſhed Laws of Nature. And it would be unreaſonable to ſuppoſe that they were effected by evil, but powerful Spirits, to put a Cheat up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Mankind.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:009331_0023_1030EC3C30D845C0"/>The manifeſt Deſign of them was to glorify God, and to promote the Holineſs and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of Men. They muſt therefore be wro't by the Finger of God; and they prove his Power and Providence over his Creatures—</p>
            <p>The Truth under Conſideration might be further evidenced from God's frequent reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſubduing the Luſts of Men. Theſe are ſo many Miracles of Grace, and ſo many Evidences of God's adorable Power, and ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Providence. For if ſome Almighty Hand did not continually hold in, and reſtrain the inordinate Luſts of Men and Devils, this World would, before now, have been an Habitation of Cruelty, and a mere Hell of Confuſion and Miſery.</p>
            <p>What we have now heard under this Head, without further inſiſting upon it, may give us a rational Conviction of the Truth we have been conſidering, viz. That God exerciſes a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Providence over all his Creatures, according to his Will.</p>
            <p>And now, from what has been offered, let us in the firſt Place learn to adore the infinite Majeſty and Greatneſs of God.</p>
            <p>How excellent, great, and glorious a Being is he, who thus rules, diſpoſes, and governs all Things! What an exalted Idea does this give us of the divine Majeſty, to think that he is a King, abſolutely Sovereign, univerſal and eternal! Of how glorious and adorable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections muſt that God be; and with how glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious a Majeſty muſt he be cloathed, who can
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:009331_0024_1030EC3FBAB41380"/>
thus inſpect and order the Univerſe as he pleaſes!</p>
            <p>What Authority and Power is he inveſted with, whoſe is the Heavens, and the Earth, and all that therein is, and who has all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures at his ſole Command, and intire Diſpoſal! How great a God is he! How greatly to be feared and had in Reverence!</p>
            <p>He muſt needs be entitled to all Honor and Worſhip, who has a neceſſary and indiſputable Right of Dominion over all. He who is Lord of all, is worthy to receive all Bleſſing and Glory from all Creatures, according to their ſeveral Abilities. It is the obliged Duty of all his reaſonable Creatures to adore him and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify his Name, who is the exalted King and Head over all.</p>
            <p>Earthly Princes and Governors will be reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, honoured and obeyed by thoſe who are lawfully ſubjected to their Authority. And by how much they exceed in Health and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Glories, and in the extent of their Dominions, a proportionably greater Honor will be chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged by them. The Reſpect and Honor which is paid them riſes in Proportion to their outward Magnificence and worldly Greatneſs.</p>
            <p>What Glory, Adoration and Praiſe then is due to God, the univerſal King and Governor, whoſe Authority and Power is moſt juſt and rightful; and who has all Things at his Will and good Pleaſure? We have all poſſible Reaſon to make him the higheſt Object of our Eſteem, Fear and Reverence. Shall not the Excellency of ſo glorious a Being make us afraid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Shall

not a holy Awe and Dread of the almighty King fall upon us? Shall a finite Creature, to whom is given ſome worldly Power, be regarded and reverenced by us; and ſhall not the infinite God, who has all Power and Authority, be much more ſo? It is only for the Sake of that derived Power wherewith Earthly Rulers are inveſted, that we honor and obey them? Does not therefore God, the infinite Original of all Authority, Might and Power, much more chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge our Fear, Adoration and humble Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Should not the Conſideration of that ſovereign Dominion, that boundleſs Power, and all-governing Authority of God, ſtrike us into an holy Fear and Trembling, at the infinite aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and terrible Majeſty that is with him?</p>
            <p>How glorious is God our heavenly King! And how reveren<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ial, humble and obedient ſhould we be to a Being, great and powerful as he is! He juſtly demands, and it is our reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Duty, to pay all Worſhip, Homage and Praiſe to him, who is all in all; who by an underived Authority, and an irreſiſtible Power, over-rules all Creatures for his own Glory.</p>
            <p>That which naturally flows from this Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, is that of the inſpired Pſalmiſt, <hi>O come, let us worſhip, and bow down!</hi> We ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain high and honourable Thoughts of him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and fall low before the high and lofty One—</p>
            <p>But, <hi>Secondly,</hi> Let what has been ſaid excite us to a ſerious Contemplation on God's Works of Providence, and to give him the Glory of his Wiſdom, Power, Goodneſs, and other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:009331_0026_1030EC47F51395E0"/>
that are therein manifeſted. This is one main Buſineſs of our preſent State, as we are underſtanding and thoughtful Creatures. And it is no improbable Opinion that ſome Part of our Employment in Heaven will be to contemplate the Works of God, as well as his eternal Eſſence, and to render him the Praiſe which reſults from both.</p>
            <p>As the Glory of God is viſible in the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the World, ſo he makes known his Wiſdom and Goodneſs, his Power, Juſtice and Mercy in the Government of it. The Word of God (as we have heard) teaches us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that all Creatures are preſerved and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſame almighty Hand which at firſt gave them Being. That he by whom they at firſt exiſted keeps them in their ſeveral Orders, Operations and Motions, and that nothing hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens either in the common Courſe of Nature, or in extraordinary Events without his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Determination. In a Word, that he is ever preſent with all his Creatures, and that even the moſt inconſiderable of them are not excepted out of his Dominion and Government. It is the Duty of reaſonable Creatures to live under a due Senſe of this Providence. Nor is it enough that we retain the general Notion and Belief of it in our Minds, but ſhould take Care to apply it to particular Events. For if God knows and orders every Thing that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to ourſelves and others, to Nations and Kingdoms, it muſt be the Duty of his People to acknowledge him in all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:009331_0027_1030EC4987F26C80"/>We ſhould often meditate, with ſuitable Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, on the glorious Inſtances of his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, his Goodneſs, and his Grace, his unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Wiſdom, and his Truth and Righteouſneſs, which appear in the Adminiſtration of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of rational Beings.</p>
            <p>The Diſperſions of Nations over the Face of the Earth, the Riſe of Empires, and the Fate of Kingdoms, as to outward Circumſtances or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Privileges, are according to the Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, and the Influence of his Power.</p>
            <p>We ſhould particularly reflect with Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude upon the many ſignal Events of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in God's Protection of his own People; his defeating the Deſigns of their Enemies; and the many wonderful Salvations and Favours which he has granted to them.</p>
            <p>Gratitude to God for favourable Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Providence, is ſo rational a Duty, that they who regard nothing but their precious En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, without any ſerious Remembrance of God, are, not only loſt to all Senſe of Religion, but even to the moſt reaſonable Apprehenſions and Affections of human Nature.</p>
            <p>Let us then aſcribe the Glory of all the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations and Deliverences, which the Church and People of God have had Experience of, from Time to Time, to him who doth according to his Will, in the Army of Heaven, and among the Inhabitants of the Earth. It is he that has ſaved and defended them from their Enemies, and diſappointed their Devices againſt them. He is the ſupreme Cauſe and Author of all thoſe
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:009331_0028_1030EC4CABC2F120"/>
glorious Works which are wro't for the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es Salvation.</p>
            <p>Inſtruments are indeed to be honored as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments whom God makes uſe of in ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Church's Enemies; but God is to be acknowledged as the ſole Author of all Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. It is he that raiſes up Inſtruments: it is he that qualifies and ſits them for any Services and it is he that does all by them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to his Name alone is all the Glory due.</p>
            <p>Let our Souls then magnify the Lord, who hath done great Things for his People. Let us lift up his Name on high, and ſacrifice Praiſe to him, who alone doth wondrous Things.</p>
            <p>Let me here adopt ſome of the Expreſſions of another. <note n="*" place="bottom">Rev.

            <p>The Engliſh Nation in particular, has been the Stage of many the moſt remarkable Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations.
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:009331_0029_1030EC55AE7F2708"/>
—By what marvellous Methods of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence was the Reformation from Popery ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed. And how has this glorious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt been ſignally guarded by an amazing Series of ſpecial Interpoſitions to this Day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It hath paſſed thro' many a hazardous Criſis, and been reduced to an expiring Poſture Time after Time: but has received new Life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and been made to flouriſh again by ſome happy Turn of Affairs, ſo ſudden and unaccountable, that the Finger of God hath viſibly appeared, its Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies themſelves being judges.</p>
            <p>And to come to this Land: how very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable have been the Operations of a ſpecial Providence towards this People, from the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning down to this Day!</p>
            <p>The great Actions and Specialties of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in Favor of the People of God here, have been many and aſtoniſhing, and afford Materials for as entertaining and affecting a Story as any Place in the whole World, in the ſame Compaſs of Time, can furniſh out. For whether we reflect on the Beginning and Riſe, or Continuance and Progreſs of theſe Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that were begun upon a religious Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, which you will allow me to ſay is the ſpecial Honor of New-England. We are on all Sides preſented with wonderful Diſplays of the ſaving Power, directing Wiſdom, beneficent Goodneſs, and unfalling Truth of our Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-God.—Let me add<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—</p>
            <p>We have in particular been wonderfully ſaved from our Enemies, when, to all human

Appearance, they might have eaſily, had they been permitted, ſwallowed us up, and made a Prey of us.—</p>
            <p>If we come down to the late War, which very much originated in Diſputes relative to <hi>North-America:</hi> how marvellous and affecting have been the Appearances of Providence for us.</p>
            <p>At the opening of it, when thro' the Perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſs of our Enemies, we were obliged in our own Defence, to have Recourſe to Arms, they had almoſt ſurrounded us by Land, with a Line of Forts; had ſome of the beſt Troops in <hi>France</hi> ſent to their Aſſiſtance, and had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged vaſt Numbers of the native Savages in their Intereſts; and were big with Hopes of driving us from the Inheritance derived to us from our Fathers, and obtained thro' a World of Peril<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Toil and Hardſhip<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and at the Expence of much Blood and Treaſure.—But <hi>bleſſed be God who hath not given us a Prey to their Teeth: our Soul is eſcaped as a Bird out of the Snare of the Fowlers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Snare is broken, and we are eſcaped.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Several Times<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at firſt, our military Affairs were under a Cloud, and preſented us with gloomy Proſpects. But at length they took another Turn, and became proſperous, even beyond our Expectation, and moſt ſanguine Wiſhes. Providence awaked on our Behalf, and by one Conqueſt after another, has ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the extended Country of <hi>Canada</hi> to the Britiſh Empire, whereby we are delivered from
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:009331_0031_1030EC58D7AC12E8"/>
the Hands of our ancient and inveterate Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, who had from the Beginning been Scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in our Sides, and upon all Occaſions vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to us; always contriving our Ruin, and exciting the Savages of the Wilderneſs, ever delighting in Blood and Miſchief, thro' deep rooted Prejudices againſt us, to numberleſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>human Murders, and Depredations, on our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant Settlements.</p>
            <p>Let us then <hi>Praiſe the Lord with our whole Hearts, and ſhew forth all his marvellous Works. Let us be glad and rejoice in him, who has main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained our Right and our Cauſe, and who ſat in the Throne judging Right—He has not ſuffered them who were our Enemies wrongfully to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice over us, and them that hated us without a Cauſe—He hath ſtirred up himſelf and awaked to our Judgment, even to our Cauſe.</hi>—</p>
            <p>And now after a ſurprizing and almoſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrelled Series of Victories and Succeſſes, with which divine Providence has crowned the Britiſh Fleets and Armies in all Parts of the World, our Enemies have been brought to ſubmit to honourable Terms of Peace, and particularly advantageous, comfortable and happy to theſe Colonies.—This great Event reflects a Luſtre on his Majeſty's Crown and Arms, and adorns the Beginning of his Reign; which it is our ardent Wiſh and Prayer may be very long and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous—and that <hi>in his Days the Righteous may flouriſh, and Abundance of Peace.</hi>—</p>
            <p>It was an happy Period with God's ancient People, when it was ſaid of their new conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

Country, The Land reſted from War. And bleſſed be God that ſuch a joyful Aera now ſhines forth upon us in <hi>America;</hi> and that we may <hi>ſit every Man under his Vine and under his Figtree, having none to make us afraid</hi>—or to diſturb us in the Enjoyment either of the Fruits of the Earth, or our more precious and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Privileges, both of a Religious and Civil Nature.</p>
            <p>But is War bro't to an happy Concluſion? And do the Bleſſings of Peace ſmile around us? Shall we therefore now <hi>beat our Swords into Plowſhares, and our Spears into Pruning Hooks</hi>; and lay aſide our military Weapons as uſeleſs Things, which we ſhall never more have Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for, and give up all Endeavours to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Art of War, and to keep up a martial Spirit?—How impolitic; how unſafe; how diſhonorable ſuch a Conduct! Who knows how ſoon he that hath ſtilled the Tumult of the People at preſent, may again call to Arms? We cannot but remember that it was but a few Years after the late Peace in 1748 was eſtabliſhed, and the Flames of War extinguiſhed, before they broke out again.</p>
            <p>The Church's Enemies are ever reſtleſs; and tho' God is above all the Enemies of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and is able to curb their Power and reſtrain their Malice;—yet have we not Reaſon to fear that the abounding of Iniquity in the Proteſtant World, may provoke God ſoon again to chaſtize his People with the Puniſhment of the Sword.</p>
            <p>Is it not the Wiſdom of a People to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in a Poſture of Defence?</p>
            <p>

            <p>Our Fathers who laid the Foundation of this Eſtabliſhment, tho't it of Importance. Nor will it be an Argument of our ſuperior Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to diſſert the Cauſe they were ſo anxious to ſupport.</p>

            <p>Altho' the peculiar Smiles of Providence which attend this anniverſary Solemnity, inſpire Joy and Gratitude into all our Hearts, yet we feel our Sorrow and Mourning renewed for the Deceaſe of the late worthy Colonel PHILLIPS, who was ſo long an Ornament to the <hi>Artillery Company,</hi> as well as a great Bleſſing in the other various public Stations which he filled with Honor, Fidelity and Acceptance. But he is gone! Gone to be here no more! His Piety, Integrity, Benevolence, and extenſive Kindneſs and Goodneſs, afforded him ſolid Comfort at the Approach of the laſt Enemy, and Victory over him.
