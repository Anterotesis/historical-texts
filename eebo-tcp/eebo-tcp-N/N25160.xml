            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE perfection of a government will not ſave it from the evils of faction and party ſpirit. The divine government itſelf has long had its oppoſers. Immediately after its introduction on earth, as we learn from the book of Geneſis, the chief of thoſe rebellious ſpirits, who by a reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ambition had raiſed a war in heaven, viſited the new creation, to ſow ſedition, and divide its happy inhabitants from their allegiance. He choſe the ſerpent for his craftineſs and ſubtilty, as the fitteſt inſtrument to ſcatter the poiſon of ſeduction, and to thwart the deſigns of wiſdom. A temptation, moſt dangerous and alluring to man in his exalted and happy ſtate, was propounded to the moſt ſuſcepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:033348_0005_0FF6D011F73A88D8"/>
of the family of paradiſe. To artful intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that they were unreaſonably abridged in hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and held in ignorance by the tyranny of their Creator, were added the enticing promiſes of encreaſed freedom, the enlargement of knowledge, and ſenſitive pleaſure. The temptation was fatal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſucceſsful, and a rebellion hence aroſe againſt God on earth, that has raged with awful virulence for almoſt ſix thouſand years. It called forth the ſtrong arm of power in the flood; on Sodom and its neighbouring cities; in Egypt and at the Red Sea, on a leader that arrogantly queſtioned, "Who is the Lord that I ſhould obey his voice;" and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Korah and his accomplices, who dared to ſay to Moſes and Aaron, the accredited miniſters of a polity ordained by God himſelf, "Ye take too much upon yourſelves, and wherefore lift ye up yourſelves above the congregation of the Lord." The ſame reſtleſs and ungovernable ſpirit, raiſed the Jews againſt the prophets, to put them to death; it brought the Saviour of men to the croſs, and perſecuted his followers, until the divine gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, in juſtice to itſelf, ſent an army to ſack Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, and to diſperſe a wicked, a ſtiff-necked, and a gainſaying people to all the winds of heaven. What it has done in later ages, may be learned from the encrimſoned page of hiſtory, and ſeen in every apartment of the mighty Bedlam, the great Lazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:033348_0006_0FF6D0143A7F3070"/>
of man: Of man naturally anarchial, diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganized, and ſeduced by the promiſe of the father of lies, "Ye ſhall be as gods."</p>
            <p>AS one object will be kept in view in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcourſe, it will not be neceſſary to deſcant on the excellency of one form of government above a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; it is enough for our preſent purpoſe, that this truth be acknowledged, that faction is, and has been, the lot of every government. The govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of kings and nobles has its evils and dangers, which I need not repeat, as they have been the theme of the friends and foes of real liberty. And enthuſiaſtic theoriſts alone will aſſert, that elective governments can be ſo pure in their principles, and ſo perfect in their adminiſtration, as to be perfectly ſecure from turbulence and inſurrection. "As heaven's beſt beams turn vinegar more four," we muſt acknowledge, however degrading it may be to the human character, that faction has thriven moſt in the mildeſt governments; and that republics in particular, have been proverbially ſtormy and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous.</p>
            <p>IF it is aſſerted by reſpectable authority, that, "It is yet in experiment whether human nature can bear ſo free a government as our own;" he is not the enemy of liberty and of the people who would meet
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:033348_0007_0FF6D0168C1579B0"/>
its difficulties, but he who would ſedulouſly conceal and keep them out of ſight.</p>
            <p>THIS is my apology for ſelecting a paſſage of holy writ, that may lead to matter ſo unuſual on this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſary occaſion. It is a religious duty that we owe to our good government, to be armed againſt theſe wiles of faction, theſe "depths of Satan;" wiles, grown common by frequent repetition; but ſo flow of heart are men to underſtand, that they are until this day little conſidered by the great body of mankind.</p>
            <p>DIVINE inſpiration informs us, that the Jewiſh nation, during the reign of David, were proſperous and happy. When he died it is recorded of him, "that he died in a good old age, full of days, rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and honors." The ſame truth is alſo apparent from many paſſages in the Pſalms, in which, the glories of Chriſt's future kingdom are undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhadowed forth, in the real proſperity of Iſrael, under the wiſe adminiſtration of the ſon of Jeſſe: "Out of Zion the perfection of beauty hath ſhone." It pleaſed God, however, for a particular ſin of David, to ſend into his family the ſcourge of domeſtic diſcord. An unhappy event took place that awoke, and called into action, the worſt of paſſions, in Abſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom the king's ſon, the paſſion of revenge. With
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:033348_0008_0FF6D018F6946598"/>
a temper ſoured by an incident, well known to all who read the word of God, he was ſoon the cauſe of ſerious trouble to his father, and the people he governed. When the viler paſſions are once rouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the human heart, it is with difficulty they are laid. Chagrin, and diſappointment, eaſily agree to acts of deſperation. Poſſeſſed of perſonal accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments, and the arts of addreſs, young Abſalom aſpired at no leſs than the dethroning of his father, and uſurping the government. To obtain theſe, he went through the uſual proceſs of every dema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, and inſinuated himſelf into the favour of the people. As parade and novelty are pleaſing to the great body of mankind, "he prepared him chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots and horſes, and fifty men to run before him:" An eſſay at ſhow, borrowed from the wicked heath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en nations, as unuſual as it was unlawful in Iſrael. But a cuſtom being unuſual and unlawful, is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten alone ſufficient to recommend it to a race of creatures, whoſe "hearts are continually ſet in them to do evil." To adminiſter juſtice between man and man, in a great nation, is an Herculean taſk. It ſeems at this time that the judiciary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment of his father's government, was unuſually crowded with buſineſs, and as it is eaſier to fault, than to mend the meaſures of our rulers, this fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed a favourable opportunity to an unprincipled and aſpiring young man. "He roſe up early and
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:033348_0009_0FF6D018F6946598"/>
ſtood beſide the way of the gate, and it was ſo, that when any man that had a controverſy, came to the king for judgment, then Abſalom called unto him and ſaid, of what city art thou? and he ſaid, thy ſervant is of one of the tribes of Iſrael. And Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalom ſaid unto him, See, thy matters are good and right, but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee. Abſalom ſaid moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which hath any ſuit or cauſe might come unto me, and I would do him juſtice! And it was ſo, that when any man came nigh to him to do him obeiſance, he put forth his hand and took him and kiſſed him. And on this manner did Abſalom to all Iſrael that came to the king for judgment. So Abſalom ſtole the hearts of the men of Iſrael." The avenues to the human heart are numerous, with which deſigning men moſt commonly are pretty thoroughly acquainted. As men have refined in manners, they have refined in villainy. The ſtate of manners with the Jews in this age, was comparatively rude; ſuch open ſolicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation might now give offence. So bare a hook, might now be unſucceſsful in the popular ſtream. But the eſſentials of matter and manner in this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs have ever been ſimilar, and have rarely failed, when adapted to the taſte and biaſſes of a people. By "the way of the gate," we are to underſtand, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the entrance of the city, or the door of the court
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:033348_0010_0FF6D01DC4294EC0"/>
where juſtice was wont to be adminiſtred: Here he harangued the litigious, the choiceſt materials of a demagogue. Told them that his father had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a child and incapable of managing his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; that the judges whom he had appointed were either negligent of their duty, or corrupt, and that bribery, and not juſtice, ruled in their deciſions. And, that he might cover his ambition under appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent humanity, he was indiſcriminately familiar with all his father's ſubjects. If any man had a contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy, let it be juſt or unjuſt, he ſhowed himſelf his patron and friend. On condition they would raiſe him to office, he not only promiſed them more liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, with a regular and impartial adminiſtration of juſtice, and decried the neglects, wickedneſs, and tyranny of their lawful prince; he could deſcend farther, when any of the multitude did him obei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance as the king's ſon, he proclaimed his equality, and gave them the fraternal kiſs. Thus he ſtole the hearts of the men of Iſrael, and a more proper metaphor than theft, cannot be applied to thoſe who ſeek to weaken public confidence in legitimate government, to anſwer their own vile purpoſes. For the people were bound to David his father by the conſtitution, by oaths of allegiance, and by his divine election and anointing as king.—When God in his providence is about to ſcourge a nation with ſuch characters as Abſalom, a train of inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:033348_0011_0FF6D0202781D4A0"/>
ſeems to be laid, to enſure the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their purpoſes. It appears of aſtoniſhing that a youth ſhould ſtir up ſo great a portion of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, againſt a king diſtinguiſhed for religion, the love of his ſubjects, and the well earned ſame of many victories. But it muſt be conſidered, that many of the partiſans and favorites of Saul his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſor, were ſtill living, and out of place at court, who had been in the intereſts of Iſh-boſheth, Saul's ſon, and who either were fearful of their perſonal ſafety, or certainly deſpaired of being benefited by the preſent adminiſtration.</p>
            <p>THE haughtineſs of Joab, the captain of the king's hoſts, his impunity in atrocious wickedneſs, and his being ſuffered to march againſt his fellow citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, had leſſened the character of David in the eyes of the people. Other public officers proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly did not excel in prudence, as a long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of power and proſperity, is rarely ſupported with dignity by the greateſt characters. And what was more than all the reſt; the ſin of the king in the matter of Uriah, was freſh in the minds of his ſubjects, and had a tendency to make them anxious for their deareſt poſſeſſions, and their lives. The name and infamy of Bath-ſheba, was the topic of her ſex, and her power was dreaded.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:033348_0012_0FF6D02276AAB870"/>AS an anvenging God had laid all theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in a train, the way was prepared for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploſion of the ſame paſſions, as were awoke by the conduct of Piſiſtratus in Athens, and Tarquinius in Rome.</p>
            <p>THE ſeeds of rebellion being thus ſown in Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, Abſalom, to conceal his deſigns from his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, could appear religious if occaſion required. With apparent filial ſubmiſſion, he requeſted the lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty of going to Hebron, a place about ſixteen miles diſtant from the ſeat of government, to pay a vow. Meanwhile, his creatures were diſpatched to every part of the kingdom, who, upon an agreed ſignal, were to proclaim him king.</p>
            <p>THE conſpiracy ſoon grew ſo ſtrong, that even Ahithophel, the king's counſellor, made "precious confeſſions" and joined it. When the intelligence arrived, that "the hearts of the men of Iſrael were after Abſalom," the court and family of the king were filled with conſternation. It was reſolved to leave the city of Jeruſalem, and take refuge in the wilderneſs. An aged monarch flying with a rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of his tried friends, before an unprincipled pa rricide muſt have afforded a moving ſpectacle. As they paſſed the brook Kidron, it is recorded, "that all the country wept with a loud voice.
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:033348_0013_0FF6D024D317F080"/>
David went up by the aſcent of mount Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went up barefoot, and all the people that were with him covered every man his head, and they wont up, weeping as they went up." The good king in his troubles did not give vent to paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate language, or attempt ſuicide, like an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſsful philoſopher in modern revolutions. Feeling that this ſcourge was raiſed up for his own, and his people's ſins, his heart was ſoft and peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. He pitied and forgave his enemies, and with the enlarged views of a chriſtian, looked up through ſecond cauſes, to God the firſt cauſe. When the prieſt, from attachment to their aged prince, were bearing the Ark of God in his fugitive train, that it might prove his defence, he bid them carry it back into the city, with theſe dignified ſentiments. "If I ſhall find favour in the eyes of the Lord, he will bring me again and ſhew me both it, and his habitation. But if he thus ſay, I have no delight in thee: behold here am I, let him do to me as ſeemeth good unto him." On being informed that his friend Ahithophel had joined the conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators, no terms of reproach eſcaped from his mouth, But a modeſt and humble ejaculation, that "the Lord would turn the counſel of Ahithophel into fooliſhneſs." The ſame amiable temper alſo marked the character of the ſuffering and afflicted

king on his arrival at Bahurim, a village in the tribe of Benjamin. Shimei a deſcendant of Saul, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid's predeceſſor, took this occaſion to expreſs his family antipathy, by publicly curſing the king, and caſting ſtones and dirt. Thoſe who ſtood round his royal perſon, felt as all natural men would feel on ſuch an occaſion: they begged the liberty to go and take off his head; "no," replied the king, "let him curſe. Behold my ſon which came forth of my bowels ſeeketh my life: how much more now may this Benjamite do it? let him alone, and let him curſe, for the Lord hath bidden him." During theſe tranſactions, Abſalom and his accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices had entered Jeruſalem, with the ſhouts of "God ſave the King." But an unprincipled man, who is baſe enough to pay obſequious addreſs to the people, that he may in this way raiſe himſelf to places of power and truſt, rarely fails either to betray them, or to become licentious in his proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity. With Ahithophel as his oracle, he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately did an act, that rendered him deſpicable in the eyes of all thoſe whoſe favourite he had been. This counſellor, whoſe wiſdom was literally turned into fooliſhneſs, told the young uſurper, that it was important to eſtabliſh it in the minds of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that the ancient regimen was never to return, and that he and his father were never to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled, and that to accompliſh this end, it was poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:033348_0015_0FF6D0297750C058"/>
to maintain a public inceſtuous intercourſe with his father's wives, and chooſe a ſelect number of aſſaſſins, who might purſue, overtake, and diſpatch his father and aſſociates. The firſt part of the counſel pleaſed, and was put into execution in the ſight of all Iſrael; and altho' the latter met his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, Abſalom was over-perſuaded by another deſigning counſellor not to adopt it, but to gather the people, <hi>en maſſe,</hi> and purſue his oppoſers, and wipe them from the face of the earth.</p>
            <p>AHITHOPHEL, ſeeing that his counſel was not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, with all the factitious dignity of a modern phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher, who cannot brook contradicton, "aroſe, ſaddled his aſs, got home to his houſe, and hanged himſelf." As the criſis approached, in which the fate of the kingdom was to be decided in battle, we find our young demagogue raſh, precipitate, and parricidal. But on the other hand, the king was cool, deliberate, and affectionate. With all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his eye and voice, he bid the commanders of his forces, to "deal gently for his ſake with the young man, even with Abſalom." The armies encountered in the wood of Ephraim, and twenty thouſand men fell by the ſword on the ſpot, and a ſtill greater number was ſlaughtered in the retreat of the inſurgents. While Abſalom on a mule was fleeing from his purſuers, the hair of his head, of
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:033348_0016_0FF6D02BC28E5BA0"/>
which he had a remarkable quantity, caught in the thick boughs of an oak, "And he was taken up between the heavens and the earth, and the mule that was under him went away."</p>
            <p>INTELLIGENCE of his ſituation was brought to Joab, the king's commander in chief, who took three ſpears and thruſt them thro' his heart, "while he was yet alive in the midſt of the oak." The trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet was blown, and the people ceaſed purſuing. Abſalom's body was taken down from the tree, thrown into a pit, and covered with an huge pile of ſtones. "And all Iſrael fled every one to his tent." Thus ended the life of an unprincipled, and aſpiring young man, who ſtole the hearts of a great people. Similar cauſes ever have, and ever will, produce ſimilar effects.</p>
            <p>THE doctrine of human depravity can be proved by the hiſtory of every nation, without the aid of the holy ſcriptures. "A diſpaſſionate view of human events, affords demonſtration, that the fiery and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive paſſions of enmity and contention, are more congenial to the natural human heart, than the mild and benevolent ſentiments of peace and love."<note n="*" place="bottom">Hamilton.</note> All are by nature greater lovers of their own dear ſelves, than of their neighbours, and the public good.

And as with this, temper, there cannot fail to be different intereſts, and different taſtes and faculties, the latent cauſes of faction, are the hereditary, and perpetual inheritance of mankind. That a human government ſhould ever be ſo conſtructed, as to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain univerſal ſupport and ſuffrage, until God has radically and univerſally changed the human heart, may be a pleaſant dream to a philoſopher, but it cannot be a reality. I hope, therefore, that I ſhall not be ſeverely cenſured, as treſpaſſing on ground that does not belong to my profeſſion, while I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to throw in my mite, to check a ſpirit of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order and indiſcipline, that like a giant, ſeems to be beſtriding the nations, and laying proſtrate their government, religion, and happineſs. In doing this, I wiſh not to be thought an enemy of neceſſary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, or as unfriendly to the principles of rational liberty. "There is a time to break down, and a time to build up." As the former, as it relates to government and religion, is more pleaſing to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature, and the latter more applicable to this country, I have; on deliberation, determined to riſk the popularity of the following ſentiments.</p>
            <p>THE ſacred ſtory to which we have been attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, may naturally lead us to conſider the materials, of which factions and conſpiracies have uſually been compoſed in free governments—By what methods theſe materials have been brought into action—
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:033348_0018_0FF6D03054DA4990"/>
And what has been the general iſſue;—With the practical inferences thence ariſing.</p>
            <p n="1">I. THE materials of all conſpiracies againſt good government, have always been compoſed of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, or wicked, ſubjects and citizens. "It is eaſy and natural for weak, and uninformed minds, to conſtrue zeal for efficient government, as evidential of a heart fond of deſpotic power and hoſtile to the principles of civil liberty."<note n="*" place="bottom">Hamilton.</note> Hence, much op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition has made its appearance from the honeſt errors of minds led aſtray by preconceived jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies and fears. But there would be little danger from the ignorant, were they not ſpurred to action by the ambitious, aſpiring, and abandoned. An ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant man can only be pitied, who is the mere puppet of a ſly intriguer, that, like a mountebank, ſets behind the ſkreen, and manages him before the ſpectators for his own emolument. The wicked, and unprincipled, are much the moſt formidable claſs of citizens, which all good governments are in danger of having arrayed againſt them. While the ignorant may be enlightened and reformed, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>principled rarely, yield to the force of truth, but are obſtinate in error, and will not be perſuaded "al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' one roſe from the dead." Theſe deſperate characters, always encreaſe in proportion to the eaſe
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:033348_0019_0FF6D032A107C7B0"/>
with which the means of wealth and luxury, can be obtained, and are the ſame in all ages and countries. Perhaps a more perfect deſcription can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be given of them, than that of the Roman Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, when informing the Roman Senate, what char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acters had joined Cataline's conſpiracy. Although the deſcription is familiar to the ſchool-boy, it may not be improper to repeat it.</p>
            <p>"THE firſt claſs, conſiſts of thoſe, who having great debts, but ſtill greater poſſeſſions, are ſo paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionately fond of the latter, that they cannot bear the thoughts of infringing them. This, in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, is the moſt honourable claſs, for they are rich: but their intention and aim are infamous. The next conſiſts of thoſe, who though oppreſſed with debt, yet hope for power, and aſpire at the chief management of public affairs; imagining they ſhall obtain thoſe honors by throwing the ſtate into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions, which they deſpair of during its tranquili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The third; thoſe who coming to the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and unexpected poſſeſſion of great wealth, have run into all the exceſſes of luxury and profu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Theſe, by building fine houſes, by affluent living, ſplendid equipages, numerous attendants, and ſumptuous entertainments, have plunged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo deeply in debt, that in order to retrieve their affairs, they muſt recal Sylla from his tomb.

The fourth; a mixed, motley, mutinous tribe, who have been long ruined beyond hopes of recovery, and partly through indolence, partly through ill management, and extravagance, are perſecuted with arreſts, judgments, and confiſcations. The fifth are parricides, aſſaſſins, and ruffians. The laſt are debauched with city extravagance, ſuch as you ſee with curled locks, neatly dreſſed, whoſe whole labor of life, and induſtry in watching, are exhauſted upon midnight entertainments. Under this claſs we may rank all gameſters, and the lewd and luſtful of every denomination. Theſe ſlim delicate youths, practiſed in all the arts of hollow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted politeneſs, not only know to ſing and dance, but on occaſion can aim the murderous dagger, and adminiſter the poiſonous draught."<note n="*" place="bottom">Cicero.</note> Such charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, with few exceptions, are the natural enemies of all governments, and readily embrace revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary principles. In ſhort—every government that has for its object, "the puniſhment of evil do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and the praiſe of them that do well;" to paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy the ſentiments of the ſame author, is a conteſt of integrity with treachery, of piety with profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of honor with baſeneſs, of moderation with unbridled licentiouſneſs, of ſound reaſon with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved underſtanding and phrenzy. In a word, it is a ſtruggle of equity, temperance, prudence, and magnanimity, with iniquity, luxury, idleneſs, and
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:033348_0021_0FF6D03738793AC8"/>
raſhneſs. In a wicked world, the materials are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways at hand, to revolutionize for the worſe, and with a few fanatics or theoretic philoſophers as pioneers, are eaſily brought to attack the fortreſſes of public tranquility, of national happineſs and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity.</p>
            <p n="2">II. IN the ſecond place as propoſed, let us ſpend a moment in ſhowing how the materials of faction and conſpiracy, are, and have been marſhalled, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt order, and the empire of the laws. And here I would premiſe, that where the great body of a people are vicious, and there is a weak executive, it is no great atchievement to overturn, or check the progreſs of the beſt civil conſtitution. A fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Greek could burn a ſpacious temple, in which the higheſt ſkill of architecture was diſplayed, and the wealth and labour of many nations was collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. A very weak hand may throw down that, which it requires wiſdom and ſtrength to rear, and a very boy, by caſting a ſtick or ſtone, can ſtop a piece of mechaniſm, which, it required ages to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent and mature. A French writer boaſted that one Voltaire was ſufficient to overthrow a ſyſtem, which it required twelve apoſtles, and an hoſt of martyrs to eſtabliſh. To which biſhop Horne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies in the following ſtriking ſimilitude. "When a candle burns, and gives light to a houſe, many
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:033348_0022_0FF6D039829E4DA8"/>
wonderful things contribute to the phenomenon. The fat of an animal is the work of the Creator, or the wax of a bee is made by his teaching, the wick is from the vegetable wool of a ſingular exotic tree, much labor of man is concerned in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and the elements that inflame it are thoſe by which the world is governed. But after all this apparatus, a child or a fool may put it out, and then boaſt that the family are left in darkneſs, and are running one againſt another. Such is the mighty atchievment of Mr. Voltaire; but with this difference that what is real darkneſs, he would call illumination."<note n="*" place="bottom">Horne's Voltaire diſſected.</note> The ſame may be applied to gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment. In the hiſtory of republics in particular, how often have we found the great intereſts of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, ſacrificed to the conceit, the ambition, and obſtinacy of individuals, who have had credit e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make their paſſions and caprices, intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to mankind. While we peruſe their annals, we are ready to exclaim with the Apoſtle, "behold how great a matter a little fire kindleth."</p>
            <p>THE materials of faction and conſpiracy, have u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually been marſhalled againſt order and the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of the laws, in one or all of theſe three ways. By addreſſing men's paſſions and flattering their prejudices—By miſtating and diſcoloring facts—And by humouring the taste of the age.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:033348_0023_0FF6D03BCBD8A378"/>1. AMBITIOUS and deſigning men commonly addreſſes men's paſſions and flatter their prejudices. This was abundantly the caſe with the aſpiring young man, to whoſe hiſtory we have been attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. In his exile with the king of Geſhur, he had learned the ſtile of a vicious court, and the pomp of royal magnificence. And as the Jews paſſionately deſired a king, like other nations, his firſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, as heir apparent, was with a profuſion of chariots and footmen, and his firſt addreſs to the prejudices of the ſoured, diſcontented, and litigious. Error always addreſs the paſſions and prejudices; truth ſcorns ſuch mean intrigue, and only addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the underſtanding and the heart. The worſt enemies of free governments are ſcarce diſcernible, they dip in the ſame diſh, and like a diſtinguiſhed member of an ancient and innocent family, talk much of the poor, and wonder at the waſte of oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, even on their Saviour's head; not that they care for the poor, but have their own vile purpoſes to ſerve, by this ſhew of benevolence and humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. So long as the world exiſts, there will be an inequality in perſonal talents, and property, which will be a ſource of continual envy and jealouſy to thoſe who do not poſſeſs them. He who on every occaſion, ſeeks to encreaſe this envy, and ſpread this natural jealouſy of the great body of mankind, againſt talents and wealth, will rarely fail to meet
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:033348_0024_0FF6D03E2954EEC0"/>
with ſucceſs. To defend, on every occaſion, the ſuppoſed privileges of ſuch characters, as were marked by the Roman orator, to embrace, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their intereſts, but adopt their capricious paſſions, cheriſh their preſumption, indulge their rapacity, gratify their taſte for pleaſure without expenſe, and feed their antipathy to all governmental reſtraints, is one of the grand ſecrets of revolutionizing. The ſpecious maſk of zeal for the rights of the people, is a favourite dreſs of lurking and dangerous ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the turbulent, and aſpiring, always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach their government. "Such as walk after the fleſh," ſaith the Apoſtle, "deſpiſe government, preſumptuous are they, ſelf-willed, they are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to ſpeak evil of dignities." "With a ſhew of humility," ſaith the Pſalmiſt, "they lie in wait ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly as a lion in his den; they lie in wait to catch the poor; they crouch and humble themſelves, that the poor may fall by their ſtrong ones."</p>
            <p>THERE are but few recorded in the annals of mankind, who have deſtroyed liberty, and proſtrated free governments, who did not begin their career, is theſe obſequious arts of demagogy, and end in tyranny. The exact point, between power and lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty, never was, and perhaps never will be found, in this imperfect ſtate; this is a precious circumſtance
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:033348_0025_0FF6D0407B8C3788"/>
to the unprincipled, as it affords a plauſible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for perpetual change.</p>
            <p>FROM the diſorders hence ariſing, that have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced republics, the advocates of deſpotic power, have drawn arguments, not only againſt republican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm itſelf, but againſt the very principles of civil lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty. As inſtability, injuſtice, confuſion, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eign influence, introduced into public councils, have been the mortal diſeaſes, under which popular governments have every where periſhed: tyrants have taken heart; and nations, to be more ſafe, have often been willing to be leſs free. Such general joy, perhaps, never pervaded Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, as at the reſtoration. Charles II. with all his vices, was eſteemed a bleſſing, compared to the tyranny of an unſtable parliament, and the lordli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Protector.</p>
            <p>BUT, ſays a writer, whoſe words I have already uſed, "If liberty is to faction, what air is to fire, an aliment, without which it expires, it would be as fooliſh to wiſh to deſtroy liberty, becauſe it nour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhes faction, as it would be to wiſh the annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of air, which is neceſſary to animal life, becauſe it imparts to fire its deſtructive agency."<note n="*" place="bottom">Hamilton.</note> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' that liberty, which at preſent is contended
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:033348_0026_0FF6D042CF1A2660"/>
for in Europe, would be better reſembled by a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, than a goddeſs, there is yet ſuch a thing as ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional liberty, which, it is to be hoped, the nations will not be diſcouraged from attempting, by the madneſs of the preſent times; and, that oceans of blood will not be ſhed in vain. It is one of the curſes of the apoſtacy, that men can never reſt ſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isfied with the mean of all extremes. The moſt popular writers on government, in this age, have taken almoſt the directly oppoſite ground, of thoſe in former ages. Inſtead of attempting to define the portion of power, neceſſary for the very exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of any government, their whole genius is ſpent, in inquiring into the poſſible conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of power. It is eaſier to diſcolour, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figure, and by the dextrous arts of political legerdemain, to transform real exiſtences, into hydras and gorgons, than to traverſe the wide field of experiment. And, as obſcurity, is much oftener in the paſſions and prejudices of the reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, than in the ſubject, many, through their unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward biaſſes, have become ſo entangled by words, and names, that, "while they promiſe liberty, they themſelves are the ſervants of curruption."</p>
            <p n="2">2. AMBITIOUS and deſigning men, accompliſh many of their purpoſes, by miſtating, and diſcolour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:033348_0027_0FF6D0451B816990"/>
facts. As the government of Iſrael, was eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by God himſelf, there is little reaſon to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that the vile ſuggeſtions of Abſalom, had any more foundation, than thoſe of the firſt great diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganizer, "the liar from the beginning." Aſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men, of all ſinners, have the greateſt antipathy to light. Their counſels, like thoſe of pandemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, muſt be held in that light, which in ſcripture is called great darkneſs, to be ſucceſsful. In the terrible convulſions, that have happened in ancient republics, and kingdoms, the true cauſes were rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apparent to the great maſs of the people, till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their effects were produced. As a harpooner more eaſily draws the heart's blood of the monarch of the deep, by ſetting him a flouncing at a cork, or buoy, than by an open and direct attack, there have been few inſtances of ſucceſsful demagogy, where ſome cork, or buoy, has not been thrown out, on which the populace might flounce, and ſpend their rage and ſtrength, until they might be taken at pleaſure. When Pauſanias, of Lacedemon, thought himſelf too great to remain a ſubject to his government, he flattered the Helots and Miſſinians—ſlaves that were ever ready to rebel againſt their maſters—and ſecretly correſponded with the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of his country. While he was inviting the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the Perſian monarch, to help him enſlave his fellow-citizens he was viſibly the poor man's
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:033348_0028_0FF6D04787498A20"/>
friend, and wept over the evils of ariſtocracy. The ſame methods of ſelf-aggrandizement, with little va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation, were purſued by Pericles and Alcibiades of Athens; by the Gracchi, Sylla, Marius Cataline, and Caeſar, in Rome; by Oliver Cromwell, in England; by Marat, and that ſucceſſion of decapita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted villains, who, of late, rode on the whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind, and directed the ſtorm of a national mob. Some cunningly deviſed pretence of public good, or ſome imaginary monſter of deſpotic power, has always been the ſtandard, to rally men from their ordinary occupations, to butcher one another, and wallow in blood.</p>
            <p>TAUGHT to view with awe, or admiration, thoſe in public ſtations; the merit or odium of meaſures, to which numerous unforeſeen cauſes may have contributed, has ever been imputed to men, and not to circumſtances. "Party ſpirit," ſays an anonymous writer, "rarely ruſhes to the front of the ſtage, brandiſhing his bloody arm over the affrighted crowd, but he wanders behind the ſcenes, preſents his dark lantern, aims the aſſaſſinat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dagger, cuts the ſinews of public confidence, and poiſons the fountain of ſocial life." Under this head may be ranged the forging of private cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondencies, the fabricating of offenſive anecdotes, and obnoxious innuendoes, mutilating and diſtorting
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:033348_0029_0FF6D049DA1AEC20"/>
the meaſures of the men in authority. Like the cry of Fire! or, Stop thief! ſet up by felons in populous cities, private plunder and emolument, has been the object of thoſe who ſound an alarm, "that your liberty is menaced," in countries conſtitution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally free and happy.</p>
            <p n="3">3. DEMAGOGUES always humour the taſte of the age. The love of pre-eminence is one of the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt principles in man. And it is curious to trace this love in all its effects. Though the taſtes and purſuits of different ages, may be different, we ſhall always find the original principles in man, the ſame, and deſigning men, like bubbles, ever riding on the top of the popular ſtream. In the ruder ages of the world, the darling purſuit of mankind, was war, military glory, and conqueſt, and the moſt ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful madman was the idol of the people. When heatheniſm was ſwept away by the power of the chriſtian religion, even the innocent, and meek reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of Jeſus, became the inſtrument to obtain pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ular applauſe. The love of pre-eminence, led ſome to climb mountains, and build towers, on which they might ſtand, and ſhow their extraordinary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion. Others ſhut themſelves up in monaſteries, and nunneries, to evince their deadneſs to the world, and the nighneſs, in which they lived to God, or went to drive infidels from the holy land.
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:033348_0030_0FF6D04C1B817D18"/>
In another age, the ſame ſpirit ſought a reform, and really altered many abuſes, but haſtened into the oppoſite extreme, until even reformation itſelf want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed reforming. The ſingular revival of religion, in this country, half a century ſince, in which, no doubt, the ſpirit of God was remarkably poured out, and much good accompliſhed, is alſo, illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the ſame idea. Men, for pre-eminence ſake, were affected in their bodies, as well as their minds, ſaw extraordinary appearances, cried out in high tranſports, preached, prayed, and exhorted loud and earneſtly, ſang through the ſtreets, and were indiſcreetly and haſtily zealous. But, becauſe the taſte and manners of the times, are altered, we are not to ſuppoſe, that the ſpirit, which led in the extravagancies of thoſe days, is now aſleep. The ſame love of pre-eminence, that once made zealots, and cruſaders, now makes ſceptics. Decent irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, now aſſumes to itſelf, the ſame airs, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulges the ſame rancorous cenſure. When Abſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom would go to Hebron, to pay a vow, religion was made the ſtalking horſe, and ſacrifice, the ſhout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing horn, of ſedition and uſurpation.</p>
            <p>BUT, demagogues are not now to be looked for, in the ſeats of religion; for this has not now the chief ſeat in the ſynagogue. The tide of the world, is not ſetting this way; and, men whom the ſin of
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:033348_0031_0FF6D04F0387EA58"/>
Diotrephes, eaſily beſets, always follow the tide. It is not in faſhion to kneel before crucifixes, but to worſhip, and adore human reaſon, falſely ſo call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and, the rage for relics, is now ſpending itſelf on <hi>teſtacia,</hi> in ſearch of Mammoth bones, making experiments on air, or caſting the age of the world from the lava of burning mountains. "Where the carcaſs is, the eagles will be gathered together. The paraphernalia of the naturaliſt and chymiſt, is now ſubſtituted for the cowl, by the modern diſciples of Ignatius Loyola. Were the ſcales of prejudice taken from our eyes, we ſhould ſee, that this reading of human nature, is juſt; and that he who once believed in legends, and he who now doubts of ſelf-evident propoſitions, are the ſame characters. The taſte, and favourite purſuits of every age, has had its uſes, but their extremes have been highly vicious. The deſire to have our thoughts our own, and to be independent in ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is commendable. But when we carry this deſire of independence too far, it is as fallacious, as it is dangerous and criminal. There is no ſuch commanding dignity of mind, in a man's trying to differ from his progenitors, as to government and religion, as ſome ſuſpect. The unnatural produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a hard and ſtupid heart, often lead a man to miſtake his own reſtleſsneſs, for activity of genius, and his own captiouſneſs for ſagacity of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:033348_0032_0FF6D050A7A40A70"/>
The world probably progreſſes in knowledge; but the analogy between the natural, and intellectual ſyſtems, evinces that new thoughts, are as rare as comets, and other new appearances in nature. A little acquaintance with antiquity may convince us, "that there is no new thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſun." From the days of the ſchool-men, to to the preſent time, a great portion of enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſm has mixed itſelf with ſcience, as well as with religion. Every age has been overſtock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with imagined original genuiſes, who have ſcourged mankind with their theories, and blinded them with new diſcovered light. Had the philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers amuſed themſelves with their categories, and predicaments, they might have been innocent, and harmleſs lunatics. But now, unfortunately for mankind, they have turned their whole attention to the fabricating of new theories in government, and religion. Being unwilling to learn wiſdom from what is paſt, and like anatomiſts make exper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on the dead, they ſeem to demand the world for a muſeum, and the living for diſſection, and like the "reſtleſs iron tongue of death, to call for millions at a meal." Nay more, they ſeem to be waging the war of the Titan's, and piling the earth in heaps, to climb at heaven. They will undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly meet with the ſame ſucceſs as their fabled pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors, and be buried by the mountains they have
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:033348_0033_0FF6D0530158A290"/>
ſet in motion. In theſe monſtrous efforts, the world has already found that "the little finger" of philoſophy, "is thicker than the loins" of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition; and that the "tender mercies" of mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern liberality in religion "are cruelty."</p>
            <p>IF Cromwell had to affect experimental religion to accompliſh the toils of his ambition, by the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious taſte and manners of his day; from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing taſte of this age, we muſt expect ſimilar characters to boaſt of their philoſophic chriſtianity, of their deiſm, and atheiſm; as theſe are the moſt prevalent ſentiments of the once chriſtian world. It is not ſaid now, "Stand by thyſelf and come not near to me, for I am holier than thou;" but "ſtand by thyſelf and come not near to me," for I know more "than thou." The infallability of the Pope, and the divine right of kings, ſeems to have tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated itſelf from the conclave of ſuperſtition, to the <hi>ſtoa</hi> of philoſophy—From the courts of intriguing deſpots, to the ſecret, ſelf-created created ſocieties of modern <hi>illuminati.</hi>

WHEN Abſalom, to human appearance, had nigh accompliſhed his purpoſe, a nation afflicted with his daring ambition, and unnatural crimes, rouſed to oppoſe him. He was defeated in battle, and in the confuſion of his retreat, his hair caught in the branches of an oak, and his mule went from under him, leaving him between the heavens and the earth. He died by the hand of violence, was thrown into a pit, and covered with a pile of ſtones, and his followers, in the true ſtyle of a mob, noiſy and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent when ſucceſsful, but mean-ſpirited and cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly in defeat, "fled every one to his tent." In like manner the great deceiver and diſorganizer, who, "from the beginning, abode not in the truth, is to be caſt into the bottomleſs pit, that he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the nations no more." Altho' "he hath now great wrath, becauſe he knoweth that his time is ſhort," bleſſed be God, his chain hath an end. Thoſe whom he now "leads captive at his will," ſhall turn againſt him, and aggravate his future con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. The pride of Korah, and his accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices, ſet up the holineſs of the congregation of Iſrael, againſt its prieſthood, and the power of the people, againſt the civil magiſtrate, altho' ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a well authenticated divine commiſſion. The earth opened her mouth and ſwallowed them up. The Jews refuſing to ſubmit to legitimate govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and waſted of the partizans of faction, have

ceaſed to be a nation, are diſperſed through the world, and are hated and deſpiſed of all men. The hiſtory of the Grecian, Roman, and French repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, thoſe Veſuviuſes of impaſſioned man, to which alluſions have already been made, might here be read. It is diſtreſſing to a benevolent mind, to ſurvey the ſtruggles of parties, the proſcriptions, the maſſacres, and aſſaſſinations, that have been guided by popular villains, ever iſſuing in their own, and their country's ruin. Not an inſtance can be found, of one, who flattered and miſled the people, but either he periſhed in the ſtorm he had raiſed, or ended in the fallacious glory of a Ceaſar. Indeed,</p>

            <p>WHEN Abſalom got into precarious power, we find him no more the fawning ſycophant of the majeſty of the people. We hear no more of his kiſſing and bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or tender wiſhes to redreſs the wrongs of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured fellow citizens.

under mild governments, or thoſe ſimple ones that are led by the magic ſounds of viſionary liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, have ever gained any thing by change. Both have always loſt. Even where a nation has been conſiderably oppreſſed, when they have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to break their ſhackles at the inſtance of popular courtiers, they have ever reſembled the man, who took "ſeven other ſpirits more wicked than himſelf;" their laſt ſtate, has ever been worſe than their firſt.

            <p>HAVING conſidered the materials, of which fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and conſpiracies have uſually been compoſed, in free governments; by what methods they have been brought to act; and what has been the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral iſſue. Your patience is craved, while a few practical inferences are made from the ſubject.</p>
            <p n="1">1. PERSONAL accompliſhments, and brilliant tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, are no infallible evidences, that' a man will make a good ruler. We read nothing of Abſalom's wiſdom, virtue, or learning, in the laws of his country, or of any diſtinguiſhed, diſintereſted, and patriotic atchievement. His firſt introduction in the ſacred memoirs is on this wiſe; "In all Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:033348_0037_0FF6D05C46A4B6D0"/>
there was none to be ſo much praiſed as Abſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom for his beauty: from the ſole of his foot, even to the crown of his head, there was no blemiſh in him." Perſonal accompliſhments, and brilliant tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, have in a few ſolitary inſtances, made an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py aſſemblage with diſtinguiſhed virtues. But more generally, they have been the ſcourge of their poſſeſſors, and of the world. The moment a man is conſcious of them, he is undone; for he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately thinks himſelf born to command; walks with faſtidious contempt over the aſhes of his anceſtors; and growing delirious with his own ſuppoſed orig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inality, he ſees "luminous periods," and the "ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of a bright and glorious day," marching before him.</p>
            <p>BUT. after all, brilliant talents have impoſing charms, and will command reſpect, and this is not one of the leſſer evils of elective governments. In giving our ſuffrages, we inſenſibly forget, that a ſound mind ſtored by induſtry, and fortified by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious principles, is always the moſt uſeful in church and ſtate.</p>
            <p>IT does not occur that belles lettres and legiſlation have little connection, and that popular aſſemblies have ever ſuffered more for the want of candid, and diſpaſſionate hearers, than daſhing, and impoſing
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:033348_0038_0FF6D05E8C886F60"/>
ſpeakers. The former, commonly bear the heat and burden of the day, while the latter are rarely ſeen in their ſeats, but on ſubjects, in which they can pronounce their own eulogiums to the gallery, or flatter the prejudices, and humour the taſte, of the age.</p>
            <p n="2">2. AND, with equal certainty, we may infer, that thoſe who are moſt ambitious of preferment, are the leaſt fitted for it; as the beſt qualified, are the moſt modeſt, and ſelf-diffident. The love of honor and preferment, when kept within due bounds, may animate the patriot, and fire the hero. Still, however, more ſacred and venerable princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, than the praiſe of men, claim the chief direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of human conduct. When the reſpect we pay to the opinions of men, encroaches on that reverence, which we owe to the Deity, to the voice of conſcience, and the ſenſe of duty, it becomes criminal, and highly dangerous. The Jewiſh ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers were charged, not with loving the praiſe of men; but, that they loved it "more than the praiſe of God." When vain glory, uſurps the throne of a man's heart, the eye of his mind is turned from the ends, which it ought, chiefly, to keep in view, and there is no crime which he will not commit, to inſure his own aggrandizement. While ſuch a character, will ſet himſelf up for ſale,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:033348_0039_0FF6D060D4BE93D0"/>
to do evil, virtue and worth, will never cry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, like courtezans, in market; they bluſh at the thought of ſoliciting notice. If the ſplendor of office, dazzles the unthinking, and unprincipled, it has, in itſelf, few charms to the upright, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative. The freedom of retirement, was long ſighed for by that faithful ſervant of the public, who has juſtly been denominated, "the father of his country." The pious, and humble, are more anxious to improve the talents they have, than to be credited with more; they connect the retribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of eternity, with the uſe, or abuſe of a poſt of honor. Hence they are ever modeſt, and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and go into place from a ſenſe of duty, rather than from the thirſt of diſtinction. And, while aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring thiſtles are trode down of every wild beaſt, theſe choice cedars, cleave to their native ſoil, and,
either gloriouſly keep their ſtation in the ſtorm, or fall with all the leafy honors of the foreſt at their ſide.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THOSE who ſpeak of great reforms in gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernments, already free and happy, are dangerous characters. "While we ſet under the ſhade of our own laws," ſays a nervous writer,<note n="*" place="bottom">The Looker-On. Paſſim.</note> "and feel all the cheriſhing benignity of our own government, it is fair almoſt to look with diſtruſt and prejudice,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:033348_0040_0FF6D063332EA940"/>
on all projects of change whatever. When the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>price of innovation, and the indefinite love of polit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical novelty, gets abroad, it always ends in blood. The mildeſt profeſſions and projects of reform, are, at this time, only the firſt ſteps of the ſcale of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, the initiative forms of that towering fab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic of miſchief, of which they meditate in their hearts. That liberty, which has been the ſtate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of change in free governments, has been ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſive of all freedom: as it affords to factious leaders, a language unintelligibly impoſing, and rich in the unideal terms of raving philoſophy. In times of ſeditious machinations, let us cleave to our religion, and our conſtitution, as the refuge of our hopes, as the haven and anchorage of freedom. The preſent moment calls rather for reſtraints on licentiouſneſs, than control of power. If we are virtuous and firm, little is to be feared from thoſe knots of ſpeculating politicians, who would open the flood-gates of foreign intrigue, and whelm us in the billows of tempeſtuous liberty.</p>
            <p n="4">4. FROM the ſtriking reſemblance between the firſt author of faction, and his ſubordinates, among men; we learn, that the objections againſt good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man governments, and the divine government, are the ſame, of courſe, that the intereſts of pure chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity, and real civil liberty, are intimately blend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:033348_0041_0FF6D0659F4DAC00"/>
The grand object of the great ſeducer, is to weaken the confidence of creatures, in the Divine Executive. To make them believe, that "he is an hard and auſtere maſter, reaping where he has not ſowed, and gathering where he has not ſtrawed." That he has no right, to do ſo abſolutely, "as he will with his own."</p>
            <p>THAT, his governing by plan, or "fore-ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whatſoever comes to paſs," his taking the praiſe to himſelf, of their formation to good ſubjects, and citizens, and not leaving it to the ſtrength of their own natural principles, abridges human liberty. They think they cannot be free, while the head of government, by an exertion of power gives complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion to their habits, and keeps them through con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in his rectitude unto ſalvation.</p>
            <p>THAT he errs as to what ought to be ſupremely loved and worſhipped. God declares, as he is the ſum of public good, he has the ſole and unalienable right to the ſupreme affection of his creatures, and that it is highly ſinful in them to beſtow it on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. But creatures, miſtaking the habits of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, for nature and reaſon, lay claim to an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual prerogative, and affirm, that "the potter hath" not "power over the clay, to make a veſſel" to any thing but "honor." And that they have a natural right, to ſay "What doſt thou? and, Why
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:033348_0042_0FF6D067DEAE6A78"/>
doſt thou thus?" It ſeems a ſtretch of power in God, to "give none account of any of his matters." And it is the united decree of all his diſcontented ſubjects; "We will not have" God "to rule over us," in this imperious and ſovereign manner.<note n="*" place="bottom">Luke xix. 14.</note> Nay, it is carried without a diſſenting voice, by all the partiſans of the father of lies, that there ſhall be "No God:"<note n="†" place="bottom">Pſal. xiv I.</note> No ſupremely perfect, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable law; no penalties of perpetual impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for men's doing as they pleaſe; Hell, like a Baſtile of deſpotiſm, has public conſent to be demol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed, or be converted into a penitentiary, and all the luſts are to be manumitted by the majeſty of the people. I ſhould not dare treat theſe grave truths in this manner, did I not feel it to be of importance, to impreſs this audience with the ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſemblance there is between the objections that are made, againſt that ſyſtem of divine government revealed in the ſcriptures, and good human govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The popular notions of oppoſing human gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernments, altho' in many inſtances juſt, need not paſs for any thing new, or originally pure in the heart of man. However, I hope none will conſtrue this, as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencing a heart unfriendly to civil liberty. No, let every tyrant, whatever name or garb he may aſſume, be brought to the duſt, and the oppreſſed of every nation, hew the chains unneceſſarily impoſed, "link from link." But let them take heed how they ſtrike
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:033348_0043_0FF6D06A20CF6DE8"/>
at the prerogatives of the Moſt High. Contending with the Almighty, will not "inſtruct him." And he that reproveth God, muſt anſwer it. That which has been done by wicked men, ever ſince the apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, againſt the king of heaven, is now doing againſt good government. Satan, in every ſhape, ſtill ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears "an angel of light," and would, if it were poſſible, deceive the very elect. The grand object of that fungous growth of mock patriotiſm, which is generated and nouriſhed by the benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſunſhine of real liberty, has been to deſtroy ſyſtems of human good, and to arm vice againſt virtue, confuſion againſt order, and licentiouſneſs againſt law. To cut the nerves of wholeſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, to bring into contempt thoſe, who are "miniſters of God for good," to the righteous, and lead "all the world a wondering after ſome beastſ" of human imagination. The materials of oppoſition, the manner in which they have been brought to act, and the general iſſue in both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, as it reſpects God, and the good ruler, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways have, and always will be the ſame. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho,' "order will eventually ſpring out of confuſion, and light out of darkneſs;" theſe addreſſes to men's paſſions, this flattery of their prejudices, this miſtating and diſcolouring of facts, this humour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the taſte of the age, are excluſively, thoſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines of Apollyon, which "brought death into our
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:033348_0044_0FF6D06C82FAD528"/>
world and all our woe." Theſe have made the earth, an Aceldema, and a Golgotha, and portend the torments of the factious and ſeditious, in a world, where mad, ferocious, and unchecked democracy, will forever reign in all its fiery horrors.</p>
            <p n="5">5. IF the divine government, and free, benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, human inſtitutions, are ſo connected in princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and practice, if they have the ſame objects, and the ſame enemies, infidels in religion, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with themſelves, ſhould they become the enemies of good government; and thoſe who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs chriſtianity, and oppoſe ſuch government, ought juſtly to be numbered with infidels. For, "What concord hath Chriſt with Belial? or, What part hath he that believeth, with an infidel? and vice verſa. Thoſe who oppoſe governments of energy, ground their theories on the innocence, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectibility of human nature, on the ſufficiency of man's natural light, for the purpoſes of attaining virtue and happineſs, without external aid; and attribute all the ills, that have befallen men, to gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment and religion. If this be true, government, that has power, is an evil, and religion, that aids ſuch power, is a ſcourge.</p>
            <p>To uphold government, while infidels at heart, and revere religion, only as an engine of civil pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icy,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:033348_0045_0FF6D06ECC870800"/>
is a ſeverer cenſure of human nature, than is given in the ſcriptures. Altho' men, in the ſacred canon, are called fools in a moral ſenſe, they are never called ſo in a natural ſenſe. But the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del, upholding energetic government, and praiſing religion, only, as its convenient beaſt of burden, brands the whole race as idiots, of courſe, ſaps his own favourite dignity of human nature, and the ſufficiency of human light. Indeed, whatever way we turn, there will be a palpable abſurdity, between the love of ſtrength in government, and the hatred of religion; and the love of religion, and the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of ſtrength in government. As a ſenſe of moral obligation, muſt be greatly impaired before men are fitted to oppoſe ſuch a government of their own making, we hence find all zealous diſorgan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>izers, ſomewhere on that climax of error, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, in what is called, modern liberality in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ſentiment, and ends in Atheiſm. And, with very few exceptions, we find all thoſe who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and embrace the religion of the fathers, or what have been called the leading doctrines of the chriſtian church, "obedient to the powers that are," reverencing good magiſtrates, loving, and cleaving to their country, "for conſcience ſake." Why every infidel does not oppoſe a government of reſtraints, muſt be, that he either does not know its tendency, or is ignorant of his own heart, and what manner of ſpirit it is that actuates him. He
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:033348_0046_0FF6D07114741D50"/>
is bewildered, and has loſt the company congenial to his ſoul; or he is a living argument in favor of the worth, and truth of chriſtianity, by wiſhing to live under the mild influence of its habits, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</p>
            <p>I AM called to ſpeak, on this occaſion, at an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventful period, and at an eventful criſis, with this country. Altho' I glory in the character of the ſtate which gave me birth, admire the diffuſion of her knowledge, her habits of order, and her bleſſed inſtitutions, I dare not defy the faſcinating charms of innovation. Vice, and irreligion, have earth, and hell on their ſide, and are the mortal foes of that ſymmetrical edifice, which was reared by the pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful labours, and has continued, hitherto, by the prayers of our anceſtors. Infidelity, with a zeal that would become a better cauſe, and with the rigour of St. Dominic, is encompaſſing ſea, and land, to make its proſelytes; of whom, when made, it may be truly ſaid, as of thoſe converted to a proud and haughty Jewiſh ſect, they are "two fold more the children of hell."</p>
            <p>IF the mountains, and uninviting ſoil of Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerland, have not been ſufficient "walls and bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks," to ſave her from the rapacity of marauding ſtrangers, let us not boaſt of ſafety from an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening ocean. Satan, intent on miſchief, could

ſpread a bridge on chaos, to mar the happineſs of paradiſe, and ſow ſedition. Were we virtuous, and united, we ſhould, under providence, have nothing to fear. But the ſhameful ſecret, that our country has its parricides, is <hi>out,</hi> and our enemies caſt it in our teeth. A military deſpotiſm, under the vile pretence of giving freedom to mankind, has once plundered the world, and may again. If our moſt intelligent divines, have underſtood the prophecies, little is to be expected for a century, or more, than "the diſtreſs of nations, with perplexity, the ſea, and the waves roaring; men's hearts failing them for fear; as the Lord, in his glory, and majeſty, has ariſen to ſhake terribly the earth." After looking to God, the eyes of good men are next turned to virtuous rulers, the genuine, tried, and approved friends of the government, religion, and happineſs of their country.</p>
            <p>No lover of his country's true glory, can turn his eye to yonder empty ſeat, without exclaiming, "Help Lord, for the Godly man ceaſeth: for the faithful fail from among the children of men." While every breeze from the Atlantic, bears on its wings the encreaſed rumour of war, and trouble, this ſtate have had to lament, in quick ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the death of a worthy Governor, an able Chief Juſtice, and a venerable Father in the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel miniſtry.</p>

            <p>BUT, I truſt in God, that he has ſtill left us ſome faithful helmſmen, who, for a time at leaſt, will ſteer us from the ſhores, whitened with human bones, and guide us through the rocks of Syren liberty. Of modern liberty; that harpy, who, like the fabled daughters of Oceanus, and Terra, has hooked claws, and looks pale for plunder; that propheteſs of evil, who takes her ſeat on deſolation, taints the viands of ſocial life with her defiling touch; than which, no monſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is more fell, no plague, or ſcourge of gods more cruel, ever iſſued from the Stygian waves.<note n="*" place="bottom">Virgil.</note> But hold! "Michael diſputing with the devil, durſt not bring againſt him a railing accuſation, but ſaid, the Lord rebuke thee." While all the horrors of faction, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy, are developed by the ſacred ſtory to which we have been attending, we have a counterpart in the conduct of David, and his friends. They ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the hand, which, in ſuch an awful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, chaſtized a nation's, and its ruler's ſins. They wept aloud, not for the fear of man, but through reverence and fear of that God, who was viſibly puniſhing them. Their hearts were ſoft and peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. They pitied and forgave their enemies, and,
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:033348_0049_0FF6D07818D87558"/>
with the enlarged views of chriſtians, looked up to God, "who makes the wrath of man to praiſe him," and will ſuffer it proceed no farther, than is compatible with his wiſe, and holy counſels. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of humouring the thirſt of innovation, they clung to their ancient inſtitutions, for political or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and ſafety.</p>
            <p>SUBMITTING to the ſtones, and dirt, the railing, and ſlanderous curſes of apoſtate, and diſcontented Shimeis, it behoves both rulers, and ruled, with all modeſty, to inquire, wherefore it is, that "the Lord hath bidden" them. Have we not reaſon to fear, that theſe are the fruits of ſecret infidelity, in the deſk? and of ſecret, and open infidelity in the ſenate? Is it not owing to breaches, plauſibly made in our ancient habits, and cuſtoms, thoſe walls of our ſheepfold, that theſe wolves are entering? Have we no Joabs, grown haughty, and negligent, by long continuance in office, no negligent, ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate miniſters of juſtice? I pray God, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed day of faſting, humiliation, and prayer, may be devoutly kept. And that all good citizens, for once, with Godly ſorrow for ſin, will bend their knees around the altar of prayer, for their country. If "God is for us who can be againſt us?" And if he is againſt us who can be for us? His protection alone, is a nation's ſtrength. He is "the God of
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:033348_0050_0FF6D07A55141288"/>
wiſdom" and the God of battles. Let our hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourable legiſlators remember, that it is emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally true of men in high ſtations, that, "one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner deſtroyeth much good," and much depends on them, whether dignity, and influence, are to be giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to vice, and irreligion. Altho' the mouth of diſcontented ambition can never be ſtopped, and the querulous tongue of licentiouſneſs, will never reſt, until the grandeur of a government ſhall be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veiled, which will impoſe ſilence on all lips, it is important, that you "let not your good be evil ſpoken of," and give none "occaſion to the enemies of the Lord, to blaſpheme." The cauſe of Chriſtianity has been more ably argued by recent events in Europe, than it can be by the pen, or tongue of man. While infidelity has been writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its inferences in blood, we muſt view it as an happy omen, to this and the neighbouring States, that ſo many young riſing characters, have been driven from the open and expoſed fields of ſcepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm, to the faſtneſſes of moral inſtitutions. May their ſpeculative converſion, be followed by a change of heart, and they experience thoſe conſolations in the religion of Jeſus, which have ever proved a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, a light, and a ſhield to pious rulers, under the honor and dignity, as well as the ſufferings and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of office. As the chriſtian religion is the genius, the life, and ſpirit of real liberty, and the
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:033348_0051_0FF6D07C99646D60"/>
true foundation of national happineſs and greatneſs, let its miniſters glory in their profeſſion. If ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of us are ſtraitened in temporalities, and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached as hirelings by the licentious, let us not be diſcouraged. Patriotiſm, as well as love to God and men, call us to fidelity in our noble employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Liberty, exiled from Europe, croſſed the Atlantic with our predeceſſors in office, and under their tutelage, ſhe here erected her ſtandard. Our rulers can frame free conſtitutions, and enact mild and wholeſome laws, but they muſt apply to us, as inſtruments in the hands of providence, to make wholeſome inhabitants, and form a free people. Sin ſtains the glory, darkens the luſtre, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grades the rank of rational creatures. All men, who know not the glorious "liberty of the ſons of God," are by nature ſlaviſh, and will have a maſter. A knight-errant may ſtrike from the hands and feet of our body, the ſhackles of deſpotic power, or the Conqueror of Italy can ſay a nation is free; and yet, they may be bound in chains, which defy the ſteel of valor to ſever, and the united "wiſdom of this world' to unlooſe. The chains of the ſoul, the fetters of the mind and heart, do not melt at human touch; the Lord hath anointed us alone, to proclaim liberty to ſuch captives, and the opening of the doors to theſe vaſſals impriſoned of their ſins. "Seeing that many glory after the fleſh, I truſt

good men will bear with us a little in our folly, if we glory alſo."</p>

            <p>FINALLY, and to cloſe—The whole ſubject may with propriety be addreſſed to thoſe who "deſpiſe government, and are not afraid to ſpeak evil of dignities." And of theſe, I hope, there are few in this numerous aſſemby. It is to be acknowledged, that many plauſible things can be ſaid in favor of error, and that man is, by nature, fonder of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs than light. Still, can you ſuppoſe, granting that you can inflate the world with the temporary phrenzy of infidel fanaticiſm, that it will be laſting; or that human nature, will of itſelf, lay aſide a char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter it has uniformly maintained for ſix thouſand years, of finally "turning and rending," thoſe who impoſe on its credulity. There may be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries where nothing would be loſt, and every thing gained by ſubverting and palſying the government. But no man whoſe conſcience is not "ſeared as with a hot iron," can apply this to our own. If the firſt great enemy of government, and all who have followed his ſteps, have loſt themſelves in the miſts of enchantment they have raiſed, it is worth while to count the coſt, before that, with induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous malignancy, you attempt to raiſe one in this enlightened State. Should you, as Vreede and Hooffe, thoſe excluſive Dutch patriots, fawn like

ſpaniels at the feet of our oppreſſors, for troops to ſtrangle your country with liberty:<note n="*" place="bottom">See the Herald of March 10, 1797.</note> we are neither a nation vitiated by long continued commerce, nor effeminate Italians. It would be attended with not a little difficulty, to make us, like wretched Venice, the mere cents and milles of partitioning powers. If you have any poſſeſſions that are dear to you, can you expect them to be inviolate, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt the jarring elements of univerſal uproar? As you may yet fail, to ſpring up Tetrarchs and Proconſuls, from the aſhes of your humbled and divided country, and the blood of her citizens, leave that low and baſe thirſt of fame, that craves thoſe honors from foreigners, which you are too vicious and too indolent to merit from your own fellow-citizens. Pray be as honorable as ambitious Caeſar, who had rather be firſt in a village, than ſecond in the city of Rome—caſt away the bitter leaven of party ſpirit. "Repent of this thy wickedneſs" towards thy mother country, on whoſe lap thou haſt been dandled, and from whoſe breaſts thou haſt drawn the ſtamina of life; "and pray God if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.—"Now to the God of peace;"—"to the God of order, and not of confuſion"—Be glory forever.</p>
