         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE good Education of Youth has been eſteemed by wiſe Men in all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, as the ſureſt Foundation of the Happineſs both of private Families and of Common-wealths. Almoſt all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have therefore made it a principal Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of their Attention, to eſtabliſh and endow with proper Revenues, ſuch Seminaries of Learning, as might ſupply the ſucceeding Age with Men qualified to ſerve the Publick with Honour to themſelves, and to their Country.<note place="bottom">
                  <p>As ſome Things here propos'd may be found to differ a little from the Forms of Education in common Uſe, the following Quotations are to ſhew the Opinions of ſeveral learned Men, who have carefully conſidered and wrote expreſly on the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; ſuch as <hi>Milton, Locke, Rollin, Turnbull,</hi> and others. They generally complain, that the <hi>old Method</hi> is in many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects wrong; but long ſettled Forms are not eaſily changed. For us, who are now to make a Beginning, 'tis, at leaſt, as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy to ſet out right as wrong; and therefore their Sentiments are on this Occaſion well worth our Conſideration.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Rollin</hi> ſays <hi>(Belles Lett. p.</hi> 249. ſpeaking of the Manner of Educating Youth) "Though it be generally a very wiſe and judicious Rule to avoid all Singularity, and to follow the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Cuſtoms, yet I queſtion whether, in the Point we now treat of, this Principle does not admit of ſome Exception, and whether we ought not to apprehend the Dangers and Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies of blindly following the Footſteps of thoſe who have gone before us, ſo as to conſult <hi>Cuſtom</hi> more than <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning our Actions rather by what others <hi>do,</hi> than by what they <hi>ſhould do</hi>; from whence it often happens, that an Error once eſtabliſhed is handed down from Age to Age, and becomes almoſt a certain Law, from a Notion, that we ought to act like the reſt of Mankind, and follow the Example of the greateſt Number. But human Nature is not ſo happy as to have the greateſt Number always make the beſt Choice, and we too frequently obſerve the contrary."</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:006321_0005_1028A063D46B9D88"/>Many of the firſt Settlers of theſe Provinces, were Men who had received a good Education in <hi>Europe,</hi> and to their Wiſdom and good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement we owe much of our preſent Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. But their Hands were full, and they could not do all Things. The preſent Race are not thought to be generally of equal Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: For though the <hi>American</hi> Youth are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd not to want Capacity; yet the beſt Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities require Cultivation, it being truly with them, as with the beſt Ground, which unleſs well tilled and ſowed with profitable Seed, produces only ranker Weeds.</p>
            <p>That we may obtain the Advantages ariſing from an Increaſe of Knowledge, and prevent as much as may be the miſchievous Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that would attend a general Ignorance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, the following <hi>Hints</hi> are offered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards forming a Plan for the Education of the Youth of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> viz.</p>
            <p>It is propos'd,</p>
            <p>THAT ſome Perſons of Leiſure and publick Spirit, apply for a CHARTER, by which they may be incorporated, with Power to erect an ACADEMY for the Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:006321_0006_1028A056B8054B18"/>
on of Youth, to govern the ſame, provide Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, make Rules, receive Donations, purchaſe Lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to add to their Number, from Time to Time ſuch other Perſons as they ſhall judge ſuitable.</p>
            <p>That the Members of the Corporation make it their Pleaſure, and in ſome Degree their Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, to viſit the Academy often, encourage and <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Rollin,</hi> Vol. 2. p. 371. mentions a <hi>French</hi> Gentleman, Monſ. <hi>Herſan,</hi> who, "at his own Expence, built a School for the Uſe of poor Children, one of the fineſt in the Kingdom; and left a Stipend for the Maſter. That he himſelf taught them very often, and generally had ſome of them at his Table. He clothed ſeveral of them; and diſtributed Rewards among them from Time to Time, in order to encourage then to ſtudy."</note> countenance the Youth, countenance and aſſiſt the Maſters, and by all Means in their Power advance the Uſefulneſs and Reputation of the Deſign; that they look on the Students as in ſome Sort their Children, treat them with Familiarity and Affection, and when they have behav'd well, and gone through their Studies, and are to enter the World, zealouſly unite, and make all the Intereſt that can be made to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh them <note n="‡" place="bottom">Something ſeems wanting in <hi>America</hi> to incite and ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Youth to Study. In <hi>Europe</hi> the Encouragements to Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are of themſelves much greater than can be given here. Whoever diſtinguiſhes himſelf there, in either of the three learned Profeſſions, gains Fame, and often Wealth and Power: A poor Man's Son has a Chance, if he ſtudies hard, to riſe, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Law or the Church, to gainful Offices or Benefices; to an extraordinary Pitch of Grandeur; to have a Voice in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, a Seat among the Peers; as a Stateſman or firſt Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to govern Nations, and even to mix his Blood with Princes.</note>, whether in Buſineſs, Offices, Marriages, or any other Thing for their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:006321_0007_1028A06906AE4038"/>
preferably to all other Perſons what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever even of equal Merit.</p>
            <p>And if Men may, and frequently do, catch ſuch a Taſte for cultivating Flowers, for Plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Grafting, Inoculating, and the like, as to deſpiſe all other Amuſements for their Sake, why may not we expect they ſhould acquire a Reliſh for that <hi>more uſeful</hi> Culture of young Minds. <hi>Thompſon</hi> ſays,
<q>
                  <l>'Tis Joy to ſee the human Bloſſoms blow,</l>
                  <l>When infant Reaſon grows apace, and calls</l>

                     <hi>Drawing</hi> is a kind of Univerſal Language, underſtood by all Nations. A Man may often expreſs his Ideas, even to his own Countrymen, more clearly with a Lead Pencil, or Bit of Chalk, than with his Tongue. And many can underſtand a Figure, that do not comprehend a Deſcription in Words, tho' ever ſo properly choſen.

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> ſays, p. 234. "When your Son can write well and quick, I think it may be convenient not only to continue the Exerciſe of his Hand in Writing, but alſo to improve the Uſe of it further in <hi>Drawing</hi>; a Thing very uſeful to a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman on ſeveral Occaſions; but eſpecially if he travel; as that which helps a Man often to expreſs in a <hi>few Lines</hi> well put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, what a <hi>whole Sheet of Paper in Writing</hi> would not be able to repreſent and make intelligible.

I do not mean that I would have him a perfect Painter; to be that to any tolerable Degree, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire more Time than he can ſpare from his other Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of greater Moment. But ſo much Inſight into Perſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and Skill in Drawing, as will enable him to repreſent tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly on Paper any Thing he ſees, except Faces, may, I think, be got in a little Time."</p>

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Locke,</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Grammar,</hi> p. 252. ſays, "That to thoſe the greateſt Part of whoſe Buſineſs in this World is to be done with their Tongues, and with their Pens, it is conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, if not neceſſary, that they ſhould ſpeak properly and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, whereby they may let their Thoughts into other Mens Minds the more eaſily, and with the greater Impreſſion. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Account it is, that any ſort of Speaking, ſo as will make him be underſtood, is not thought enough for a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. He ought to ſtudy <hi>Grammar,</hi> among the other Helps of Speaking well, but it <hi>muſt be</hi> THE GRAMMAR OF HIS OWN TONGUE, of the Language he uſes, that he may underſtand his own Country Speech nicely, and ſpeak it properly, without ſhocking the Ears of thoſe it is addreſſed to with Soleciſms and offenſive Irregularities. And to this Purpoſe <hi>Grammar is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary</hi>; but it is the Grammar <hi>only</hi> of <hi>their own proper Tongues,</hi> and to thoſe who would take Pains in cultivating their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and perfecting their Stiles. Whether all Gentlemen ſhould not do this, I leave to be conſidered, ſince the Want of Propriety and Grammatical Exactneſs is thought very miſbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming one of that Rank, and uſually draws on one guilty of ſuch Faults, the Imputation of having had a lower Breeding and worſe Company than ſuits with his Quality. If this be ſo (as I ſuppoſe it is) it will be Matter of Wonder, why young Gentlemen are forc'd to learn the Grammars of foreign and dead Languages, and are never once told of the Grammar of their own Tongues. They do not ſo much as know there is any ſuch Thing, much leſs is it made their Buſineſs to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in it. Nor is their own Language ever propos'd to them as worthy their Care and Cultivating, tho' they have <hi>dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Uſe</hi> of it, and are not ſeldom, in the future Courſe of their Lives, judg'd of by their handſome or awkward Way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing themſelves in it. Whereas the Languages whoſe Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mars they have been ſo much employed in, are ſuch as proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly they ſhall ſcarce ever ſpeak or write; or if upon Occaſion this ſhould happen, they ſhould be excuſed for the Miſtakes and Faults they make in it. Would not a <hi>Chineſe,</hi> who took No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of this Way of Breeding, be apt to imagine, that all our young Gentlemen were deſigned to be Teachers and Profeſſors of the dead Languages of foreign Countries, and not to be Men of Buſineſs in their own." Page 255. the ſame Author adds, That if Grammar ought to be taught at any Time, it muſt be to one that can ſpeak the Language already; how elſe can he be taught the Grammar of it? This at leaſt is evident from the Practice of the wiſe and learned Nations among the Antients. They made it a <hi>Part of Education</hi> to cultivate <hi>their own,</hi> not foreign Tongues. The <hi>Greeks</hi> counted all other Nations barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and had a Contempt for their Languages.

This no Doubt ſaved them very much Time; but they <hi>applied themſelves carefully</hi> to the Study of <hi>their own</hi> Language, and were <hi>early</hi> able to ſpeak and write it in <hi>the greateſt Perfection.</hi> The <hi>Roman</hi> Youth, though they learned the <hi>Greek,</hi> did not neglect their own Tongue, but ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died it more carefully than we now do <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> without giving ourſelves any Trouble about our own Tongue."</p>

It is very remote from the Precepts I have mentioned. Hath the Child arrived to ſix or ſeven Years of Age, he mixes with a Herd of ill-bred Boys at School, where under the Pretext of Teaching him <hi>Latin,</hi> no Regard is had to his <hi>Mother Tongue.</hi> And what happens? What we ſee every Day. A young Gentleman of eighteen, who has had this Education, CANNOT READ. For to articu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the Words and join them together, I do not call <hi>Reading,</hi> unleſs one can pronounce well, obſerve all the proper Stops, vary the Voice, expreſs the Sentiments, and read with a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Intelligence. Nor can he ſpeak a Jot better. A Proof of this is, that he cannot write ten Lines without committing groſs Faults; and becauſe he did not learn his own Language well in his early Years, he will never know it well. I except a few, who being afterwards engaged by their Profeſſion, or their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Taſte, cultivate their Minds by Study. And yet even they, if they attempt to write, will find by the <hi>Labour</hi> Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition coſts them, what a <hi>Loſs it is,</hi> not to have learned their Language in the proper Seaſon. Education among the <hi>Romans</hi> was upon a quite different Footing. Maſters of Rhetoric taught them early the Principles, the Difficulties, the Beauties, the Subtleties, the Depths, the Riches of their own Language.

And would it not be very unreaſonable to require of a learned Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Schoolmaſter (who has all the Tropes and Figures in <hi>Farna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi>'s Rhetorick at his Finger's Ends) to teach his Scholar to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs himſelf handſomely in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> when it appears to be ſo little his Buſineſs or Thought, that the Boy's Mother (deſpiſed, 'tis like, as illiterate for not having read a Syſtem of Logic or Rhetoric) outdoes him in it?</p>
                  <p>"To ſpeak and write correctly, gives a Grace, and gains a favourable Attention to what one has to ſay: And ſince 'tis <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> that an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> will have conſtant Uſe of, that is the Language he ſhould chiefly cultivate, and wherein moſt Care ſhould be taken to poliſh and perfect his Stile. To ſpeak or write better <hi>Latin</hi> than <hi>Engliſh,</hi> may make a Man be talk'd of, but he will find it more to his Purpoſe to expreſs himſelf well in his own Tongue, that he uſes every Moment, than to have the vain Commendation of others for a very inſignificant Quality. This I find univerſally neglected, nor no Care taken any where to improve young Men in their own Language, that they may thoroughly underſtand and be Maſters of it. If any one among us have a Facility or Purity more than ordinary in his Mother Tongue, it is owing to Chance, or his Genius, or any Thing, rather than to his Education, or any Care of his Teacher. To mind what <hi>Engliſh</hi> his Pupil ſpeaks or writes, is below the Dignity of one bred up among <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> tho' he have but little of them himſelf. Theſe are the Learned Languages, fit only for Learned Men to meddle with and teach: <hi>Engliſh</hi> is the Language of the illiterate Vulgar. Though the Great Men among the <hi>Romans</hi> were daily exerciſing themſelves in their own Language; and we find yet upon Record the Names of Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors who taught ſome of their Emperors <hi>Latin,</hi> tho' it were their Mother Tongue. 'Tis plain the <hi>Greeks</hi> were yet more nice in theirs. All other Speech was barbarous to them but their own, and no foreign Language appears to have been ſtudied or valued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt that learned and acute People; tho' it be paſt Doubt, that they borrowed their Learning and Philoſophy from abroad.</p>
                  <p>I am not here ſpeaking againſt <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin.</hi> I think <hi>Latin</hi> at leaſt ought to be well underſtood by every Gentleman. But whatever foreign Languages a young Man meddles with, that which he ſhould critically ſtudy, and labour to get a Facility, Clearneſs and Elegancy to expreſs himſelf in, ſhould be <hi>his own</hi>; and to this Purpoſe <hi>he ſhould daily be</hi> EXERCISED in it."</p>
                  <p>To the ſame Purpoſe writes a Perſon of eminent Learning in a Letter to Dr. <hi>Turnbull:</hi> "Nothing certainly (ſays he) can be of more Service to Mankind than a right Method of Educating the Youth, and I ſhould be glad to hear —— to give an Example of the great Advantage it would be to the <hi>riſing Age,</hi> and to our Nation.

Every one is ſuffer'd to form his Stile by Chance; to imitate the firſt wretched Model which falls in his Way, before he knows what is faulty, or can reliſh the Beauties of a juſt Simplicity. Few think their Children qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a Trade till they have been whipt at a <hi>Latin</hi> School for five or ſix Years, to learn a little of that which they are oblig'd to forget; when in thoſe Years right Education would have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd their Minds, and taught them to acquire Habits of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>their own Language</hi> eaſily under right Direction; and this would have been uſeful to them as long as they lived," <hi>Introd. p.</hi> 3, 4, 5.</p>

The End of Maſters, in the long Courſe of their Studies, is to habituate their Scholars to ſerious Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Mind, to make them love and value the Sciences, and to cultivate in them ſuch a Taſte, as ſhall make them thirſt after them when they are gone from School; to point out the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of attaining them; and make them thoroughly ſenſible of their Uſe and Value; and by that Means diſpoſe them for the different Employments to which it ſhall pleaſe God to call them.
