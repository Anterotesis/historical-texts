            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IF the ſcheme of the covenant of grace be true, in the light in which I have handled it, the importance of ſomething of this kind, will I preſume, be a ſufficient apology for my undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; provided I had been able to do it in a good form. As to the form, I ſhall only ſay, I have been ſo ſtraitened in time, that I could hardly think of any thing but matter, not manner.</p>
            <p>If this ſcheme is not true, I can only tell the world I thought it was true; and though this is a poor way of apologizing for error; yet it is as good as any I can make; and there are but few can make a better apology, not only for what they do and ſay, but write too, in many caſes; if they can ſo good. If any are diſpoſed to think it not true, who yet count themſelves able to refute it; I ſhall take it very unkind, not to attempt it: But whoever ſhall attempt to refute this general ſcheme of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace, I beg will conſider well the affair; for it he don't convince me, he may expect, if God ſpare me long enough, I ſhall endeavour to rack his thoughts, let who will be tortured by it. Such a ſcheme promiſes too much advantage, to be eaſily ſubmitted; though every thing untrue, ought to ſubmit. I beg all ſocieties will endeavour to weigh what has been ſaid, without prejudice, as much as may be; and ſubſcribe myſelf, a friend and well-wiſher to each of you.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>ITH reſpect to the grace of the covenant: I uſe the word <hi>Grace,</hi> to ſignify <hi>freely,</hi> and ſo to exclude merit, or the deſert of the Creature, (which I underſtand to be the common acceptation of the word grace in Divinity) now there are but two ways of meriting or deſerving that I know of, which are diſtinguiſhed into <hi>Condignity</hi> and <hi>Congruity:</hi> Merit of condignity is the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving as much, or doing as much for any thing as it is worth, therefore this kind of <hi>merit</hi> never had any place in religion; for who among moſt perfect creatures, even of the celeſtial order, could give or do as much for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and glory as they are worth? or who among the guilty race of fallen men, can do as much for God, as
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:008874_0004_103093A7C99FD630"/>to deſerve his own juſtification? or that God ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veil his perfections to him, and grant him the free com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications of his love and mercy, and the gratifying enjoyment of himſelf? which is but an early heaven, an earneſt upon earth, of that full inheritance above.</p>
            <p>Merit o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> 
               <hi>congruity</hi> is only deſerving any thing in order of fitneſs or agreeableneſs; hence when God created men and angels, in knowledge, righteouſneſs, and true holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, capable to ſerve and honour him perfectly; it was but fit or ſuitable to diſplay his glory and perfections to them, and promiſe them the full enjoyment of himſelf in an eternal heavenly ſtate, correſpondent to their ſerving him perfectly as probationers for a time. Now this merit of <hi>congruity</hi> was the condition of the firſt covenant, but hath no place in the ſecond, or covenant of <hi>grace:</hi> for ſuch defilement, imperfection, and iniquity, cleaves to the beſt of our ſervices, as renders it intirely unſuitable, that the <hi>doers of them ſhould be juſtified</hi> or ſaved on their account: on the contrary, we deſerve eternal dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation for their in perfections: hence <hi>without ſhedding of blood is no remiſſion, and heavenly things muſt be purified. Heb</hi> ix. 22, 23. Agreeable to the ancient repreſentation of Chriſt by the high prieſt. <hi>Exo.</hi> xxviii, 38. <hi>That Aaron may bear the iniquity of the holy things, which the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael ſhall hallow in all their holy gifts,</hi> &amp;c. Now if every poſſible way of meriting, be excluded (as we ſee) from the covenant of grace, juſtification and ſalvation, (as to any thing we can do) muſt be freely beſtowed, as is declared, <hi>Rom.</hi> iii 24. <hi>Being juſtified freely by his grace;</hi> and vi. 23. <hi>The gift of God is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life.</hi> And if the gift of God is eternal life, ſurely eternal life is God's gift; and what can be more free than a gift? Suppoſe, when the ſecond covenant was made with <hi>Adam,</hi> and in him with his poſterity, they had (for the time enſuing) been rendered capable to ſerve God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, ſo that it would have been congruous to give them heaven on that account, (which is far from the true ſtate of things) yet ſuch a covenant could not be a covenant of
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:008874_0005_103093A976E9B958"/>grace, but of debt, and what could compenſate for time paſs'd, and injuries done? A ſervant whoſe time and whole ability is due to his maſter, can never make up black days, or compenſate for injuries. Hence, it became infinitely reaſonable, that the new covenant ſhould exclude every kind of merit, and be founded upon another cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, viz. that of redemption; which is a covenant to repair breaches, and demands the taking of life, ſhedding of blood, and a complete ſatisfaction for injuries done to infinite honours; which ſatisfaction, the life and blood of all mere creatures, could not make in a finite time; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt be the blood of the ſon of God, who is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as a <hi>Lamb ſlain from the foundation of the world. Rev.</hi> xiii. 8. Here God appoints himſelf another ſeed (not inſtead of <hi>Abel</hi> whom <hi>Cain</hi> ſlew, but) inſtead of <hi>Adam,</hi> whom the <hi>Devil</hi> ſlew: hence, when the ſecond covenant was made with <hi>Adam,</hi> and in him with his poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, as he was made a foederal or covenant father, this ſeed is ſpoken of, as one to bruiſe the ſerpent's head, whoſe blood is the foundation upon which a covenant of grace can be made with man; hence called <hi>the blood of the covenant or teſtament. Luke</hi> xxii. 20. <hi>Heb.</hi> ix. 20. <hi>Ex.</hi> xxiv. 8.</p>
            <p>Secondly. I was to ſhew, that all men are included in this covenant: And in order to this,</p>
            <p n="1">1. I obſerve, that this covenant was eſtabliſhed to and with <hi>Adam;</hi> for it was made immediately after the fall, before <hi>Adam</hi> had a ſon, as appears <hi>Gen</hi> iii. 15. Now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſome ſuppoſe, when the covenant of grace was made, all was paſs'd by but the elect; yet I have never underſtood that thoſe perſons held <hi>Adam</hi> to be paſs'd by, as a non-elect; but that it has generally been believed he was of the choſen, and was ſaved. Now it appears alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unreaſonable to me, to ſuppoſe, that God would chooſe him who had betrayed ſo great a truſt, and done ſuch infinite injury to God and his own poſterity, and paſs by ſome of his poſterity, who had only ſinned in
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:008874_0006_103093AC51043B50"/>his repreſentation: chooſe the ruiner, and paſs'd by the ruined. Surely ſuch are not the moſt grateful repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of him, who declares <hi>he has no pleaſure in the death of a ſinner!</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It appears infinitely reaſonable to me to ſuppoſe, (that as <hi>Adam</hi> had ſuſtained ſo great a relation to his poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity in the firſt covenant, as to be their repreſentative for life and death, heaven and hell, and had actually ruin'd them all) when God condeſcends to covenant with him again, that if it be poſſible, God will give him ſome ſuch relation to his poſterity, as ſhall let him ſee, they are not damn'd barely on his account; and nothing ſhort of making him a foederal father, could make ſuch a diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very to him; for as there can be but one covenant of grace, ſo if that doth not propoſe, and promiſe ſalvation to his ſeed (who are yet unborn) as well as to himſelf, he can ſee no way for their ſalvation at all: And O how gloomy and melancholy a conſideration muſt be inferred, if <hi>Adam</hi> underſtood the covenant as many do in theſe days! <hi>ſci.</hi> that the greater part of his poſterity was paſs'd by in making the covenant, reprobated, and left to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in a ruin that himſelf had brought upon them. Such a ſtate of things, ſeems to be hardly conſiſtent with the comfort of that good man, when we conſider the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of his relation to his poſterity.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But we are ſure it was poſſible for God to make ſuch a covenant with <hi>Adam,</hi> as to confer on his poſterity foederal holineſs, or a new covenant relation of ſonſhip to God; for ſuch a form of covenanting was after exempli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with <hi>Abraham;</hi> and ſurely that form of covenanting was according to the original pattern. The form of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanting with <hi>Abraham,</hi> we know, was, that the whole family are included; father, ſon, ſervant born in his houſe, or bought with his money of the ſtranger, <hi>Gen.</hi> xvii 12, 13. The unborn ſeed of both are included in the covenant, and if they are not dealt with as ſuch, the covenant was null and void with reſpect to them, ver. 14. Yea, the females are incovenanted with the males,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:008874_0007_103093B05F306000"/>(as I could abundantly prove, was it denied) tho' inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the formal external ratification of the covenant by circumciſion. I ſhall ſay no more at preſent, but that the females in <hi>Iſra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l</hi> were ever treated as God's co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant people; and the daughters might not marry with the uncircumciſed. <hi>Gen.</hi> xxxiv. 14. Now that God did ſo covenant with <hi>Adam,</hi> as to include all his poſterity, will appear, if we conſider a few things.
<list>
                  <item>1. That we have no Hint of any covenant made with <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſeed, <hi>ſci. Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel;</hi> yet they are God's covenant children; for it belongs to none but ſuch, to uſe the modes of the adminiſtration of the covenant of grace; and offerings and ſacrifices have no relation to any other covenant. We are ſure God inſtituted this ſervice, and enjoined it them either immediately himſelf, or mediately by their fathers, who alone can be ſuppoſed to be their inſtructors in this caſe, as <hi>Gen.</hi> iv. 3, 4.</item>

               <hi>The ſons of God ſaw the daughters of men, that they were fair; and they took them wives of the daughters of men.</hi> By <hi>ſons of God,</hi> can be underſtood no other than <hi>Seth</hi>'s poſterity; and by <hi>daughters of men, Cain</hi>'s; in which account we can't but know, male and female of the former, are God's children, and neither male nor female of the latter; for ſurely it was lawful for the ſons of <hi>Seth</hi> to marry. But if the daughters of <hi>Seth</hi> were not daughters of God alſo, they had none but
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:008874_0008_103093B38CC87DD0"/>daughters of men to marry with; which we ſee was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful: and conſequently, it was as unlawful, for the daughters of God, or of <hi>Seth</hi>'s poſterity, to marry with the ſons of men, or of <hi>Cain</hi>'s poſterity. But how came <hi>Seth</hi>'s poſterity to be children of God, above <hi>Cain</hi>'s? It was not their being regenerated, or their pious and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous living: no, it is the wickedneſs of theſe ſons of God, that is mention'd as the cauſe, why God will deſtroy men from off the earth by a flood, <hi>Gen.</hi> vi. 2, to 13, <hi>and God ſaw that the wickedneſs of man was great in the earth;</hi> while <hi>Noah only was found righteous in his generation,</hi> chap. vii. 1. "Their ſon ſhip therefore above the poſterity of <hi>Cain,</hi> could he no other than a covenant relation from their father <hi>Adam,</hi> which <hi>Cain</hi> and his poſterity had forfeited and loſt, by his <hi>going out from the preſence of the Lord</hi> God was willing <hi>Cain</hi> ſhould have his proper primogeniture, or place of firſt born; which <hi>Cain</hi> ſeemeth to ſuſpect, by the manner of God's ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, <hi>if thou doſt well, ſhalt thou not be accepted? and unto thee ſhall be his deſire, and thou ſhalt rule over him,</hi> Gen. iv. 7. and when <hi>Cain</hi> had ſlain leis brother, God did not excommunicate him, but brands him with going out voluntarily; <hi>Cain went out from the preſence of the Lord,</hi> Gen iv. 16.</p>

After the flood God ſpake to <hi>Noah,</hi> and his ſons with him, ſaying, <hi>and I, behold, I eſtabliſh my covenant with you, and with your ſeed after you,</hi> Gen. ix. 8, 9 Here the ſeed are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, with a covenant eſtabliſhed with them, as fully as with the parents; and what comfortable encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without this, could there be, <hi>to be fruitful, and multiply, and repleniſh the earth?</hi> ver. 1 and 7, or fill it, as the word <hi>repleniſh</hi> ſignifies: and God's bleſſing <hi>Noah</hi> and his ſons, with the ſubjection of beaſts, or a dominion over them, could yield but cold comfort, if their ſeed are not the bleſſed of the Lord with them; but we ſee they were: and here the whole world are the church again; and their ſeed after them, as ver. 9, are all the human creatures that ever ſhall be born.</p>

However, I think the caſe is out of all doubt, from the reaſons and arguments already uſed, that the covenant was made and eſtabliſhed with <hi>Adam,</hi> and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant ſeed; and as all, male and female, are his deſcendants; ſo the covenant of grace includes all, as really as ever the covenant of works did: it is no more a reaſon, that the heathen are not in the covenant of grace, becauſe they receive no actual benefit from it, than it is, that all were not in the covenant of works, becauſe they reap no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. For we ſee, children can as well be bereaved of foederal holineſs, in the covenant of grace, by parents' miſconduct, as of real holineſs in the covenant of works, by the miſconduct of <hi>Adam.</hi>

            <p>Thirdly. I was to ſhew, that the covenant of grace is conditional.</p>
            <p>But before I come directly to the point, I will premiſe a few things.
<list>
                  <item>1. That a covenant muſt exiſt before it can be conditional; therefore, what God doth for man, before a covenant is made with him, cannot be obtained by any condition to be done on man's part; for condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſuppoſe a covenant.</item>
                  <item>2. That a covenant muſt (as it is a compact by which God and men are to conduct themſelves, by obligations) be fairly exhibited, and the terms underſtood, and ſuch as can be complied with, and are ſuitable to be complied with.</item>
                  <item>3. The covenanting parties muſt know they are parties concerned; otherwiſe the covenant is a counterfeit and, cheat.</item>
                  <item>4. A covenant muſt be ratified, or eſtabliſhed, in order to its being obligatory, on the parties concerned. The ſealing of a covenant, cannot be a condition of that covenant, becauſe it is not binding 'till it be ratified: a covenant may be owned and confirmed, and yet not one condition of it ever performed, and all the good condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:008874_0011_103093B9C0A45A38"/>promiſed, forfeited and loſt. There is no doubt but men are under obligations to join themſelves to the Lord in covenant, when God will covenant with them, but theſe obligations ariſe from a natural, and not foederal relation to God.</item>
                  <item>5. That God has ever choſen to treat with men under the bonds of a ſolemn covenant, ratified by oath, or vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſeal, of bot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I now come directly to the proof of the third thing propoſed, viz. That the covenant of grace is conditional. N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>w all muſt allow, that this is the only covenant, in which life and ſalvation is propoſed, and promiſed to any of the children of men; the only covenant in which he treats with them about life and happineſs; and that it is fairly exhibited, and the terms intelligible and reaſonable; that the parties concerned are God and the viſible Church, between both the parties: Hence I query, how are God's covenant people, or the viſible church, to expect life and ſalvation? Are they promis'd <hi>abſolutely</hi> or <hi>conditionally?</hi> To which I anſwer, if they are <hi>abſolutely</hi> promis'd, all
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:008874_0012_103093BF4103DB70"/>in the covenant muſt neceſſarily be ſaved; it is impoſſible to evade this concluſion, from theſe premiſes: but in order to deny the conditionality of the covenant, that I am inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon, it is denied, that any were in the covenant of grace <hi>really,</hi> but only the regenerate; others only <hi>viſibly.</hi> Now if I can prove, that all the <hi>viſible</hi> church, were <hi>really</hi> in covenant, the argument will ſtand in full force. And here I ſhall examine this diſtinction, between <hi>Reality,</hi> and <hi>Viſibility.</hi> To be <hi>viſibly</hi> in covenant, is to be in covenant, ſo as to be ſeen in covenant: but if they are not <hi>really</hi> there, they cannot be ſeen there; and viſible church-memberſhip, is a mere imaginary idea, <hi>i. e.</hi> a nothing. But do not God and men ſee the church really in covenant, <hi>i. e.</hi> the viſible church? or is it only ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious men? who in one breath ſay, they ſee a people in covenant, and their ſeed foederally holy, and in the next they ſee nothing <hi>really.</hi> One might have thought, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe would not be turned quite out of doors, to gratify a miſtake.</p>
            <p>If God tells me, that <hi>viſible</hi> church members, tho' un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate, are in the covenant of grace; I think I do well to believe, he ſaw them <hi>really</hi> there; or muſt I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, he tells me of that which hath no <hi>reality?</hi> God ſaith, the ſons of <hi>Seth</hi> were his ſons <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>urely none will ſay they were regenerate; for <hi>Noah</hi> only was found righteous in that generation, <hi>Gen.</hi> vii. 1. If they were not really in the covenant of grace, they were not really his ſons; for one is as real as the other; and if they were not really in, they were really out, and are no more God's children than <hi>Cain</hi>'s poſterity. To uſe the words viſible church, to diſtinguiſh it from the inviſible, or regenerate elect, is undoubtedly very proper: but to uſe them in oppoſition to a real church, is a manifeſt ſelf-contradiction: for vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible exiſtence, is real exiſtence; and the viſible church as really exiſts, as the inviſible. To ſay, the viſible church has no real exiſtence, is to make her only an imaginary, or fantaſtical church; ſhe exiſts only in fancy, but bath no more reality, than a pious man without ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:008874_0013_103093C13B8BF520"/>or heaven without holineſs: and is this chimerical church, that glorious one, that hath ſo much occupied the pen of the wiſe and learned, and godly, to defend? <hi>Let it not be told in</hi> Chriſtendom, <hi>leſt</hi> Anabaptiſtry <hi>tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph.</hi> I am very ſenſible, it has been tenderneſs for the ſupport of the grace of the new covenant, that has crowded the beſt of men, to deny unregenerate men being really in the covenant of grace; as knowing, if that was allowed, they would have a right to ſpiritual promiſes, or the promiſe of ſpiritual bleſſings; and for natural men to have a right to the promiſes of ſpiritual bleſſings, they ſuppoſed to be inconſiſtent with free grace: but this I ſhall ſhew is a miſtake, hereafter, and at preſent proceed to ſhew, that the viſible church is really in ſolemn cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God. And having ſpoken of <hi>Seth</hi>'s unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate poſterity, as being owned of God for his covenant children, under the firſt diſpenſation of the covenant of grace; I ſhall next prove from <hi>Iſrael,</hi> under the ſecond diſpenſation; and full to the purpoſe is that xvith chap. and 8th ver. of <hi>Ezekiel, Yea, I ſware unto thee, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into a covenant with thee, ſaith the Lord God, and thou becameſt mine.</hi> This could be no other but the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace; for in relation to any other, there was never found with God a time of love ſince the fall; and by no other, was the blood or defilement of ſinners, ever to be waſhed away. The time of this covenanting, was when God called <hi>Abraham,</hi> as ver. 3, <hi>Thy birth and thy nativity is of the land of Canaan, thy father was an Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, and thy mother an Hittite;</hi> and before God cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted with them, they were as helpleſs as a new-born babe: the covenanting therefore here ſpoken of, was with their father <hi>Abraham,</hi> and yet made theſe <hi>his children,</hi> ſo long after, <hi>God's children;</hi> he owns them for his; <hi>and thou becameſt mine;</hi> which is a manifeſt proof of foederal holineſs. That they were unregenerate, of whom theſe things were ſpoken at this time, is evident; for the deſign of this prophecy was, to make <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> know her abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, ver. 2. and her vileneſs is deſcribed throughout
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:008874_0014_103093C2E3A88A40"/>the latter part of the chapter; I ſhall cite a few in ſtances. Ver. 20. <hi>Thou haſt taken thy ſons and daughters, whom thou haſt born unto me, and theſe haſt thou ſacrificed unto them, to be devoured thou beſt ſlain my children, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered them to cauſe them to paſs through the fire for them.</hi> Ver. 21. that is their images.

            <p>But more fully to evince this hypotheſis. I obſerve, unregenerate men, really in the covenant of grace, are ever treated with <hi>conditionally,</hi> under all the diſpenſations thereof, <hi>Gen.</hi> iv. 7. <hi>If thou doeſt well, ſhalt thou not be accepted?</hi> Deut. xxix. 12, read to 25. <hi>That thou ſhouldeſt enter into the covenant with the Lord thy God, and into his oath, which the Lord thy God maketh with thee this day: that he may eſtabliſh thee to day for a people unto himſelf, and that he may be unto thee a God, as he hath ſaid unto thee, and as he hath ſworn unto thy fathers; leſt there ſhould be among you man or woman, family, or tribe, whoſe heart turneth away this day from the Lord our God; the Lord will not ſpare him; then men ſhall ſay, becauſe they have forſaken the covenant of the Lord God of their fathers, which he made with them,</hi> ver. 25. See chap. xxxii. 5, to 29. <hi>They have corrupted themſelves; a perverſe and crooked generation; for a fire is kindled in mine anger, and ſhall burn unto the loweſt hell; O that they were wiſe, that they would conſider their latter end!</hi> Iſai. xlviii. 17, 18. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Iſrael, I am the Lord thy God, which teacheth thee to profit; which leadeth thee by the way that

            </p>
            <p>But that the covenant of grace can be, and is <hi>conditional,</hi> I more fully ſhall make manifeſt from <hi>Rom.</hi> iv. 13. <hi>For the promiſe that he ſhould be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or his ſeed, thro' the law, but thro' the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of faith.</hi> Now, that by the world, is in this text, to be underſtood the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> if we conſider a few things, will appear,
<list>
                  <item>1. That the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was expreſsly given to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his ſeed, <hi>Gen.</hi> xvii. 8. or promiſed to be given; hence in <hi>Heb.</hi> xi. 8. called the <hi>land of promiſe.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. That the exerciſe of faith was a condition to which the land was promiſed. <hi>Heb.</hi> iii. 19. <hi>So we ſee they could not enter in, becauſe of unbelief;</hi> and the apoſtle tells us, <hi>that which is of faith, is of grace,</hi> Rom. iv. 16. And ſeeing that land was promiſed of grace, and to faith, and was a type of the heavenly reſt, or reſt in <hi>Chriſt</hi> by faith; ſo the way of obtaining it, was fit to be an example, of the way of' obtaining juſtification, or ſalvation: hence is the apoſtle's reaſoning in the ivth to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> when he ſaith, <hi>The goſpel was preached to the Jews, in the promiſe of the land of Canaan,</hi> ver. 2. <hi>but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it;</hi> and ver. 6.</item>
               </list> 
               <hi>They to whom it was firſt preached, entered not in, becauſe of unbelief;</hi> the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:008874_0017_103093CCB7040BA0"/>not in of thoſe to whom it was firſt preach'd, means their not entering into <hi>Canaan,</hi> which was promis'd to them; for upon this the apoſtle founds all his exhortation to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> both to <hi>fear,</hi> as in ver. 1. and to <hi>labour, leſt any man fall after the ſame example of unbelief;</hi> as in ver 11. Now the ſum of what I have here proved is this, viz that the promiſe of the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was a gracious goſpel promiſe, and that the land was to be obtained by faith, and not by the works of the law; and ſo a fit pattern by which to prove juſtification to be of grace; and hence it is, that the apoſtle uſeth the argument to that end, <hi>Rom.</hi> iv. 13. But let the apoſtle in this text, mean what he will by the world, this we have found, viz That the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was a world promiſed, exactly accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the apoſtle's account here, viz. that <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed ſhould be heirs of it, and that, not through the <hi>law,</hi> but through the <hi>righteouſneſs of faith.</hi> Now tho' the promiſe of the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> was a gracious goſpel promiſe, and to be obtained by faith, in oppoſition to obtaining of it by the works of the law; yet they to whom the promiſe was made, many of them, never obtained it, for want of complying with the condition; this the apoſtle proves, <hi>Heb.</hi> iii. at large, ver. 18, 19; and in chap. iv. 1, 11, proves, that thoſe to whom the promiſe is made o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> entering into <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s reſt, or into ſalvation by faith, may not obtain it, for not complying with the condition, to which the pomiſe is made. <hi>Let us therefore fear, leſt a promiſe being left us of entering into his reſt, any of you ſhould ſeem to come ſhort of it; let us labour therefore to enter into that reſt, leſt any man fall after the ſame example of unbelief.</hi> Nothing need be more plain than this, viz. that to fall after the ſame example of unbelief, is for thoſe to whom the promiſe is made in the covenant of grace, not to obtain the ſalvation promiſed, becauſe they do not comply with the condition, to which the promiſe is made. But laſtly, if there is no coming ſhort of things promiſed in a pure covenant of grace, for that there are no conditional ſuſpending terms; then for
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:008874_0018_103093CE603E0740"/>God ever to declare, that men with whom the new cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was made, periſhed for want of complying with a condition; was, and is, to declare, that the covenant in which he treated with them, tho' called new, yet was the old covenant of works; which is blaſphemous once to ſuggeſt. From all which it appears, the covenant of grace is conditional.</p>
            <p>Fourthly. I was to ſhew there muſt be life, or no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
            <p>Here I obſerve, that it is the covenant of grace, reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the ſalvation of periſhing men, that I a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Hence it is, that <hi>Moſes</hi> could call heaven and earth to record, that he had ſet before God's covenant people, lif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But what hath the names grace and ſalvation, to do with a covenant, that can only ſink the greater part of theſe with whom it is made, deeper into hed? And yet this muſt re the caſe, it ſalvation in the covenant, was provided for none but ſuch as are ſaved: when <hi>Jeſurun</hi> waxed fat, forſook God, and lightly eſteemed the Rock of his SALVATION; a fire was kindled in God's anger, which ſhould <hi>burn to the lowest hell,</hi> Deut. xxxii. 15, 22. God the Rock of

Tho' the number of the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> be as the ſand of the ſea, a remnant ſhall be ſaved, <hi>Rom.</hi> ix. 27. If there was ſalvation in the covenant of grace, for none but this remnant; then but a remnant could be ſaved: And all except that remnant, muſt burn in the loweſt hell, for their misfortune in being the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſo foederally holy. Such divinity cannot be true; therefore there muſt be no life, or no covenant.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>If life and ſalvation are in the covenant of grace for all men, without diſtinction, then Chriſt ſhed his blood for all; and ſeeing all are not ſaved, be muſt have ſhed his blood in vain; which can't be allowed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſwer. You ſay, for <hi>Chriſt</hi> to ſhed his blood in vain, can't be allowed, but I ſay, for God to make a new covenant with a people reſpecting the ſalvation of their immortal ſouls, is impoſſible, if ſalvation for their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal ſouls is not in it: Yourſelf allow in the objection, life and ſalvation can't be in the covenant for ALL, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s blood was ſhed for ALL; if God therefore extend the covenant beyond the blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> it is a defraud; and when God owns the wicked, unregenerate ſons of <hi>Seth</hi> for his children, made ſo by being in the covenant of grace; doth he counterfeit a covenant, and defraud <hi>Seth</hi>'s children? And when God tells <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in order to make her know her abominations, whoſe chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were, moſt of them, like to periſh in their abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations; he had entered into a covenant with them; and made them his own; yea, he had thoroughly waſhed away their blood, <hi>Ex.</hi> xvi. 9. Doth he defraud them by entering into a counterfeit covenant with them? What is become of the charitable plea for the ſpeechleſs, if this was the caſe? For this covenant was made before they were born; and yet with them, as being in the loins of <hi>Abraham</hi> their father, when God covenanted with him: For God covenanted to be a God to him, and his ſeed.
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:008874_0020_103093D1B2DFD590"/>Now, to waſh away the blood of a people, in a new co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant religious ſenſe, muſt mean one or more of theſe ſeveral things; either their eternal election, powerful conviction, regeneration and juſtification, or a new cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that made it poſſible for them to be ſaved. That they were elected, convicted, or converted, appears not at all: Therefore by waſhing away their blood, can mean nothing elſe but making ſuch a covenant with them, as tenders ſalvation poſſible and attainable. And that this covenant waſhing away of blood, is the thing intended, will fully appear, from the time in which God ſaith it w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Therefore when men ſay, <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhed his blood in vain, if it was for them that are not ſaved; they know not what they ſay, not whereof they affirm; unleſs they could prove God never made and ratified the covenant of grace with any but thoſe that are ſaved; which I think, is impoſſible. I know men have attempted to prove the covenant of grace is made only with the regenerate, elect,

            <p>I have ſhewn already, that the covenant of grace is <hi>conditional;</hi> the promiſes, of conſequence, muſt be <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional</hi> alſo.

This I ſhall do,</p>
            <p n="1">1.

Thoſe to whom it propoſe eternal life, it promiſes ſpiritual relief; if all the viſible church were not bound to ſeek ſpiritual life by the covenant they were under, they can never receive a double or aggravated damnation for not doing it, and it is not the covenant of grace that is diſpenſed to them, but ſome other temporary covenant.

This miniſtered an occaſion for God to call, and covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> which he doth without any alteration as to the nature of the covenant; which was, that it conveyed foederal holineſs to the ſeed of the faithful, or viſible church: God diſpenſed the covenant to <hi>Abraham</hi> with ſome ceremonial difference, and added circumciſion to be a <hi>criterion</hi> of the viſible church; the better to diſtinguiſh to the world, and the church, who ſhould be the ſubjects of his peculiar favour, and the heirs of promiſe, that men might know where to go to find <hi>the foot-ſteps of the flock,</hi> and where God <hi>makes flocks to reſt at noon, Cant.</hi> i. 7, 8.

This covenant was diſpenſed to <hi>Adam</hi> and his ſeed with bloody types; but had not this ſeal, and ſignificant ſign of heart circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, or regeneration; therefore the covenant was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed to <hi>Adam,</hi> and his ſeed, with ſome ceremonial diſadvantages, and indeed, the covenant was not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed with all its ceremonial advantages in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s day, and ſome time after, <hi>viz.</hi> until the ark was built, the mercy ſeat, and one high-prieſt appointed to enter once a year into the moſt holy place; with the names of the twelve tribes engraven on his breaſt-plate, bearing the judgment of the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> upon his heart before the Lord continually, <hi>Exod.</hi> xxviii. 29, 30. And many other things that might be obſerved.

Both in the, words of the objection, and in the 4th chapter of the <hi>Galatians,</hi> he ſaith, ver. 21, <hi>Tell me, ye that deſire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law? For it is written.

And here let me ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>The ſcope and deſign of the apoſtle in both theſe chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters was, to diſſuade profeſſors from an attachment to their own righteouſneſs for juſtification; or prevent them from ſuch attachments. This will appear, if we conſider, that when the apoſtle had expreſſed his moſt pathetick ſorrow, for his brethren and kinſmen according to the fleſh; to whom pertained the ſervice of God, and the promiſes: The reaſon he gives why they periſhed, was, that <hi>they ſought righteouſneſs by the works of the law,</hi> Rom. ix. 2, 4, 32. And his argument in <hi>Gal.</hi> iv. is on the ſame footing, ver. 21. <hi>tell we ye that deſire to be under the law.</hi> In order therefore to purſue his deſign, of eſtabliſhing the doctrine of juſtification by grace only, he takes notice of the different circumſtances, that the church, or particular members in it, are under, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they adhere to the law, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> goſpel covenant. Thoſe that adhered to the law covenant, he ſaith, <hi>were children of the fleſh:</hi> Why? Becauſe no church, or member of it, could be made ſpiritual by it; there was no promiſe of
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:008874_0028_103093EDEDAD63D0"/>the ſpirit in it: And if they would be righteous, it muſt be by their own natural ability; which the apoſtle calls, <hi>being made perfect by the fleſh,</hi> Gal. iii. 3. Thoſe that adhered to the goſpel covenant, he calls <hi>children of promiſe:</hi> Why? Not becauſe they were regenerated; for the promiſe of a new heart, or regeneration, could not be made to them who had got it already: But becauſe the goſpel covenant, had the blood of <hi>Chriſt</hi> for its foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; and promiſed all ſpiritual relief to thoſe that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered to it as ſuch. Now in order to eſtabliſh, promote, and illuſtrate this dictinction of covenants, and different circumſtances of perſons, according as they adhere to either covenant, the apoſtle has recourſe to two inſtances, <hi>ſci. Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Iſaac, Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob;</hi> in whoſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances he finds ſomething very apt to his purpoſe. In <hi>Gal.</hi> iv. notice is only taken of <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> both ſons of <hi>Abraham;</hi> with whom God eſtabliſhed the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace: And tho' God promiſed to be a God to him, and his ſeed, which might ſeem as tho' <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was an heir of promiſe; yet he is not the ſeed, to whom the promiſe is made, but in <hi>Iſaac ſhall the ſeed be called,</hi> Rom. ix. 7. Now this circumſtance, the apoſtle makes an allegorical figure of two covenants; and the point of light in which he talks, is this: The promiſe being to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his ſeed, <hi>Iſhmael</hi> being ſuch, ſeemed as tho' he was an heir; but he is not: <hi>Caſt him out; for the ſon of the bond woman ſhall not be heir, with the ſon of the free woman,</hi> Gal. iv. 30. Now, how doth this anſwer to <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> as ver. 25. Why, as God made but one covenant with the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> or the twelve tribes; and that a covenant of promiſe: ſo it would ſeem a tho' all muſt be heirs of promiſe; but they are not: Why? They adhere to a law covenant; ſo cannot be heirs with thoſe that adhere to the goſpel, or covenant of grace: And as <hi>Agar</hi>'s ſeed was rejected, in the making the covenant; ſo ſuch as adhere to a law covenant, are rejected in the execution of the covenant of grace; for this reaſon: They are the children of a bond covenant;
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:008874_0029_103093EF9C0ED898"/>and not of a free, or goſpel covenant; though ſuch only was the covenant God made with them. The apoſtle ſaith, this law covenant was from mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> Gal. iv. 24. and gendered to bondage; <hi>i. e.</hi> the law given at mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> in ſo terrible a manner, as to cauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> exceedingly to fear and quake, <hi>Heb.</hi> xii. 21. argued the rigour of a law covenant (though no ſuch covenant was made at that time, any more, than <hi>Agar</hi> was in fact, mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> which is ſaid <hi>Gal.</hi> iv. 25) and argued the bondage of thoſe that adhered to ſuch a law covenant. So that when we join (as the apoſtle doth) <hi>Agar</hi> and <hi>Sinai</hi> together (as they ſignify bondage and terrible) fitly repreſent the terrible bondage of thoſe that adhere to a law covenant. Hence, ſaith the apoſtle, they anſwer to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which now is, and is in bondage with her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ver. 25<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The inhabitants of this <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> are therefore called <hi>children of the bond woman,</hi> ver. xxxi. and are thoſe ſaid to be <hi>born after the fleſh,</hi> ver. 23. of whom it is alſo ſaid, <hi>when they followed after the law of righteouſneſs, did not attain to it, becauſe they ſought it not by faith, but by the works of the law;</hi> ſo ſtumbled at <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Rom. ix. 31, 32. who alſo were broken off from the goſpel covenant, or of grace, becauſe of unbelief, and adhering to a law covenant, chap. xi. 21.

               </gap> elect; and could not know they were concerned, till they were regenerated; therefore if this was the apoſtle's deſign, he is endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to attach them to a covenant, in which he cannot acquaint them, that they are parties concerned; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a four-fold improbability, that they are concerned at all; theſe motives could not be ſufficient, to anſwer the apoſtle's deſign: Hence then we muſt look for ſome other meaning, that will bear a connection with the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going inſtances of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> and alſo anſwer the grand deſign. And here let me ſay, <hi>the purpoſe of God according to election,</hi> Rom ix. 11. Hath a two-fold aſpect;</p>
            <p n="1">1. It reſpects the chooſing of <hi>Jacob,</hi> for that ſeed, with whom he, <hi>viz.</hi> God, would eſtabliſh his covenant; while <hi>Eſau</hi> is rejected; and herein they exactly agree, with the foregoing inſtance, for <hi>Iſaac</hi> was choſen for the ſame ſeed, and both are choſen before they are born; to this end <hi>Iſaac</hi> was a ſon of promiſe, before he was conceived, <hi>Gen.</hi> xviii. 10.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It reſpects the eternal purpoſe of God, with reſpect to the manner in which he choſe <hi>Jacob,</hi> as well as <hi>Iſaac,</hi> to be thoſe ſeeds with whom he would eſtabliſh his cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; and the manner in which he chooſeth to ſave any ſinner. To chooſe a perſon for ſalvation, is one thing; but to choſe a way in which to ſave him, is another, though both are according to the eternal purpoſe of God. That God hath choſen a certain number for ſalvation, is certain; but the way choſen wherein to ſave them, may be a way for all to be ſaved, notwithſtanding God choſe a certain number of angels for eternal happineſs
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:008874_0033_103093FB76D402C0"/>from eternity; but the way to that happineſs was a way for them all to obtain it. Now it could anſwer no end at all, as to the apoſtle's deſign, <hi>viz.</hi> to bring people to adhere to the goſpel covenant; to tell them, one out of five was. elected, and four our of five reprobated from eternity: Children of the fleſh, but not of promiſe; of the <hi>bond,</hi> but not of the <hi>free</hi> woman; though all viſibly in the ſame; yea, it muſt entirely fruſtrate his deſign; for according to that; they might adhere to the goſpel covenant, and be children of the bond woman neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. Therefore the apoſtle hath no deſign here, to ſpeak, neither doth he, about elect, or reprobate perſons in the church, as one being a child of promiſe more than the other; but only as they are attached, to a law, or goſpel covenant; and this exactly agreeth with the other inſtance: Hence, when he ſpeaks of election, it is only with regard to <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> as certain inſtances, whereby to point out the way, in which God from eternity purpoſed to ſave ſinners; <hi>which is, not of works but of him that calleth,</hi> ver. 11. Here the apoſtle in order to promote his general and grand deſign, of bringing profeſſors to adhere to the goſpel covenant; and to ſhew that election, and juſtification is purely of grace; takes notice that <hi>Jacob</hi> was choſen to be the ſeed, (with whom God would eſtabliſh his covenant) before he was born, or had done good or evil; by which he eſtabliſheth this doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> that man's good work ſhall have no more hand in meriting, or deſerving his own election, juſtification, and eternal happineſs, than as though he had never done any good at all, This doctrine they that adhered, or were attached to a law covenant did not believe; as appears, <hi>Rom.</hi> ix. 32. <hi>They ſought righteouſneſs by the works of the law,</hi> and <hi>Gal.</hi> v. 4. <hi>Whoſoever of you are juſtified by the law, are fallen from grace,</hi> chap. iv. 21. <hi>Tell me, ye that deſire to be under the law,</hi> &amp;c. And not believing this doctrine, they are children of the fleſh, and of the bond-woman, for that they adhered to a bond-covenant: But no becauſe they were not elected, or
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:008874_0034_103093FD2D5F14F0"/>regenerated; for that the apoſtle ſaith nothing about therefore the objection gains no ſupport, from theſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the free-woman, and of promiſe, though unregenerate. But poſſibily ſome body waits to aſk me this difficult queſtion. <hi>Why was</hi> Iſhmael <hi>and</hi> Eſau <hi>caſt out of, or rejected from the covenant, ſeeing infants belong to the</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>above, and are the children of promiſe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Though I am wearied with difficult queſtions, yet I will endeavour to give ſome account of this affair. And here let us conſider what God was doing in the early ages of the world; and let me ſay, to all bodies there muſt be a head; in all families there muſt be a patriarch; in all kingdoms there muſt be a ſupreme; in all ſtates there muſt be a law giver; and to all branches there muſt be a root: Now as in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s family, God eſtabliſheth a divine government, or a theocracy, he made himſelf head, king, and law giver to them, both as a church, and as a ſtate; thus he gives them laws about dividing lands, and ſettling bounds, ſee <hi>Joſh.</hi> xv. 13. read chap. xvi. and xvii. However God makes <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and his family, the metropolis of the nation. This was the ſovereign pleaſure of God; for he might have given this preferment, to <hi>Nahor,</hi> or <hi>Haran, Abraham</hi>'s brother; but it can't be the priviledge of each of them. Here God honours <hi>Abraham</hi> with the promiſe, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould deſcend from him; makes him, as it were, his boſom friend; undertakes to give laws to him and him family; and from them ſhall laws be propagated in the world; eſpecially religious laws: <hi>To them were committed the oracles of God:</hi> Rom. iii. 2. And the law muſt go forth of <hi>Zion,</hi> and the word of the Lord from <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Here God makes him the father of all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>Gen.</hi> xvii. The root of the church, <hi>Rom.</hi> xi. 17. So that if any will be members, <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> they muſt take hold of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s covenant, be grafted into it, and receive divine bleſſings from him patrimony, for there is the root and fatneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:008874_0035_10309402718FF918"/>
Before <hi>Abraham</hi>'s day, God made choice of no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular family, to whom he would give laws, ſo as that all the world ſhould receive the mind of God from that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily only. And this was not a privilege he himſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in a covenant way; for God made no covenant before; that if he would do ſo or ſo, he would make a covenant with him, in which he ſhould be the father, firſt of the <hi>Jew,</hi> and after of the <hi>Gentile</hi> alſo. Now to make a covenant of ſalvation with a people is one thing; but to put particular preferment upon ſome perſon or perſons in that covenant, is another: And the <hi>Gentile</hi> church can never have that preferment, the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> church had; until God deſtroy <hi>Abraham</hi>'s patrimony: <hi>Thou beareſt not the root, but the root thee, Rom.</hi> xi. 18. Here I am prepared to ſay; when <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> are ſpoken of as rejected, there is no appearance that the were caſt out of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace, for that was the common priviledge of all that had a deſire to be in it; and they were in it by God's command, <hi>Gen.</hi> xvii. 10, 23. And if they are turned out, it is upon their own default; but not before <hi>Eſau</hi> was born, <hi>Rom.</hi> ix. ii. Here then when <hi>Jacob</hi> is ſpoken of, as being choſen before he was born, it hath no relation to his election for heaven, (tho' he might be one of that election too) but of his being choſen to be a father of the church, and of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> and hence in honour to him, he is called ſo, <hi>Rom.</hi> xi. 28, and ix. 5. Now, as the promiſe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> viz. that God would be a God to him, and his ſeed after him; did not bind God to confer the particular preferment of patriarch, on one of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>'s, or <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s children, more than the other; God, as a ſovereign, makes the diſtinction, and diſcovers he has done it in reſpect of <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s children, before they are born, or have done good or evil, in theſe words, <hi>The elder ſhall ſerve the younger.</hi> This therefore, of chuſing <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> was no more done in a covenant way, than the chuſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf: For the promiſe that God would be a God to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his ſeed, was as much in favour of one child as the other; and as to
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:008874_0036_1030940599BC3608"/>particular preferment, God, as ſovereign, could diſpoſe of it in an unconditional way; whereas a covenant always ſuppoſeth conditions. And God's chuſing <hi>Jacob,</hi> before he had done good, was an excellent argument to eſtabliſh the covenant of grace; and to bring profeſſors to adhere to it. And now I ſhall conſider, what may be ſaid fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Eſau.</hi> And</p>
            <p n="1">1. With reſpect to <hi>Eſau,</hi> the elder ſhall ſerve the younger. This could not be before they were born; therefore reſpects after time, and means <hi>Eſau</hi>'s poſterity, as well as himſelf: and all that is deſigned by it is, that <hi>Jacob,</hi> and him poſterity, ſhall be preferred; they ſhall rule with God: ſhall receive laws from God; while <hi>Eſau</hi> and his poſterity, ſhall receive God's laws from them, and a <hi>Chriſt</hi> from his brother's family, and not his own; and if he and his poſterity, will enjoy the bleſſings of their covenant relation to God, they ſhall adhere to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for to them ſhall the mind of God be revealed, as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>Jacob have I loved, but Eſau have I hated.</hi> If we underſtand hated, to reſpect <hi>Eſau</hi> before he was born, it can mean no more, than prefering <hi>Jacob</hi> before him, as above ſaid; but if we join hated to the time in which he was to ſerve his brother, it may mean more; for before he ſerved his brother, he profanely ſold his birth-right, <hi>Heb.</hi> xii. 16. and ſought to ſlay his brother <hi>Jacob, and he ſaid in his heart, then will I ſlay my brother Jacob,</hi> Gen. xxvii. 41.

            <p>When God covenants with a father, it is a time of love with all his infant offspring, as <hi>Ez.</hi> xvi. 8. Yet God as a ſovereign, may chuſe to prefer one above the other, and promiſe to do it, in the covenant, and that is to reject the other from that preferment, but not from the covenant. God purpoſed that <hi>Jacob</hi>'s family ſhould grow up into a religious kingdom, <hi>Ez.</hi> xvi. 3. ſhould have the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> ſhould build his ark and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious houſe; ſhould have the ſpirit of prophecy, and his oracles; ſhould keep their tribes diſtinct, and bring forth his only-begotten ſon, with evidence, that this is the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile.</hi> This family ſhall be capital; and here religion ſhall be in ſtate, honour and dignity. This could not be the preferment of every family of the earth; all could not live in <hi>Canaan;</hi> one ark is all that muſt be; and one high prieſt at a time; and to give his written law and goſpel to them, is ſufficient for the whole world; tho' all the world are not made the head.

And could God put <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> into the covenant of grace, and then caſt them out, and hate them, and not allow them the privilege even of the heathen? They were in the covenant of grace by circumciſion; and if they had held to their covenant relation, and they and their poſterity had not hated and perſecuted God's choſen, wherein they confronted God, and his ſovereign diſpoſal of things; God would never have hated them, in the light of rejecting them from the covenant of grace; no, if their own wickedneſs had not debarr'd them, <hi>Iſhmaelites,</hi> and <hi>Edomites,</hi> might have come and eat of the paſſover with the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> for he that was circumciſed, had a covenant right to do ſo, let him be of what nation he would; and being found in God's covenant way, had a right to the promiſe of the holy ghoſt, a new heart, and remiſſion of ſin. Therefore the objection obtains no ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port from 11, 12, 13 verſes of <hi>Rom.</hi> ix. Now ſeeing the objection hath no ſupport from the chapter thus far, I proceed to conſider what more may be ſaid from the other parts of it. Ver 15. <hi>I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy.</hi> And 16. <hi>So then it is not of him that willeth, or runneth, but of God that ſheweth mercy.</hi> All the apoſtle could mean, conſiſtent with his grand deſign, in the verſes, is this, viz. That men need not expect by all the good they can do, to deſerve a reward of glory and happineſs: And this anſwered the deſign of diſſuading them from adhering to a law covenant. If he had meant to tell them, that there was no odds, they might as well believe one thing as another; or do one thing as
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:008874_0039_1030940BCD0EB278"/>another; or nothing, as they pleaſed, before they were regenerated; this could be no argument to perſuade them to adhere to the goſpel covenant, in order to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated: Therefore, to ſhew mercy, means to deny merit; and to will, and run, means running in a law covenant; and there is no promiſe to ſuch, to be ſure: For ſuch are the children of the bond woman; and will be harden'd if they don't bring forth fruits meet for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; for however they they may think to ſay, they have <hi>Abraham</hi> to their father, yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ey have <hi>Agar</hi> to their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and all ſuch are enemies to <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And this concludes with ver. 17. Ver. 18 <hi>For the ſcripture ſaith unto Pharoah, even for this ſame purpoſe have I raiſed thee up, that I might ſhew <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> power in thee.</hi> Here again is ſovereignty; as there was in chuſing <hi>Jacob</hi> to the above ſaid prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and rejecting <hi>Eſau</hi> from it. As God had deſigned to bring <hi>Iſrael</hi> to great honour, ſo, as a ſovereign God, he deſigned to bring them firſt into great affliction and bondage; and bring them out with a ſtretched out arm; and appoints <hi>Pharoah</hi> to be the priſon-keeper: But what is all this to the apoſtle's purpoſe? but only to ſhew, that God has a ſovereign right to do what he pleaſes, with ſuch as adhere to a law covenant: They are more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to God than heathen <hi>Pharoah;</hi> they are in the hands of juſtice; and God may harden them as he pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; for they refuſe to adhere to the covenant that hath mercy in it; and this was a good argument to bring pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors to adhere to a goſpel covenant. But if we turn it the other way, and ſay, thoſe that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered to a goſpel covenant, were exactly ſo, in the hands of juſtice and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty; no argument is left to induce unregenerate profeſſors, to adhere to the goſpel covenant at all; for in or out, they are no more related to the mercy of God, than heathen <hi>Pharoah;</hi> and yet they muſt adhere to the goſpel covenant, or they cannot be regenerated at all: And if they do adhere to it unregenerate, they can't be children of promiſe, nor really in covenant, and then they muſt be children of the fleſh, and of the bond woman;
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:008874_0040_1030941106D5A628"/>and if that means reprobates, they muſt be eternally damn'd. Now what kind of jargon is this? Let the world judge.</p>
            <p>Now I come to ver. 19. <hi>Thou wilt ſay then, why doth he find fault.</hi> The apoſtle hath all along been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing the bad circumſtances of thoſe that adhere to a law covenant, as not being children of promiſe, but only in the hands of ſovereign juſtice, as the heathen: Here he ſtates an objection of thoſe that adhere to ſuch law covenant; and the who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> latter part of the chapter is deſigned to anſwer the objection. The force of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is this. <hi>viz.</hi> That if man's good works can merit, or deſerve nothing, at the hand of God; why doth he blame us? If doing good won't help us, we are ſure do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing band cannot. Now in order to anſwer this objection; and with a view to bring unregenerate profeſſors to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to a goſpel covenant; he again conſiders, that ſuch as adhere to a law covenant, have no reaſon to reply a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, ver. 20. Why? Their circumſtances are exactly parrallel to the heathen, they are <hi>clay of the ſame lymp;</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As <hi>Iſrael</hi> were choſen in ſovereignty, to be the glory of the nations, ſo the goſpel viſible church, is the glory of our lower world, and terrible as an army with banners, <hi>Cant.</hi> vi. 4 As for the inviſible church, it can't be ſeen. But behold the glory of the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> above, or ſhe that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heres to a goſpel covenant; and <hi>the gentiles ſhall ſee thy righteouſneſs, and all kings thy glory; thou ſhalt alſo be a crown of glory in the hand of the Lord, and a royal dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem in the hand of thy God; for the Lord delighteth in thee,</hi> Is. lxii. 3, 4. <hi>I am a wall, and my breaſts like towers: Then was I in his eyes as one that found favour,</hi> Cant. viii. 10. All this is ſpoken of the goſpel viſible church, ſee <hi>Iſ.</hi> lxii. 6. Now, how great was the riches of glory, on us the gentile veſſels of mercy? that we ſhould be called, together with the remnant of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as <hi>Rom.</hi> ix. 27. to a goſpel covenant relation to God, to partake with them of the root and fatneſs, ch: xi. 17. who on the one hand were deſolate heathen, and on the other

               </gap> mercy. And this is the ſum of the apoſtle's anſwer to the objection <hi>Rom.</hi> ix. 19. taken from the 20th ver. to ver. 29. And all this appears to have nothing in it, to diſtinguiſh the eternal elect from the reprobates; or the regenerate from the unregenerate; but only to diſtinguiſh the different circumſtances of thoſe that adhere to a law, or goſpel covenant; and to bring them to adhere to the latter; and was well calculated to anſwer the grant deſign. Hence we ſee the objection obtains no ſupport from <hi>Rom.</hi> ix. or <hi>Gal.</hi> iv. therefore I ſtill conclude, the holy ghoſt, a new heart, and remiſſion of ſin, are promiſed to all the viſible church, that adheres to the covenant of grace. And now we ſee with what conſiſtency the apoſtle could raiſe his lamentation over his kinſmen, who were <hi>Iſraelites, Rom.</hi> ix. 2. <hi>whom God had planted a noble vine, wholly a right ſeed,</hi> Jer. ii. 21. when he made them children of promiſe in the covenant of grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> ix. 4 in cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting with their father <hi>Abraham;</hi> and had conferred on them the glory of preferment, <hi>to whom pertaineth the glory,</hi> ver. ix. who now are turned into the degenerate plant, of ſtrange <hi>Agarenes;</hi> had laid their honour in the duſt, by ſeeking righteouſneſs by the works of the law, ver. 32. But if he had underſtood, all theſe children of the flesh were reprobates, by an eternal decree; and no ſalvation provided for them in the covenant of grace, his lamentation muſt have been, an impious confronting of God's decrees; and he could never ſay, the reaſon why they periſhed, was becauſe they did not ſeek righteouſneſs by faith; for if they were ſo reprobated, they muſt perish ſeek what way they will. By what has been ſaid, we learn men are under a miſtake, when they bring <hi>Rom.</hi> ix. to prove God deals with thoſe that adhere to the goſpel co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, in the way of ſovereignty, for that is to confound the goſpel with the law. We ſee many things there ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of were done in a ſovereign way, but not a word of the goſpel church in that light, only the calling her to a
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:008874_0043_103094174285FF00"/>covenant ſtate. For God to covenant to ſave a people on certain terms or conditions, and yet to have a ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign right to damn them, is a ſelf contradiction in any covenant whatſoever.</p>
            <p>But now let us take the objection, and ſee what we ſhall make of it, in the light in which it is uſed. <hi>Children of the fleſh, are not the children of God; but the children of promiſe are.</hi> Now as this objection is brought to deny, that regenerating grace is promiſed to all the viſible goſpel church; if it can anſwer that end at all, it muſt be underſtood thus: By <hi>children of the fleſh,</hi> the unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate or non-elect; and that no ſuch are the <hi>children of God,</hi> in the covenant of grace, and ſo not <hi>children of promiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here to prove, that the unregenerate are the children of God, in the covenant of grace, I ſhall cite but one text, out of one hundred that I could bring to that purpoſe; and that is, <hi>Ez.</hi> xvi. 8. <hi>I ſware unto thee, and entered into a covenant with thee, ſaith the Lord God, and thou becameſt mine.</hi> And that an unregenerated church, are the children of the promiſe of regeneration, appears from the nature of the thing; for that regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cannot be promiſed to the regenerate. 2d. From <hi>Ez.</hi> xxxvi. 26, 27, <hi>A new heart will I give you, and a new ſpirit will I put within you; and I will take away the ſtony heart out of your fleſh, and give you an heart of fleſh.</hi> This is a promiſe made to them, as being the viſible church, in covenant, and God's children, and yet unregenerate.</p>
            <p>If by <hi>children of the fleſh,</hi> the apoſtle had a deſign to ſignify the non elect, that is as much as to ſay, they are not the children of God in the covenant of grace, and there is no proviſion made for their ſalvation in that covenant; therefore not <hi>children of promiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But how is it poſſible, that this could be his meaning? Doth not God own all <hi>Seth</hi>'s poſterity for <hi>his children,</hi> in the covenant of promiſe; and act upon the relation in three fold reſpects; 1ſt, his ſpirit ſtrives with them; 2d.
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:008874_0044_1030941C89A79E60"/>he binds them to do the duties of the covenant of grace; that is, marry in the chriſtian church; 3d. He deſtroys them for wickedneſs that they could not have committed, if they had not been his children in covenant; <hi>i. e.</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying with thoſe out of covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> vi. 2, 3, 13. So that they were bound to do its duties, encouraged by its promiſed bleſſings, and expoſed to its direful penalties, as being in it: And <hi>Adam,</hi> before the fall, was never more firmly in the covenant of works, a child of God, or of promiſe; yet who dare ſay, theſe were of the elect? But to ſay there was no proviſion made in the covenant of grace, for any but the elect, and that theſe are the only children of God, and of promiſe, in the covenant of grace; is to ſet the ſecret and revealed will of God a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So I might multiply ſelf contradictions <hi>ad infinitum,</hi> the apoſtle had deſigned to tell us, by children of the fleſh, was to be underſtood reprobates, for whom no proviſion was made in the covenant of grace; therefore that could not be is meaning.

            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly</hi> I was to ſhew, <hi>the condition muſt be a poſſible condition to all, or no condition at all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By a <hi>poſſible condition to all,</hi> I mean this, v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>z. that the thing required in the covenant of grace, as a term or condition of obtaining the ſalvation promiſed in it, muſt be conſtituted in ſuch a manner, as to be <hi>poſſible</hi> for all thoſe of whom it is required, to comply with faid term; or elſe it is no condition.</p>
            <p>This will appear thus; a covenant, as it is always a a platform, or compact of agreement, can never be ſuch, if the terms of agreement are impoſſible; for how can I agree to that with which it is impoſſible for the to agree? As for example; ſuppoſe a man would propoſe to give me 1000 <abbr>l</abbr>. to paſs through, or penetrate the earth to my <hi>antipodes;</hi> or to fly to the <hi>moon;</hi> could he poſſibly make ſuch a covenant with me, when I could by no means comply with the terms? It could be no more than an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable propoſal; the condition of a covenant it could not be. So, for God to promiſe, that he will he recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled with me, and give heaven to me, if I will make to myſelf a new heart, or ſincerely embrace <hi>Chriſt</hi> by a liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith, without his aſſiſtance, or by my own natural ability, can never be the condition of a covenant; for the condition of a covenant, is that which I can agree with; the which if I <hi>will not</hi> do it, I may be guilty, but not if <hi>I cannot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Objection. God hath not loſt his power of command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only we of obeying.</p>
            <p>Anſ. Can God then make a covenant of grace with you, on impoſſible terms? If ſo, you may agree on them terms, if you can; I am ſure God cannot (to ſpeak with reverece) make ſuch a covenant with me. It is impoſſible it ſhould be a covenant of grace, that hath no mercy in it; and to
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:008874_0046_1030941FE671E370"/>promiſe me heaven upon impoſſible terms, hath no mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of mercy, on the leaſt tincture of it: And according to the tenor of the objection, (tho' it is well known to be <hi>old tenor</hi>) God could make a new covenant with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, tho' <hi>Chriſt</hi> never take their nature upon him. What then do wiſe, learned, and pious gentlemen mean (when diſputing with thoſe that hold univerſal redemption) they ſay, The queſtion is not, whether <hi>Chriſt</hi> has paid a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom ſufficient for every individual of the human race; in that we are agreed on both ſides. But where is the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? while one party ſaith, if <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath not purchaſed a power to believe; or in other words, a ſufficiency of the ſpirit to make an effectual application of redemption, for each individual, the ranſom of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is not ſufficient for each individual. And the other party ſaith. <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath not purchaſed a ſufficiency of the ſpirit or of grace, to make ſuch effectual application of redemption, for every individual. One might have thought, ſuch agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments might bluſh, when they appear in the publick, under that character. However, I ſhall not canonize them for agreements, though the injudicious may think, they fell from heaven; becauſe they dropt from judicious, learned, and pious men; <hi>injudiciouſly</hi> I ſay.</p>
            <p>To ſay, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> hath paid a ranſom ſufficient for each individual of the human race, if they will ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely embrace him by ſaving faith, by their own natural ability; is to ſay this, viz that if men had not loſt their original ſpirituality, and diſpoſition of mind, to ſerve God ſincerely and perfectly, the ranſom of <hi>Chriſt</hi> would have been ſufficient for each individual of them; <hi>i. e.</hi> it would have been ſufficient, if no ſufficiency or ranſom had been wanting. And is it not to mock common ſenſe, to talk half an hour ſtrenuouſly about the ranſom of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as tho' it was ſufficient for every individual of the human race; and then glory of agreement with univerſaliſts, when before the ſtory it out, you ſay the ranſom of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is not ſufficient, for every individual. I ſhall conclude this head, with ſaying if <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath not purchas'd ſufficiency of
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:008874_0047_10309422C7033250"/>grace for each individual of the human race, to enable them ſincerely to embrace <hi>Chriſt,</hi> of whom ſincere faith is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; the terms of the covenant are impoſſible; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>tyranny,</hi> without <hi>mercy,</hi> is in the new covenant, for all the viſible church, except the elect. And this can't conſiſt with the kind expreſſions of God to the viſible church, and thoſe that periſh out of her. Hence the condition muſt be <hi>poſſible to all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly.</hi> I was to ſhew, <hi>That regenerating grace is promiſed, to the faith and endeavours of unregenerate men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have already proved, that regenerating grace is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed; and that it is promiſed conditionally, and not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely: And alſo that it is promiſed to the church, as being unregenerate, yet adhering to a goſpel covenant; and that to a regenerate church, it can't be promiſed. Hence then, to whoſe condition can it be promiſed, but to the condition of unregenerate men? To promiſe rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerating grace, to a condition done by itſelf, muſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that the perſon to whom it is promiſed hath it, and hath it not, at the ſame time; unleſs a man can be rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated more than once, which I ſuppoſe no perſon will aſſert. <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſpeaks of being born again once; but not a ſecond time. <hi>John</hi> iii. 3, But poſſibly it will be here aſked, where did God promiſe the grace of regeneration, to any individual unregenerate perſon or perſons, in ſuch a manner, as that we can be ſatisfied, the promiſe was made to him or them perſonally? To which I anſwer, Regenerating grace was implicitly, and by neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence promiſed to <hi>Cain; if thou doſt well, ſhalt thou not be accepted?</hi> The acceptation here, can mean no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs, than the acceptation of his brother <hi>Abel,</hi> for God propoſeth to prefer him above <hi>Abel,</hi> thou ſhalt rule over him. And the promiſe in 2d of <hi>Acts</hi> ver. 39. and <hi>Ez.</hi> xxxvi. 26. are as expreſs and perſonal, yet condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional. But as I ſhall undertake to prove, that God hath bound himſelf to give regenerating grace, to the proper endeavour of unregenerate men: So, all that might be
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:008874_0048_103094287693D8F8"/>more ſaid to theſe texts, will be properly then conſidered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore I omit further conſideration of them at preſent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſhall proceed to ſhew, what the proper endeavour of an unregenerate man is, to which the promiſe is ſo effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually made. Now before I come directly to the point, it will be proper to inquire when and how, an unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate man became an heir of promiſe: And as to the time when; it was either when he actually entered as adult age into the covenant of grace by circumciſion, or baptiſm; or when he was entered by his parents, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, or miſtreſs in infancy, by either of thoſe ordinances: Before <hi>Abraham</hi>'s day, it is moſt probable he was an heir in the covenant, by natural generation, as a deſcendant from <hi>Adam,</hi> with whom the covenant was made. As to the manner how he became an heir of promiſe; it was by faith; it was by the blood and righteouſneſs of the ſaviour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that the covenant became a covenant of promiſe; and it was by believing in, owning, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to his righteouſneſs, and the true doctrinal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of it, that made men children of promiſe, when they entered into the covenant of grace. As to infants being children of promiſe, that was by faith alſo, but not their own actual faith. If the parent, maſter, or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs had not the true profeſſion, of being ſaved by the righteouſneſs of another, viz. the Meſſiah, or <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> they could neither ſeek their own, nor the ſalvation of others, by faith; and as God deſigned to ſave all, ſmall or great, bond or free, in the way of a gracious cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and as the anſwer of prayer; by faith they muſt ſeek, and ſeeking by faith, their own, and their infants' ſalvation, may be obtained: When children become able to act faith for themſelves, as is required. In <hi>Ezek.</hi> xxxvi. 37. we find, he that will have a new heart, or regeneration, muſt ſeek for it; and in <hi>Rom.</hi> ix. 32, we find it muſt be ſought by faith. Now it is for want of underſtanding this ſcripture diſtinction of faith, and the ſtreſs that God hath laid upon it, in the covenant of grace, that the chriſtian word are in ſuch confuſion about
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:008874_0049_1030942A5C412B68"/>the covenant of grace, and who are in it; about the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and who are heirs of them. Thus when faith is ſpoken of as a prerequiſite to baptiſm; the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> ſay, juſtifying faith is intended, and non have right to be in the covenant of grace, by baptiſm, but ſuch as have it, and therefore the unregenerate, and infants are excluded: And then they are obliged, either to deny, that faith was required of the adult <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> as prerequiſite, to entering them into the covenant of grace by circumciſion; or the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant being that of grace, in which they were ſo entered: For if that into which they were entered by circumciſion, was the only covenant of grace; and faith was required of all the adult, as a prerequiſite to being ſo entered; faith being required of the adult now, can be no argument, that either the unregenerate, or infants are now excluded: and hence they are obliged to confront all the ſcriptures, that ſpeak of <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s glory, as being all in the covenant of grace; <hi>holineſs unto the Lord; planted wholly a right ſeed; and the blood of them all waſhed away by being in the covenant of grace, and all heirs of promiſe.</hi> See <hi>Jer.</hi> ii. 3, 21. <hi>Ex.</hi> xvi. 8, 9. <hi>Ep.</hi> ii. 12. <hi>Rom.</hi> ix. 4. thus they are in the utmoſt confuſion in ſentiments.</p>
            <p>Now, though theſe that hold the right of the adult unregenerate, and infants to baptiſm, can ſee the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of anabaptiſt ſentiments; yet when it is ſaid, that faith, which qualifies a perſon for baptiſm, or enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the covenant of grace, makes him an heir of promiſe; this they deny, <hi>i. e.</hi> many of them. And what is this, but either to ſay, the covenant that faith qualified him to enter into, was not covenant of grace; or if it was, the faith that qualified him to enter in, did did not entitle him to the bleſſings of it. And herein will appear the confuſion of this denial: When theſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen are diſputing with <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> they will lay great ſtreſs on this faith of an unregenerate man; that it quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied <hi>Iſrael</hi> to be in covenant; and qualified the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to come in; and that they were all children of promiſe, that were in the covenant by it; and that all the viſible
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:008874_0050_1030942D32A04FD8"/>church were in glorious circumſtances. But when they are diſputing with thoſe that hold general redemption; this faith is forgot; or it is good for nothing ; he that hrth got it, is not really in covenant; and if he ſeeks ſalvation by it, it is not ſeeking by faith, &amp;c. Hence they confront not only their own arguments, but all the ſcriptures that ſpeak of the viſible church, in covenant by faith, as being children of promiſed, though unregenerate. Now as I ſaid, it was for want of underſtanding the ſtreſs that God puts on the faith of an unregenerate man, that has been the cauſe of much confuſion in the chriſtian world, about who are in the covenant, and heirs of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. So now I will briefly ſhew ſome part of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of this faith.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By it the chriſtian church ſtood in the covenant of grace; while for the want of it, the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> church was turned out doors. Becauſe of unbelief they were broken off; thou ſtandeſt by faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> xi. 20. What tongue can expreſs the importance of this affair! the <hi>earth</hi> is not only rent and ſhaken, but heaven alſo; the <hi>children of the kingdom are caſt out,</hi> Mat. viii. 11, 12. <hi>The fruitful field turned into a barren wilderneſs; and the barren wilderneſs into a fruitful field.</hi> The wife and children rent from the boſom and bowels of a tender huſband, and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate father; crying <hi>my bowels, my bowels, I am pained at my very heart,</hi> Jer. iv. 19. <hi>My heart is turned within me, how ſhall I give thee up,</hi> Hoſ. xi. 8.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It was by this faith of unregenerate men, the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael</hi> came out of <hi>Egypt, Ex.</hi> iv. 1. viii. 31. kept the paſſover; paſſed through the ſea; and the walls of <hi>Jericho</hi> fell, <hi>Heb.</hi> xi. 28, 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, 30. went through the wilderneſs; entered the land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> and without faith, none of theſe things could have been done, <hi>Heb.</hi> iii. 19. <hi>Ex.</hi> iv. 1. And indeed men may have faith to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move mountains, caſt out devils, and do many wonderful works in <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s name, without the faith of regeneration. And as I ſaid a man is an heir of promiſe, when he is in the covenant of faith; and it is his faith, in the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:008874_0051_1030943137756B10"/>of <hi>Chriſt profeſſedly,</hi> that makes him an heir to the promiſe of regeneration. Therefore I come now to the point, to ſhew what is the proper endeavour of an unregenerate man. And ſeeing no adult perſon, is a proper heir to the promiſe, but only as a <hi>profeſt</hi> believer in the righteouſneſs of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as provided for the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of guilty, ſinful, and periſhing men; he is, when under the bonds of the covenant of grace, bound (as in a moſt ſolemn compact ratified) to do, 1ſt. the <hi>remoter</hi> conditions of regeneration, 2d. the <hi>direct</hi> condition; and both at the expence of an aggravated damnation: Hence it is fit he ſhould be an heir of promiſe. And as there are <hi>remote</hi> conditions, ſo there are alſo <hi>remote</hi> promiſes, of ſuper added aſſiſtance, to enable to the performance of the <hi>direct</hi> condition. <hi>I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not, I will lead them in paths that they have not known: I will make darkneſs light before them,</hi> Iſai. xlii. 16. <hi>I ſaid not unto the houſe of Jacob, ſeek ye me in vain,</hi> chap. xlv. 19. And were it not that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes apprehend him, at the very ſpot, where faith, and the covenant firſt find him, the promiſe would not reach as far as the covenant, and ſalvation could not be obtain'd in a covenant way. Here then, faith and the covenant find him,
<list>
                  <item>1. owning God to be the true, holy, juſt, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, wiſe, and merciful God.</item>
                  <item>2. Owning himſelf a ſinful, guilty, curſed, ruin'd, and periſhing creature; that hath no righteouſneſs wherewith to appear before, or be reconciled to, this holy, juſt, and powerful God.</item>
                  <item>3. Owning, God has provided a glorious, all ſufficient Saviour, for ſuch helpleſs and periſhing creatures.</item>
                  <item>4. Owning, that as he can by this proviſion, be reconciled to this holy, juſt, and gracious God, ſo it is his moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſervice.</item>
                  <item>5. Owning that he is bound in the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn bonds of a gracious covenant, to be reconciled, at the ſevereſt penalty.</item>
                  <item>6. Owning, God to be his God, in the new covenant; ready, as a tender father, to help his periſhing children.</item>
               </list> Now take either of theſe ſix ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles from him, except the ſecond, and you take from
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:008874_0052_103094344C09C598"/>him, faith, and the covenant of grace. The ſecond is not a goſpel article, and only <hi>enters that the offence may abound,</hi> Rom. v. 20. So that we ſee, faith, and the covenant puts a ſtock into his hand, that can't be put into the hand of a man, out of covenant; nor in covenant, without faith: Hence he that is planted in the covenant by faith, is <hi>planted a noble vine, wholly a right ſeed,</hi> Jer. ii. 21. Hence then in the ſpot where this faith, and the covenant of grace find him, and the promiſe firſt appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends him, there is not more required of him, than he is able to do, and that which, in theſe circumſtances, he is able to do; is the proper endeavour of an unregenerate man; to which ſuper-added aſſiſtance, is <hi>directly</hi> promiſed, and regenerating grace, <hi>remotely.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This then, is the proper endeavour of an unregenerate man; to <hi>ſet his face Zion-ward,</hi> or in other words, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards heaven, going and weeping; this faith and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſtate, hath furniſhed him for mourning: For the faith is a confeſſion, that God is holy, juſt, and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; and that himſelf is vile and periſhing, and can work no acceptable righteouſneſs; the covenant ſets a dying <hi>Jeſus</hi> before him, and makes grace and mercy meet, with juſtice and holineſs, before his face. Hence it is a part of his proper duty, to look about him, and ſee what he can ſee; for the view of God's holineſs and mercy; of a bleeding <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and of his own vileneſs; are proper objects to excite deep and juſt ſorrow. Repentance is the firſt proper duty in the covenant of grace, after a man is entered; for faith muſt bring him in. <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s baptiſm, is a baptiſm of repentance for the remiſſion of ſins; not but that he ought to repent or ſorrow, before he enters, if it is at adult age; but when entered, if un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate, it is a condition of the covenant. And as he is to <hi>mourn,</hi> ſo he is earneſtly to <hi>pray,</hi> and ſeek the Lord early. Neither ſorrowing, or praying, will do alone. And how graciouſly hath God promiſed to hear the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing prayer of his own children in covenant. How gladly doth he regard their ſorrowful cry, when they cry
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:008874_0053_103094361A393220"/>for convicting and converting grace. <hi>I have ſurely heard Ephraim bemoaning himſelf; and ſaying, turn thou me, and I ſhall be turned. Is Ephraim my dear ſon? I he a pleaſant child? for ſince I ſpake againſt him, I do earneſtly remember him ſtill; therefore my bowels are troubled for him, I will ſurely have mercy on him, ſaith the Lord God, Jer.</hi> xxxi. 18, 19, 20. See 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> xv. 2. and <hi>Prov.</hi> viii. 17. <hi>Thoſe that ſeek me early, ſhall find me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As it is the proper endeavour of an unregenerate man, to pray and mourn, ſo he ought to uſe the means God hath appointed for his help; ſuch as faſting, meditation, ſelf-examination, attend on all the publick means of grace; and however men have embarraſſed this affair, with not rightly underſtanding God's mind in his word; yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly it is the duty of all in the covenant of grace, by the faith I am ſpeaking of, to draw near the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>table.</hi> God enjoined the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> church to uſe all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations of a dying ſaviour; and nothing can be more ſtriking, than to behold the ſymbols of his dying love, nothing that hath ſo much tendency, to cauſe us to <hi>look on Jeſus whom we have pierced, and mourn for him, Zech.</hi> xii. 10. But to proceed; it is the duty of unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate men, to be much in ſecret prayer; and to take care they don't quench the ſtriving of God's ſpirit. This was a ſin of the antediluvian world of God's children, <hi>Gen.</hi> vi. 3. God's ſpirit will ſtrive with God's covenant people, until he gives them up to hardneſs of heart; and then their covenant ſtate, is left to them deſolate. <hi>My ſpirit ſhall not always ſtrive with man. Ye do always reſiſt the holy ghoſt, as your fathers did, Acts</hi> vii. 51. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold your houſe is left unto you deſolate, Matt.</hi> xxiii. 38. Alſo it is the duty of unregenerate men, to labour to <hi>be holy in all manner of coverſation,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet</hi> i. 15. <hi>He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious ſeed, ſhall</hi> doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs <hi>come again with rejoicing, Pſ.</hi> cxxvi. 6. And tho' it would be needleſs to tell all that unregenerate men might do, as a proper endeavour to obtain regenerating grace; yet it is proper to add; they ought by all means
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:008874_0054_10309437C8B33BE0"/>to take care, that they do not reſt in their moral virtues, or reformations of life: They ought to conſider that this doctrinal faith, and covenant ſtate, and reformation of life, can't juſtify them; therefore they ought to labour to obtain a deep and juſt ſenſe of their unjuſtified, and periſhing condition by nature, and their inability to help themſelves out of that condition; or to change and renew their own hearts: Hence, in ſenſe of weakneſs, and of a periſhing unjuſtified condition; they are to cry mightily to God; to make them fully acquainted with their loſt condition, and lead them to <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and enable them to receive him, and his righteouſneſs, by a living act of faith, for their eternal juſtification, and peace with God.</p>
            <p>Now though honeſt and ſincere ſeeking, in all the above ſaid ways, are the proper endeavours of unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate men; and thoſe to which regenerating grace is <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motely</hi> promiſed; yet they are not the <hi>direct;</hi> but the direct endeavour, is the ſoul's crying under a deep, and juſt ſenſe of an unjuſtified ſtate; preſſed down with a heavy burden of guilt; owning he deſerves no mercy at the hands of a holy God; yet pleading for mercy, for <hi>Chriſt</hi> and mercy's ſake. This endeavour is never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely finiſhed, as the condition of regeneration, until regeneration be given; but when it is given, it is given as a thing promiſed in covenant, to a groaning priſoner, appointed to death.</p>
            <p>Now as we have found the proper and direct endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of an unregenerate man; the which I think no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable man can deny to be ſuch: I ſhall now proceed to ſhew, that God hath bound himſelf to give regenerating grace to ſuch men by promiſe, in the covenant of grace.</p>
            <p>Here then I ſhall ſay, as there can be but two cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, namely, one of works, and the other of grace: So there can be but two ways of ſaving in either covenant; <hi>i. e.</hi> conditionally, or unconditionally; and a covenant, called a covenant of ſalvation, muſt ceaſe to be ſuch; if ſalvation is not promiſed, one of theſe ways. Covenants are always ſolemn, binding things when ratified. Take
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:008874_0055_1030943E354DE3A8"/>away bonds and obligations, and where can a covenant be found? And if men's covenants are ſolemn, becauſe of their binding obligations; how much more ſacred, and ſolemn, muſt the covenant tranſactions of Jehovah be? If the ſolemn covenant of grace is not a ſacred repoſitory, of inviolably ſtipulated terms; where is the foundation for ſacred truſt? Here then, as I have inviolably proved the covenant of grace was made in the favour of all the human race; and that all that adhered to the goſpel covenant, and ratified it as ſuch, were of the <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> above; and like <hi>Iſaac,</hi> children of promiſe; for that they ſtood by faith in the covenant of grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> xi. 20. <hi>Thou ſtandeſt by faith.</hi> So they were under the ſacred inviolable tranſactions of ſtipulation, and reſtipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and as I have ſhewn, the promiſe muſt apprehend them, where faith and the covenant firſt find them; otherwiſe the covenant and faith would reach farther than the promiſe; whereas the promiſe is always made to the church, when faith is their qualification. Here then, as there muſt be life and ſalvation in the covenant of grace, for all that are in it, as we have before ſeen; and as that life can be covenanted for but one of theſe two ways, viz. conditionally, or unconditionally; ſo in one of theſe ways, ſalvation muſt be certain; and what can make it certain, but the bonds of a ſacred and ſolemn covenant? Here then to ſay, God is not bound to give ſalvation neither of theſe ways, is to ſay that ſalvation is not covenanted for in that covenant, in which <hi>Adam,</hi> and all the viſible church, have ſtood by faith, before they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated.</p>
            <p>But in order to be better underſtood, I would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to bring this affair into a narrower point of light; and in order to do this, it will be proper, for a ſhort ſpace, to abſtract ſome part of the argument; For while I am conſidering the viſible church, as adhering to the covenant of grace, and ſtanding in it by faith, as heirs, and the only heirs of the promiſe of regeneration, either remotely, or directly; I ſuppoſe the covenant to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional:
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:008874_0056_10309440069224E8"/>So alſo, when I conſider the proper endeavour of an unregenerate man, either remotely, or directly; as entituling to the promiſe of regeneration; I ſtill ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the covenant to be conditional: And indeed I have proved, that the covenant of grace is conditional; yet in order to reflect light on the argument in this ſpot, it is proper to conſider what muſt be the ſtate of the affair, if the covenant was unconditional: For as I am ſaying, a covenant is a ſolemn, and if a religious covenant, ſacredly ſolemn compact, of inviolable ſtipulated terms; ſo it is no hard ſaying to aſſert, that the covenanting parties are bound to abide by the ſacredly ſtipulated terms of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace; for why? If the covenanting parties are not bound to abide by the ſtipulated terms, it ceaſeth to be a bond, or obligation; therefore ceaſeth to be a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. Here then it is eaſy to ſee, that if God covenanted to ſave periſhing men unconditionally, he is bound to ſave them unconditionally; and as he cannot covenant to ſave, but either conditionally or unconditionally; if be doth not covenant to ſave unconditionally, if he covenant to ſave at all, it muſt be conditionally; and then, if that condition be complied with, he is ſtill bound to ſave all that comply: I think the world may be challenged on this concluſion. Hence then, if God had covenanted to ſave unconditionally, all the race of <hi>Adam</hi> muſt be ſaved; and we have nothing to do, to limit the promiſe to the viſible church, or any condition to be done by any; for that ſuppoſeth the covenant to be conditional. And if God covenanted (as I ſaid) to ſave unconditionally, the wildeſt ſavage, or heathen in the world muſt be ſaved, as ſoon as one of the viſible church; for I have proved, that when God made the covenant with <hi>Adam,</hi> he made all his ſeed foederally holy; and by oath and covenant, waſhed away the blood of all of them; and made them his children in the new covenant; which as I proved, could mean nothing leſs than putting them into a <hi>ſalvable ſtate,</hi> or a way of ſalvation by the new covenant. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as I uſed to ſay, ſeeing they are not all ſaved, ſince
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:008874_0057_1030944201A0EE60"/>they are all covenanted for; facts prove they were not covenanted for, to be ſaved unconditionally; yet as there are but two ways that they can be covenanted for, ſeeing they are not covenanted for unconditionally, they muſt be covenanted for conditionally, or they can't be made foederally holy, or their blood waſhed away in any ſenſe.</p>
            <p>Here then, 1ſt. I am reduced to the neceſſity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering men covenanted with conditionally; and 2d. I am under the ſame neceſſity to conſider all the human race covenanted with conditionally; for as we have ſeen when the covenant was made with the father, it made the unborn children, God's children, both with reſpect to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> as <hi>Gen.</hi> vi 2. and <hi>Ez.</hi> xvi. 8. Hence the ſeed of both are God's, by the ſacred bonds of a ſolemn new covenant tranſaction. 3. I am under the ſame neceſſity (ſince the covenant is conditional) to conſider the condition as a poſſible condition to all the ſeed of <hi>Adam;</hi> otherwiſe tyranny, and not mercy, would be in the covenant, for all that are not ſaved; and then their blood could not be waſhed away in any ſenſe; which the ſcripture declares it was; and I have fully proved under former heads.</p>
            <p>Now as we have found, if God covenanted to ſave unconditionally, all muſt be ſaved, becauſe all were co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanted for. So on the contrary, if God covenanted to ſave conditionally; it muſt be poſſible for them all to do that condition; becauſe they were covenanted with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally; and as we have ſeen, it is impoſſible to make a covenant upon impoſſible terms. Here then I ſhall ſay, regeneration is ſalvation; he that is regenerated, is ſaved with an everlaſting ſalvation; he is as ſurely ſaved, as he that went to heaven twice ſeventeen hundred years ſince. Regeneration, juſtifying faith, and juſtification it ſelf, are not one before the other, in the order of time; but only in the order of nature; therefore he that is regenerated, acts ſaving faith, and is juſtified at one and the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual time. Now, as regeneration is ſalvation: when God covenanted with <hi>Adam,</hi> and made all his ſeed foede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:008874_0058_10309444D667E6A0"/>holy, made them his own ſons and daughters, and waſhed away the blood of them all, and made all that he had theirs, <hi>Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine. Luke</hi> xv 31. This of regeneration, muſt have been covenanted for, with reſpect to every individual ſon and daughter of <hi>Adam:</hi> This is but the native reſult, and moſt neceſſary conſequence, of the ſeveral things I have before inviolably proved. Hence then, as regeneration is the beginning of heaven, and as a covenant that talks of ſalvation muſt be a counterfeit; but can't be the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace, that hath not this ſalvation ſtipulated in it: So regeneration muſt be covenanted for conditionally, or unconditionally, with reſpect to all the race of <hi>Adam,</hi> for that they well all parties concerned, as we have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſeen. Now if regeneration had been covenanted for unconditionally, the ſacred and ſolemn tranſaction, muſt neceſſarily have inferr'd the ſure ſalvation of all the ſeed of <hi>Adam:</hi> And ſeeing they are not ſaved, we are ſure God covenanted with them conditionally: And we are as ſure, from all the nature and force of covenant ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations, that when that condition is complied with, God hath bound himſelf by a moſt gracious and ſolemn promiſe, to beſtow that moſt valuable, and neceſſary grace of ſalvation, <hi>regeneration.</hi> And ſeeing this grace cannot be promiſed, to any condition done by itſelf; it muſt be promiſed to the condition of an unregenerate man; and what can be more reaſonable, than for God to promiſe regenerating grace, to ſuch proper endeavour as above deſcribed. Now as this concluſion is ſo native and neceſſary from the premiſes, which have been all ſo fully proved; I think it ſuperfluous to produce more evidence at preſent; and ſhall only proceed to anſwer objections.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt Objection. <hi>If things are ſo, then God is bound, and the creature free.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſwer. If it is ſo, it is not the firſt, nor yet the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, that God hath bound himſelf, and left the creature free; and if God make a covenant with crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as probationers, ten thouſand times, it will always
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:008874_0059_10309448E044A690"/>be the caſe, unleſs God can find a way to break covenant firſt; which I don't believe he ever will.</p>
            <p n="2">2d. Objection. <hi>For God to be bound to ſave unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate men, is to deſtroy ſovereign grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſwer. What hath ſovereignty to do in a covenant that is conditional? and where is the covenant that is not ſo? Do you mean by ſovereignty, God's reſerving <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o himſelf a right to refuſe to hear the prayer of a ſincere ſeeker, or that God will regenerate thoſe that never ſought? Such ſovereignty as this, is inconſiſtent with ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a covenant way. God hath bound himſelf by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe in the covenant, to hear the prayer of a ſincere ſeeker in <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s name, or by faith, <hi>Ezek.</hi> xxxvi. 37. <hi>Rom.</hi> ix. 32. <hi>They ſought it not by faith.</hi> And God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generates no adult perſon without ſeeking firſt, <hi>for this I will be inquired of by the houſe of Iſrael, to do it for them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Query. <hi>Was not Paul regenerated by ſovereign grace?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> No. He was called to adhere to the gospel covenant, by ſovereign grace, becauſe he had adhered to a law covenant, and had been as dexterous a ſtickler to man's own righteouſneſs, as any ſon of <hi>Agar,</hi> of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> below, or of the fleſh among them all: Therefore in that circumſtance he was not a ſon of promiſe, any more than heathen <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> But when he is by ſovereign grace, called to adhere to the goſpel covenant, then he ſeeks by faith, prays and faſts, and receiveth regeneration, as promiſed to the proper endeavour of an unregenerated man. For it appears not that he was regenerated, nor is it probable, till <hi>Ananias</hi> came, and <hi>he received the holy ghoſt, Acts</hi> ix. 11, 17. And how is it poſſible, any man ſhould be regenerated, before he is made ſenſible of the inſufficiency of his own righteouſneſs, and the ſufficiency of the goſpel way of ſalvation, by the merits of <hi>Chriſt?</hi> And can any man ſee the danger he is in by nature, and the encouragement the goſpel gives, and not cry to God? It cannot be. Therefore. let a man's converſion be as

            <p n="3">3. Objection. <hi>If God is bound to give regenerating grace, to the endeavours of unregenerate men, then men can boaſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> I do not underſtand, that the ſcripture ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth any room for boaſting, but when ſalvation is of the merit of works. Now what is there in the proper en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour of an unregenerate man, that makes it meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous? Doth the meritoriouſneſs of it ariſe from the work itſelf, or from the ſanction given it by the connection of the promiſe? If the work in itſelf is meritorious, then thoſe that oppoſe me in this ſpot, are as guilty of giving room for boaſting as myſelf: For they all ſay, a man muſt be powerfully affected with the ſenſe of an unjuſtified ſtate; preſſed down with a heavy burden of guilt; own he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves no mercy at the hands of a holy God; yet plead for mercy, for <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s and mercy's ſake, in order to be regenerated. I ſuppoſe no perſon will ſay, this work conſidered in itſelf, can give room for boaſting; and if room for boaſting ariſeth only from the connection of the promiſe, then the work of juſtifying faith, will alſo give
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:008874_0061_1030944DD2D39480"/>room for boaſt; fpr juſtofocatopm os ſurely connected with ſaving faith, by promiſe; as is allowed. Here let it be obſerved, that room for boaſting don't ariſe from the different degree, or kind of influence, by which a man acts, but from the exact conformity of the action, to the divine law. <hi>e. g.</hi> Suppoſe ſome of the angels to have continued perfect by an irreſiſtible influence, and others only by a common influence of probationers, yet they would have equally deſerved heaven: So the acting of a juſtifying faith, doth not exclude boaſting, becauſe it is done by irreſiſtible influence (for if the work done, was ſufficient for his juſtification, for he would be juſtified on the account of it, tho' it be done by ſuch influence) but becauſe it is the ſoul's acting on the righteouſneſs of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which is ſufficient; and therefore he cannot boaſt, becauſe his own work was no cauſe, why he was juſtified.

So that it is not the power by which the ſoul acts, let it be more or leſs, but the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance that attends the action, that excludes boaſting. I dare be bold to ſay, that if a man by his own natural ability, could act the ſame individual act of faith, that a regenerate man doth, by the mighty power of God, he would be equally juſtified, and have no room to boaſt, in the ſcripture ſenſe of boaſting: For faith doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude boaſting, becauſe it was wrought by the mighty power of God; but becauſe it excludes our own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; and applies the righteouſneſs of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for the matter of our juſtification. And this exactly agrees with <hi>Rom.</hi> ii. 27, 28, <hi>Where is boaſting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay, but by the law of faith. Therefore we conclude, that a man is juſtified by faith, without the deeds of the law.</hi> Now to ſuppoſe that the law of faith excludes boaſting, becauſe it is wrought by the mighty power of God's ſpirit; is to ſuppoſe, that it
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:008874_0062_1030944F802D3A20"/>is not the righteouſneſs of <hi>Chriſt</hi> alone, that excludes boaſting; but ſome ſanction in the act of believing, as a work that excludes boaſting. But ſurely the action, nor the ſanction of it, as a work, are the righteouſneſs of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> and the act of faith hath no other ſanction to exclude boaſting, but the bare acting on the righteouſneſs of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> And to ſuppoſe, that any ſanction in the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of faith, ariſeth from the excellency of the influence, by which the work is done; and for that reaſon excludes boaſting; is to ſuppoſe, that to be juſtified by a goſpel law of works, will exclude boaſting: But the text is this; we are juſtified by faith, without the deeds of any law whatſoever, as a work. And to the ſame purpoſe is <hi>Eph.</hi> ii 9. <hi>not of works<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> leſt any man ſhould boaſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here then we ſee, boaſting is not excluded in the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of faith, from any excellency in the influence by which it is acted: why then ſhould the faith of an unregenerate man, by a promiſe being connected with it, give room to boaſt more than the other? they are both called faith in ſcripture; the viſible goſpel church, is ſaid to ſtand by faith, in the goſpel covenant, <hi>Rom.</hi> xi. 20. and the regenerate are ſaid to be juſtified by faith; and the apoſtle faith, <hi>that which is of faith, is of grace, Rom.</hi> iv. 16. <hi>therefore it is of faith, that if might be of grace.</hi> Surely that which is of grace, doth not admit of boaſting.</p>
            <p>But let us conſider more diſtinctly, theſe two kinds of faith, in compariſon. The faith of an unregenerate man, with which the promiſe of regeneration is directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected, is this, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <list>
                  <item>1. he believes that God is an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely wiſe, holy, juſt, powerful, and ſin revenging God, and is humbled, and deeply wounded and affected, with the view of the eternity, and inviolable excellency of theſe perfections. The faith of him that is regenerated, is the ſame.</item>
                  <item>2. He believes, that God has made a new covenant, and has ſent his own ſon to die the moſt ſhameful, pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and ignominious death; to ſave periſhing ſinners: Hence he believes God is merciful and gracious. So <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> the other.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="61" facs="unknown:008874_0063_10309452638E5350"/>
3. He believes that he is by nature, a hard, and ſtony hearted, juſtly condemned, and periſhing ſinner. So doth the other.</item>
                  <item>4. He believes that he hath no power to change his own heart. So the other.</item>
                  <item>5. He believes if he periſh forever, he can never do any thing to deſerve the help of God's ſpirit, or his juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. So doth the other.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Here then he gives up hopes of ſalvation by law; and pleads in agonies and pains for a new heart, and for light and ſtrength, to lay hold of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s righteouſneſs, that he may be reconciled to God; and all is done in <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s name. This of giving up life by the law, belongs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction; belongs to the proper endeavour of an unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate man. The firſt act of ſaving faith, is venturing alone on the righteouſneſs of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and it is impoſſible to venture on the righteouſneſs of <hi>Chriſt</hi> alone, while any hopes are left by the law. Here then we may ſee the harmony between the faith of the regenerate and unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate. One gives up life by the law; and ſo doth the other. One pleads <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s righteouſneſs alone; ſo doth the other. The faith of one is wrought by the ſpirit of God; and ſo is the other. One hath loſt all room for boaſting; and the other alſo. But herein their faith dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers: One ventures his eternal all on the righteouſneſs of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the ſure word of faith; the other hath not light and ſtrength to do ſo. Therefore, the faith of the regenerate man, produceth mourning and rejoicing; and the faith of the other, mourning and lamentation. Now what is the ſum of all, but only this? <hi>viz.</hi> That the faith of the unregenerate man, is as real faith as the other; for as he muſt quit all dependence on the law, before he can be regenerated; when he hath ſo done, if he ſeeks at all, it muſt be by faith. To ſeek ſalvation by <hi>Chriſt</hi> alone, is as true faith, as to believe alone on <hi>Chriſt</hi> for juſtification; tho' one juſtifieth, and the other doth not. And he that quits dependence on the law, and ſeeks by faith alone, can by no means boaſt, though regenerating
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:008874_0064_10309457AB05EA80"/>grace be promiſed to ſuch a ſeeker. It is this ſeeking by faith the apoſtle refers to, when he ſaith, <hi>Iſrael did not attain righteouſneſs, becauſe they ſought it not by faith,</hi> Rom. ix. 31, 32. Here we ſee, ſeeking by faith, is made a condition of obtaining; and if I cannot ſeek by faith, before I obtain regeneration, I cannot ſeek righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs by faith, until I have got it; for he that is rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated, hath attained righteouſneſs. There are but two ways of ſeeking. <hi>viz.</hi> by the law, and by faith. The <hi>Jews</hi> were unregenerate, and if ſuch cannot ſeek by faith, they muſt ſeek exactly as they did; and why are they blamed? Why did not God regenerate them, before he required them to ſeek at all?</p>
            <p>But poſſibly by boaſting, you mean this, <hi>viz.</hi> that one man can ſay to another, if you had done as I have done; you would have been ſaved as well as I. To which I anſwer, if this is your meaning, it is not the ſcripture meaning at all, in reſpect of boaſting. As I proved before; the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was promiſed to <hi>Abrabam,</hi> and his ſeed, by free grace; and by them was to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by faith, as really as ſalvation is promiſed by grace; and to be obtained by faith. Now, could not thoſe that went into the land, have ſaid to thoſe that did not; if you had done, as I have done, you might have gone in, as well as I. Did thoſe that went in, go by the faith of regeneration, or irreſiſtible grace? And could not thoſe that rebelled againſt God, and ſo periſhed in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; have done otherwiſe? Could thoſe therefore that went in, boaſt? If this you talk of, is the ſcripture ſenſe of boaſting, they could. But they could not; and why? becauſe neither their ſword, or bow, bought the land; tho' the uſe of both, is a term, <hi>ſine qua non,</hi> of their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it. <hi>i. e.</hi> boaſting is excluded, becauſe God gave it them; and their own righteouſneſs, no more deſerved that inheritance, than it did heaven. So alſo the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that ſtood in the goſpel covenant by faith; (tho' not the faith of regeneration; as appears <hi>Rom.</hi> xi. 20, 21) could boaſt in the light you ſpeak of; for men could adhere to
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:008874_0065_1030945986FE11D0"/>the goſpel covenant, and ratify it by baptiſm, without irreſiſtible grace: And was it impoſſible for the <hi>Jews</hi> to believe <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to be the true Meſſiah, without the faith of regeneration? when he had wrought ſo many ſigns and miracles among them, to prove his miſſion. Nay, it is impoſſible they ſhould be regenerated, until they doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinally firſt own <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and adhere to the covenant of grace. Well then, could not the <hi>Gentile</hi> ſay to the <hi>Jew,</hi> you might be in the covenant of grace, as well as I, if you would: He ſurely might, and ſpeak true too: But can the <hi>Gentile</hi> boaſt, in the ſcripture ſenſe of boaſting? No: <hi>Boaſt not againſt the branches; thou beareſt not the root, but the root thee.</hi> i. e. the covenant of grace and promiſe, into which you are grafted by faith; and from which you are broken becauſe of unbelief; ſaith nothing of your own righteouſneſs, as the cauſe of your accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with God: And were it not that this is the root or foundation of the covenant in which you ſtand; you would be as ſoon damn'd <hi>ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ding</hi> in; as they <hi>falling</hi> out: <hi>Praying,</hi> as they <hi>blaſpheming:</hi> Hence you cannot boaſt. And what do men mean then; to tell us, that if the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of regeneration, is made to the proper endeavour of an unregenerate man; he can boaſt? When the promiſe hath the ſame root, the covenant hath; and is made by thoſe that ſeek by faith, without the deeds of the law; which as we have ſeen, an unregenerate man can do; and muſt do, before he can be regenerated. Such men know not what they ſay.</p>
            <p n="4">4th Objection. <hi>This doctrine ſuppoſeth, an unregenerate man to have a ſaving qualification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> By a ſaing qualification you muſt mean this, <hi>viz.</hi> That he hath ſomething, which if rightly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, he muſt be ſaved.

For a man can't believe for that for which there is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, for faith hath nothing to work upon.</p>
            <p>Now ſurely, that which confirms a man in a ſtate of ſalvation, muſt be a ſaving qualification. An irreſiſtible call, makes heaven as ſure as irreſiſtible regeneration: And is it not an odd ſtory, that a man ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in happineſs, before he is confirmed in holineſs? If any one ſhould think, this effectual calling is regeneration, then it can't be before juſtifying faith, in the order of time; unleſs regeneration be before ſuch faith, in the order of time too. If effectual calling and regeneration, are one and the ſame thing; the names are a diſtinction, without a difference; and if neither of them are before
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:008874_0067_10309460A7083FA0"/>juſtifying faith in the order of time, then effectual calling is improperly uſed; for it is uſed to ſignify a call to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and not converſion itſelf. It is ſuppoſed effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual calling is irreſiſtible conviction; but if it is irreſiſtible regeneration, and not before ſaving faith, in the order of time, our ideas are confuſed with a diſtinction of names, where there is no difference: For regeneration is allowed to be effectual; becauſe juſtifying faith, is neceſſarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with it in the order of time. If they are both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore juſtifying faith in the order of time, then regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can mean nothing but effectual calling; and our ideas are yet confuſed with a diſtinction, but no difference: And regeneration has been improperly uſed to ſignify, that moſt excellent divine principle, that expatiates in juſtifying faith, and pure love to God and holineſs; or in other words, conforms the mind to God, to eternal acceptance. Now, that effectual calling, which is prior to faith, in the order of time, (call it regeneration, or what you will) cannot ſo conform the mind to God: And then the above-ſaid divine principle, which cannot exiſt, in the order of time, prior to juſtifying faith, wants a name, if regeneration is not the name of it.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall criticiſe no longer, on other men's ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but proceed to communicate my own; both on effectual calling, and regeneration.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. As to an irreſiſtible call, before juſtifying faith; there is no ſuch thing. This will appear from ſeveral reaſons: 1. An irreſiſtible call confirms a man (as was ſaid before) in a ſtate of ſalvation; therefore it aſſumes the prerogative of juſtifying faith; and no man hath power to become a ſon of God, in a confirmed ſenſe, without receiving <hi>Chriſt</hi> by a juſtifying faith, <hi>John</hi> i. 12: tho' a man have all faith, ſo that he could remove moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> xiii. 2. yet if it doth not conform the mind to God, in pure love, to God and holineſs; he is nothing in a confirmed ſenſe: If men taſte the heavenly gift; and partake the holy ghoſt; taſte the powers of the
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:008874_0068_1030946266D22410"/>world to come, (in conviction) they may fall away, and periſh for ever, <hi>Heb.</hi> vi. 4, 5, 6.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The concluſion, that conviction is irreſiſtible, is drawn from no premiſes that infer it. The premiſes are 1. ſcripture, 2. experience. The <hi>ſcriptures</hi> from which ſuch concluſion is inferred, are ſuch as <hi>Pſ.</hi> cx. 3. <hi>Thy people ſhall be willing in the day of thy power,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> vi 44. <hi>No man can come to me, except the father draw him.</hi> But both theſe texts reſpect regeneration; and not conviction; for it is the real coming to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by a juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying act of faith<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that can be here intended; and who denies a day of mighty power, being neceſſary to ſuch coming? unleſs it be ſuch as deny the mighty power of God being neceſſary to regeneration. 2. The <hi>experience,</hi> from which ſuch a concluſion is drawn, is this, <hi>viz.</hi> men that are regenerated, are firſt powerfully convicted; they are in great diſtreſs; and continue earneſt ſeekers, until they obtain regeneration; while many others, that ſeem to be as powerfully convicted as they, turn back and periſh. Hence it is concluded, that ſuch as continue ſeeking till they find, are under an irreſiſtible ſovereign influence; but the concluſion will be as well inferred, that the angels who continued perfect, were under an irreſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible influence; which is to deſtroy the notion of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing created probationers. Beſides, thoſe that did turn back, were once earneſt ſeekers; and who dare ſay, they could not continue ſuch? A reſiſtible power made them ſuch (is allowed) and to ſay a reſiſtible power could not continue them ſuch, is a ſelf contradiction. And if they had continued ſeeking, why ſhould they not find? Men muſt follow on to know the Lord, if they would be ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful, <hi>Hoſ</hi> vi. 3. and that we may ſee they can do, without irreſiſtible conviction; therefore (as I ſaid) the concluſion is drawn from no premiſes that inferred ſuch concluſion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As to regeneration; it is nothing elſe but the power, and principle of juſtifying faith; it is that power by which the ſoul is renewed. <hi>Rom.</hi> xii. 2. ſo that it is transformed,
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:008874_0069_103094658F997438"/>and made to approve the good, acceptable, and perfect will of God. It is the renewing of God's image; called <hi>the waſhing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Tit. iii. 5. alſo called by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>New Birth,</hi> John iii. 3, Now this moſt neceſſary and excellen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> grace, cannot exiſt in the order of time, prior to juſtifying faith; for that (as I ſaid) it is only the power, and principle of faith. Faith cannot act, until it exiſt; and regeneration is the power of its exiſtence. Regeneration, as it ſignifies renewing, transforming, and conforming the ſoul to God, to eternal acceptance, doth none of theſe things prior to, or abſtract from a juſtifying faith. It is therefore, only the principle of faith; but it is faith that conforms the ſoul, purifies the heart, and works pure love to God and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And as there can be no ſuch conformity, prior to the acting of faith; ſo there can be no regeneration, prior to faith, in the order of time. But</p>
            <p>I ſhall now enquire, whether convicting and converting graces, are of different kinds; or regeneration, only a greater degree of the ſame kinds; and I am of opinion, the latter is the truth. And here I ſhall ſay, it is dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the underſtanding, ignorance and blindneſs of heart, that alienates the ſoul from God, <hi>Eph</hi> iv. 18 and by neceſſary conſequence, the reſtoring of ſpiritual light in the underſtanding, muſt reduce the ſoul to its original bias, and primitive ſuaſion; in proportion to the degree of that light. Wherein did man's original ſpiritual death (which was the death of all deaths) conſiſt, but in the privation of ſpiritual light, in the reaſonable ſoul? God veils his glorious perfections and attributes; as to their beauty and amiableneſs, harmony, and conſiſtency; and leaves the rational ſoul, deſtitute of a divine impreſs. Hence the once elevated mind, is bereaved of its original happy biaſs, and ſweet ſuaſion; God's moral image, with which it was impreſt, becomes extinct; and the deſolate ſoul commenceth bankrupt. Now all that is neceſſary, to the reſtoring the ſoul to its primitive glory, beauty, and original ſweet ſuaſion; is the unveiling the divine
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:008874_0070_103095CF4ED81450"/>perfections; and re-impreſſing the human ſoul with their beauty, amiableneſs and charms. This will melt the hardeſt heart; and make the moſt ſtubborn ſinner bow. The ſoul is the ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>t to all the religious and regular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum of the bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> and reaſon is the agent of all the moral and eva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>cal conformity, of all the powers, paſſions, and faculties of the human ſoul to God. The ſpirit of God can make no religious impreſſion on the ſoul, but in the eye of reaſon; to ſuppoſe the will is bowed, any other way, than by an impreſſion made on the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; is to ſuppoſe, a brute creature might be made religious; and is ſuch a mechanical notion of religion, as I deſire not to be concerned with; for that it makes man a machine: Now what is ſpiritual conviction, but an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of God's perfections on the ſoul; by a degree of illumination? thoſe ſo enlightened, are <hi>made partakers of the holy ghoſt,</hi> Heb. vi 4. The ſame ſpirit, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth of righteouſneſs, convinceth alſo of ſin, <hi>John</hi> xvi. 8. In conviction, the ſoul is carried from one degree of illumination to another; convinced firſt of one thing, then of another; until it is fully prepared, to be enlightened with the ability and willingneſs of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to ſave; the freedom and ſatisfaction that God the father hath, in ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a periſhing ſoul by the righteouſneſs of his own ſon. And what is it can make the guilty diſcouraged ſoul, venture its eternal all on the faithful word of truth, and promiſe of God, but only being fairly enlightened about it? All the light that a convicted ſoul obtains, though it create great anxiety to be ſaved, yet cannot regenerate the heart, until it ariſe to ſuch a degree of clearneſs, as to enable the ſoul to venture; and whenever it ariſeth to ſuch degree, there is no ſpace of time between that and the ſoul's venturing. And hence the ſoul is regenerated by that faith, which is only produced by a greater degree of light. There was faith before, that created many changes in the mind; but this only can conform the heart to God; for while the ſoul refuſeth to venture on <hi>Chriſt</hi> alone, it can never be impreſſed with the beauty, amiable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:008874_0071_103095D0F500E4B8"/>and conſiſtency of the divine perfections: All God's ways till then, are not ways of pleaſantneſs; therefore the mind cannot be conformed or regenerated. Hence it is ſaid, <hi>God who commanded the light to ſhine out darkneſs, hath ſhined in our hearts, to give the light of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage of the glory of God, in the face of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> 2 Cor iv 6 And <hi>we all with open face, beholding as in a glaſs, the glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame image,</hi> chap. iii. 18.</p>
            <p>If all that is meant by regeneration being a different kind of grace, to that of conviction, is only this, <hi>viz.</hi> that different graces, diſpoſitions, paſſions, and affections, are wrought in us; that is to teach the world nothing; for every one may ſee that: But how doth theſe different graces in us, prove the grace of conviction and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion are of different kinds? A greater degree of light of the ſame kind, can make as great a difference as this. What vaſt degree of difference is made, in the paſſions, diſpoſition, and affections of men, under high or low convictions; are they therefore different graces of the ſpirit? And what is converſion, but acting by a high degree of conviction, about what is right or wrong. We know the rays of the ſun in direct lines, make vaſtly dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent impreſſions on all globical ſubſtances, to thoſe that are in indirect, oblique, and circular lines. Thoſe in direct lines, make it always ſummer at the equinoctial; thoſe in oblique, make it ſometimes winter, ſometimes ſummer here, <hi>i. e.</hi> hot or cold. It is not the greater diſtance of the ſun from us, that is the cauſe of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme cold in our northern climes in winter; but the more oblique manner of the rays ſtriking on the earth, to that of ſummer. Were the ſun at twice the diſtance at the equator, it would be hotter there than here, at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon diſtance; becauſe of the ſtraight direction of the lines: or the lines ſtriking in a direct manner, occaſion a direct reflection; while thoſe in an oblique, only glance. And how vaſtly different are the impreſſions of light on us, that are from the ſun in direct rays, to thoſe that are
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:008874_0072_103095D29F52EBC0"/>indirect and circular: Such as before the ſun makes its appearance in our horizon, after day break; or at ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand from the moon. Thoſe rays in direct lines from the ſun, communicate heat as well as light, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctly conſpire to promote every uſeful buſineſs; and inſpire the creation for vigorous action; while thoſe from the moon, leave the creation chill'd or congeal'd dull, ſtupid, and inactive. And are all theſe different paſſions, affections, and diſpoſitions, occaſioned by a different kind of light? No ſurely! but only from a greater or leſſer degree of the ſame kind Now the convictions that are prior to regeneration, are more circular, oblique, and indirect: They are by the law mainly; which is as a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edged ſword that cuts every way; but cannot cure. There is light, but no perceptible heat, like rays of the moon. But then, as the <hi>law is in the hand of a mediator,</hi> Gal. iii. 19. It is the <hi>ſword that goes from Chriſt's mouth,</hi> Rev. i. 16. and the convictions create<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They forebode the riſing of the ſun of righteouſneſs, <hi>Mal.</hi> iv 2. <hi>Luke</hi> i. 78. 2 <hi>Pet</hi> i. 19. But when the ſun of righteouſneſs ariſeth, in diſplays of rich grace, and goſpel love; the ſtony heart diſſolves; the affections are fired with primitive beauty; and the anxious and perplexed ſoul is charmed to reſt. And yet all this is but the native reſult of greater light of the ſame kind. And what is it that renders the church triumphantly perfect? (not a different kind of grace) but greater degrees of the ſame kind. Now we ſee through a glaſs darkly; but then face to face. When he ſhall appear, we ſhall be like him: for we ſhall ſee him as he is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xiii 12. 1 <hi>John</hi> iii. 2. and yet how much more graceful are theſe heavenly fires, than we?</p>
            <p>I conceive this notion of regeneration, being a different kind of grace to that of conviction, has been the cauſe of much confuſion in the chriſtian world; and poſſibly <hi>hath ſlain its ten thouſands:</hi> For by means of this, men look
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:008874_0073_103095D57954B648"/>upon regeneration to be ſome kind of unknown, unintel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible thing; and conclude they can do nothing towards believing in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or changing their own hearts, until they obtain that grace of the ſpirit: Hence they wait for it, and expect ſome kind of unknown power muſt fall from heaven, much like the miraculous falling of the holy ghoſt on the day of Pentecoſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Acts</hi> ii. 2, 3. And when people of this notion are converted as they ſuppoſe, they love to ſpeak of wonders, of viſions, or of voices, or of the immediate application of a text; as though the word of faith was not ſufficient to be believed, without a new revelation of it: And though many of thoſe who hold regeneration is a different kind of grace to that of conviction, don't approve of theſe extraordinary conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; yet they take their riſe from their own extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary notion of regeneration. Hence alſo it is, that men are ſo much urg'd to wait for the ſpirit; and it is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, both by preacher and hearer, it would be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption to attempt to believe in <hi>Chriſt</hi> by a juſtifying faith, until they have obtained the grace of regeneration; which is a different kind of grace, to any that an unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate man has, as they ſuppoſe.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oth, both to ſaints and ſinners.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Sinners often loſe a very promiſing conviction by it; they wait for the ſpirit of regeneration, until their convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions die, and dwindle to nothing.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They conceive hard thoughts of God, as tho' he was not willing to ſave, becauſe he won't regenerate them in the way they are waiting for it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. They are frighted from obeying God's commands; ſuch as, <hi>Lay hold on eternal life,</hi> 2. Tim. vi. 12. <hi>and work out your own ſalvatian,</hi> Phil. ii. 12. Theſe things they dare not attempt to do; becauſe they have not the ſpirit of regeneration (as they ſuppoſe) hence they muſt pray, and wait: This kind of waiting is much like a youth that would learn arithmetic by neglecting the ſtudy of his rules, waiting for the maſter to teach him: The
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:008874_0074_103095D7658BD100"/>maſter may be under obligations to teach him, but not in the neglect of the exerciſe of his rules. Now this notion of regeneration, won't allow the proper exerciſe; whereas the notion of conviction, being of the ſame kind of grace to that of regeneration, will; for the ſpirit of conviction the ſinner has; and if all that is neceſſary to conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, is only greater light, then he can pray, and ſtudy the doctrine of the goſpel, ſearch after knowledge as after hid treaſure. All he wants is rightly to underſtand how he ſhall ſee <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſo, as to venture his eternal all upon him; and the God of love will never neglect aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, in what the ſinner cannot find out by the juſt exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the rules of the goſpel. On the other hand, let him ſee ever ſo much of the way of ſalvation by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he muſt not venture to believe, until he knows he has the ſpirit of regeneration; and that he can never know till after he has believed; therefore he is waiting for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible things. If men therefore would venture on a <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they muſt believe from the ſpirit of conviction; for it is not regeneration, 'till faith make it ſo; and it is alſo not irreſiſtible, until faith qualify it as ſuch, by giving it the ſanction of inſurance: But that will be conſidered under the laſt head of doctrine.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This notion of regeneration gives great diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſinners in general, which muſt be a great embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſment to the ſucceſs of the goſpel.</p>
            <p n="5">5. This notion does great injury to the ſaints.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It keeps them long from believing, many times; except they had ſeen ſigns they would not believe: They are like <hi>Thomas,</hi> except I ſhall ſee in his hands the print of the nails, <hi>i. e.</hi> unleſs God will make ſome extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary diſcovery to me, I will not believe. And though God may be merciful to their unreaſonable demands, as was the caſe with <hi>Thomas;</hi> yet they often are long neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and if God doth not indulge their extravagance, they are obliged to forget their diſtinction, that the grace of conviction and regeneration are of different kinds, and act upon the former, like men of ſenſe.</p>

               <pb n="73" facs="unknown:008874_0075_103095DA494E08C8"/>
2. This notion hinders them much from living by faith; as they did not firſt believe, barely on the cre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of the goſpel, but on ſome ſign, or extraordinary diſcovery: So, when they have loſt their elevated frame, and ſweet ſence of their experience, they are as much at a loſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> how to believe as ever; and then they muſt pray and wait for a new revelation; but to try to believe when they pray, that they conclude is ſtill preſumption. Hence we ſhall hear them complaining of the hardneſs of their he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r's and of their doubts and fears; and theſe they make evidences of their humility; while they are only evidences that they live without the exerciſe of faith; and ſo they pray and wait.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This notion, that conviction and regeneration are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent kinds of grace, holds the church in conſtant ſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction and confuſion. Saying no unregenerate man has a ſaving qualification, and then denying it, and ſaying they muſt have an effectual or irreſiſtable call Saying that the viſible church are in covenant, and bound to the duties, at the expence of the penalties, and then denying they are really in covenant. Saying the promiſe of regeneration is made to the elect; and then ſaying no unregenerate man is drawn by the mighty power of God, otherwiſe he would be an heir of promiſe; and yet ſaying they are drawn by irreſiſtible conviction; and yet not heirs of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. And theſe confuſions are not reſtrained to the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, but are an <hi>epidemical</hi> diſtemper.</p>
            <p>But now let us turn the affair and ſay, convicting and regenerating graces are of one kind, and differ only in degree, and there is no need to ſay and unſay: For why? Then we can ſay an unregenerate man has a ſaving qualification by being really in covenant, and under the ſtriving of God's Spirit, and that he may be drawn by the mighty power of God, have faith, and be an heir of promiſe; and there is nothing to contradict it, for it muſt be mighty power that can effectually convince the ſoul of its own immediate danger, unworthineſs, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency, and yet that mercy rejoiceth againſt judgment;
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:008874_0076_103095DD32A5AAF0"/>and can diſpoſe the ſoul to quit all dependence on the law, and cry mightily to God by faith, or in <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs alone; though all this doth not regenerate, till faith of juſtification act, and ſo not irreſiſtible, till that act give it the ſanction of inſurance. If the graces are of one kind, and differ only in degree, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>n conviction is really ſaving according to the degree of it; and qualifies the creature to examine and exerciſe the rules of the goſpel, in order to obtain a ſufficient degree of light, to venture his eternal all on <hi>Chriſt</hi> for juſtification; and he need never ſtay to aſk whether he has got regenerating grace; for he hath got that which is as much like it as any thing can be, till <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aith of juſtification give it another name, and regenerate him by it. He need not ſtay to aſk whether he is one of the elect; for believing only can determine that affair He need not ſtay to aſk whether he has got the power of God; for if he has ſuch power to be willing to be juſtified on the acc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>et of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s righteouſneſs alone, that he might glorify God and enjoy him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ver; it is all the power he wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s, to do that work; and it will be regenerating grace if he act juſtifying faith; and it would not be regenerating grace if he had twice the power, without that act. He need not ſtay to aſk whether he is a child of God; for the prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal could ſay father I have ſinned, from the federal rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he had ſuſtained in <hi>Adam,</hi> by the new covenant. And he need not ſtay to aſk whether he is one to whom regeneration is promiſed; for if he is unregenerate it can be promiſed to none but ſuch; and if he ſeek in the worthineſs of <hi>Chriſt</hi> alone, he is one of the only perſons to whom that promiſe is directly made: And ſtill the promiſe of regeneration is made to the proper endeavours of unregenerate men, which was the point to be proved.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Eighth</hi> and laſt thing under the head of he cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was to ſhew, <hi>That influences to change the heart, are the purchaſe of</hi> Chriſt. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. If the bereaving and depriving the ſoul of a divine and ſpiritual life, or God's moral image, was a penalty

The former is true, ſo the latter. The major appears, <hi>Gen.</hi> ii. 17. In the day thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely die. The bereavement of ſpiritual life, or God's moral image, was inſtantaneous on rebellion; then our firſt parents knew moral and penal evil experimentally; and moral good by the want of it; as we know not how to make a juſt eſtimate of health, until we are bereaved of it: And though temporal and eternal death are included in the threatning; yet theſe are but conſequent on the other, and have in them no moral, but only natural and penal evil; but the other, though it be inflicted as a moſt juſt penalty; yet the cruel venom of a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Many things might be ſaid touching the DECREES; many have been the controverſies about them; I believe there have been many injurious thoughts on all ſides; but my deſign is not to concern myſelf any farther with other men's thoughts, than as they may lie as objections to my own; and ſhall proceed to communicate my own freely.</p>
            <p>Here then I ſhall ſay ſomething concerning the nature, cauſe and manner of God's decrees: for though we are not able to comprehend all the counſels of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> or ſee into the reaſons of all his determinations and conduct; yet according as reaſon and revelation hath furniſhed us, we may ſpeak with ſafety.</p>
            <p n="1">1. With reſpect to the nature of a decree of God; it is the ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed determination of the unchangeable God, who is the ſupreme agent that <hi>doth all things after the counſel of his own will,</hi> Eph i 11. What men or angels decree is uncertain as to the event; but not ſo with reſpect to God' decrees; they are like himſelf unchangeable. To ſuppoſe a decree of God can be chang'd, is to ſuppoſe either the decree is found to be wrong, or God was not able to effect the thing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e purpoſed; either of which is blaſphemy For the <hi>Lord of h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2. The cauſe of decrees is this, <hi>viz</hi> God who ſees all things from eternity to eternity that are, ſhall be, or poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly can be, by one infinite view of his all comprehenſible wiſdom and knowledge, cannot be an idle ſpectator. But as he is able to cauſe, to permit, or to prevent, he muſt determine and decree ſomething, with reſpect to every thing that comes to paſs; either that he will cauſe it, or permit it, or prevent it, or permit it to be prevented. Our rational minds furniſh us with theſe dictates, <hi>viz.</hi> That if we could ſee all that will be done in the next century, or age of the world, had it in our own power to cauſe, or prevent; if we had wiſdom ſufficient at preſent, to be abſolutely determined which would be beſt; we could do no leſs at preſent, than decree either to cauſe, permit, prevent,
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:008874_0079_103095EB2C7247D8"/>or permit to be prevented, every thing that reſpects the next century; and then all things in that century would be decreed by us now; in ſome ſenſe or other</p>
            <p n="3">3. The manner in which God decrees things is this.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That they have no influence, either on his own, or any creature's conduct. God's decrees are only indications, or expreſſions of the certainty of events; but no cauſe either of the events themſelves, or of their certainty. This concluſion will appear inviolable in all; <hi>e. g.</hi> God from eternity decreed to create the world, but doth that decree influence God? <hi>i. e.</hi> doth God create the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath bound himſelf by a decree to create it? Why did he decree to do it? he ſurely ſaw ſome ſufficient reaſon, or he would never decree it: And that reaſon which is ſufficient to diſpoſe God to decree it, muſt be the reaſon of the certainty why he will do it; to found the reaſon of God's creating on one thing, and the certainty on another, is to ſuppoſe that when God ſaw ſufficient reaſon to create the world, it was not certain that he will do it, until he hath bound himſelf by a decree, <hi>i. e.</hi> that reaſon which infinite wiſdom ſaw ſufficient for the creating the world, is not ſufficient to diſpoſe God certainly to do it; therefore leſt he ſhould neglect doing that which he ſees ſufficient reaſon for, he decrees he will do it, and that makes it certain he will do it. Surely when God ſaw ſufficient reaſon, to diſpoſe him to decree the creation of the world; that ſame reaſon was ſufficient, to diſpoſe him certainly to do it; therefore the decree has no influence in the creating, or the certainty of it. If it is objected, God could not ſee the creation as a certainty prior to the decree? It is anſwered, God ſaw ſufficient reaſon for crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, prior to the decree; and if God ſaw ſufficient reaſon for creating, prior to the decree; that reaſon muſt be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to diſpoſe him certainly to create; and God's ſeeing the creation a certainty, is not the reſult of the decree, but the reſult of infinite wiſdom, ſeeing ſufficient reaſon for creating; and God ſeeing ſufficient reaſon to diſpoſe him certainly to create, is the reaſon why he decrees cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to do it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="unknown:008874_0080_103095EF4803BA30"/>
Two things ought here to be conſidered;
<list>
                  <item>1. When I ſay, God ſaw ſufficient reaſon to diſpoſe him certainly to create the world, before he decreed to do it; it muſt not be underſtood, one thing before another in the order of time, but only in the order of nature; for there is no before or after with God, in the order of Time, with reſpect to ſeeing ſufficient reaſon for doing a thing, and purpoſing or decreeing to do it.</item>
                  <item>2. When I ſay, the decree of God is not the reaſon, neither of God's doing a thing, or of the certainty of his doing it; it muſt not be underſtood as tho' when God ſaw ſufficient reaſon to do a thing, a decree is not connected with it; for what God ſees ſufficient reaſon for doing, he muſt purpoſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>When we purpoſe or decree to do a thing, we always have ſome (as we think) ſufficient reaſon for ſuch purpoſe, or decree. Now is this decree the reaſon why we will certainly do it? No, for if we ſee ſufficient reaſon to do otherwiſe, we will alter the purpoſe or decree: And the reaſon why God will not alter his purpoſes or decrees, is this, <hi>viz.</hi> he can never ſee a more ſufficient reaſon for his conduct, than he ſaw at firſt; for if he could, he would ſurely alter his decrees: That decree that binds to do that which there is not ſufficient reaſon for, muſt be dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, like the decrees of the <hi>Medes and Perſians, Eſt.</hi> viii. 8, 11.

            <p>I come now directly to ſhew, how God hath <hi>decreed</hi> with reſpect to men. And by a <hi>decree of election,</hi> I mean a number of the human race, were choſen from eternity, for everlaſting happineſs; and that the number is certain and definite.</p>
            <p>By a <hi>decree of reprobation,</hi> I mean that all except the elect were predeſtinated to everlaſting deſtruction, from the fame eternity: But then no man or woman need be terrified with this repreſentation of God's decrees; for I ſhall ſhew that theſe decrees, are in no ſenſe the cauſe why one is ſaved, or the other damned: Or in other words, they have no kind of influence, and men are all as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ee to be ſaved, as thought there was no decree of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation: And the elect as free to be damned, as though there was no election, as to all that that decree ſhall ever do towards their ſalvation. As I ſaid before, the cauſe why God decrees things, is only that he cannot be an idle ſpectator, but muſt decree ſomething with reſpect to all events; either, that he will cauſe, or permit, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, or permit to be prevented. And as I ſhewed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:008874_0082_103095F4F824D550"/>the manner of God's decreeing, that his decrees have no influence on himſelf; ſo there is no reaſon why he cauſeth, permitteth, preventeth, or permitteth any thing to be prevented. I ſhall now proceed to reconcile theſe definite and fixed decrees, with the covenant of grace: And here I ſhall ſay, the decrees of God can never be ſo deſigned by him, as to oppoſe, claſh with, or embarras the covenant of grace. I ſhall therefore now ſhew, when and how decrees, do theſe things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Decrees oppoſe the covenant of grace, when they forbid the making of it: And what I ſhall now ſay, let the world conſider: If God had reprobated, by an eternal decree of predeſtination, all the ſeed of <hi>Adam,</hi> except thoſe that ſhall be ſaved, in and for <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, without any regard to their rejecting of, or rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or a ſalvation provided for them in the new covenant; then God can never make a new co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with them, after that ſin and rebellion: It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for God to covenant about the pardoning, and blotting out of ſin and tranſgreſſion, it he hath bound him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by an eternal decree, that he will never pardon their ſins, or blot out their tranſgreſſions <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>k who do not eaſily ſee a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion from the premiſes, what I have here proved is this, <hi>viz.</hi> that the covenant of grace was made with the reprobate ſeed of <hi>Adam,</hi> as really as with the elect; and that it could not have been made with them, if they had not been predeſtinated to final ruin, in the fall of <hi>Adam:</hi> therefore, they are predeſtinated to ruin, no otherwiſe, then as they reject the blood of the covenant of grace, with which they are ſanctified, or made covenantly holy, <hi>Heb,</hi> x. 29. So that they might all have been ſaved, notwithſtanding all, that the decree of reprobation ever did to hinder it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A decree oppoſeth the covenant of grace, when it hath influence on human actions: A man cannot be rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated, or powerfully convicted, without powerful aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance from the ſpirit of God: And if that aſſiſtance is to be obtained by decrees, and to by the terms of a covenant, the whole notion of covenanted ſalvation, is overthrown. <hi>e. g.</hi> When God covenanted with angels; if the elect among them had by a decree of predeſtination to happineſs, been kept from rebellion, they are not ſaved by a covenant at all; and its nonſenſe to talk of a covenant with reſpect to them; for the decree influenceth all their ſtanding, and governs their conduct. On the other hand, if the decree of reprobation takes away the power of ſtanding from reprobate angels, that decree muſt influence their fall, and neceſſarily infers their dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, do the beſt they can. So, if the help of the ſpirit is witheld from the non-elect of the ſeed of <hi>Adam,</hi>

               </gap>ence we ſee, that decrees muſt have no influence, neither ſecret nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd.

            <p n="3">3. Decrees oppoſe a covenant, when they don't allow men to be probationers, for a covenant always doth, and if the decrees of God have any influence in the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining man's conduct, they put the elect into a ſtate of inſurance from eternity; and the reprobates are ſealed to damnation; and a covenant is uſeleſs for either of them. If it be replied, <hi>God has decreed to ſave the elect in a covenant way;</hi> it is anſwered, that is true; but it could not be true, if men were ſaved becauſe they are elected: God, as I have ſaid, decrees every thing that comes to paſs; yet I have alſo ſaid, and prov'd, decrees have no influence, and nothing comes to paſs becauſe it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed; for if it doth, that is not to ſave in a covenant way, as we have ſeen. If God has decreed to ſave in a covenant way; and yet ſaves by ſovereign grace, and abſolute decrees; then he has decreed to ſave in an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible way; for that way of ſaving is inconſiſtent with a covenant; or at leaſt, he doth not ſave in the way he has decreed to ſave; and to ſave in two ways, directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, is impoſſible.</p>

But I ſuppoſe a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty ariſing only from fore-knowledge, will hardly give ſatisfaction here, the decree muſt influence their coming, and then they cannot help coming. If the decree doth not influence their coming, there can be no other certainty
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:008874_0090_1030960C8B230360"/>than that which ariſeth from fore knowledge: And if the decree doth not influence their coming, there is nothing in the objection: Therefore let us now inquire whether, the certainty of the elect's coming to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ariſeth from fore knowledge only, or from the influence of a decree. I know a decree cannot be ſeparated from fore know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; but then, it is one thing for God to fore-ſee a thing, and decree it; and another for God to decree ſo, that the decree ſhall produce, or influence the event decreed. God fore-ſaw the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> and of angels, and decreed both; but what dreadful work do we make, if we ſuppoſe thoſe decrees had any influence, in produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing theſe direful events: And yet theſe events, being foreſeen and decreed, are as certain, as it is that the elect f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> I ſuppoſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> did not deſign to tell us, more or leſs, than he deſigned to tell them; and if he deſigned to tell them, they were not of the elect, he as fully deſigned to tell them, they were reprobates; and the reaſon why they did not believe, was, they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated to damnation; and not being of the elect, he
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:008874_0092_1030961113CB5648"/>had nothing to do with them. But if this was his deſign, we may juſtly wonder. Indeed there were many things wonderful in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> his perſon, name, counſels, and miraculous conduct, compoſe a moſt extenſive ſcene of wonders: But then his wonderfulneſs did not conſiſt in inconſiſtency, and injudiciouſneſs; and who under heaven can tell, what end he could propoſe, in telling God's covenant people, they were reprobates; for whom there was no proviſion made in the covenant of grace; and that he had nothing to do with them, for they were not his ſheep, and he was not ſent to be their ſhepherd: And then cry <hi>O Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem, thou that killeſt the prophets, how often would I have gathered thy children together, and ye would not.</hi> i. e. How often would I have gathered reprobates, when I had no commiſſion to do ſo. And then behold the city, and weep over it, ſaying, <hi>if thou hadſt known in this thy day, the things which belong to thy peace;</hi> when they neither had a day of grace; or any thing belonging to their peace; and it was impoſſible they ſhould know they had. But ſurely every man of ſenſe muſt ſay, if <hi>Chriſt</hi> had once told them they were reprobates, and he had no commiſſion to be their ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, for they were not of his ſheep; he could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with himſelf, ever after ſuch declaration, urge theſe reprobates, to believe on him for ſalvation. But this he doth with the moſt powerful arguments (conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent or inconſiſtent) <hi>John</hi> x. 37, 38, <hi>If I do not the works of my father, believe me not. But if I do, though ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not me, believe the works: That ye may know and believe that the father is in me, and I in him.</hi> Hence then we muſt look for ſome other diſtinction of ſheep, then either being regenerate, or of the elect, or barely being the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ſo God's covenant people. And the true diſtinction, is that which is made <hi>Rom.</hi> ix. and <hi>Gal.</hi> iv. Such as turn the goſpel covenant into a law covenant, <hi>Chriſt</hi> cannot be their ſhepherd, nor they his ſheep, be they of the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> as they will; they are children of the bond-woman, and not of
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:008874_0093_1030961524D72700"/>promiſe; for while they imagine their own moral virtues, and ceremonial waſhings ſhall juſtify and ſave them; they muſt ſtumble at <hi>Chriſt;</hi> but cannot follow him, as their ſhepherd; and he cannot feed them, as his ſheep. And when beyond all diſpute this was <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s meaning, we ſee with what propriety <hi>Chriſt</hi> could tell theſe that were not of his ſheep; of a day that belonged to their peace; and weep over them, for ruining themſelves in adhering to a law covenant; and urge them with the moſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful arguments, to believe on him, as the ſaviour that God had ſent into the world: <hi>That ye may know and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that I am in the father, and the father in me,</hi> John x. 38. And here we ſee, how ſorrowfully this text, for many ages, has been rack'd and tortured, to make it ſpeak a ſenſe, that makes <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s conduct non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe. And ſtill we ſee, decrees have no influence, and do no way embarras the covenant of grace; though the number of elect and reprobate, are certain and definite; any more than the decrees of God, with reſpect to angels, embarraſſed their convenant ſtate.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I was to ſhew, <hi>that efficacious grace is neceſſary to regeneration, and juſtification; from which none can fall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the grace of regeneration, and the efficacy of it, I have ſufficiently diſcourſed, under the 7th heard upon the covenant; therefore I ſhall proceed to ſay ſomething of the perſeverance of the ſaints. And the reaſon why the ſaints cannot fall from grace, is this, <hi>viz.</hi> a juſtifying faith inſures all that have it, in a ſtate of ſalvation. He that is juſtified, ſhall not come into condemnation; he hath everlaſting life, and is paſſed from death unto life, John v. 24. <hi>he that believeth on the ſon, hath everlaſting life.</hi> John iii. 36. <hi>They ſhall never periſh,</hi> John x. 28. A juſtifying faith, puts thoſe that have it, beyond a ſtate of probation. To be on trial for any thing, ſuppoſeth always the thing uncertain, and not inſured. The ſaints are upon tryal for growth in grace, and increaſing fitneſs for the heavenly world. And this growth, as to the
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:008874_0094_10309618055B71D8"/>greater or leſs degree of it, will be according as men im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove in ordinary caſes. How much knowledge a ſaint ſhall have in this world, is uncertain; or how great his faith, love to God and holineſs, to the ſaints, his meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, patience, and temperance ſhall be, is uncertain. A degree of every grace is certain, to every ſaint: He is therefore a probationer, only for a greater degree; but a greater juſtification, a ſaint cannot obtain, than he hath at firſt; for it is perfect. God may pardon the ſins of the ſaints every day; and they have need of it, <hi>for in many things they offend,</hi> James iii. 2. <hi>And there is not a a juſt man upon earth, that doth good, and ſinneth not,</hi> Eccl vii. 20. But it is one thing to pardon the ſins and imperfections of a ſaint, and another to juſtify his ſtate. Men are inſured in a ſtate of ſalvation, when ever they come into the poſſeſſion of the righteouſneſs of <hi>Chriſt. Adam</hi>'s righteouſneſs would have inſured all his poſterity, if he had continued perfect, whenever they became heirs of it, and that would have been by natural generation. Men are made heirs of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s righteouſneſs, by the faith of regeneration. And tho' <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſeed would have been bound to be holy, yet not as probationers; for they would have been inſured. So the ſaints are under the higheſt obligations to be <hi>holy in all manner of converſation and godlineſs,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> iii. 11. But then, they are not probationers to obtain a right and title to the eternal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of heaven, for that is made ſure on the acting of the faith of juſtification; and this is the only reaſon why a ſaint cannot fall from grace. <hi>Satan may deſire to have them, and ſift them as wheat;</hi> but <hi>Chriſt</hi> will always <hi>pray for them, that their faith fail not,</hi> Luke xxii. 31. <hi>Chriſt</hi> prays they <hi>may be kept from the evil of the world,</hi> John xvii. 15. and it will ſurely be done.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly</hi> and laſtly, I was to ſhew, that a poſſibility of ſailing, is always neceſſary to a ſtate of probation, for regeneration, juſtification, eternal life, or any thing elſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="unknown:008874_0095_1030961B2D440340"/>
I have already conſidered, that ſuch as act a juſtifying faith, are at the ſame inſtant juſtified, and therefore not probationers for juſtification, after ſuch act. And that regenerating grace, is before that act, in the order of nature; and alſo that eternal life, is neceſſarily connected with the ſame juſtifying act of faith; ſo that heaven with all the glory of the heavenly ſtate, is inſured, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in the favour of ſuch perſon or perſons. And if perſons are upon trial, as probationers for things, they are already in poſſeſſion of, and are influenced and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to them; we have loſt all in the ideas of a proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary ſtate; and muſt conſider the angels yet as proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners, for they are as much bound to their good beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, as the ſaints. Here then we ſee, if men are ever probationers for regeneration, juſtification, or eternal life, it muſt be before they act the faith of regeneration. And we alſo ſee, that all perſons that ſay, men are not probationers in the covenant of grace, for life and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, until they act the faith of regeneration, implicitly ſay, they are not probationers for life and happineſs at all. To be a probationer in a covenant, includes theſe ſeveral things.
<list>
                  <item>1. The thing for which a man is a probationer, muſt be covenanted for: For however God may give things not covenanted for, he that obtains them, doth not obtain them as a probationer in covenant. To obtain things as a probationer in covenant, is to have them covenanted for, on certain terms or conditions; for if there are no conditions, there can be no trial, and a ſtate of probation, is always a ſtate of trial.</item>
                  <item>2. To be a probationer for a thing, is to have it ſo covenanted for, that it is poſſible to obtained it; a ſentiment contrary to this, is madneſs.</item>
                  <item>3. To be a probationer, is to have the thing ſo cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted for, as that it is not certain, it ſhall be obtained <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> If the thing covenanted for, is certain to be obtained, it is inſured, and he for whom it was covenanted, is no probationer. Take away either of theſe things, and you deſtroy the notion of probation.</item>

1. Hence then we ſee, if men are ever probationers for life and ſalvation, it is before they are regenerated; for regeneration conforms the ſoul to God, in acts of juſtifying faith, and holy love; and is the beginning of heaven; and inſures the full fruition of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Hence then we ſee, if men are ever probationers for life and ſalvation, it muſt be covenanted for, before they obtain that life and ſalvation; therefore it muſt be covenanted for, before they are regenerated, for a man is not upon trial, for life and ſalvation, after he is rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated, more than the angels in heaven; for one is us much confirmed in ſalvation as the other.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We hence ſee, if men are ever probationers for life and ſalvation, it muſt be, when it is poſſible for them to obtain it, or not obtain it; therefore, they muſt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bationers, before they are regenerated: For after they are regenerated, they are inſured, and cannot periſh; and conſequently not probationers.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We hence ſee, if men can be probationers no where, but where the ſalvation covenanted for, may be obtained, or not obtained; (upon the truth of which, the world may be chalenged) then a poſſibility of failing is always neceſſary to a ſtate of probation for any thing; be it what it will: And this was the point to be proved.</p>
            <p n="5">5. We hence ſee, if regenerating grace inſures ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to them that have it (which I hope no thinking, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding chriſtian will deny) then God can covenant about life and ſalvation, with no people as probationers for it, but the unregenerate: For as we have ſeen, the regenerate cannot be probationers for it, becauſe they are inſured in it; and a certainty of obtaining the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation covenanted for, or an impoſſibility of obtaining it, either of them deſtroy the notion of a probationary ſtate.</p>
            <p n="6">6. We hence ſee, if God makes the covenant of grace with none but the regenerate, or ſuch as act a juſtifying faith, and not until they are regenerated, or act that act; then he ſaves none as probationers: For that act inſures; and if the covenant is not made before a juſtifying act of
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:008874_0097_103096221A745AA8"/>faith; it is not made until the ſinner is ſaved: And it is not made until he is put beyond a ſtate of probation: For from the original of that act, it is impoſſible but he muſt be ſaved; and if the covenant cannot be made with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate men, becauſe they have not regeneration, and the firſt act of juſtifying faith; then that faith muſt be firſt; at leaſt in the order of nature; and they cannot be probationers, in the order of nature, much leſs in the order of time, before that act: Therefore they cannot be ſaved as probationers at all. If it be replied, <hi>faith is a condition of the covenant, and men are upon trial whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will act a juſtifying act of faith, and when they will act a juſtifying act of faith; and when they do it, they are ſaved as probationers.</hi> It is anſwered, if the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is not made with him that is ſaved, before he act a juſtifying faith; faith, which is the gift of God, was given to him before he was in covenant; and what God gives to men out of covenant, is not given to them as probationers; for they are probationers no otherwiſe, than as being in covenant.</p>
            <p n="7">7. We hence ſee, a man cannot be a probationer out of covenant, or in covenant if he is inſured, or confirmed in a ſtate of ſalvation; or if ſalvation is not ſo covenanted for, as that it is poſſible to obtain it. Hence then, God can covenant with no perſon or perſons, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bationers for life and ſalvation, but the unregenerate: And theſe cannot be probationers, if they are confirmed in ſalvation, as being elect; or ſealed under a decree of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination to periſh, as reprobates. Thoſe only can be probationers in the covenant of grace, for whom ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is poſſible, but not infallible.</p>
            <p n="8">8. We hence ſee, if God has not covenanted with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate men, and that ſo it is poſſible for them, either to be ſaved or not ſaved; he has not covenanted to ſave men at all as probationers: And ſuch a concluſion, is to deſtroy the nature of all covenants; and turn them into an abſolute promiſe, of unconditional ſalvation: <q>Tho' the covenant of works, and of grace, are diſtinct ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:008874_0098_10309623CD9EFFE0"/>they muſt neceſſarily each of them, partake of the nature of the genus: <hi>i. e.</hi> have what is eſſential to a covenant in general; and this is eſſential; even a promiſe with ſtipulation, or condition: In this they muſt both agree, or they cannot both be covenants.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. We hence ſee, if men are not ſaved as probationers they are not ſaved by a covenant ſtate at all; but we are ſure God ſaves none, but according to a covenant: And the terms of ſalvation by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> are the terms of a well ordered covenant. It would be a piece of the grandeſt ſuperfluity, to produce ſcriptural evidence for this; for the word of God is full of it.</p>
            <p n="10">10. We hence ſee the reaſon why God covenanted with unregenerate men, about life and ſalvation; <hi>viz.</hi> that he deſigned to ſave men in a covenant way, and as proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners; which could not be, if they were ſaved before be covenanted with them: If the angels had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in a ſtate of ſalvation before they were covenanted with, they could never have been ſaved as probationers, or in a covenant way: The covenant muſt be made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that confirmation, not only in the order of nature, but alſo of time; for they muſt have time after the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is made, to do either good or evil; for if they are not in the covenant, they cannot be probationers by it; and if they are confirmed; and can do nothing but good, neither are they probationers. So if God will ſave men as probationers, the covenant of grace muſt be made with them, before a juſtifying act of faith, not only in the order of nature, but alſo of time: For before they can be probationers, they muſt be in covenant; and if, they are not there, before a juſtifying act of faith, even in the order of time; they cannot be probationers: for an act of faith conforms the heart to God; and they cannot chooſe evil, ſo as to come into condemnation; therefore, if they are not in covenant before regeneration, in the order of time; they have no time to do any thing but believe: And they never ſaw a time, after they were in covenant, that they could do that, for which they could
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:008874_0099_1030962579AF9018"/>periſh: And ſo could not come into covenant as proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners. And if they could not come into it as proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners; we are ſure they could not be probationers, when there. <hi>i. e.</hi> If God could not make the covenant with them as probationers, becauſe they were confirmed in a ſtate of ſalvation; they could not obtain ſalvation as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bationers, after the covenant was made; for the ſame reaſon.</p>
            <p n="11">11th, We hence ſee, there is no way to deny the covenant of grace, being made with unregenerate men, without denying alſo, that God deſigned to ſave men in a covenant way, and as probationers: And where is the man ſo hardy as to aſſert ſuch a thing?</p>
            <p n="12">12th, We here learn, the true properties of a proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner; which are theſe; <hi>viz.</hi>
               <list>
                  <item>1. A real being in covenant, or under a ratifying covenant tranſaction.</item>
                  <item>2. So in cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as that it is poſſible, either to be ſayed, or loſt. Hence then, whoever aſſerts conviction, or regeneration, prior to a juſtifying act of faith, in the order of time, are irreſiſtible; aſſerts alſo, thoſe that have ſuch conviction, or regeneration, are put beyond a ſtate of probation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a juſtifying act of faith, even in the order of time; for he that is under an irreſiſtible influence, to do good; it is impoſſible but he muſt be ſaved; and if he receive <hi>Chriſt</hi> by a juſtifying act of faith; he doth not receive him as a probationer: but as one confirmed in ſalvations, for he could do nothing elſe: But was like the angles able only to do good.</item>
               </list> And how not only unreaſonable, is ſuch a concluſion, but unſcriptural alſo? So that, the true ſtate of things is this; no grace of the ſpirit is irreſiſtible, in its own nature; and no otherwiſe confirms a final perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, than as it receives a ſanction of inſurance, by a juſtifying act of faith; And final perſeverance, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to none but ſuch as act a juſtifying act of faith: It is therefore the righteouſneſs of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Surely, ſurely, however our kind <hi>Emanuel</hi> came not to deſtroy men's lives, but to ſave them; yet he will never come to reign in general, until we that profeſs to be his friends, are more friendly to each other; and can ſee more <hi>eye to eye:</hi> What duty is ſo much inculcated as love; but O how do our diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons alienate our hearts, and keep us at ſword's points; and hence we weary ourſelves in vain, in looking for the peaceful reign of the prince of peace.</p>

Can the church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ever be general, in the doctrine of the <hi>kirk of Scotland;</hi> whoſe predeſtinarian ſentiments allow but a remnant of the viſible church to belong to <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s mediatorial kingdom? though this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinarian doctrine, is not reſtrained to the creed of the kirk of <hi>Scotland;</hi> for the creeds of the <hi>church of England,</hi> and of the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> are much the ſame, as to the decrees of God. And O my ſoul! how is it poſſible that ever the church of thy dear and kind Lord, ſhould agree to a ſcheme of the covenant of grace, that allows him to reign over but a few of them? And that the churches in general ſhould unite in ſuch a ſcheme? A ſcheme in which its advocates have no other way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile the general calls, and profeſſions of kindneſs, that God hath expreſſed in his holy word, and the general offers of grace, with their notion of particular redemption and decrees, but only to tell us, that all that God intended by ſuch calls and honour, was to ſhew how reaſonable it is that men ſhould repent and turn to God: When they had no proviſion made in the covenant of grace, for ſuch turning, were not of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s ſheep, and he not ſent to be their ſhepherd. O how has error trodden down the ſcheme of the covenant of grace! that was originally cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to promote harmony, peace, and concord in the church, and brotherly love among all it's members. Surely ſuch a ſcheme of the covenant of grace, can never be very good natur'd, for it is impoſſible but it muſt be very croſs, and crooked to the viſible church, if there
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:008874_0110_1030964732B31C58"/>is ſalvation in it but for a remnant of thoſe that are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly in it. And indeed I think, it will want more than <hi>metaphyſical</hi> diſtinctions, to ſcreen it from lying, if there is not ſalvation in it for all: For that it ſaith all were foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derally holy, and the blood of them all waſhed away. But ſuch a ſcheme, is as inconſiſtent with the general reign of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the church, as it is with the general peace of its members; and therefore muſt be turned out of the church, before a general reign can be expected; or the church in general united; and brotherly love promoted. If any ſhould think that perſons cannot be broken from a law dependence, and brought naked to believe in <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s righteouſneſs, without firſt believing particular redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; let them only inquire of experienced people, and ſuch as may be judged to be truly gracious; and ſee if they all believed that doctrine, before they embraced <hi>Chriſt.</hi> As for myſelf, though I did once believe that doctrine, and the predeſtination correſpondent to it: yet it was ſome time after, I think my ſoul had embraced <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by a juſtifying faith; and I am perſuaded, that more embrace <hi>Chriſt,</hi> before they believe the doctrine of particular redemption and decrees, than do afterward; and many regenerate ſouls, never believe it: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is of no uſe in the world; but only to be a ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling-block in the way of the weak; a bone of conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and a bar in the way of the general reign of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and the union of the churches.</p>

Can all the different churches unite with thoſe call'd the <hi>Friends;</hi> who have thrown away the viſible and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſeals of the covenant of grace? When did God make, and own a covenant with a people, without exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſeals? As ſoon as the covenant of grace was made with <hi>Adam</hi> and his ſeed, God enjoins the offering of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices; which as they were types and ſhadows of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his ſacrifice; ſo they could be no leſs ſeals, or ratify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tokens of the covenant of grace; for they confirmed the way of ſalvation by blood and ſacrifice; and therefore they could be no leſs than confirming tokens of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant

I very well know the arguments the <hi>Friends</hi> uſe againſt the external ſeals of the covenant; but my deſign is not to enter into debates with every ſect of profeſſors; but to ſuggeſt the reaſons why we cannot unite; and the injury our diſcord doth to <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s kingdom; the peace of the church in general; and the general good of the world. And O my ſoul, how can the chriſtian world unite with a people, which we cannot prove, are viſibly in the covenant of grace? And who can prove to us, that the <hi>Friends</hi> (as they chooſe to call themſelves) are they and their infant offspring, in ſaid covenant? Neither of the churches diſtinct from them, can receive them for members; admit them to their communion, or to ſit at the Lord's table (if they would deſire the privilege) until they are baptized: And could we poſſibly prove God made the covenant with <hi>Adam</hi> and his ſeed, and <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed, and ſo prove a univerſal redemption, from their all being in covenant? If there had been no other evidence of their being in covenant, than there is that the <hi>Friends</hi> are in covenant with God; we ſurely could not. It won't do for men to tell us they are in covenant; God muſt tell us ſo, or we have no right to believe; and God ſaith, they were added to the church by baptiſm, <hi>Acts</hi> ii. 41. and <hi>Chriſt</hi> has promis'd to be with no people as a

For it is by this mode of adminiſtration, the church is rendered vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; and this coming in the room of circumciſion, as <hi>Col.</hi> ii. 11, 12. Sealing the covenant, as a covenant of promiſe to us, and our infants; we are by this means grafted in with the remnant of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were never broken off becauſe of unbelief, and with them grafted in by baptiſm, we partake of the root and fatneſs of their covenant ſtate; and as the promiſe is yet general to the father, child and ſervant, ſo we can yet prove ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral redemption, under all the adminiſtrations of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace; which we could not do, if the promiſe was not to us, and our ſeed, in the ſame manner, that it was to <hi>Adam,</hi> and his ſeed; to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his ſeed; and theſe things can be proved with reſpect to neither of the diſpenſations of the covenant of grace; but only by the external mode of the adminiſtration of the covenant: For it is by the viſible ſeals of the covenant, that God tells us who they are that he owns for his covenant people. Hence we that are God's viſible covenant peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, can never unite with thoſe called the <hi>Friends,</hi> as a viſible church of God; for we have nothing to prove, that God hath diſpenſed the covenant in the goſpel day, without viſible ſeals; but much to the contrary. And O my ſoul, who can ceaſe to lament for our dear <hi>Zion;</hi> when ſocieties are rent from her communion, by tearing the ſeals from the covenant of grace; introducing anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy or confuſion, into <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s kingdom; and deſtroying the general peace of the church?

And if infants are not in the church, they belong not to <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s kingdom; and we have ſeen in the doctrine, how unwilling God was, there ſhould be a race of uncovenanted people: How highly did God reſent the conduct of <hi>Moſes;</hi> when he would go to bring his covenant people out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> when he would go to be a guide to others; and had neglected to guide his own family? <hi>The Lord met him, and ſought to kill him,</hi> Ex. iv. 24. and what is the matter? Why <hi>Moſes,</hi> that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded of God's covenant care of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſeed, won't remember the care of God to his own ſeed; has forgot that every man child that is not circumciſed, ſhall be cut off from God's people, as a breaker of God's covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> xvii. 14. And here we ſee, this curſe firſt falls on the parent; however the child may periſh in the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw. But it is impoſſible, the whole world can ever be <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s viſible kingdom, in this world, according to the <hi>Anabaptiſt</hi> faith; unleſs we can find an age, in which there are no infants; and it would be ſtrange for God to deſtroy the power of generation, in order that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould have a general kingdom, or reign in this world. However, if God deſtroy the power of generation, for one age, <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s general reign can't be long; for there will be nobody to reign over, in the next; unleſs God raiſe the dead: It can't be a thouſand years, unleſs men live much longer than in theſe days; and how can the

And O, how ſorrowful is it, that men ſhould be found to caſt their children out of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s kingdom! and that which ſeparates <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s kingdom from him, or any part of it; can never make his kingdom general.

Or that he will alter the terms of the covenant, and take them in without faith? Or that he will reign over them out of covenant, as tho' they were in it?

The church of <hi>Chriſt</hi> may be ſure, theſe are people of extraordinary talents; eſpecially when as we learn (if we will credit them) they can do more than God: For God tells us, he could not work ſix days, and keep ſabbath at the ſame time; therefore did not keep ſabbath, until the ſix days work was done; and began ſabbath with reſting from his works. Theſe people take pains to prove the ſabbath was a ſign (which no perſon ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied that I know of) and that all ſigns are aboliſhed; and is it not wonderful, thoſe who are ſo great <hi>ſcripto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> that they cannot find one word in the bible for keeping a weekly ſabbath; have not found the bow in

And why don't they tell the world (for they are fond. to make proſelytes) when, and where the fourth command was aboliſhed? And when they declare, they can't find one word in the bible for keeping a ſabbath, eſpecially the chriſtian ſabbath, or Lord's day; what do they more than the <hi>Jews,</hi> who cannot find one word in the bible, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> whom they, or their fathers crucified, is <hi>Chriſt?</hi> Surely if they were not blind, they might find a great many words in the bible, to keep the Lord's day, or firſt day of the week, for the chriſtian ſabbath; for it is too evident to be denied, that more ſabbaths were kept to commemorate <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s redemption, when it was only wrought in figure, or repreſented to be done, than ever were kept to commemorate the works of creation. The children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were commanded to keep every ſeventh year for ſabbath, <hi>Lev.</hi> xxv. 4. and that was as much as every ſeventh day, take time by the bulk; and the fifti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth year, or jubilee, is overplus, ver. 8, 9, 10, 11. add to theſe the paſſover, <hi>ſeven</hi> days in a year; and the feaſt of tabernacles, <hi>eight;</hi> Levit. xxiii. 5, 41, 42<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> alſo the tenth day of the ſeventh month, called the day of attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ver. 27, 28. Now all theſe ſabbaths were inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted to commemorate <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s redemption; as may be ſeen by a little attention.

Theſe two goats figured <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s death and reſurrection, or that our ſaviour muſt die, and yet bear away our ſins alive, ver. 21, 22. this was done but once in a year; and God declares he will

And that every ſeventh year, as well as the fiftieth year, were kept to commemorate <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, appears, for that theſe years of ſabbaths, and religious years, began on this day of attonement: The trumpet of the jubilee was to found on the tenth day of the ſeventh month; which was the firſt day of the jubilee year, ſee <hi>Lev.</hi> xxv. 9, 10. Now as the jubilee year began the next day after the laſt day of the 49th; which was alſo a ſabbatic year; the 49th year, muſt have begun on the ſame day of the civil year, that the fiftieth year did; and of undeniable conſequence, all the foregoing years of ſabbaths, muſt begin on the ſame tenth day of the ſeventh month, or day of attonement. Now all theſe ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial ſabbaths, were inſtituted for no other end or deſign, but to teach the chriſtian world, that the day of attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or the day in which he was to finiſh his work of redemption, ſhould be the weekly ſabbath. Until this work is actually done, the ſeventh day ſabbath can't give place; and one day in ſeven for reſt and ſabbath, is enough for God and men; but yet, when <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s work of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption is repreſented to be done, leſt men ſhould think God did not deſign as much regard ſhould be paid to <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s works of redemption, as to his own of creation, he inſtitutes theſe hand writings of ordinances, which the apoſtle ſaith were againſt us, <hi>Col.</hi> ii. 14. and they were ſurely againſt the church, in ſome ſenſe; as were circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, and all the coſtly offerings and ſacrifices; hence called a <hi>heavy yoke,</hi> Acts v. 10. God before the fall, allowed men ſix days to work; and one in ſeven to reſt; and to be devoted purely to divine worſhip: When men were fallen, they ſurely wanted as much time to work, as before the fall; whereas God allows them (while theſe ceremonial ſabbaths laſt) more than a day in a week leſs: And what abominable perverſion muſt it be to ſay, one day in ſeven for a ſabbath is againſt the church, becauſe ſo many were? And then to place the fourth command among ceremonial laws; and ſay a weekly ſabbath was
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:008874_0118_1030965E3B1F8750"/>aboliſhed with them. But can the chriſtian world think, <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s moſt glorious reign will be among a people, that won't allow him to be their law giver, as to the time of divine worſhip; and uſe ſo free with the Lord of the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath; who made the weekly ſabbath for man, <hi>Mark</hi> ii. 27, 28<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as to tell him, one day in a week for a ſabbath is an ordinance againſt the church? Becauſe God makes ſo free with them, as to tell them, two days and a half in a week for ſabbath, is againſt them; and as ſoon as <hi>Chriſt</hi> has ſuffered, he will lighten their yoke; therefore they ſhall tell him, one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> a week, is too heavy a yoke for man to bear: And will neither keep the ſabbath themſelves; nor allow others to keep it, if they could help it. And when they are puniſhed for breaking the laws of God and men, in going ſabbath after ſabbath, ſeveral miles to work, where they have nothing to do, but only to be taken notice of; when they are fined, they cry out of perſecution. Alas, alas, how hath error and ſchiſm deſtroyed the peace of <hi>Zion!</hi> and when ſhall <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> become a quiet habitation; and there ſhall be none to hurt or deſtroy, in all God's holy mountain; but the knowledge of God ſhall cover the earth?</p>
