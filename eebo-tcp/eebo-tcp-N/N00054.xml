            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe knowledge of Divinity is necessary for all sorts of men, both to settle and establish the good, and to convert and fetch in the bad. Gods principles pulls down Sathan false principles set up in mens heads, loved and believed with mens hearts, and defended by their tongues whilst strong holds remain unshaken, the Lord Jesus is kept off from conquering of the soul.</p>
            <p>Now spiritual Truths are either such as tend to enlarge the understanding, or such as may work chiefly upon the affections. I pass by (in this known age) the first of these and (being among a people whose hearts are hard enough) I being with the latter sort: For the understanding, although it may literally, yet it never savingly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains any truth, until the affections be therewith smitten and wrought upon.</p>

               <p>Now, there are two sorts of people that are ignorant of this their misery.</p>
               <p>First, the common sort of prophane, blockish, ignorant people.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the finer sort of unsound hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low professors, that have a peacoks pride,

that think themselves fair, and in a very good estate, though they have but one feather on their brest to boast of.</p>
               <p>I will begin with the first sort, and show you the reasons why they are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of their misery, that is for these four reasons.</p>
               <p>First, sometimes because they want the saving means of knowledge. There is no faithful Minister, no compassionate <hi>Lot,</hi> to tell them of fire and brimstone from heaven, for their crying sins. There is no <hi>Noah</hi> to forwarn them of a flood: There is no messenger to bring them tydings of those armies of Gods devouring plagues and wrath, that are appro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They have either no Minister at all to reach them, either because the Parish is too poor, or the Church-living too great to maintain a faithfull man (the strongest asses car<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And know not what to preach, unless they should follow the steps of Master <hi>Latimers</hi> Fryer, or at the best, they shoot off a few pot guns against gross sins: or if they do show men their misery, they lick them whole again, with some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table

ill applyed sentences: (but <hi>I</hi> hope better things of you, my brethren) the mans Patron may haply storm else. Or else they say commonly, thou hast sinned, but comfort thy self, despair not, Christ hath suffered: And thus skin over the wound, and let it fester within, for want of cutting it deeper. I say therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they want a faithful watch man to cry, <hi>Fire, fire,</hi> in that sleepy estate of sin and darkness wherein they ly; therefore whole Towns, Parishes, generations of men, are burnt up, and perish miserably, <hi>Lament.</hi> 2.14.</p>

                  </gap> of heart that which you fear a little now.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, because if they be free from this foolish fear, they cannot see their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery, by reason that they look upon their

               <p>Which false principles, are these prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally: I will but name them.</p>

               <p>Secondly, because they feel no misery,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> but are very well, therefore they fear none.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, because God blesseth them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> in their outward estates, in their corn, children, calling, friends, &amp;c. would God bless them so if he did not love them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, because they think sin to be no great evil, for all are sinners, for this cannot mischieve them.</p>
               <p>Fifthlie, because they think Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5:"/> is above all his works, though sin be vile, yet conceiving God to be all mercie, all honey, and no justice, they think they are well.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, because they think Christ died for all sinners, and they confess themselves <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> to be great ones.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, because they hope well, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> so think to have well.</p>
               <p>Eightly, because they do as most do,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> who never crying out of their sins while they lived, and dying like lambs, at last
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:000093_0113_0FA0164F6DF5A7D0"/>
they doubt not for their parts, but doing as such do, they shall die happily, as others have done.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, because their <hi>desires</hi> and <hi>hearts</hi> are good, as they think.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, because they do as well as God will give them grace, and so God is in the fault only, if they perish.</p>
               <p>These are the reasons and grounds up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which prophane people are deceived.</p>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, hereupon the soul cometh to be affected, and to taste the goodness and sweetness of Jesus Christ, as those did, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. and the soul breaketh out into a passionate admiration: Oh! that ever there should be any hope for such a vile wretch as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, hereupon the soul being comforted after it was wounded, now cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth God, <hi>my God,</hi> and Christ, <hi>my sweet Savior,</hi> and now it doubteth not but it shal be saved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Why? because I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived much comfort after much sorrow and doubting, <hi>Hos.</hi> 8.2.3. and yet remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth a deluded miserable creature still, But here mark the difference between the witness of each spirit. The <hi>false spirit</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a man believe he is in the state of grace, and shal be saved, because he hath <hi>tasted</hi> of Christ, and so hath been comforted, and that abundantly: But the <hi>true spirit</hi> perswadeth a man, his estate is
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:000093_0142_0FA0166E9D902938"/>
good and safe, because he hath not only tasted, but bought this Christ, as the wise merchant in the Gospel, that rejoyced he had found the pearl, but yet stayeth not here, but selleth away all, and <hi>buyeth</hi> the pearl. Like two Chapmen that come to buy wine, the one tasteth it, and goeth away in a drunken fit, and so concludeth it is his: So a man doth that hath the false spirit: but the true spirited man doth not only taste, but buyeth the wine, although he doth not drink it all down, when he cometh to taste it: yet he having been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by tasting to buy it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>Again, the false spirit having given a man comfort and peace, suffereth a man to rest in that estate; but the true Spirit ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made the soul t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now the soul cryeth out. <hi>What shal I do for Christ that hath done wonders for me?</hi> If every hair of my head were a tongue to speak of his goodness, it were too little, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 8.10. The joy of the Lord is our strength,

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> IV, <hi>False applying of true promises,</hi> is the last cause of false peace. And when a man hath Gods Spirit within, and Gods hand and promise (as he thinketh) for his estate, now he thinketh all safe. This did the <hi>Jews,</hi> they said, <hi>We have Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham to our father</hi>: and so reputed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves safe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God having made them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise: I <hi>will be a God of thee, and of thy seed.</hi> But here is a difference between a child of Gods application of them and a wicked mans: the first applyeth them so to him, as that he liveth upon them, and nothing but them: and to whom doth the dug belong,<note place="margin">Psal. 38<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 19.</note> but to the child that liveth upon it? The other liveth upon his lusts and creatures, and yet catcheth hold on the promise.</p>
               <p>By these four means is begot a bastard false peace.</p>

of <hi>the will,</hi> which is the third cause why men deceive themselves, which are many, I will only name three.</p>
               <p>First, when the <hi>will</hi> is resolved to go on in a sinful course, and then setteth the understanding a work to defend it: whence it fareth with the soul, as with a man that cometh to search for stollen goods, who having received a bribe afore-hand, sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth every where but where it is, and so the man is never found out to be what he is: So a man having tasted the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of a sinful course (which pleasure bribes him) he is contented to search into every corner of his heart, and to try him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, as many do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> except <hi>ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> where his darling lust lyeth, <hi>he sitteth upon that,</hi> and covereth it willingly from his own eyes, as <hi>Rachel</hi> did upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ollen goods, and so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver findeth out himself, <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ohn</hi> 3.20. A man that hath a mind to sleep quietly, will cause the curtains to be drawn, and will let some light come in, but shutteth out all that, or so much as may hinder him from sleeping: So a man having a mind to sleep in some particular sinful course at his ease, will search himself, and let some light come into his mind.</p>
               <p>And hence many prophane persons, that know much, their opinions are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox, their discourse savory, yet do they know little of themselves, and of those
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:000093_0145_0FA01671423A8A98"/>
sins and lusts that haunt them, which they must part with, because this light troubleth them, it hindereth them from sleeping in their secure estate, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they draw the curtain here. Hence many men that live in those sins of the grossest usury, finding the gain, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting the sweet of that sin, will read all books, go to all those Ministers they suppose that hold it lawful, and so pick up and gather reasons to defend the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of the sin, and so because they would not have it to be a sin, find out reasons whereby they think it no sin: but the bottom is this, their will hath got the bribe, and now the understanding playeth the Lawyer; and hence men live in the most crying sins, and are sure to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, because they will not know they are in an error.</p>
               <p>Secondly, when the will setteth the understanding a work to extenuate and lessen sin; for many when they see their sin, yet maketh it smal, by looking at the false end of their optick glass, they think such smal matters never make any breach between the Lord and their souls. Hence they say, <hi>The best man sinneth seven times a day:</hi> and <hi>who can say my, heart is clean?</hi> What is the reason that a child of God hath little peace many times after com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of smal sins? Oh! it is because
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:000093_0146_0FA0167209015028"/>
they see the horrible nature of the least sin, smal wrongs against so dear,<note place="margin">The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why men ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</note> so great a friend as the Lord is, it cutteth their hearts; yet a carnal heart is never trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for great sins, because they make a light matter of them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, wilful ignorance of the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible wrath of God. Hence men rush on in sin, as the horse in the battle. Hence men never fear their estates, because they know not Gods wrath hanging over them. Coldest snakes when they are fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen with cold, never sting nor hurt, one may carry a nest of them in his bosom; but bring them to the fire, then they hiss and sting: so sin, when it is brought near Gods wrath (that devouring fire) it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth men cry out of themselves, Then I am undone: Oh! I am a lost creature! But being not thus heated, sin never ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a man cry out of himself.</p>
               <p>These are the causes why men are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of their woful miserable e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Yet there are three more dangerous, because more secret.</p>
               <p>Now followeth the second reason of mens ruine. By reason of mans <hi>carnal security,</hi> whereby men cannot be affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with, not so much as have hearts to desire to come out of their misery, when

               <p>Because God poureth not out the full measure of his grace upon men, because he kindleth not the pile of wrath that lyeth upon men: it is reserved and concealed, <hi>not revealed from heaven,</hi> and so long, let God frown, Ministers threaten, and smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler judgements drop, yet they will never seek shelter in Jesus Christ, but sleep in their sins, until God rain down floods of horror, blood, fire; untill Gods arrows stick in mens hearts,<note place="margin">
