            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>IN the following Letters the reader will not meet with a day relation of events merely military. The Author, avoiding the naked brevity and minute preciſion of a camp Journal, occaſionally adverts to the natural hiſtory, and politics of America, as well as to the religion, national character, and cuſtoms of the inhabitants.</p>
            <p>Some pains ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e been taken, in this tranſlation, to retain, if poſſible, the ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> and philoſophical manner of the French original, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n deviates from the common line of ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple narration, and introduces ſentiment as well as deſcription.</p>
            <p>The Author appears to be a philoſopher, and though many of his ideas on religion, politics, genius of the people &amp;c. may be diſſonant from our mode of thinking on theſe points, in America, and ſometimes perhaps really ill founded, yet there is certainly more ſatisfaction in diſcovering what opinion a foreigner entertains of us, although only from a caſual acquaintance, a tranſient viſit to the country, than in reading the beſt accounts and narratives of our own, which, in ſuch matters, may be ſuſpected of being too ready to humour our local prejudices, or flatter our vanity.</p>
            <p>They who would ſaunter over half the Globe to copy the inſcription on an antique column, to meaſure the altitude of a pyramid, or deſcribe the ornaments on the Grand Seignior's State Turban, will ſcarcely find any thing in American Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels to gratify their t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb facs="unknown:018167_0004_0FA55EB5B9274578"/>
or read the travels of others with ſatisfaction, through this country.</p>
            <p>Moſt of thoſe accounts of North-America, given to the public by Britiſh explorators and others, previous to the Revolution, are generally taken up, with the recital of wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful adventures, in the woods beyond the Lakes, or with the Hiſtories and records of the wild Indian nations, ſo that by the time the reader gets through one of thoſe performances he never fails to be better acquainted with the <hi>Ottagamies, Cherokees, Miamees, Na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Our French Author is more liberal—two years before the preſent peace he conſidered the United-States as a great inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent nation, advancing with haſty ſtrides to the ſummit of power and ſovereignty.</p>
            <p>Conciſe, yet curious accounts of two of the greateſt events that have happened in this or any other age, will be found in the following performance: theſe cannot fail of attracting ſome ſhare of the reader's attention, not only becauſe they were the viſible means of accelerating an independence, which, according to probability, and in the natural courſe of human affairs, was the taſk of another century, but alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the philoſophers both of America and of Europe, in conſequence of the pacification thereby effected, have their ideas upon the ſtretch, carefully anticipating the commercial, and political advantages, or diſadvantages, reſulting from this very extraordinary Revolution.</p>

I believe I have ſuffered as much from this nauſeous complaint as any perſon that ever went to ſea, and notwithſtanding the frequent uſe of acids, it for a long time
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:018167_0010_0FA55EBA2EE5FB40"/>
wholly prevented me from attending to any kind of buſineſs, or paying a particular attention to the many objects that ſurrounded me. Languiſhing with weakneſs, and confined to the narrow bounds of this floating priſon, hearing nothing from morning till night but the barbarous phraſes peculiar to the ſea and ſailors, I was in no condition to obſerve or reflect upon the awful beauties of the ocean, or the grandeur of the ſcene around me. With per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect indifference I beheld it toſſing, boiling and foaming; ſwelling into mountains, or jumbled into a chaos of confuſion; its vapour exhaling into the air, or forming artificial rainbows about our veſſel, while it at the ſame time menaced us with deſtruction. With little or no emotion, I ſaw it abate of its rage, grow ſmooth, extend the limits of the horizon, and preſently reſemble an immenſe maſs of oil, ſtill however retaining its undulation. But it was difficult for me to withhold my attention from thoſe ſcintillations of light, which the moſt inconſiderable motion in the water ſtruck out of obſcurity; they were particularly remarkable when a freſh g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>e drove the veſſel through the water with an increaſed rapidity; ſhe then ſeemed to plunge into torrents of flaming phoſphorus, and to be making a tremendous progreſs through plains of liquid fire. I revolved in my own mind, what could be the cauſe of this ſingular, though common appearance, which I believe has never been thoroughly inveſtigated: Are they atoms of ſalt which, from their ſeveral ſurfaces, reflect the rays of light? Or is it their colliſion with the ſulphurous particles, that kindles them into flame, or are they rather the igneous fluid, the radical fire that is ſuppoſed to be the firſt cauſe of fluidity in the other elements?</p>
               <p>We ſteered a ſoutherly courſe till we came to the 30th. degree of North Latitude. The ſea in this climate appeared to me to have more of a greeniſh caſt than before, and to abound throughout with this fire reſembling phoſphorus; we there ſaw the goldfiſh, the voracious dolphin, and the flying fiſh, which to eſcape the former, flies out of the water, but falls down again as ſoon as the air has dried the moiſture on its wings. I did not know the galley fiſh, tho' common enough on our coaſts; but the ſailors caught one, which I examined with the moſt ſcrupulous attention. Nature has given it a bladder, which buoys it up and ſerves as a rudder to direct its courſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>; its whole contexture is nothing more than a ſlimy maſs, the organiſation of which I had not time thoroughly to conſider; it is provided with long fibres encircled with rings, which ſerve to give it a hold in the water, ſo as not to be driven away by the violence of the wind; and through theſe fibres they alſo ſuck up the food that ſerves for their ſubſiſtence. I touched this animal with my finger, and immediately had the painful ſenſation of a burn, ard forty-eight hours afterwards I ſtill felt the effects of this penetrating cauſtic.</p>
               <p>In fine weather I uſed to take great pleaſure, at night, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating the grand proſpect of the ſtarry firmament over our heads; but the wonted order and regularity of the Heavens was
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:018167_0011_0FA55EBB208122F0"/>
wholly altered; the ecliptic circle had withdrawn itſelf a great diſtance from the Horizon, the pole-ſtar had approached very near thereto, and the great Bear was about ſetting and concealing himſelf entirely from our view: what ſurpriſed me moſt, was, that the milky way had diſappeared, although I plainly perceived the conſtellation of the <hi>Swan</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is known to have its place in the midſt of it—I could wiſh the philoſophers would explain this aſtronomical myſtery, thoſe eſpecially who argue that the <hi>Galaxy</hi> is nothing more than an immenſe collection of ſtars; for why ſhould theſe ſtars diſappear, when all the reſt of the heavenly bodies are viſible here as well as in other places?—I now no longer wondered at the idea of the ancients about the riſing and ſetting of the ſun in the ocean:</p>
               <p>Being often forced for the ſake of freſh air to be upon deck at the time of his appearing or diſappearing, I obſerved him ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times detaching himſelf ſlowly from the line that bounded the ſkies and waters, and at other times falling perpendicularly into the midſt of the waves; the eye, with a momentary deception, perſuading itſelf that the Horizon was plunging after the great luminary.—</p>
               <p>The ſea, you well know, has plants and herbage peculiar to itſelf; it is remarkable that nature has formed them conſiderably different from land vegetables in colour, ſhape and properties; and if of a leſs delicate ſtructure, it was doubtleſs ordered ſo becauſe ſhe did not intend this element to produce animals as precious and ſo exquiſitely wrought as the other. The marine plants, however, are not without evident traces of the wiſe hand that formed them; I often ſaw the ſea covered with theſe ſaline herbs for a great ſpace, and in examining them, remarked among other things that inſtead of fibrous roots, they had parts ſomewhat like hands to attach themſelves to the rocks, a ſtem flatted at the end, and thick leaves, the better to reſiſt the ſhock of the waves; and all provided at ſmall intervals with cells nearly empty of air, which by this means counterpoiſed their ſpecific weight, and forced them to tend con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly in a perpendicular direction toward the ſurface of the water.</p>
               <p>I cannot give you a competent idea of the agreeable emotions I experienced at the ſight of land, which at firſt appeared like a thin miſt at the very extremity of the Horizon. What moment of life is comparable to that when a man is upon the point of re-enjoying his health, coming within reach of objects which intereſt the mind, the heart and the ſenſes, and finding, inſtead of a late chaos and the ghaſtly image of deſtruction, a world of nature everywhere organized into the moſt elegant ſymmetry and perfection—to walk upon the graſſy plain, to breathe the perfume of a thouſand flowers, to enjoy the ſhade of the trees, to liſten to the harmony of the birds of the grove, and to ſee them ſoar aloft and poiſe themſelves in the air!</p>

                  <pb n="12" facs="unknown:018167_0012_0FA55EBBB1E3ED48"/>It is abſence from theſe enjoyments that makes their value the better known, and that ſwells the ſoul with gratitude to the benign creator of all, when we are reſtored to them. A leafy branch float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the ſurface of the water made my heart leap with joy, as this was the token of a new world r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The inſide of the town does not at all leſſen the idea that is formed by an exterior proſpect: a ſuperb wharf has been carried out above two thouſand feet into the ſea, and is broad enough for ſtores and work-ſhops through the whole of its extent; it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates at right angles with the principal ſtreet of the town, which is both large and ſpacious, and bends in a curve parallel to the harbour; this ſtreet is ornamented with elegant buildings, for the moſt part two or three ſtories high, and many other ſtreets terminate in this, communicating with it on each ſide. The form and conſtruction of the houſes would ſurpriſe a European eye; they are built of brick, and wood, not in the clumſy and melancholy t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But that enthuſiaſm, which firſt gave birth to the ſect, is now in a great meaſure ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed; ſo that we muſt take them as they are in the preſent age, to form a proper opinion of them.</p>
               <p>Such virtues as the above, in which the Quakers are ſaid to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, have been more prevalent among them and of longer duration in America, than elſewhere, becauſe the climate and the life they lead is favourable thereto.</p>
               <p>Piety, is not the only motive that brings the American Ladies in crowds to the various places of worſhip. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of all ſhows and public diverſions whatever, the church is the grand theatre where they attend, to diſplay their extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance and finery. There they come dreſſed off in the fineſt ſilks, and over-ſhadowed with a profuſion of the moſt ſuperb plumes. The hair of the head is raiſed and ſupported upon cuſhions to an extravagant height, ſomewhat reſembling the manner in which the French ladies wore their hair ſome years ago. Inſtead of powdering, they often waſh the head, which anſwers the purpoſe well enough, as their hair is commonly of an agreeable light colour; but the more faſhionable among them begin now to adopt the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent

European method, of ſetting off the head to the beſt advantage. They are of a large ſize, well proportioned, their features general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly regular, and their complexion fair, without ruddineſs. They have leſs cheerfulneſs and eaſe of behaviour, than the ladies of France, but more of greatneſs and dignity; I have even imagined that I have ſeen ſomething in them, that anſwers to the ideas of beauty we gain from thoſe maſter-pieces of the artiſts of antiquity, which are yet extant in our days. The ſtature of the men is tall, and their carriage erect, but their make is rather ſlim, and their colour inclining to pale. They are not ſo curious in their dreſs as the women, but every thing upon them is neat and proper. At twenty-five years of age, the women begin to loſe the bloom and freſhneſs of youth; and at thirty-five or forty, their beauty is gone.</p>
               <p>The decay of the men is equally premature, and I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to think that life itſelf is here proportionably ſhort.

               <p>Boſton is ſituated on a peninſula, upon a deſcent towards the ſea ſide; this peninſula is connected witn the continent only by a neck of land, which at full tide is not more than the breadth of a high way, ſo that it would be no difficult matter to render this a place of great ſtrength. Hard by is an eminence which commands the whole town, upon which the Boſtonians have built a kind of light-Houſe or beacon, of a great height, with a barrel of tar fixed at the top, ready to ſet fire to in caſe of an attack. At ſuch a ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, more than forty thouſand men would take arms, and be at the gates of the town in leſs than twenty-four hours.</p>
               <p>From hence may be ſeen the ruins of Charleſtown, which was burnt by the Engliſh, on the 17th of June, 1775, at the battle of Bunker's Hill—a melancholy proſpect, calculated to keep up in the breaſts of the Boſtonians, the ſpirit and ſentiments of liberty. This town was ſeparated from the peninſula only by <hi>Charles</hi> river, and was built in the angle formed by the junction of this river with the <hi>Myſtic.</hi> The buildings in it were good, the whole ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being fortified to advantage, and ſeems to have been about half as big as Boſton.</p>
               <p>The harbour of this laſt mentioned city, can receive more than five hundred ſail of veſſels, but the entrance is difficult and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, being only a channel about the breadth of three ſhips. Some ſtrong batteries, erected upon one of the adjacent iſlands, protect the road, and conſequently relieve the town from any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of an inſult from an enemy by ſea. The capes that

diſpoſed of their ſhips and cargoes together, and went over to England to purchaſe their manufactures, which they tranſported to America in Engliſh Bottoms, and thus the mother country increaſed, by the American commerce, the value of her own commodities, while ſhe ſupplied them only with articles of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption. By this double exchange with the Americans, the Engliſh manufactures were in great demand, although they could not be afforded ſo cheap as thoſe of other nations, owing to the exceſſive price of labour in England. Their fiſheries, their trade, and the vaſt number of veſſels they built has rendered them the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers of all the Northern colonies.</p>
               <p>It is computed that from 1748 to 1749, incluſive, there were 500 veſſels employed from this port in foreign commerce, and inward entries were made of 430; and the coaſting and fiſhing veſſels amounted to at leaſt 1000. It appears however that after this, as a certain Engliſh author remarks, their commerce had declined.</p>
               <p>In 1738 forty-one ſhips were built at Boſton making in the whole 6380 tons; in 1743 were built 28; in 1746 twenty; in 1749 fifteen, amounting in all to 2450 tons. This decreaſe in the commerce of Boſton probably aroſe from ſeveral new eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that had been formed along the coaſt, which drew to themſelves thoſe different branches of trade which their ſeveral ſituations favoured them in.</p>
               <p>The great demand for rum among the Americans led them to form connexions with the French Colonies: and our wines and brandies making this liquor of ſmall requeſt among us, they flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered themſelves that they could import molaſſes to advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. This attempt ſucceeded beyond their expectations, although they had nothing to give in exchange but lumber, and ſome ſalt proviſions. But the Engliſh government perceiving the injury its own iſlands thereby ſuffered, prohibited this commerce entirely. The colonies, upon this, complained bitterly, and repreſented, that by hindering them from exporting the productions of their ſoil to what port they pleaſed, they would be rendered unable to pay for thoſe indiſpenſably neceſſary articles, which they purchaſed at an exorbitant price in England.</p>
               <p>The government then took a middle way; permitted them the exportation of lumber, and loaded french ſugar and other foreign commodities imported, with very heavy duties. But this did not yet ſatisfy the colonies: they conſidered the mother country in the light of a jealous and avaricious ſtep-mother, watching every opportunity to turn to her own advantage thoſe channels of gain, which would have enabled them to live in eaſe and plenty. This was one of the principal cauſes of the miſunderſtanding between England and her colonies; from thenceforward the latter perceived what a change independence would make in their favour, and France was by no means ignorant of the political advantages that would accrue to her from ſuch a revolution.</p>

You will eaſily conclude, that in ſuch a new nation as this, theſe pieces muſt fall infinitely ſhort of that perfection to which our European literary productions of this kind are wrought up; but ſtill, they have a greater effect upon the mind than the beſt of ours would have among them, becauſe thoſe manners and cuſtoms are delineated, which are peculiar to themſelves, and the events are ſuch as intereſt them above all others: The drama is here reduced to its true and ancient origin. <note n="*" place="bottom">We confine our theatrical pieces either to fabulous heroes, the characters and manners of which have little or no reſemblance to ours, and whoſe actions we can take no part in, or elſe draw our pictures of life from that claſs in ſociety which are the leaſt numerous, I mean the great and rich.

The Greeks, whom we have badly imitated, were in theſe points much more rational; all their dramatical ſubjects had a reference to their own mythology, form of worſhip, government, and the manners and cuſtoms of the ſeveral States; hence, their theatrical pieces could be ſupported without love fictions, or an abſurd mixture of incidents. Much has been ſaid about depravity of taſte, perverſion of manners, and ſo on, when the Pariſians have been found to forſake the great theatres, and run to foreign exhibitions. But people deceive themſelves in this matter; thoſe who flocked thither, with the greateſt eagerneſs, were people moſt engaged in buſineſs, and conſequently leſs corrupted in their manners than the great. Licentiouſneſs was not their motive, but the pleaſure of beholding the real ſcenes of life repreſented. Things intereſt us only ſo far as they reſemble our own circumſtances, and condition. The artiſt, who drew the picture repreſenting the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſment and confuſion of <hi>Paris,</hi> when about to leave the fair Helen, and the impetuoſity of Hector reproaching him with his ſoftneſs and effeminacy, forces me to admire his divine art in the handling of the ſubject, in the juſtneſs of the deſign, and in the life and harmony of the colouring: but <hi>Grenze,</hi> perhaps a leſs finiſhed genius, and leſs regular, makes me tremble at the unnatural view of a father curſing his ſon, and does not even give me time to admire his beauties.</note>

                  <pb n="19" facs="unknown:018167_0019_0FA55EC6ECE7DD68"/>It is difficult to imagine what a ſtrange idea the Americans had of the inhabitants of France, prior to the war; they looked upon them as a people bowed down beneath the yoke of deſpotiſm, given up to ſuperſtition, ſlavery, and prejudice, mere idolaters in their public worſhip, and, in ſhort, a kind of light, nimble machines, deformed to the laſt degree, incapable of any thing ſolid or conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; entirely taken up with the dreſſing of their hair, and paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their faces; without delicacy or fidelity, and paying no reſpect even to the moſt ſacred obligations.—The Engliſh, it ſeems, were pleaſed to diſſeminate theſe prejudices amongſt them, and confirm them therein; Preſbyterianiſm, a moſt bitter enemy to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Faith, had likewiſe rendered the Boſtonians, among whom this ſect is predominant, more ready to liſten to and believe them.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of the war, every thing ſeemed to concur to ſtrengthen theſe prejudices. The greater part of the French, who came into America at the firſt appearance of the revolution, were men loaded with debts, and ruined at home in their reputation; and yet, by aſſuming titles and fictitious names, they obtained diſtinguiſhing ranks in the American army, received advances of money to a conſiderable amount, and then immediately diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared. The ſimplicity of the Americans, added to their little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The firſt commodities, too, that the Boſtonians received from France, contributed, by their bad quality, to ſuggeſt unfavoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ideas reſpecting our upright dealing, and induſtry. For this reaſon, only, thoſe goods which were imported hither from France,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:018167_0020_0FA55EC7AF199A18"/>
are ſold at a conſiderably lower price than Engliſh articles, not in any reſpect ſuperior.</p>
               <p>At the arrival of the Count D'Eſtaing, the people here were much ſurpriſed to find that the French were not ſuch weak, diminutive and deformed little mortals, as their prejudices had painted them: They however at laſt concluded, that the Count and the people in his fleet, had been picked out on purpoſe, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to give them a more advantageous idea of the nation. Some coloured figures, having accidentally ſtained one of the dreſſing cloths, confirmed them in the opinion, that the French made uſe of vermillion to colour their faces.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding my being known for a Frenchman, and Roman Prieſt, I was continually receiving new civilities from ſeveral of the beſt families in this town; but the people in general retain their old prejudices: I ſaw a remarkable proof of it one day from a trifling occurrence, which at the ſame time ſerved to give me a better idea of their character. The chimney of the houſe I lodged in, and which belonged to a Frenchman, happened to take fire; you may eaſily conceive what an uproar this would occaſion in a town chiefly conſtructed of wood. The people collected in crowds; but after they were told whoſe houſe it was, they remained idle ſpectators of the ſcene. I then cauſed the doors to be ſhut to ſtop the draft of air, and cloſed up the chimney, in which the fire was, with a wet blanket; we alſo threw water down inceſſantly, to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate a moiſture; the women of the houſe, who were Americans, were however, much diſpleaſed at the ſight of the floors, covered with water and foot; and if we had not, in deſpight of them, acted as we thought fit, I think they would rather have had the houſe burnt, than the floors and ceilings ſpoiled.</p>
               <p>We have juſt heard the news of the capture of St. Euſtatius by the Engliſh: without doubt, avarice had a greater ſhare in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing this expedition, than ſound policy. The Americans, not pleaſed with ſuch of the French manufactures as were firſt ſent over, went thither to purchaſe thoſe of the Engliſh, which after the war with Holland, were ſent out to that iſland under neutral flags; and thus they ruined one of their principal branches of commerce, and forced the Americans to have recourſe to our productions, which experience has now taught them to have a more favourable opinion of than before.</p>
               <p>The arrival of the army, under M. le Comte de Rochambeau, at Rhode-Iſland, ſpread a general terror through that place: the fields became mere deſerts, and thoſe whom curioſity led to viſit Newport <note n="*" place="bottom">This is the capital town of the State; the goodneſs of its ſoil and the excellence of its climate have gained it the name of the <hi>Paradiſe</hi> of New-England: its trade was very flouriſhing before the war: Beſides its lumber and ſalt proviſions, which were exported to the Iſlands, they ſent out large quantities of beer, cheeſe, poultry and tallow.</note> could ſcarcely perceive a hum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Every Frenchman ſaw the abſolute neceſſity there was for obliterat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe prejudices, and every one ſacrificed ſomething to his own feelings, in order to accompliſh this deſired end. The ſuperior officers eſtabliſhed the ſtricteſt diſcipline among the troops: and the officers in general manifeſted upon every occaſion that politeneſs and ſweetneſs of behaviour peculiar to the nobility and gentry of France: In conſequence of this the ſoldiery became mild, circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and moderate, and for a whole year there was not a ſingle complaint made.</p>
               <p>The French at Newport were no longer that fickle, preſumptuous, bluſtering, haughty people that prejudice had pictured them; at the entertainments they gave, their whole behaviour was quiet and reſerved, and their converſation confined to the American gueſts, to whom they became every day more and more dear. Theſe young French noblemen, whom fortune, birth, and the habit of a court life, commonly leads to diſſipation, luxury and a love of empty pomp, were the firſt to ſet the example of a ſimple and frugal manner of living; and they now ſhowed themſelves as affable and as courteous to all, as if they had lived their whole lives with theſe citizens, in the quality of equals. This conduct, ſtrictly perſevered in, brought about a total change in the opinions of the Americans, regarding us. Even the Tories <note n="‡" place="bottom">Tories <hi>i. e.</hi> Royaliſts. This word is derived from the Saxon.</note> could not but reſpect the French, altho' they deteſted the cauſe they ſupported, and I am informed they were infinitely more affected with ſorrow at the departure of the army, than they had been alarmed with fear at their arrival.</p>
               <p>The French have in general, been upbraided a long time for paying no regard to the moſt ſacred of all connexions, when their gallantry is concerned. Perhaps Newport may have afforded ſome examples. A French officer, by his attention and aſſiduity, gained the affections of a young and amiable lady. Her huſband, who loved her tenderly, was ſoon convinced of the reality of this new attachment, and altho' afflicted in the moſt ſenſible manner, he did not diſcover his trouble to her either by complaints or reproaches; the reputation of his guilty ſpouſe was ſtill dear to him, and he was even afraid ſhe would diſcover that he had knowledge of her infidelity. "And yet if ſhe continues doubtful of it (ſaid he to a friend) ſhe will give over all hopes of regaining my eſteem; her ruin will of conſequence enſue, and my own peace be ſacrificed: let us then endeavour to awaken her tenderneſs, and recall her to her duty by remorſe for what is paſt." From this moment he became more aſſiduous and complaiſant to her than ever; with ſorrow and deſpair in his ſoul, he ſhowed a countenance ſerene and ſatisfied. He received at his houſe, with attention and civility, the very officer who was the author of his misfortune; but, by the aſſiſtance of a friend, ſo contrived matters, as to hinder him from
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:018167_0022_0FA55EC9320E77E8"/>
any private interviews with her whatever. Theſe repeated diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments appeared to the Frenchman to be mere effects of chance; he, however, grew fallen and peeviſh upon it, and conſequently became leſs amiable in the eyes of the lady, and her huſband more ſo than ever; and thus, that virtue which had not loſt all its claims to her ſeduced heart, ſoon recalled it to its duty. Such a procedure as this, in ſo delicate an affair, diſcovers great knowledge of the human heart, and ſtill more of dominion over itſelf.</p>
               <p>The army left Newport the 9th of June to go, it is ſuppoſed, to the Southward, and they are now actually at Providence. I am juſt ſetting out to join it, and if it continues its march. I make no doubt I ſhall be enabled to entertain you with particulars ſtill more intereſting.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>I FOUND the army at Providence, encamped on a riſing ground. This is a conſiderable town, and pretty well peopled; ſome of the houſes are built of brick and others of wood; it is ſituated at the mouth of the river Patuxit, at the bottom of a bay betwixt the States of Maſſachuſets, Connecticut, and Rhode-Iſland: This ſituation affords it a gainful commerce in corn, maize, lumber, and ſalt proviſions for the Iſlands; there are alſo many veſſels built here.</p>
               <p>This town is the capital of a colony of the ſame name, Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence Plantation, now incorporated with the State of Rhode-Iſland. A certain perſon, named Roger Williams, a miniſter in Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts-Bay, who had been baniſhed by the magiſtrates for preaching up new doctrines, retired to this place with his followers, and founded a colony, giving it the name of <hi>Providence,</hi> in order to preſerve to poſterity, the remembrance of the odious treatment he had experienced. He there lived forty years in a rational ſolitude, wholly taken up with improving this infant ſettlement, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing the Indians; he alſo writ ſome pieces againſt the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and practices of the Quakers, and, in the end, his regular

manner of life, and benevolent conduct forced his enemies to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of the inſults they had offered him. And thus you ſee, ſir, the annals of the new world furniſh examples of an intolerant ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit amongſt a people, who have upon almoſt every other occaſion ſhowed themſelves the greateſt enemies to it.</p>
               <p>How different are the objects that now ſurround me, from thoſe which have hitherto taken up my time and attention! Bred up in the quiet retreats of the arts and ſciences; living conſtantly with thoſe, who either cultivated or patronized them, and always deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to make them the companions of my labours and my plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures —what a change do I experience now, when I am tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the midſt of the hurry of camps; all tumult and commotion around me, and experiencing every moment a thouſand wants! Here I am taught to fix the true value upon uſeful inventions, and diſtinguiſh them from thoſe which are only curious and whimſical. A ſingle ſheet protects me from the inclemency of the weather; and being without books to divert my mind from the fatigues <note n="*" place="bottom">The difficulty of providing a ſufficiency of carriages, and finding proviſion to ſupport the horſes or oxen, obliged Count Rochambeau to order, that no officer ſhould carry with him more than one hundred and fifty pounds weight, including tents, beds, &amp;c and thus it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in our long march, in a country where there are ſo few reſources, that almoſt all of us were in want of ſome one neceſſary or another.</note> I feel, I frequently write, for want of ink, with the juice of an herb: hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, if I could reſt for any length of time in tranquillity—but no ſuch thing—after two in the morning, the drum orders us univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally out of our hard beds; in haſte we roll up our travelling bed-furniture, mount our horſes, and, with the ſlow pace of an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador's train, follow the march of the foot-ſoldiers, bending under the weight of the burden on their backs.</p>
               <p>When, at length, arrived at the place deſtined for our encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we have ſtill to wait during the hotteſt part of the day for the baggage waggons, before we can take any repoſe. The ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Our young Generals, who have been bred in eaſe and delicacy, bear up under theſe fatigues with a degree of reſolution that makes me bluſh for my weakneſs. Whilſt their tables, exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting at the ſame time abundance and frugality, invite the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers to a ſtile of living which the want of domeſtics and other neceſſary means would render it impoſſible for them otherwiſe to enjoy, they encourage the ſoldiery under the ſeverity of duty by marching before them on foot. <note n="§" place="bottom">M. le Vicomte de Noailles has in particular made a whole campaign on foot.</note> What you will moſt wonder at, is,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:018167_0024_0FA55ECAB4096940"/>
that the French never loſe their cheerfulneſs and gaiety in theſe painful and laborious marches. The Americans, whom curioſity brings by thouſands to our camp, are conſtantly received with good humour and feſtivity; and our military muſic, of which they are extravagantly fond, is then played for their diverſion. At ſuch times officers, ſoldiers, Americans, of both ſexes, all inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingle and dance together;—it is the feaſt of equality; and theſe are the firſt fruits of the alliance which is, we hope, to ſubſiſt perpetually between the two nations.</p>
               <p>The fathers of the families melt at the ſight of theſe affecting ſcenes; even thoſe, who when they firſt heard of our marching, viewing us through the medium of prejudice and miſrepreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, had trembled for their poſſeſſions, and for their lives. The <note n="†" place="bottom">Their news-papers, during all our march, have never failed to do juſtice to the diſcipline of our army.</note> ſoldier, inebriated with joy, forgets the fatigues of the morning, nor makes himſelf wretched by anticipating thoſe of to-morrow. Theſe Americans being yet in that ſtage of their national growth, wherein the diſtinctions of birth and rank are ſcarcely known, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the ſoldier and the officer in the ſame point of view, and often aſk the latter, what his <hi>trade</hi> was in his own country; not being able to conceive, that the occupation of a ſoldier may be as fixed and permanent as any trade whatever. The familiar appellation of <hi>brother,</hi> given ſome of them by the Marquis,<note n="*" place="bottom">M. le Marquis de la Fayette is univerſally known to the Americans, by his title of <hi>Marquis.</hi>
                  </note> excited their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity and reſpect to a great degree; and the young American La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies have always conſidered it as one of their greateſt honours, to have danced with that nobleman.</p>
               <p>Whatever may be the future ſucceſs of this army, it will always retain the glory of having made the moſt laſting impreſſions in theſe countries, and rendered the memory of the French name dear and precious to all; an atchievement m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>re flattering to true ambition, and perhaps more difficult to accompliſh, than gaining battles, or ſpreading univerſal conqueſt.</p>
               <p>Before I arrived here, I had no expectations of diſcovering the traces of the French modes and faſhions, in the midſt of the wilds and foreſts of America. The head dreſſes of all the women, except Quakers, are high, ſpreading and decked profuſely with our gauzes: and here I cannot but reflect upon the oddneſs of their taſte, when I find, through the whole ſtate of Connecticut, ſo prevailing an inclination for dreſs, (I may ſay to a degree of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance) with manners at the ſame time ſo ſimple and ſo pure, as to reſemble thoſe of the ancient patriarchal age. Pulſe, Indian corn, and milk are their moſt common kinds of food; they alſo uſe much <hi>tea,</hi> and this ſober infuſion conſtitutes the chief pleaſure of their lives; there is not a ſingle perſon to be found, who does not
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:018167_0025_0FA55ECB719BDC10"/>
drink it out of china cups and ſaucers, and, upon your entering a houſe, the greateſt mark of civility and welcome they can ſhow you, is to invite you to drink it with them. In countries where the inhabitants live upon foods and drinks of the moſt ſubſtantial kind, it may be uſeful to the health, but I believe it is prejudicial in thoſe where they ſubſiſt moſtly on vegetables and milk, eſpecially when the ſoil, yet too much ſhaded by the woods, makes them the leſs nouriſhing; and perhaps this may be one of the cauſes, that with a robuſt and healthy conſtitution, their lives here are much ſhorter than thoſe of the inhabitants of other countries. The loſs of their teeth is alſo attributed to the too frequent uſe of tea; the women, who are commonly very handſome, are often, at eighteen or twenty years of age, entirely deprived of this moſt precious ornament; though, I am of opinion, this premature decay may be rather the effect of warm bread: for the Engliſh, the Flemiſh, and the Dutch, who are great tea drinkers, preſerve their teeth ſound a long time.</p>
               <p>The inhabitants of Connecticut, who raiſe ſuch excellent corn, are, however, ignorant of the valuable art of rendering it more digeſtive, and conſequently more nouriſhing, by thorough fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation and kneading; whenever they want bread, they make a cake, which they ſet to bake at the fire upon a thin iron plate. The French, whom the war brought into America, never could accuſtom themſelves to this kind of bread, but did their endeavour to inſtruct the natives how to bring it nearer to perfection: in the in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s upon the road we found ſome tolerably good, but far inferior even to that made in our army. The inhabitants who reſide at a diſtance from the high-ways preſerve their ancient cuſtoms in this and other particulars with great obſtinacy, and believe no bread in the world to be better or more palatable than their own.</p>
               <p>Scattered about among the foreſts, the inhabitants have little intercourſe with each other, except when they go to church. Their dwelling-houſes are ſpacious, proper, airy, and built of wood, and are at leaſt one ſtory in height, and herein they keep all their furniture and ſubſtance. In all of them that I have ſeen, I never failed to diſcover traces of their active and inventive genius. They all know how to read, and the greateſt part of them take the Gazette, printed in their village, which they often dignify with the name of <hi>town</hi> or city. I do not remember ever to have entered a ſingle houſe, without ſeeing a huge family bible, out of which they read on evenings and Sundays to their houſhold. They are of a cold, ſlow and indolent diſpoſition, and averſe to labour; the ſoil, with a moderate tillage, ſupplying them with conſiderably more than they can conſume: they go and return from their fields on horſeback, and in all this country you will ſcarcely ſee a traveller on foot: the mildneſs of their character is as much owing to climate as to their cuſtoms and manners, for you find the ſame ſof<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This country is interſected with an incredible number of rivers and rivulets; but Connecticut river is the moſt conſiderable in the whole State; the town of Hartford, ſituate on its banks, is the capital, and conſiſts at preſent of not more than four or five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred houſes, on a ſtreet two miles in length. The river is deep enough to float veſſels of about one hundred and fifty tons burthen, up to the town. The ſoil is light, except on the ſouthern ſide of the river, and yet it produces maize or Indian corn, and ſeveral other kinds of grain, in great abundance, the bread of which is much whiter than that in France, and the taſte equally excellent; this was a conſiderable article of the American commerce with the iſlands, where they nevertheleſs preferred our European grain, being of a more mealy ſubſtance, and keeping ſweet a much l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The trunks, cloſe and compact, ſtraight, and towering into the air beyond the reach of the eye, diſplay from the top a multitude of branches, cloathed with a deeper green than ours can boaſt of. The oak is by far the moſt frequent to be met with;—for the tree moſt uſeful to man, is the tree of all climates; and I have obſerved no leſs than ſix or ſeven different ſorts in this country: the leaves of one ſort are broad with almoſt imperceptible indentings, in others the inciſions are ſtill deeper, and in ſome they are ſo deep, that the principal fibres only remain extended; a day or two ago I met with ſome oaks, bearing leaves that are long and narrow and very much reſembling thoſe of the peach tree.</p>
               <p>But the monarch of theſe foreſts is the <hi>tulip</hi> or <hi>yellow tree</hi>; its aſpiring top riſes above the loftieſt oaks, and its thick extended branches project their ſhadow to a very great diſtance; its leaf compact, ſmooth and ſlender, is ſomewhat in ſhape like a man's hand, with this difference, that the longeſt ſide appears to be cut tranſverſely. Each leaf is originally folded in a particular wrapper, formed ſimply of two other leaves, of an oval ſhape touching in every point of their circumference; this principal leaf afterwards ſeparates the two others in order to expand and give room for growth, in the ſame manner as a young bean ſhoots out from between the leaves that confined it on each ſide. The tulip, that brilliant flower, upon which our Floriſts laviſh ſuch a profuſion of toil and expence, grows to the number of thouſands upon this ſtately tree, refreſhes the eye of the American native, and perfumes the air which he breathes beneath its ſhade.

Being of a nature fitted to flouriſh in every climate, it would, I think, ſucceed perfectly well in France; more pleaſant to the ſight than the great cheſnut tree, and more clean, it would

Some ſay, the firſt Europeans that came to America, being afflicted with that dreadful <hi>malady,</hi> the progreſs of which has been ſo fatal in Europe, made uſe of this ſhrub with ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>We alſo found upon the banks of Connecticut river a ſort of roſe-laurel, covered with flowers, and affording a delightful proſpect to the eye. The gum-tree, which we found in low interval lands, is a ſpecies of grove-laurel, the ſmell of which is ſomewhat like that of our common laurel, but more agreeable; its fruit, much like grains of pepper, is covered with an oily ſubſtance, of which they make wax candles; the wax is drawn from the berry, and collected by boiling them in water; and theſe candles when burning emit a moſt delightful ſmell. But the proceſs is too troubleſome, and the product too ſmall, for it ever to become an object of commerce.</p>
               <p>The maple tree grows here to a very great ſize and is one of the moſt valuable productions of all North-America: when the ſap runs they make inciſions in the body of the tree, from whence a rich liquor flows out, which when boiled down, becomes a perfect ſugar, and is uſed as ſuch.

The raiſin, or fleſhy part of the other, was ſmall, the ſkin hard and the kernel large, preſerving a greeniſh taſte even when ripe: I am convinced if this kind was cultivated with due care it would ſoon come to perfection. The vines we ſee in France, in the vineyard provinces, growing at random in hedges without cutting or culture, are of a kind very little ſuperior.

               <p>The ſquirrels are of a pale aſh grey, larger than ours, very common in the woods, and eaſy to be tamed; thoſe called flying ſquirrels are of a darker grey, and ſmaller in ſize than the other; their ſkin is large and looſe quite to the extremities of the paws, which they extend, when they leap from one branch of a tree to another, and thus are enabled to make uſe of a greater quantity of air, to ſupport themſelves upon, as a bird does in flying.</p>
               <p>The whole country, from Boſton to Providence, is level; and I have in this extent met with brooks, which we would call rivers; their beds, in thoſe places where I paſſed, looked as if they had been hollowed out of a ſoil of ſoft and ſpungy ſtone, of a grey and red complexion.

Torrents and rivers could never have thus rounded, intermixed and thrown them in heaps; the ſea alone muſt have ſeparated them by ſlow degrees, ſcattered them into different parts, re-united, and impreſſed on them theſe general forms by a continual attrition: But however attentively I have conſidered things, I have not yet been able to find any veſtiges of animal petrifactions, or of trees and ſhells. The North-river has, in and about its bed, very few ſtones of the granite kind, but plenty of marble, free-ſtone and ſlate.</p>

in our ſituation, would have been irreparable; the Engliſh, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, although greatly intereſted in preventing our joining the Americans, never made the leaſt movement to hinder it.</p>
               <p>A march of two hundred and fifteen miles through the moſt exceſſive heats, in a country very defective in ſupplies for an army, where the ſoldier is often in want of bread, and is obliged to carry proviſions for ſeveral days with him, has nevertheleſs made fewer invalids among us, than if we had laid ſtill in a garriſon. It is true, the ſtrict attention of the ſuperior officers has greatly contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted thereto, in never ſuffering the men to drink water, except with a quantity of rum intermixed, to take away its injurious qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities. M. le Comte Saint-Maime, Colonel commandant de Soiſſonnais, always at each halt, and each place of encamping, ſent out, and purchaſed barrels of cider, which he cauſed to be diſtributed among his troops, at a very low rate. His example was afterwards followed by the other corps, and produced the happieſt effects.</p>
               <p>The Engliſh, ſince our encamping with the Americans, having laid a plan to intercept the ſupplies we received from the back country by means of the North-River, ſent up a twenty gun frigate, and ſome ſloops as far as Tarry-town, a village ſituated ſix miles upon the right flank of the rear of the army. Two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men made an attempt to land, and the firſt company that diſembarked had time to ſet fire to ſome great gun carriages, to a batteau, and to take off another loaded with ſix thouſand rations of bread; but a ſergeant of the regiment of Soiſſonnais, and twelve ſoldiers, forced them to re-embark, and even entered waiſt deep into the water to purſue them, and hindered the reſt from coming on ſhore. This firſt feat of the French arms in America gave the Engliſh ſome idea of what they were to expect from the united efforts of a whole corps. The commanding officers ſtrove who ſhould be foremoſt in beſtowing praiſes upon theſe brave ſoldiers: "My general (anſwered the ſergeant to M. le Baron de Viomenil, who was extolling his bravery to the ſkies) I am indebted to the good advice and bravery of my corporal for what I have done, for he perfectly ſeconded my endeavours." Courage is not a rare virtue in France, but modeſty is ſomewhat more ſo, and yet this was a pattern of the moſt perfect modeſty, in a circumſtance very delicate for a ſoldier. I have, I aſſure you, heard with pain a ſuperior officer find fault with the encomiums that were given theſe men, and blame M. le Baron de Viomenil for having afterwards invited them to dine with him.—Can virtue ever be too much honoured, or too well rewarded!</p>
               <p>Batteries were erected in haſte, as low as Dobbs's ferry, and when the Engliſh frigate and ſloops came down, they had to ſuſtain a very heavy cannonade: a ſhell from a mortar piece ſet the frigates ſails on fire, and terror and confuſion ſeemed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant among the crew, twenty-two of whom threw themſelves overboard into the river, and were moſtly drowned.</p>

               <p>I have ſeen General WASHINGTON, that moſt ſingular man— the ſoul and the ſupport of one of the greateſt Revolutions that has ever happened, or can happen again. I fixed my eyes upon him with that keen attention, which the ſight of a great man always inſpires—We naturally entertain a ſecret hope of diſcovering in the features of ſuch illuſtrious men, ſome traces of that excellent genius which diſtinguiſhes them from, and elevates them above their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low mortals. Perhaps the exterior of no man was ever better cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to gratify theſe expectations, than that of General Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington: He is of a tall and noble ſtature, well proportioned, a fine, chearful, open countenance, a ſimple and modeſt carriage; and his whole mien has ſomething in it, that intereſts the French, the Americans, and even enemies themſelves, in his favour. Placed in a military view, at the head of a nation, where each individual has a ſhare in the ſupreme legiſlative authority, and where the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercive laws are yet in a great degree deſtitute of vigour, where the climate and manners can add but little to their energy, where the ſpirit of party, private intereſt, ſlowneſs, and national indolence ſlacken, ſuſpend and overthrow the beſt concerted meaſures; although ſo ſituated, he has found out a method of keeping his troops in the moſt abſolute ſubordination: making them rivals in praiſing him; fearing him even when he is ſilent, and retaining their full confidence in him, after defeats and diſgrace —His re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

cauſe;—like Peter the Great, he has by defeats conducted his army to victory; and like Fabius, but with fewer reſources and more difficulty, he has conquered without fighting, and ſaved his country.</p>
               <p>Such are the ideas that ariſe in the mind, at the ſight of this great man, in examining the events in which he has had a ſhare, or in liſtening to thoſe whoſe duty obliges them to be near his perſon, and conſequently can beſt diſplay his true character.—In all theſe extenſive ſtates, they conſider him in the light of a beneficent God, diſpenſing peace and happineſs around him—Old men, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and children, preſs about him when he accidentally paſſes along, and think themſelves happy, once in their lives, to have ſeen him—they follow him through the towns with torches, and celebrate his arrival by public illuminations.—The Americans, that cool and ſedate people, who in the midſt of their moſt trying difficulties, have attended only to the directions and impulſes of plain method and common reaſon, are rouſed, animated and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed at the very mention of his name; and the firſt ſongs that ſentiment or gratitude has dictated, have been to celebrate Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Waſhington.</p>
               <p>It is uncertain how many men his army conſiſts of exactly: ſome ſay, only four or five thouſand, but this General has always found means to conceal the real number, even from thoſe who compoſe it. Sometimes with a few troops he forms a ſpacious camp, and increaſes the number of tents; at other times with a great number, he contracts it to a narrow compaſs; then again by detaching them inſenſibly, the whole camp is nothing more than the mere ſkeleton and ſhadow of an army, while the main body is tranſported to a diſtant part of the country.</p>
               <p>Neither do theſe troops in general wear regular uniforms; but the officers and corps of artillery are obliged, without exception, to ſuch diſtinction. Several regiments have ſmall white frocks, with fringes, which look well enough; alſo linen over-alls, large and full, which are very convenient in hot weather, and do not at all hinder the free uſe of the limbs in marching: with food leſs ſubſtantial, and a conſtitution of body leſs vigorous than our p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="36" facs="unknown:018167_0036_0FA55ED9D14E5BE0"/>The American military habit, altho' eaſy to be ſoiled, is never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs very decent and neat; this neatneſs is particularly obſervable among the officers, to ſee them, you would ſuppoſe they were equipped with every neceſſary in the completeſt manner, and yet upon entering their tents, where perhaps three or four reſide together, I have often been aſtoniſhed to find, that their whole travelling equipage and furniture would not weigh forty pounds; few or none have matraſſes; a ſingle rug or blanket, ſtretched out upon the rough bark of a tree, ſerves them for a bed; the ſoldiers take the ſame precaution never to ſleep on the ground, whilſt ours prefer it to any other way.</p>
               <p>Their manner of living is very ſimple, and gives them but little trouble; they content themſelves with broiling their meat, and parching their corn, or baking unleavened dough, made of Indian meal, upon the hot embers.</p>
               <p>In ſome regiments they have negro companies, but always commanded by the whites.</p>
               <p>Their diſcipline is exceeding ſevere, and the power of the officers over the ſoldiers is almoſt unlimited, laſhing them with whips, and beating them with canes for the ſlighteſt faults: I, with ſome French officers, was accidentally a witneſs to their rigorous mode of chaſtiſement; the criminal was tied to the wheels of a cannon carriage, his ſhoulders naked, his arms ſtretched out, in order to give the muſcles their greateſt tenſion, and in this ſituation every ſoldier of the company came up and gave him a certain number of ſtrokes, with a large whip, which ſoon covered him with blood; what aſtoniſhed us moſt, and detained us the longer at this diſagreeable ſpectacle, was, that two of theſe unhappy culprits, who both ſuffered the ſame degree of puniſhment, never uttered the leaſt groan or complaint, or ſhowed any ſigns of fear. Is this courage, or is the natural ſenſibility of mankind leſs acute among a people, where the air of the foreſts and the conſtant uſage of tea and milk, ſoften and relax the fibres to a moſt aſtoniſhing degree?</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the actual appearance of our Generals before New-York, the object of the preſent campaign remains very uncertain: ſome ſay the Americans are tired of the war, and diſcontented with our inactivity, and for that reaſon the French army has joined them, ſolely to re-animate their drooping courage. It is alſo reported, that ſince the defection of Arnold, General Waſhington, not altogether ſatisfied with the fidelity of his army, has come to a reſolution of truſting the important p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We have juſt learnt that <hi>M. de Barras,</hi> commander of our ſquadron at Rhode-Iſland, has received ſome tidings of <hi>M. de Graſſe,</hi> and has ſent him a frigate, with a number of pilots on board for theſe coaſts. This looks as if New-York was their object. That Iſland and city is, at preſent, the general ſtore houſe of the Engliſh, and the centre of their operations; the
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:018167_0037_0FA55EDA79F612E0"/>
poſſeſſion of this place enables them to hold an eaſy communication with their territories to the north and ſouth, and at the ſame time to menace the interior parts of the adjacent country by means of Hudſon's river, and prevent the forces of the North-Eaſtern States from advancing to the Southward: it is alſo a ſecure receptacle for their fleets, where they can plan and prepare for their offenſive operations, in the Weſt India Iſlands. The capture of this place would be a deciſive ſtroke; and from the moment ſuch an event takes place, the Engliſh muſt forever renounce the hope of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting the States; and in their preſent exhauſted ſituation, I do not ſee how they would even repair the loſs of the ſtores and the troops.—Charleſtown and Savannah, having to oppoſe the whole impreſſion and ſtrength of the American continental forces, would make but a poor defence, and the Iſlands, ſtill more difficult to be relieved by timely aſſiſtance, would lie entirely at the mercy of an enemy.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, New-York is well fortified and defended, both by land and water, and the fortifications very extenſive; it is, beſides, garriſoned by the beſt troops of Great Britain, amounting to fifteen thouſand men, including the troops raiſed in the country; ſo that to lay ſiege to New-York there would be wanting, beſides a ſuperior maritime force, at leaſt thirty thouſand men; whereas, our combined army does not amount to much more than ten thouſand; it is true the militia of the country may be collected, but theſe are nothing more than undiſciplined troops, the duration of whoſe ſervice is always limited; and what could ſuch do againſt regular forces, well intrenched, and inured to all the dangers and hardſhips of war, for ſix or ſeven campaigns? Even the French army, however brave and well diſciplined it may be, is compoſed of troops, very few of whom have ever been actually in a battle. At any rate, a ſiege of this place would be long and tedious, and as to the ſquadron of M. de Graſſe, we know it cannot leave the Weſt-India Iſlands till the Hurricane ſeaſon comes on, and can only remain here during that ſeaſon, otherwiſe his projected operations in thoſe ſeas would fail, and our poſſeſſions lie expoſed to the enemy.</p>
               <p>If, on the other hand, this important expedition ſhould fail, all would be ruined: the Americans exhauſted, and diſcouraged at the revolt of Arnold, panting after repoſe, and viewing us in the light of a feeble Ally, would loſe cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The South is, moſt probably, the real object of this campaign: Thoſe States have for a long time felt all the miſeries of war, and have been waſted alternately by friends and enemies. Virginia has been the ſcene of the cruelties and devaſtations of Arnold; and Cornwallis, diſquieted at the news of our marching, has quitted Charleſtown and traverſed, with a large body of troops, the Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="38" facs="unknown:018167_0038_0FA55EDB45356B78"/>
kidnapping the negroes, and ſpreading death and deſolation wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he happened to march. So many repeated diſtreſſes and loſſes have diſcouraged the inhabitants, and inclined them to do any thing at all to better their ſituation. The arrival of our army among them, can alone free them from oppreſſion, and revive their courage.</p>
               <p>A certain <hi>warrior, [Marquis de la Fayette]</hi> at the head of twelve or fifteen hundred men, has nevertheleſs found means to keep his ground all this time in Virginia; the impetuous Arnold, and the active Cornwallis, not daring to attempt any thing againſt him. You will doubtleſs ſuppoſe, that this <hi>warrior</hi> is one of thoſe men, whom long experience and brilliant ſucceſſes, have rendered for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable to the enemy. This leader, I aſſure you, is a man of only twenty-four years of age, who has left the arms of an affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate and amiable wife, a reſidence among pleaſures and high life, where his name, and an alliance with an illuſtrious family, opened a way to the greateſt dignities, to come to this country, and, under the American FABIUS, defend the ſacred cauſe of liberty, and learn to ſerve his king and country. The word <hi>Marquis,</hi> which has been ſo long uſed among us, to characterize foppiſh fickleneſs and levity, univerſally excites admiration and gratitude, at the very mention of of it, throughout the American world.</p>
               <p>A ſouthern expedition would be leſs hazardous in its nature, and leſs deciſive in its effects, than here, but more preſſing upon the enemy, and promiſing a more certain proſpect of ſucceſs. We have intelligence, that Lord Cornwallis is fortifying at York, a ſmall town in Virginia, ſituated upon a river of the ſame name. This news begins to elevate the ſpirits of the French, who, if they could once hear of the arrival of M de Graſſe, would conclude, that this campaign would not yet go over without ſome conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able events.</p>
               <p>Several of our officers employed their leiſure time laſt winter, in making a tour to the ſouthward. One of them, M. de Saint Victor, Captain in the regiment of Soiſſonnais, and well known to be very ſkillful in every particular that regards his profeſſion as a ſoldier, and who did not make this tour without reaping conſiderable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage from it, has viewed <hi>York,</hi> and judges it incapable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fortified to any great purpoſe, being deſtitute of an opening for a retreat; ſo that having a ſquadron that could command Cheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apeak-Bay, in his opinion, we could ſoon bring the enemy to what terms we pleaſed.</p>
               <p>It is difficult, however, to perſuade one's ſelf, that Cornwallis, who knows the country ſo well, and has acquired ſo much reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this war, and who is by no means ignorant of the motions of our armies, would pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>GENERAL Waſhington and Count Rochambeau paſſed the North-River a few days ago, and have ever ſince been reconnoitring. They who ſuppoſed we were to direct our rout to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Virginia, begin now to think they were deceived: part of the army, on this ſide, are preparing to march down by the way of King's-bridge; and on the other ſide, orders are given to get ready to proceed towards Staten-Iſland, and even to conſtruct ovens to bake bread for the troops, when arrived in that quarter; others again are ordered towards Philadelphia.—What are we to think? All this ſeems to me like our theatrical marches, where the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern and perplexity of the ſpectators is continually increaſing; I am in doubt, whether the unravelling of the matter will compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſate for the trouble, anxiety, and uneaſineſs it occaſions.</p>
               <p>Staten-Iſland, they ſay, is garriſoned by eight or nine hundred regular forces, ſo that the capture of it would be a moſt brilliant affair: It is ſeparated from Long-Iſland only by a ſtreight of two or three miles over, and our being ſuch near neighbours, would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex the Engliſh greatly, and put us in a ſituation to attempt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing upon the larger iſland, with a better proſpect of ſucceſs. Our troops are full of ardour and confidence, and the ſeveral com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders ſeem calculated by nature to inſpire them with a ſpirit of boldneſs and enterprize. General Waſhington, in particular, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates them by his preſence, by the idea they have of his military talents; by his local knowledge of the country, and by that impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrable veil of ſecrecy, under which he revolves and matures all his great deſigns. It is ſaid the army will move in a day or two, which will enable us to determine the better to what quarter we are to proceed.</p>

               <p>AT length, Sir, I can inform you that the army left Philips<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg the 19th. of laſt month, and having made a retrograde movement, returned to <hi>North Caſtle,</hi> twenty-two miles diſtant. A heavy rain rendered this march very diſagreeable, for inſtead of reaching that place at ten or eleven in the morning, as we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, we did not arrive till eight o'clock the next day; both officers and ſoldiers having ſpent the night in the roads in the moſt diſmal weather, and water half leg deep. Neither was I exempt from the general misfortune; for I had imprudently advanced, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accompanied, ſome miles before the army, and got into a road infeſted with Refugees (who never grant quarter to Frenchmen) where a domeſtic of mine eſcaped from them very narrowly, and had he not been armed, would doubtleſs have loſt his life. They have lately hanged a Secretary belonging to one of our Commiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and aſſaſſinated an officer of the legion of Lauzun; ſo that I will confeſs to you, when I found myſelf alone and defenceleſs in theſe woods, I was in dread of adding to the number of thoſe who have fallen victims to the reſentment of theſe enemies of republican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm; yet I had the good fortune to arrive ſafe at the camp, having paſſed the night without tent or ſhelter of any ſort, ſtretched out by a large fire, roaſting on one ſide, and half drowned on the other, — and even found means to ſleep ſeveral hours. How many of you rich ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The inhabitants of the country were greatly ſurpriſed to ſee us returning the ſame road ſo ſoon, and the <hi>tories,</hi> with a malicious ſneer, demanded <hi>if we were going to reſt from our labours:</hi> but it was not long before they diſcovered the feint.</p>
               <p>We were now advanced conſiderably up the North-river, and in three days were as high as King's ferry, but the Americans, having travelled along the river ſide, had arrived there before us.</p>
               <p>Some have alledged, that if the Engliſh had ſent ſome armed veſſels up the Hudſon, they might have retarded us conſiderably, and done us infinite miſchief. The retrograde march that we made by order of General Waſhington, was doubtleſs meant to divert
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:018167_0041_0FA55EDD951F7C68"/>
them from this attempt; but nevertheleſs, after the trial they had of the abilities of our artillery men, they muſt have known they would run a great riſque of having their veſſels deſtroyed eſpecially if they had met with calms or contrary winds.</p>
               <p>The allied army has croſſed a great part of the State of New-Jerſey, drawing a large quantity of batteaus with them upon carriages, and always menacing Staten-Iſland. It proceeds in two columns, the Americans forming that next to the ſea, although their number does not exceed five or ſix thouſand. The inactivity of the Engliſh, at this critical moment, is really incomprehenſible; they might, without riſquing a great deal, harraſs our army, and do us irreparable miſchief, and they have all the reaſon in the world to make ſuch an attempt, for altho' General Waſhington has had the dexterity to keep them in uncertainty hitherto, they cannot be ignorant that we are in hourly expectations of the arrival of Count de Graſſe upon theſe coaſts; and they know that Admiral de Barras has embarked all his heavy cannon, and made prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for ſailing. It is their intereſt to prevent the junction of our forces, and what more favourable opportunity could there be, than when the army was marching through a country covered with ſteep mountains, thick ſet with woods, and interſected with rivers, and where for want of ſupplies, the troops muſt march in a leſs compact ſtate than they would otherwiſe do.</p>
               <p>There is now ſcarcely any doubt but that we are going to Virginia, unleſs we ſuppoſe the immediate arrival of Count de Graſſe ſhould oblige the army to return northwards.</p>
               <p>This part of the country is wholly different from that we have hitherto traverſed: it is not, like Connecticut, covered with ſmall hills lying cloſe together, which render travelling difficult, obſtruct the view, and prevent one from forming a clear idea of the whole ſcene. Many ridges of mountains, which ſeem to be branches of the Apalachian, ſtretch from north eaſt to ſouth weſt, and form intervals of vaſt and beautiful plains, which the hand of the geometrician ſeems to have ſmoothed to a level. Theſe plains are adorned with large and handſome edifices; and the country abounds with orchards, fields of wheat, rye, barley, indian corn, and flouriſhing woods.—The inhabitants, for the moſt part of Alſacian and Dutch deſcent, are gay, eaſy and engaging in their manners, and reſemble the happy region they inhabit. Proviſions are brought into our camp from all quarters; and thoſe that bring them are commonly wealthy people, and very unlike our traders in fruits and pulſe. You will often ſee the women decked with their head dreſſes and gauzes, riding in their farm waggons to market, drawn by the moſt elegant horſes.</p>
               <p>I have taken the pains to travel over the ſummits of theſe high mountains of Jerſey, and find them to conſiſt principally of rocks of granite, of different kinds, adhering very cloſe together, but aqua fortis, when applied thereto, produces no ebullition: iſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs is found here likewiſe in the greateſt abundance. If thoſe

mountains, which muſt neceſſarily be ranked in the primitive claſs, owe their origin to a vitrified matter, which had once been in a ſtate of fuſion for ſeveral thouſand years, they would neceſſarily be homogeneous; but I do not remember that I ever found here a mixture of ſeveral ſubſtances, re-united in grains, aſſuming regular forms and different colours. Be that as it will, theſe mountains muſt have undergone great revolutions, for they are ſplit aſunder in many places, and fragments of a prodigious bulk are removed a conſiderable diſtance from their firſt ſituation: upon one of the loftieſt of theſe hills, I met with a monſtrous block of ſtone, ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by itſelf, rounded at its angles, ſupported upon a very ſmall baſis, and apparently upon the point of tumbling down, and rolling away—what was its original poſition, or who could have raiſed it to this height?</p>
               <p>The village of Princeton is inconſiderable, but remarkable for its charming ſituation, elegant houſes, and above all, a college built of ſtone, four ſtories high, having twenty-five windows in the front, in each ſtory. In the college, I ſaw two grand per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>WE were yeſterday encamped in the vicinity of a very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able little town; and although we are to day but twelve miles from it, we are come in view of another not at all inferior to it, in pleaſantneſs and the ſalubrity of the air, and ſituated to much better advantage: It is the largeſt we have ſeen ſince our leaving Providence, and ſtands upon the north eaſtern bank of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laware, twenty-ſeven miles above Philadelphia. This advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous ſituation, makes it a place of conſiderable trade, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with the capital of Pennſylvania, eſpecially in the article of proviſions. The Delaware is navigable thus far up, for veſſels of ſome tolerable burden, but afterwards becomes all at once ſo ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that a little above the town carriages may paſs ſafely over at the fording places, when the tide is out. The ſhores of this river have nothing of that gloomy and ſavage aſpect obſervable on the Hudſon; they are, on the contrary, as level and pleaſant as thoſe of the Loire. The ſoil is light here, as well as in moſt other places we have ſeen, but at the ſame time very excellent. The maize, or

Indian corn, a plant that infinitely exhauſts the ground, grows luxuriant here, even in thoſe lands which have been cultivated for a century paſt, and is in height from ſeven to eight feet; the ſtalks are plump and vigorous, and the ears long and heavy.</p>
               <p>General Waſhington has rendered this place famous to the lateſt times, by a victory, in which he ſo happily diſcloſed the amazing reſources of his genius.</p>

Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Waſhington's army, which had ſcarcely dared to ſhow itſelf the whole campaign, and was every day growing weaker and weaker, left the Engliſh in enjoyment of the greateſt ſecurity, and only two nights freezing weather would have enabled them to croſs the Delaware on the ice, and take poſſeſſion of Philadelphia. In this critical ſituation of affairs the <hi>Congreſs</hi> retired to Baltimore in Maryland, and America, with dread and conſternation, beheld the fatal moment approaching, when her chains were to be rivetted on her forever.</p>
               <p>General Waſhington, not finding himſelf in a ſituation to make head againſt the united force of the enemy, formed a deſign of attacking them ſeparately: In haſte he collected the militia of Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania, Maryland, and Virginia, and divided the whole into three bodies; two could not paſs the Delaware for the ice, but that party under the direction of the General himſelf was more fortunate; for he croſſed the river, and after a ſmart conflict, took above nine hundred Heſſians priſoners. A ſhort time afterwards, having kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled fires through his camp, and left one man to take care of each, he marched round about, and came upon the rear of the enemy, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed them once more, near Princeton, and obliged another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable body to ſurrender their arms. The Engliſh were then, in their turn, forced to retire, and put themſelves on the defenſive.</p>

               <p>THE arrival of the French army at Philadelphia was more like a triumph, than ſimply a paſſing through the place: the troops made a halt about a quarter of a league from the city, and in an inſtant were dreſſed as elegantly as ever the ſoldiers of a garriſon were upon a day of review: they then marched through the town, with the military muſic playing before them, which is always particularly pleaſing to the Americans; the ſtreets were crowded wiih people, and the ladies appeared at the windows in their moſt brilliant attire. All Philadelphia was aſtoniſhed to ſee people, who had endured the fatigues of a long journey, ſo ruddy and handſome, and even wondered that there could poſſibly be <hi>Frenchmen</hi> of ſo genteel an appearance.</p>
               <p>The troops next marched in a ſingle file before the Congreſs, and M. le Chevalier de la Luzerne, miniſter from the court of France, and afterwards encamped in a large plain contiguous to the river Schuylkill. The next day after our arrival, the regiment of Soiſſonnais went through the exerciſe of the fire arms: at leaſt twenty thouſand perſons, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The rapidity of the military evolutions, the ſoldierly appearance of the troops in general, and the exactneſs of their motions, ſurpriſed and enrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured the beholders, but their attention was ſtill more excited, when they beheld in one of our chiefs, the relation and friend of that young <hi>Hero</hi> to whom they are ſo much indebted, and for whom they profeſs an admiration ariſing almoſt to enthuſiaſm: a loſs, <note n="§" place="bottom">He had ſome days before received the news of his daughter's death.</note> (which one muſt be a father, and of great ſenſibility too, to have a juſt idea of) had for ſome days rendered him a prey to grief and melancholy; not even the charms of Philadelphia could draw him from his tent; and like another Achilles, nothing but the claſh of arms could make him forget his ſorrow.</p>
               <p>We were a good deal amuſed with a miſtake of ſome of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people, who took for a great General one of thoſe alert fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, whom our commanding officers commonly have in their reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue,

His ſhort tight bodied coat, his rich waiſtcoat with a ſilver fringe, his roſe-coloured ſhoes, his cap adorned with a coat of arms, and his cane with an enormous head,—all appeared to them ſo many token<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Altho' he approached his maſter, the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel commandant, merely to receive and publiſh his orders, they imagined that he gave them of his own accord, and directed the movements of the troops, independent of any ſuperior.</p>
               <p>The Preſident of Congreſs,<note n="*" place="bottom">The Honourable Thomas M'Kean, Eſquire, was then Preſident.</note> in a ſuit of black velvet, honoured this review with his preſence. Theſe honeſt Pennſylvanians differ very conſiderably from us in the ceremonies of dreſs, as we differ from them again in our modes of legiſlation.</p>
               <p>The manoeuvres of our troops raiſed the moſt flattering expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the minds of the ſpectators; and they did not heſitate to declare, that ſuch ſoldiers were invincible.</p>
               <p>This day was deſtined for favourable omens. M. le Chevalier de la Luzerne, who, upon this occaſion, received his countrymen with the dignity and generoſity of the repreſentative of a great Monarch, and the frankneſs and cordiality of an individual, after the review, invited all the officers to dine with him. Hardly were we ſeated at the table, when an expreſs arrived: a diſquieting ſilence immediately ſeized every gueſt—our eyes were fixed upon the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier de la Luzerne, every one endeavouring to gueſs what the meſſage would turn out to be.—
<q>Thirty-ſix ſhips of the line, ſaid he, commanded by Monſieur le Comte de Graſſe, are arrived in Cheſapeak-Bay, and three thouſand men have landed and opened a communication with the Marquis de la Fayette.</q>
—Joy and good humour, immediately reſumed their place on every countenance—Our impatient leaders began to count the days, and reckon how long it would be before they would have it in their power to face the enemy; and their heated imaginations made the time much ſhorter than it afterwards proved to be. Healths were next drank; and that of the Miniſter of the marine of France was not forgotten, whoſe activity and great abilities, have paved the way to the moſt brilliant ſucceſſes of our fleet: The preſence of his ſon, M. le Comte de Charlu, ſecond Colonel of the regiment of Saintonge, added ſtill more to our pleaſure and ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>Among others, Charles Thomſon, the Secretary of Congreſs, the ſoul of that political body, came alſo to receive and preſent his compliments. His meagre figure; furrowed countenance; his hollow ſparkling eyes; his white, ſtraight hair, that did not hang quite as low as his ears, fixed our thorough attention, and filled us with ſurprize and admiration.</p>
               <p>The important news of the arrival of Count de Graſſe, was ſoon ſpread throughout the city, and echoes of joy were heard from every quarter: Some merry fellows mounted upon ſcaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folds and ſtages, pronounced funeral orations for Cornwallis,

               <p>Thus, you ſee, the people are univerſally perſuaded of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of this expedition.—Could theſe flattering hopes be realized, they would haſten a peace, which in our ſituation, and under the wiſe and benevolent Prince that governs us, would place France in a point of view, that has been wholly unknown ſince the exiſtence of her monarchy.</p>
               <p>Philadelphia, the capital of Pennſylvania, is built upon an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated and extenſive plain, a little above the confluence, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two rivers, Delaware and Schuylkill. The famous William Penn, founder of this colony, gave the plan, and pointed out the ſituation. His plan has been followed, but the town is built upon the principal river for the conveniency of trade. Its form is an oblong, extending two miles in length, and having eight ſtreets perfectly parallel to each other, croſſed at right an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles by ſixteen others, of near a mile in length, equally wide and as exactly parallel. Care has been taken to leave vacancies for public edifices. The two principal ſtreets, <hi>Front-ſtreet,</hi> and <hi>Market-ſtreet,</hi> are each one hundred feet broad. Veſſels of five hundred tons can lie afloat, by the moſt convenient wharffs; and I ſaw more than twenty ſhips at once upon the ſtocks. The town contains at leaſt ſix thouſand houſes, for the moſt part built of brick, and all extremely handſome; the people are computed to be about forty thouſand ſouls. The Roman Catholics have two chapels here, governed by an Engliſh ex-Jeſuit, and a G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The mildneſs of the climate, the goodneſs of the ſoil, their rural occupations, and a ſolitary mode of life, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the views of their legiſlature, and Pennſylvania ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the moſt virtuous and happy colony that hiſtory has ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded. But by the increaſe of inhabitants, by the flocking in of ſtrangers, and its becoming a commercial ſettlement, the fortunes of individuals were enlarged, luxury was introduced, the manners of the people inſenſibly changed, and that <hi>golden age,</hi> which was here realized, was ſoon conſidered as nothing more than a brilliant

               <p>In this city the repreſentatives of the thirteen States, denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated the <hi>Congreſs,</hi> hold their reſidence. The front of the edifice in which they ſit, is of brick, and conſequently without any of the orders of architecture; it is, however, as handſome as any ſtructure in this taſte can be, and preſents to the eye a noble, ſolid, regular maſs. It is placed in the common range of the houſes, without any conſiderable interval of ſeparation, and certainly loſes much of its beauty becauſe you have no proper ſtand to examine it in the requiſite point of view: Each individual State ſends its deputies hither to conſult upon its intereſts, make its propoſals and concert means for the defence of the common cauſe. This aſſembly has no concern with any matters further than what reſpects the general intereſt of all the States, each having its particular aſſembly, who make laws and provide for the ſupport of their civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, independent of the general Congreſs. The number of repreſentatives is always in proportion to the extent and importance of the ſeveral States that ſend them—the feweſt that can be ſent are <hi>two,</hi> and <hi>ſeven</hi> the moſt, but how many ſoever there be, the repreſentatives of each ſtate have but one voice. The central poſition of this town, and its natural ſecurity of ſituation has decided the choice in its favour. The firſt Congreſs was held here the fifth of September 1774, and the act of Independence was paſſed July 4th, 1776; at a period, when the affairs of America looked dark and gloomy, when a very numerous fleet and army ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the avenues to New-York, and threatened deſtruction to the very exiſtence of liberty in America.</p>
               <p>The market-houſe, ſituated in the midſt of the city, is large and handſome. The priſons for Debtors and criminals, as well as that deſigned for priſoners of war, are ſpacious and airy.</p>

               <p>The plan of William Penn is yet far from being accompliſhed, but is perfected more and more as the town enlarges: it is eaſy to judge what an amazing growth it has had, when we find an old man yet alive in Philadelphia, who remembers when the very firſt ſtone of it was laid. This town, ſituated on a river where veſſels of war may eaſily come up, and upon a fertile ſoil which requires little labour to cultivate it, and built after a well conſidered plan, cannot fail of becoming in time one of the largeſt and moſt beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful cities in the world</p>

               <p>WHEN the army reached the Head of Elk, a place on the north of Cheſapeak bay, we had the mortification to find there was not a ſufficiency of tranſports to receive us all on board. It was with difficulty that we could even procure ſhallops and boats, for the moſt part open, to take in the grenadiers, chaſſeurs and ſome American regiments: in caſe of bad weather theſe troops will ſuffer much and run a conſiderable riſk of being drowned; General Waſhington and Count Rochambeau, have advanced on by land, to concert their plans of operation with M. de Graſſe. M. le Baron de Viomenil, the immediate commander of the French army, has determined likewiſe to go all the way by land.</p>
               <p>Baltimore is, from its ſituation, one of the moſt important places of all North-America.—Placed almoſt at the head of the Bay, it lies convenient to receive the produce of Pennſylvania, the Delaware ſtate, and eſpecially the commodities of Maryland. This laſt mentioned ſtate has very conſiderable iron forges, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces a ſpecies of tobacco of a leſs pleaſing ſmell than that of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia, but infinitely more ſtrong, and for that reaſon preferred by the people of the north of Europe.</p>
               <p>Thirty years ago, Baltimore was only an inconſiderable village; at preſent it is a large wealthy town, built nearly in the ſhape of a creſcent or half-moon, The northern part of it, is ſituated upon a narrow ſlip of land, that projects a conſiderable diſtance into the Bay, and is ſo low, that the town in this place, apparently riſes out of the boſom of the waters, and already ſeems to anticipate its future dominion and grandeur.</p>
               <p>Lord Baltimore, an Iriſh Catholic, formerly eſtabliſhed two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of his perſuaſion in this place, and gave his name to the ſettlement. About one quarter of it is peopled by thoſe unfortunate Acadians, and their deſcendents, whom the Engliſh cruelly forced away from their own happy country,<note n="‡" place="bottom">The beſt of Nova Scotia is that part called by the French <hi>Acadia,</hi> where a number of that nation firſt ſettled in <hi>1604.</hi> Theſe people were known by the name of Neutrals, and lived in a perfect State of independence after the Province was given up to England, having ſworn never to act againſt their native country, to which, as well as to their religion and prieſts, they were moſt enthuſiaſtically attached. Soon after the year <hi>1749,</hi> perceiving the Engliſh encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon them, they determined rather to remove to New France (Canada) than run the riſque of having their religion contaminated by an intermixture with heretics. But the Engliſh getting notice of their deſign, ſeized upon all who were not yet gone, and embarked them on board their ſhips, in which they were tranſported to different parts of the then Engliſh Colonies, where the greater part of them ſoon died of grief and vexation.</note> to leave them deſtitute and
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:018167_0049_0FA55EE438E61210"/>
poor in a region where they were utter ſtrangers. Their quarter is the meaneſt in appearance, and worſt built of all, and the tyranny of the Britiſh government has, till lately, h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ndered them from gaining any thing by the happy ſituation of this town; but being for the moſt part ſea-faring men it is hoped they will not fail, in time, to make up by commerce the loſs of their fertile ſettlements in Acadia.</p>
               <p>They ſtill preſerve the French language among them, and are prodigiouſly attached to whatever regards the nation from which they originated, eſpecially in their religious worſhip, which they keep up with a ſtrictneſs that would have done honour to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive ages of chriſtianity. Their way of life is plain and ſimple, and their manners ſimilar to thoſe prevalent among them while they were yet in the happy region of Acadia. The prieſts there exerciſed that authority over them which virtue and education allow, over men who are not yet corrupt in their morals, they were their judges and their mediators, and to this day theſe exiled peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple never mention their names without tears.</p>
               <p>They told me a great deal about a <hi>Monſieur le Clere,</hi> who, at their departure, gave them veſſels and ornaments for the ſervice of the altar.
<q>Theſe ornaments (ſaid the good old man) will ſerve to recall to your minds what you owe to the religion of your fathers: can it flouriſh—can it even exiſt in thoſe new regions which you are now going to inhabit! While you reprove all other creeds and modes of worſhip, can you ſhow by your gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs, good will and beneficence, that you ſtill hold them as brethren, who are of a different faith! Perhaps Providence is making you its inſtruments to extend the divine truths of the goſpel, and render them prevalent in ſome other region of the world. This reflection alone ſupports me under the ſorrow and pangs of parting, but wherever you may be forced by the will of heaven, rely upon it, my heart will always follow you, and never, never will I raiſe my trembling hands to the ſacred altars of the Divinity, but you ſhall be the deareſt objects of my prayers.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Their chapel is built without the town upon a height, near four or five churches of different ſects. They complain much, that they do not find in their preſent miniſters, the zeal and affection of thoſe in Acadia: taken up with their temporal concerns, they beſtow few inſtructions upon their flock, and their whole paſtoral function ſeems confined to ſaying low maſs once a month.</p>

               <p>THE army was to proſecute the reſt of the march to Virginia by land, and with that view took the road leading to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> a flouriſhing commercial town upon the Potomack; but upon the news of the arrival of the Romulus ſhip of war, with two frigates and a number of tranſports, we turned off towards Annapolis, but the horſes and carriages continued their journey by land.</p>
               <p>As we advance towards the ſouth we obſerve a ſenſible difference in the manners and cuſtoms of the people. We no longer find, as in Connecticut, houſes ſituated along the road at ſmall diſtances, juſt large enough to contain a ſingle family, and the houſhold furniture nothing more than is barely neceſſary; here are ſpacious habitations, conſiſting of different buildings, at ſome diſtance from each other, ſurrounded with plantations that extend beyond the reach of the eye, cultivated not by the hands of freemen, but by thoſe unhappy blacks, whom European avarice and injuſtice has taken from their native regions of Africa to cultivate poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions not their own, in a foreign ſoil. Their furniture here, is conſtructed out of the moſt coſtly kinds of wood, and the moſt valuable marble, enriched by the elegant devices of the artiſts hand.

The ſtate houſe is a very beautiful building, I think the moſt ſo of any I have ſeen in America. The periſtyle is ſet off with pillars, and the edifice is topped with a dome.</p>

Judge how inconvenient this muſt have been to troops crowded into a narrow ſpace, and without any decks over them; while even the officers had nothing but biſcuit to live upon. The ſhores of this Bay, which is formed by the influx of ſo many great rivers, are far from being lofty, neither are they much cleared of the wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ds, and it is but rarely that you diſcover any habitations; but the few we ſaw were very agreeably ſituated. This country will be, in time, one of the moſt beautiful in the world.</p>
               <p>When our little fleet had ſailed up James-River, celebrated for the excellent tobacco which grows upon its ſhores, we diſembark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at James-Town, the place where the Engliſh firſt eſtabliſhed themſelves in Virginia. The troops have already joined the grena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, chaſſeurs, and the three thouſand men brought hither by Count de Graſſe, conſiſting of the regiments of <hi>Agenois, Gatinois</hi> and <hi>Touraine,</hi> under the command of Monſ. de St. Simon, Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal de Camp. This General had a little before, effected a junc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with fifteen hundred or two thouſand Americans, commanded
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:018167_0052_0FA55EEA78C38268"/>
by M. le Marquis de la Fayette, who, as you have heard, could never be reduced, notwithſtanding the forces of Cornwallis were three or four times his number. I ſhould have mentioned, that M. de la Fayette, in quality of Major-General of an American ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, at the age of twenty-four years, found himſelf at this time ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior in command to a French general officer, and continued ſo till the other detachments of the army were collected into one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, under General Waſhington.</p>
               <p>Williamſburg, tho' conſiderable, as the capital of Virginia, is in other reſpects a place of little importance: it is ſituated upon a plain, level piece of land, and the main ſtreet, paſſing through the midſt of it, is more than one hundred feet in width: at one of the extremities, and fronting the ſtreet is the capitol, or ſtate-houſe, a ſmall but regular building; and at the other end is the college, capable of containing more than three hundred ſtudents: there is a library belonging to it of about three thouſand volumes, and an apparatus for experimental philoſophy, tolerably complete. With the moſt lively ſatisfaction I contemplated theſe monuments of the real glory of men; and while I contemplated them, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called to my mind places and perſons moſt intimately connected with my heart. The tumult of arms has driven from hence, thoſe who had the care of theſe philoſophical inſtruments, for the muſes you know, take no pleaſure but in the abodes of peace: We could only meet with one ſolitary profeſſor, of Italian extraction; and I cannot but ſay, his converſation and abilities appeared to be ſuch, that after what he had told us in commendation of his brethren, we could not help regretting their abſence.</p>
               <p>Williamſburg does not contain above a hundred and fifty houſes, and is the only town we have yet ſeen in Virginia worth mentioning: not ſituated on the banks of any river, it ſtands at an equal diſtance from two ſmall ones, one of which falls into York, the other into James River. It is ſubject to the inconveniency of ſcarcity of good water. What makes the ſituation of this place valuable, is the neighbourhood of James and York rivers, between which grows the beſt tobacco in the whole State, and for this reaſon it ſeems to have been built where it is: I do not think, nevertheleſs, that it will ever be a place of any great importance; the towns of York, James, Norfolk, and Edenton, being more favourably ſituated for trade, will undoubtedly eclipſe it.</p>
               <p>Although Virginia extends from the 36th. to the 39th. degree of north latitude, the winters are very ſevere, and great quantities of ſnow ſometimes fall. The ſouthern and eaſtern winds are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive warm, and thoſe from the north and weſt, coming over mountains and lakes, equally cold. In a days time there will often be a rapid tranſition from one extreme to the other. The country produces ſeveral very excellent kinds of wood, and about Williamſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg and the ſhores of the bay, the land is covered with trees yielding rozin; the meadows and marſhes ſubſiſt great numbers of excellent horſes, which far exceed thoſe of the other States in point
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:018167_0053_0FA55EECB2757330"/>
of beauty: Vaſt quanties of hemp are raiſed here, as well as flax, Indian corn and cotton: The cotton ſhrubs produce annually, and at the firſt view we took them for beans in bloſſom. Silk worms ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed here very well, and it is not improbable but they may at ſome future time form one of the moſt conſiderable branches of trade in this ſtate. The commodity moſt in demand is tobacco; you well know the character it has, and for common uſe it may be conſidered as the beſt in the world: What the Engliſh imported yearly from this ſtate, and from Maryland, might have amounted to about ninety-ſix thouſand hogſheads; but among themſelves they did not conſume one ſixth part of that quantity, and either diſpoſed of the reſt among us, or exported it to the north: judge then how valuable this commerce was to that nation. They purchaſed it here at the very loweſt rate, taking it in exchange for their broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloths, linen and hard wares, and ſelling again for ready money what they did not want for their own home conſumption, and thus they increaſed their capital every year to the amount of eight or nine millions. No other of their poſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſſions, not even thoſe in India, ever afforded them ſo clear a profit. Three hundred and thirty veſſels, and about four thouſand ſailors were conſtantly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in this trade: of theſe the city of Glaſgow, in Scotland, owned the greateſt part, and by that means ſupported its flouriſhing manufactures, which were perhaps more conſiderable than thoſe of any town in England.</p>
               <p>Since the war, the tobacco exportation has been only about forty thouſand hogſheads annually; what advantages then would have accrued to the Engliſh, could they have ſooner made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves maſters of Cheſapeake-bay. There are now fifty or ſixty veſſels collected at York, under the cannon of Cornwallis, ſent on purpoſe to load with this weed, which three fourths and a half of the human race take ſuch ſupreme delight in chewing, ſnuffing or ſmoking.</p>
               <p>The population of Virginia, is computed at one hundred and fifty thouſand whites, and five hundred thouſand negroes. There is a ſtill greater diſproportion between the whites and blacks in Maryland, where there are not more than twenty thouſand whites, and at leaſt two hundred thouſand negroes. The Engliſh imported into theſe two provinces, between ſeven and eight thouſand yearly. Perhaps the lot of theſe ſlaves is not quite ſo hard as that of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes in the Iſlands; their liberty, it is true, is irreparably loſt in b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can, not at all induſtrious by nature, is conſiderate enough not to expect too much from his ſlave, who in ſuch circumſtances, has fewer motives to be laborious than himſelf.</p>
               <p>The great rivers, which water this province, have their ſource in the blue mountains, a chain of which runs through the whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, from north to ſouth. Beyond theſe rolls the Ohio, through vaſt foreſts and meadows, in a ſerpentine courſe, till it unites with
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:018167_0054_0FA55EED52F30B30"/>
the Miſſiſippi: according to the reports of travellers, the fineſt and moſt fertile countries in the world extend along the ſhores of this river, which are nevertheleſs as yet but ill explored. It is ſaid, that General Waſhington had in contemplation, if he could not break the chains of his country, to go and eſtabliſh himſelf there with thoſe, whom the love of liberty and independence ſhould incline to partake of his fate and fortune.</p>
               <p>As you advance to the ſouthward, the different degrees of heat are obſervable by the difference of the vegetable productions The gum-laurel riſes here into a tree, and the ſaſſafras becomes tall and ſtately. We took notice in Maryland, of a fruit very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon there, ſharp taſted and bitteriſh before it was ripe, but, like our ſorb apples, luſcious, inſipid and flabby, when come to matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, being about the bigneſs of a plumb, and of a bright yellow.</p>
               <p>Almoſt all the plants here are odoriferous: the white <hi>flower-ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting,</hi> of which the fields are full, is remarkably ſo.—The cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpillars differ entirely from thoſe of Europe, being covered with tufts, which hide both their heads and feet: theſe tufts are long, cloſe and ſmooth as if they had been trimmed with ſciſſors; ſome are all over of one colour, ſuch as a very fine vermillion, others are chequered with regular ſpots.</p>
               <p>We found near the North-River, in the ſtate of New-York, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpecies of this inſect, remarkable for its ſize and beauty. M. le Chevalier de Chattelux,<note n="*" place="bottom">M. le Chevalier de Chattelux, Marechal de Camp, one of the forty members of the French academy, it Major-General in the army of Count Rochambeau.</note> whom the great affairs of an army do not entirely preclude from allotting ſome moments to literary amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, made me a preſent of one, which I have delineated upon paper: it was about four inches long, and had ſeven or eight rings paſſing round the body; its ſkin was thin and of a light green, through which you might perceive the motion of the blood in the arteries; his eye-balls were about the bigneſs of a pea, and his tail of a deep yellow; each of his rings had four little branchy horns, hard and of a jet black, about two twelfths of an inch long: his head was armed with eight more, more than an inch in length, ſtrong, branchy, and bent towards each other, yellow, and black towards the extremities, and poliſhed in the moſt exquiſite man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. This ſtately inſect lets us know, by the arrogance of its car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, that it is not ignorant of the noble dreſs it wears, and ſeems conſcious of a natural ſuperiority over its fellow worms.</p>
               <p>I have had a dangerous trial of the wonderful ſubtlety of the poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a ſpecies of the ſpider; it ſtung me in the forehead as I was going to bed in my tent, but I hardly felt any pain in the ſpot where the ſting had penetrated, and the pimple it occaſioned was barely perceptible: however, ſome ſhootings in the muſcles of my throat on the ſide next to the wound, prevented me from getting any ſleep: in half an hour afterwards I found my belly was ſwol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, and my body full of dead, heavy pains. I then got up and

walked about in the open air, but my pains increaſing rapidly, communicated themſelves to my back, and at length centered in my ſtomach; In a ſhort time I could ſupport myſelf no longer on my legs, and in this condition was carried to Williamſburg, from which we were only a few hundreds of yards diſtant: here they gave me ſome volatile alkaline ſalts, and rubbed the part where I had been ſtung; but notwithſtanding this, the oppreſſion at my ſtomach increaſed, and my pains became more and more violent; bleeding was of little or no ſervice, and I was relieved at laſt by the ſimple remedy of warm water, which had I delayed to make uſe of, I ſhould infallibly have died for want of breath. As the nervous ſyſtem was only attacked by the poiſon, it is plain the alkaline ſalts could but have increaſed the irritation. I am now recovered, except that I have at times ſome painful ſhootings in my nerves, <note n="*" place="bottom">Since my return to France I have had ſeveral touches of theſe pains in my nerves.</note> a kind of malady I could hardly give credit to, were I not actually the ſufferer.</p>
               <p>In Maryland, I began to pick up petrified ſhell-fiſh, where there is great plenty on the ſhores of the bay, but in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of Williamſburg I have ſeen the ground guttured out to the depth of more than twenty-five feet by the land floods, and diſcloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vaſt quantities of theſe ſubſtances, the greater part of which was not more than half petrified.</p>

               <p>THE combined army left Williamſburg the 28th of Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, with a view to inveſt York; and advanced the ſame day
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:018167_0056_0FA55EEF6DA93580"/>
to within three quarters of a league of the town. Such approaches as theſe are not commonly made without great circumſpection, ſince the encampments muſt neceſſarily be multiplied in proportion as you draw near to the enemy, but the impatience of the troops for action rendered them rather too ventureſome on this occaſion, not heſitating to march twelve miles in the face of the enemy through dangerous woods, upon a looſe, ſandy ſoil, and through the moſt exceſſive heats. One of our young Colonels went ſo far, as to uſe every argument he could think of to prevail upon General Waſhington to ſuffer him to attack two redoubts that lay in our way. The General referred the matter to M. le Comte de Rocham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beau, to whom he had intruſted the immediate direction of the ſiege, but Count Rochambeau thought it more prudent to give the troops a little time for repoſe, and reconnoitre the places, before he made any attempt of that kind.</p>
               <p>A body of Americans, headed by the Marquis de la Fayette, compoſed the right column, and the French, preceded by their grenadiers and chaſſeurs formed the left. The army of M. le Compte de Rochambeau, conſiſting of the regiments of <hi>Bourbon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nais, Royal Deux Ponts, Soiſſonnais</hi> and <hi>Saintonge</hi> was placed in the center: The troops under the command of <hi>M. de Saint Simon</hi> extended to the left as far as <hi>York</hi> river, and the Americans occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied the right, flanked by the ſame river.</p>
               <p>On the thirtieth, the enemy evacuated the two redoubts, which the young Colonel was for attacking upon our firſt arrival: they were diſtant about four hundred toiſes [eight hundred yards] from their main works, and upon their leaving them, the French immediately took poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>On the firſt of October in the night, the Americans began two redoubts to the right of the others. The enemy diſcovering this, inſtantly turned their fire that way, and as we expected, ſeveral of the American work men were killed. This, however, did not at all intimidate their companions, who held on at their buſineſs with the ſame ardour as if no ſuch accident had happened. <note n="§" place="bottom">Theſe were militia men, to whom the ſiege was a ſpectacle altogether new.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The army was buſy, till the ſixth, in conſtructing long and ſhort faſcines, gabions, and landing the Artillery and ammuniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. We were ſoon after in a ſituation to open the trenches. The regiments of Bourbonnais and Soiſſonnais, commanded by Baron de Viomenil, and fifteen hundred Americans under the Marquis de la Fayette, poſted themſelves all night in a deep ravine to protect the fifteen hundred workmen on the right. At the ſame time the regiment de Touraine opened the intrenchment on the left, and raiſed a battery over againſt a redoubt, detached from their main works, and intended to keep off the fire directed from the right of the enemy. The act<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>vity of the workmen and the natural looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:018167_0057_0FA55EF036AEEAA8"/>
of the ſoil, to our great aſtoniſhment, put the parallel into a ſtate to receive the troops on the next day. They entered it about noon, with drums beating.</p>
               <p>The opening of the trenches, which is ordinarily the moſt fatal period of a ſiege, was in this inſtance executed without the effuſion of blood; a circumſtance the more fortunate, as the wounded would have been unprovided with ſtraw to lie on, and linen rags for the dreſſing of their wounds. This was performed on the 7th: on the 8th and 9th they laboured hard in conſtructing batteries, which were proſecuted with ſuch expedition that thoſe of the Americans and Monſieur de Saint Simon opened about five in the evening. The latter ſoon forced a frigate to move from her moorings, that had been very troubleſome in firing upon our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campments; they alſo levelled a red hot ball at the Charon, a forty-four gun ſhip, and burnt her, as they did likewiſe a ſloop, The batteries of Count Rochambeau began to play on the tenth, at ſeven in the morning; and now the difference of the two firings could eaſily be diſtinguiſhed; that of the enemy was ſlow and irregular, while ours was briſk and well ſupported. Our engineers had pitched upon the moſt advantageous poſitions, and the artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery men made every diſcharge take effect by the exactneſs of their aim, and their alertneſs in working the guns.</p>
               <p>Lord Cornwallis had not prepared his troops for ſuch ſalutations as theſe; he had aſſured them, on the contrary, "that we were unprovided with battering cannon, and had only ſome field pieces; that our troops were raw and unſkilled in war, and that thoſe of M. de Saint Simon in particular, were nothing better than undiſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plined vagabonds, collected in the Weſt Indies, enervated by a hot climate, and would ſoon be conquered, were it only by the firſt attacks of the cold weather, prevalent in theſe countries: and as to the American troops, they knew very well what diſtreſſed cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances they were in; and finally, that powerful ſuccours from New-York would ſoon put them in a ſituation to beſiege the beſiegers."</p>
               <p>This harangue did but increaſe their conſternation. As ſoon as they began to hear the terrible roaring of our batteries, we that were on the heights ſaw them flying precipitately from their redoubts, while their batteries in an inſtant were entirely ſilenced. They had been quiet ſpectators of our labours, and we now became ſo in our turn with reſpect to them. At this time I watched an opportunity to traverſe our lines, which conſiſted of a large ditch, broad enough for carriages to travel in, about four feet in depth, and covered by a rampart of gabions, or cylindrical baſkets, fixed upon the ground, by means of projecting ſtakes, filled and covered over with looſe dirt, and forming a height of about ſeven feet on the ſide towards the enemy. The batteries were placed upon platforms, on the inſide of the ditch, raiſed and ſtrengthened with paliſadoes. The quarter next the enemy was covered by a large parapet, in which were the embraſures for the cannon: all theſe
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:018167_0058_0FA55EF1056925A8"/>
works, as well as moſt of thoſe of the Engliſh conſiſted wholly of earth.</p>
               <p>I now beheld the cannon, thoſe infernal machines, playing with the utmoſt fury; I ſaw the rapid bullet ſtriking or rebounding from the redoubts of the enemy, and driving thro' the air the planks and timber, which formed the embraſures for the great guns. <note n="*" place="bottom">Ours were made of faſcines, and conſequently were leſs expoſed to be damaged by the fire of the enemy.</note> I followed with my eye, in its parabolic path, the ſlow and deſtructive bomb, ſometimes burying itſelf in the roofs of houſes, ſometimes when it burſt, raiſing clouds of duſt and rubbiſh from the ruins of the buildings, at other times blowing the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate wretches, that happened to be within its reach, more than twenty feet high in the air, and letting them fall at a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable diſtance moſt pitiably torn. Such terrible ſights as theſe fix and captivate the attention, and fill the mind at the ſame inſtant with trouble, wonder and conſternation. "The beſieged, (ſaid the deſerters) are in the utmoſt confuſion; not knowing where to fly, death ſeizes them even in the arms of ſleep: and the General, uneaſy at the diſcontent of the Heſſians, no longer confides his advanced guard to any but the Engliſh ſoldiers."</p>
               <p>We had to paſs to our entrenchments through a narrow defile, where the enemy principally directed their fire, and the firſt lodgment for ſuch as ſhould chance to be wounded was but a ſmall diſtance off. I advanced thither as faſt as my health and ſtrength would permit, and perceived that the bullets often fell upon the faſcine cabbin in which we were. I here obſerved, in the dead of night, the different degrees of celerity betwixt the flaſh, the ſound, and the projected body. The light preceded the ſound, and the ſound the ſtroke, but at a much leſs conſiderable interval of time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tarleton,</hi> that impetuous leader, who had ſpread terror through their whole march from Carolina, on the day that the batteries of Count Rochambeau began to play made a ſally by way of Gloceſter, at the head of his legion conſiſting of four hundred picked men. M. le Choiſi, Brigadier General, then marched againſt him with a part of his troops, who together with M. le Duc de Lauzun, at the head of his Huſſars, repulſed him with the loſs of about fifty of his men: this event was a thunder ſtroke to the inhabitants of the country, who had hitherto believed Tarleton invincible, and formed a judgment of his talents from the boldneſs of his thefts and robberies.</p>
               <p>In the night of the eleventh we opened a ſecond parallel, at about three hundred yards from the enemy's main works: a prodigious quantity of royal grenades, or ſmall bombs, from the enemy diſturbed the workmen a good deal, which did not however prevent them from going on with alacrity; but we now relaxed the fire of our artillery for fear of doing them damage by our ſhot, as
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:018167_0059_0FA55EF1ADF7AB70"/>
well as becauſe we began to demoliſh our old batteries to conſtruct new ones. At this time the fire of the enemy became briſker than uſual.</p>
               <p>True bravery manifeſts itſelf chiefly in ſieges. The confuſion, the hurry, the example of others, all contribute during a battle, to rouſe, move and animate the moſt timid, who, in an inſtant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſuperior to themſelves: but in the long continued fatigues of a ſiege, where dangers are inceſtantly growing out of each other, where, in the ſilence and ſolitude of darkneſs we have to face death with coolneſs and unconcern, to reflect on its conſequences and horrors with calmneſs, and ſet the real loſs of life in competition with the uncertainty of our hopes and expectations in a ſtate of futurity, then it is that the courage of a warrior proves itſelf to ſpring from an unbounded love of honour, and an invincible attachment to his duty.</p>
               <p>The French, in this ſiege, ſeemed to become rivals to each other; and each officer envied the lot of him who was ſent upon attempts of the greateſt danger; they hurried away, with a curioſity which I cannot but call raſhneſs and madneſs, to examine the works of the enemy, and haſten the progreſs of our own. Even the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure common ſoldier, whoſe life and death is equally conſigned to oblivion, ſtrove to outdo his renowned officers in theſe daring en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes, and went up in defiance of the enemy to the very edges of their intrenchments. The miner, with the axe in his hand, advanced with a determined ſtep through a ſhower of grape ſhot to cut down the tree at his leiſure, which perhaps ſhielded him from deſtruction. The corps of artillery, ſo diſtinguiſhed by the abilities and intrepidity of their officers, were no leſs ſo by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, ſpirit and courage of their ſoldiery.<note n="*" place="bottom">The ſoldiers of theſe corps, are no way inferior to the others in bravery, capacity, and a fondneſs for doing their duty. I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs they are not ſo fatigued by conſtant exerciſe, nor ſubjected to ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere a diſcipline as the others, and therefore if the ſame ends can be accompliſhed by more ſimple methods, leſs fatiguing to the officers, and leſs hard upon the ſoldiers, why ſhould we heſitate to prefer that mode which is the eaſieſt?</note> General Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton himſelf beheld the effects of this daring ſpirit with aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; a bomb or a bullet, fortunately pointed, excited in them the lively emotions of an eager huntſman, who is upon the point of ſeizing his prey.</p>
               <p>A gunner, at one of the embraſures, had his foot carried away by a bullet. I tried to conſole the unhappy man in the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his anguiſh, when he gave me for anſwer,—"I am leſs afflicted for the loſs of my foot, than for being ſo unfortunate as not to have had time, before it happened, to diſcharge the cannon I had pointed with ſo much care!"—He ſoon after died of his wound, and never ceaſed to complain, till the laſt, of the failure he had made in firing the piece.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="unknown:018167_0060_0FA55EF27601E5B0"/>As long as we were working at the batteries of the ſecond pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel, the fire of the enemy was inceſſantly kept up. The works, that were carried on with the greateſt vigour, were not, however, extended as far as the aſſailants wiſhed. They demanded, with vehement exclamations, to be led on to attack the two detached redoubts, which incommoded them much, and the poſſeſſion of which, would enable them to enfilade a part of the works of the enemy: The eager valour of the Baron de Viomenil, was particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly impatient of reſtraint in this enterprize, when, at length, on the 14th, he was ordered to attack one of them, having under him Count William de Deux Ponts, ſecond Colonel of the regiment of Royal Deux Ponts, and M. le Chevalier de Lameth, Aide-Marechal: The Marquis de la Fayette commanded the attack up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the other, and M. de Gimat was placed under his direction — both redoubts were taken ſword in hand; but unfortuately Count William was wounded, and the Chevalier de Lameth mortally in both his knees.</p>
               <p>The following night four hundred of the beſieged, pretending to be Americans, ſurpriſed one of our batteries, nailed up ſeven pieces of cannon, killed ſome ſoldiers, made a few priſoners, and wounded about thirty: a lad of fifteen years old, ſervant to an officer, who was ſleeping juſt by, was ſtabbed with a bayonet in thirteen or fourteen different parts of his body. The regiment of Soiſſonnais, which was poſted a ſmall diſtance off, knew nothing of this affair till it was over, becauſe the officer who commanded the redoubt had given orders not to fire, or make an alarm at the approach of theſe pretended Americans; this regiment, however, ſoon haſtened up, and had not the Lieutenant Colonel of Saintonge ſounded a retreat, the Engliſh would have been completely ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded. Several of the enemies ſoldiers were wounded and brought to our hoſpitals, and the men who a moment before had been cutting each others throats, were now collected under the ſame roof, and received, indiſcriminately, the ſame care and attention. And thus it is, that in the midſt of the horrors that diſtreſs and diſgrace our nature, there are ſtill ſome traces left of the once noble and exalted diſpoſition of mankind.</p>
               <p>On the ſixteenth and ſeventeenth, our new batteries began to play; broke ſome palliſadoes, and even made a breach in the enemy's works. Lord Cornwallis finding himſelf upon the point of being torn and cruſhed from every quarter, now took the deſperate reſolution of paſſing over in the night to Gloceſter, a poſt ſtill leſs capable of defence than York. Bad weather, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, hindered him from accompliſhing his purpoſe, and on the ſeventeenth, at ten in the morning, he ſent a flag to aſk a ceſſation of arms for twenty-four hours: the deputies were reminded of the behaviour of their Generals at Charleſtown and Savannah in ſimilar circumſtances, and had their requeſt refuſed. Another flag then came out propoſing a ſurrender, when two hours ſuſpenſion of arms was granted them, which term was afterwards prolonged.
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:018167_0061_0FA55EF32BCCD848"/>
Lord Cornwallis deſired to know what terms of capitulation were to be allowed him.— "THOSE OF CHARLESTOWN," anſwered General Waſhington, with ſpirit and judgment.</p>
               <p>By thus recalling a victory to their remembrance, in which they had manifeſted the moſt overbearing inſolence, he taught them to treat the Americans in a different manner, for the time to come, when they ſhould happen to fall under their power. M. le Vicomte de Noailles and Mr. Laurens, an American officer of great merit, ſon of that Preſident of Congreſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, who was ſo long in the tower of London, acted as commiſſioners on this occaſion. The firſt requeſt the Engliſh deputies made was to know the names of our chief Engineers and officers of artillery; for they declared, that it was not in the power of man to point out perſons poſſeſſed of greater talents or ſkill in their profeſſion.</p>
               <p>On the eighteenth of October, about noon, the articles of Capitulation were ſigned, and on the nineteenth, Lord Cornwallis and his army ſurrendered themſelves priſoners of war.—

The ſimple ſuppoſition that they had plundered the inhabitants was humiliating; if it was proved, it would be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable. This motive, as well as the novelty of the fight, was the occaſion of many thouſands of Americans flocking down to ſee the ſurrender of York. Their moſt important object was the negroes. There have been ſeveral anecdotes handed about relative to reclaimed property, one of which bears rather hard upon Tarleton. He ſat out one day to aine with one of our commanding officers, and was mounted upon a very fine horſe, accompanied by ſeveral French Aids de Camp. An American inſtantly appeared and claimed his horſe, ran up, ſtopped him and obliged the Colonel to diſmount, loading him at the ſame time with the moſt bitter invectives. Somebody then lent him a very mean beaſt, upon which he arrived among our officers, who were utterly at a loſs to contrive how a man of ſo much ſpirit could endure to be ſo humbly mounted.</note>

The Bonetta ſloop of war ſhall be fitted for ſea, and retained by her former captain and crew, and left wholly to the diſpoſal of Lord Cornwallis, from the moment the Capitulation ſhall be ſigned.

Lord Cornwallis pretended ſickneſs, to avoid appearing on this occaſion, and it was ſaid, he gave himſelf up entirely to vexation and deſpair: indeed it was no wonder, for he now ſaw the fruit of many years ſucceſs vaniſh in a moment; the painful, laborious march he had made through the deſert, half peopled region of North-Carolina, in order to conquer Virginia, was now entirely loſt. An army, by whom he was almoſt adored, conſiſting of more than ſeven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand choice troops, were obliged to ſurrender their arms to an enemy as much depiſed as hated; twelve thouſand muſquets, more than two hundred pieces of Iron and Braſs cannon, and a prodigious quantity of warlike ſtores were now transferred into hands that would inevitably turn them to the diſadvantage of his country; he moreover ſaw their marine deprived at once of fifteen hundred ſailors and ſixty ſquare-rigged veſſels, excluſive of a ſhip of forty-four guns and two frigates, beſides the total loſs of the commercial productions of Virginia.</p>
               <p>The two lines of the combined army were more than a mile in length; the Americans were to the right: but the diſproportion obſervable among them in point of age and ſize, and the diſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity of their dreſs, which was alſo dirty and ragged, ſet off the French to great advantage, who, notwithſtanding ſo much fatigue, maintained at all times an erect, ſoldierly and vigorous air. But we were all ſurpriſed at the good condition of the Engliſh troops, as well as their cleanlineſs of dreſs; to account for their good appearance, Cornwallis had opened all the ſtores to the ſoldiers before the capitulation took place. Each had on a complete new ſuit, but all their ſinery ſeemed only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Upon their return, the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh officers had the civility to pay a compliment to the meaneſt of the French, which they did not deign to do to the Americans of the higheſt rank. <note n="§" place="bottom">An officer belonging to the American army remarked, that after the ſurrender, the Engliſh behaved with the ſame overbearing inſolence as if they had been conquerors, the Scots wept bitterly, while the Germans only conducted themſelves decently, and in a manner becoming Priſoners.—With a meanneſs always attendant upon vanquiſhed inſolence, the Engliſh ſervilely cringed to the French, vainly attempting to ſcreen the diſgrace of being conquered by thoſe they bad ſo often denominated American <hi>rebels,</hi> and republicans.</note>

Among others I ſaw the lady of an Engliſh Colonel come to our camp, with tears in her eyes, to beg the protection of a French guard to defend her and her infants from the violence of an American ſoldier. The next day after the ſurrender, the officers that were priſoners came over to view our entrenchments, but when they went to examine thoſe of the Americans, they were driven away with contempt and indignation. During the whole time they remained at York, I do not remember that they had the leaſt connexion or intercourſe with the Americans, while they lived upon familiar terms with the French, and ſought upon all occaſions to give them proofs of their eſteem. <note n="‡" place="bottom">The Engliſh newſpapers have given the French full credit for the generoſity and delicacy with which they treated the Britiſh priſoners.

               <p>THE American war, the ſucceſs of which has appeared ſo dubious, offers to our view two events, almoſt unparalleled in any war that hiſtory has recorded in her annals: I mean two entire armies made priſoners, who nevertheleſs were urder the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Generals of the firſt note and ability. It now remains to aſk, which of the two has diſcovered the deepeſt talents, and the moſt activity, or experienced the greateſt obſtacles, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the moſt miſtakes.</p>
               <p>Being myſelf a witneſs to the efforts of one army, and ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by perſons who had a ſhare in reducing the other, having alſo in my hands ſome exact and faithful accounts of that affair, I will venture a few reflections.</p>
               <p>Let us in the firſt place take a curſory view of Burgoyne's cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign, and we ſhall be the better enabled to compare him with his brother in misfortune, <hi>Lord Cornwallis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Burgoyne, formed by nature with an active, enterpriſing diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, animated by a moſt extravagant love of glory, a favorite alſo of the court of London, was furniſhed amply with the means of ſecuring the moſt brilliant ſucceſs. His army conſiſted of ſeven thouſand one hundred and ſeventy three regular troops, Engliſh and Germans, excluſive of a corps of artillery, and ſeven or eight hundred men, under the orders of Colonel St. Leger: all his offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers were men of approved merit, and he was provided with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable train of artillery and ammunition of every ſort. Guy Carleton, Governor of Canada, who had the care of furniſhing the particular articles, forgot nothing that might contribute to the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the expedition. The ſervices this governor had rendered to the crown,—the preſervation of Canada, which was owing to his exertions alone, and the perfect knowledge he had of the whole country, ſeem to have given him the beſt pretenſions to the
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:018167_0067_0FA55EFBCC491888"/>
chief command, but he had a ſpirit great enough to forget this piece of injuſtice;<note n="*" place="bottom">They have now made him their commander in chief in North-America, in the room of Sir Henry Clinton. Misfortunes are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in every country to ſilence cabal and intrigue, and render impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial juſtice to merit; but it too often happens, that applications to real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſerving men come too late to be of any ſervice.</note> and went ſo far in favour of his rival, as to conſent to make treaties with the ſavages, tho' contrary to his own private opinion, and from them obtained a conſiderable body of Indians and warriors. The unſteady, capricious temper of theſe people, their barbarous and bloody cuſtoms, their thirſt for plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, their infidelity in fulfilling their engagements, did not all hinder the Engliſh from making them the companions of their expected conqueſts: Burgoyne harangued them with an eloquent oration on the ſhores of Lake Champlaine, calculated to inflame their courage and reſtrain their barbarity. But what influence can eloquence have over the minds of thoſe men, who in their whole language have not two words to ſignify <hi>equity</hi> and <hi>humanity.</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <p>Theſe Savages being parcelled out into numerous tribes, have conſequently manners more or leſs barbarous; ſeveral of them take the membrane that covers the ſcull, from the enemies they kill in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and carry it off in triumph, with the hair on, and even drink their blood.</p>
                     <p>The Spaniards have been reproached for exerciſing cruelties upon the inhabitants of the countries they conquered; but it appears that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of this kind are no leſs well founded againſt the Engliſh.</p>
                     <p>An Indian ſpeech that was given me by a profeſſor at Williamſburg, a tranſlation of which is ſubjoined, is a proof of this. It diſcovers at the ſame time, the bold and maſculine energy with which theſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages are taught by nature to expreſs themſelves.</p>

This place, built by the French, in 1756, is ſituated weſtward, towards the ſtreight that preſerves the communication between the Lakes <hi>George,</hi> and <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine,</hi> upon a point of land covered with ſharp rocks, and hemmed in by water on three ſides. The part adjoining the main land is covered by a deep marſh, and defended by the old French lines: to theſe the Americans had added ſeveral other works, and a group of fortifications, called by them a <hi>block-houſe.</hi> They alſo fortified the ſummit and the foot of a high mountain, on the eaſtern ſide, called <hi>Mount Independence,</hi> and with aſtoniſhing ardour and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry united both theſe poſts, by a bridge thown over the ſtreight, ſupported by twenty-two huge piles, each fifty feet long and twelve thick, faſtened together by cramp irons and large chains.</p>
               <p>Lake Champlaine was, on the ſide next the bridge, defended by a boom, compoſed of beams laſhed together, and wound round with chains. By this means a communication was not only kept up between the two poſts, but no poſſibility of acceſs offered on the northern ſide.</p>
               <p>Although Ticonderoga is of itſelf lofty, it is nevertheleſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, in eminence, by another mountain called <hi>Sugar Hill,</hi> from its being in the form of a ſugar loaf. The Americans had entertained thoughts of fortifying it, but concluded that the works were already too extenſive for their means of defence, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that its difficulty of acceſs, and the rocky inequality of its ſurface would hinder the enemy from taking advantage of its ſituation.</p>
               <p>The royal army advanced with great caution along the ſides of the lake, having in the center their fleet, which, on its coming up, anchored within cannon ſhot of the enemy. On the approach of the right wing, the Americans, to the great ſurpriſe of the royaliſts, abandoned their works on the ſide next Lake George, and ſet fire to them: Major General Philips then took poſſeſſion of an advantageous poſt on Mount <hi>Hope,</hi> which, beſides that it commanded their lines, cut off their communication with the lake. It is ſaid the Americans ſhewed but little courage in defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the other poſts on this ſide as well as on the other.</p>
               <p>The Britiſh army advanced with an equal celerity on the other ſide of the lake, and in a ſhort time inveſted all their works. The advantages that Sugar Hill preſented, ſoon determined the Engliſh to build redoubts there, and the paths they were obliged to climb, upon a rugged and almoſt perpendicular ſurface, did not hinder the alert Major General Philips from erecting his works in a very ſhort ſpace of time.</p>
               <p>The American Generals now thought proper to hold a council of war, in which was repreſented, "that they had not above half the neceſſary number of working hands, that the neceſſity for labour increaſed as the hands diminiſhed, and that the place would be inevitably and completely inveſted in leſs than twenty-four
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:018167_0069_0FA55EFFC94DDDD0"/>
hours." It was then unanimouſly reſolved to evacuate the poſt, which was immediately put in execution.</p>
               <p>It has been ſince aſked, with a degree of reproach, "why, if the forces were not ſufficient to defend it, did they not withdraw the troops; remove the artillery and ſtores and demoliſh the fortifications before the arrival of the enemy? Why did they wait to be ſurrounded, at an inſtant when a retreat was apparently more prejudicial than a ſurrender upon ſuch terms as might have been granted, and which would have been infinitely preferable to the riſque they ran of having their fortifications carried by aſſault?."</p>
               <p>Immediately, upon the determination of the council to evacuate the place, the American army embarked their baggage, their artillery, and their proviſions in a decked veſſel, and more than two hundred batteaus, eſcorted by five gallies; directing their courſe towards Skeneſborough, while the garriſon marched towards Caſtletown.</p>
               <p>The next morning the royaliſts having diſcovered the precipitate flight of the Americans, took poſſeſſion of the bridge and fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, and this enormous maſs, which had coſt more than twenty months labour, was now cut up in leſs time than it would take to relate it. By five in the morning, the frigates <hi>Royal George,</hi> and <hi>Inflexible</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">This ſhip was built in twenty eight days and mounted eighteen twelve pounders.</note> had a free paſſage through, and Burgoyne loſt no time in purſuing the enemy by water, whilſt the troops marched after them by land. He overtook them, at length, near <hi>Skeneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough falls,</hi> where he ſeized two of the gallies, and blew up three others. The Americans, being now in a deſperate ſituation, ſet fire to their batteaus, mills and fortifications, and ſaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the woods, unprovided, and deſtitute of every thing.</p>
               <p>Confuſion and diſmay predominated in like manner among the forces on the left; the ſoldiers no longer obeyed the commands of their officers, and in this ſituation Brigadier General Frazer came up with their rear guard, with a body of troops far inferior, and attacked them, expecting every moment to be joined by General Reidſel. The Americans, at firſt defended themſelves bravely, but at the coming up of the laſt mentioned commander, they fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d precipitately, after loſing a conſiderable number of their men, together with Colonel Francis, their leader, and one of their braveſt officers. General Saint-Clair, who commanded the van<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>guard, when informed of theſe diſaſtrous circumſtances, took immediately to the woods, in doubt whether to march to the upper parts of Connecticut or towards Fort Edward. Colonel Hill was detached from Skeneſborough, with the ninth regiment towards Fort Anne, and on his way, fell in, with a body of American troops, ſix times as numerous as his own, which he defeated after three hours engaging. The Americans then burnt Fort Anne, and f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed to Fort Edward upon Hudſon's river.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="unknown:018167_0070_0FA55F001C4194E0"/>General Saint-Clair arrived at Fort Edward, (where General Schuyler commanded,) with the remains of his army, after a march of ſeven days, in a moſt deplorable condition, having ſuffered every diſtreſs that imagination can conceive, from the bad quality of the water, and want of cloaths and proviſions: He was here joined by the other fugitives, equally weak, fatigued and diſcouraged.</p>
               <p>Burgoyne, without loſing time, ſet out from Skeneſborough, on his march to Fort Edward, but encountered great difficulties and embarraſſments, although the diſtance is not very conſiderable; for the country is naturally ſo wild, ſo deſert, ſo incumbered with marſhes, interſected with creek<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and the enemy had ſo increaſed theſe natural obſtacles by huge lines of abbatis, that it is not eaſy to conceive how much he had to ſuffer in ſurmounting theſe difficulties. He had to conſtruct near forty bridges or cauſeways, and one of them, made of trunks of trees, was more than a mile in length. It is true, he might have avoided all this trouble in taking his rout round by Ticonderoga, but he feared a retrograde movement of his army might give the Americans time to recover their courage, and ſlacken the ardour of his own troops.</p>
               <p>It is worth while to obſerve, that in all this diſtreſs, misfortune, and univerſal conſternation, not a ſingle diſtrict in America ſeemed in the leaſt diſpoſed to come in, or make its ſubmiſſion. The danger did not diſcourage even thoſe States which were moſt expoſed to the depredations of the enemy; under the direction of the Congreſs they all united with the greateſt vigour to repulſe them; and General Arnold was diſpatched to the Northern army with a train of artillery, furniſhed him by General Waſhington on purpoſe for this expedition. At his arrival, he ordered the troops from Saratoga to a place called <hi>Stillwater,</hi> in order to be in a better ſituation to check the progreſs of Colonel Saint Leger, who was advancing toward the Mohawk river. His troops, however, (St. Leger's) ſuffered great loſſes from the Indians: the efforts of Burgoyne not being ſufficient to reſtrain their cruelty, friends as well as enemies fell alike victims to their thirſt of blood. The murder of Miſs <hi>M'Crea,</hi> in particular, ſtruck terror into every heart: She was then in the bloom and innocence of beauty and youth, her father was attached to the royal party, and upon the very day that ſhe f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Scenes ſo ſhocking as theſe, irritated the people almoſt to diſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and kindled a ſpirit of hatred, even in the diſaffected, againſt a government capable of accepting <hi>allies,</hi> more diſpoſed to extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate than ſubdue the people, whom they claimed as ſubjects.</p>
               <p>The Americans now began to think it their duty to defend not only the rights of their country, but alſo thoſe that nature herſelf had given them. Each citizen became a ſoldier, and when their regular forces ſeemed almoſt annihilated, deſpair poured forth mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes, ſtill more formidable, from the woods, the mountains, and the borders of the marſhes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="unknown:018167_0071_0FA55F00AD268090"/>It was now that Burgoyne's army began to experience real diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, in the neighbourhood of Fort Edward;—in proportion as they advanced, obſtacles multiplied on every ſide; for fifteen days, they were employed in bringing down batteaus and proviſions from Fort George to Hudſon's river, a diſtance of more than eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen miles: this exceſſive labour was quite unequal to the waſte of time and proviſions; they did not receive one third of the horſes they expected from Canada, on account of the length of the way, and the great number of water paſſages; and for the ſame reaſon they could not collect more than fifty pair of oxen; heavy rains added ſtill more to their difficulties, and in the end, they found it impoſſible to eſtabliſh magazines to continue their operations.</p>
               <p>Intelligence was at laſt received, that Colonel Saint Leger had arrived before, and was directing his views againſt, Fort Stanwix: Burgoyne upon this, concluded, with ſome reaſon, that if he could proſecute his march rapidly forward, and advance down the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawk river, ſuppoſing at the ſame time Colonel Saint Leger to ſucceed in his attack on the fort, he ſhould draw the enemy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two fires, or at leaſt have it in his power to force them to change their ſituation, and retreat to a greater diſtance, which would consequently open the Mohawk country to him, and afford him the means of executing his intended junction.</p>
               <p>However juſt this plan might be, it could not be carried into execution for want of proviſions, to connect ſo long a chain of poſts with Fort George; and becauſe the enemy had a body of troops at <hi>White-Creek,</hi> ſufficient to break it.</p>
               <p>He abandoned this project then, and fell upon a ſcheme of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing Bennington, where the Americans had great ſtores of corn and cattle. Bennington lies between two branches of the river <hi>Hooſick,</hi> about twenty miles eaſt of the Hudſon, a place of little importance, and incapable by its ſituation of ever becoming con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, unleſs ſome remarkable changes ſhould take place. This expedition Burgoyne intruſted to Colonel Baum, a German, and gave him five hundred men, and two pieces of artillery for the purpoſe; and to be the better enabled to make the beſt of ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages as ſhould be gained, he fixed his main camp before Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toga, and made a bridge of boats over the river, upon which the advanced corps might paſs. During theſe tranſactions, the corps of Colonel Breyman, conſiſting of light infantry, was poſted at <hi>Battenkill,</hi> with a deſign, if neceſſary, to ſupport Colonel Baum. The latter, in his march, fell in with a ſmall proviſion convoy of the enemy, which he took: But the want of waggons and horſes, made his march ſo long and fatiguing, that the Americans got intelligence of his deſign, and had time to prepare to receive him. The Colonel, upon his approach to the place, finding that his force was not ſufficient to make an attack, with a proſpect of ſucceſs, poſted himſelf in as favourable a ſituation as poſſible, and ſent off an expreſs to the General. Breyman then had orders to reinforce Colonel Baum, without loſs of time: He obeyed, but
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:018167_0072_0FA55F0173531960"/>
his march was long and difficult, meeting with nothing but bad water and bad roads; the want of horſes and wheel carriages, add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtill more to his embarraſſments, and a long continuance of heavy rains, rendered his condition almoſt as wretched as can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be conceived. But the American General, Starke, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Bennington militia, effectually prevented their junc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He marched on the 16th of Auguſt to attack Colonel Baum, and the latter was ſo far from expecting ſuch a viſit, that he took him at firſt for the reinforcement he was waiting for: However, he made a very brave defence, but his little works were ſoon forced on all ſides; the Indians and the Engliſh provincial troops, had already ran away into the woods, and there remained only the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, who, after they had expended all their powder, charged the enemy ſword in hand, but were finally forced to ſurrender priſoners of war, after ſeeing their Colonel fall.</p>
               <p>A little after this action arrives Colonel Breyman, without knowing any thing of what had paſſed: Inſtead of friends, he ſaw himſelf ſuddenly ſurrounded by American forces; but the fatigued and exhauſted ſtate of his troops did not prevent him from making a ſoldierly defence. He even drove the enemy from two or three heights; but was, however, at laſt overpowered by numbers; and after firing away all his ammunition, made a retreat with great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, leaving two pieces of artillery in the hands of the enemy. Their loſs in theſe two actions, amounted in killed, wounded and miſſing to five or ſix hundred men; and in this ſtroke, Fortune now, for the firſt time, ſince the death of General Montgomery, ſhowed herſelf favourable to the Americans in their expeditions to the north: The militia at length found they <hi>could</hi> conquer regular forces; an opinion of more conſequence at this time than the gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a great battle upon other occaſions.</p>
               <p>While Saint Leger was employed, with various ſucceſs in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieging Fort Stanwix, General Harkimer came at the head of nine hundred of the militia of the country to relieve and victual the fort: Upon this Saint Leger, fearing an attack in his entren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hments, fixed an ambuſcade, compoſed of regulars and Indians to intercept them. The militia, a thing almoſt incredible in a country where this kind of warfare is uſual, fell blindly into it, loſt a conſiderable number, and could not be rallied but with the greateſt difficulty. The Governor of the fort, Colonel Ganſevoort, informed, in the mean time, of what had happened, haſtened to make a diverſion in favour of his friends, penetrated into the Engliſh camp, plundered it, carried off a great quantity of ſuch articles as he was in want of, and made ſome priſoners. <note n="§" place="bottom">Note, this ſally was made under the immediate direction of Colonel Willet.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Colonel Saint Leger, after his ſucceſs, neglected nothing to engage the beſieged to ſurrender. The Governor, however, continued deaf to his menaces, as well as to his promiſes and intreaties.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="unknown:018167_0073_0FA55F022E4346E8"/>In the ſkirmiſh with the militia, the Indians did not get the booty they expected; they beſides loſt ſeveral of their warriors, celebrated among them for their bravery, and now learnt with extreme vexation that General Arnold was coming to the relief of the place with a thouſand men, and that Burgoyne had met with ſeveral checks, if not totally ruined. Their diſcontent and ill humour was then carried to exceſs: notwithſtanding all that could be ſaid or done to calm, and retain theſe daſtards with the army, they left the camp, after having robbed the officers, pillaged the ſtores, cut the throats of ſeveral of the ſoldiers and ſtolen their arms and proviſions, which in the end forced Colonel Saint Leger to raiſe the ſiege in haſte, and even leave behind a part of his baggage. This laſt piece of news completed the joy and confidence of the Americans, while Ganſevoort and Willet, who had defended the place, were ranked, as well as General Starke and Colonel Warner, in the number of the Saviours of their country.</p>
               <p>Burgoyne, ſupplying himſelf conſtantly with proviſions from Fort George, but with great difficulty, paſſed Hudſon's River about the middle of September, the enemy being at that time in the vicinity of Stillwater. The Miniſtry and Parliament have examined whether this march was either neceſſary or ſeaſonable, but it has not appeared that any ſufficient arguments have been brought againſt it: it is evident, that Burgoyne was determined in his meaſures not only by immediate circumſtances, but alſo by the inſtructions of his court. He afterwards advanced through bye-roads and routs little frequented, along the river, on the ſame ſide with the enemy, and often ſeparated from them only by thin woods. He marched in perſon at the head of the Engliſh line, which formed the right wing. This wing was covered by General Frazer, and Colonel Breyman, with the grenadiers and light infantry, Indian eſcorts, Provincials and Canadians: the left wing and the artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, commanded by Majors Philips, and Reidſel, followed the ſhores of the river.</p>
               <p>The Americans now preſented themſelves in force to attack the flank of the Engliſh line. The latter were not a little ſurpriſed, when they ſaw with what boldneſs the enemy began the attack, and with what vigour and obſtinacy they ſupported it from three in the afternoon till ſun-ſet. General Arnold led on his troops, and courted danger with an ardor and intrepidity, which although na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to his character, could never have been ſhown to better ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage: the Americans however were conſtantly reinforced with freſh troops, whilſt, on the ſide of the Engliſh, the weight and burden of the action was almoſt continually ſuſtained by the ſame perſons.</p>
               <p>Major-Gereral Philips, upon hearing the firſt fire, marched with a part of the artillery acroſs a piece of woods, very difficult of acceſs, and his arrival, in a critical minute, for that time ſaved the army, who remained maſters of the field. This victory was honourably gained, but gave them to know, that the Americans
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:018167_0074_0FA55F0300372148"/>
were capable of defending themſelves, not only in entrenchments, and behind walls and hedges, but in the open field, uncovered, and for a conſiderable ſpace of time. The Engliſh remained under arms the whole night, and at day-break advanced within cannon ſhot of the enemy, fortifying their wings and extending their left towards the river; but they found the Americans too much upon their guard to be meddled with.</p>
               <p>The fatigues the army had undergone, and the diſcouraging proſpect they had before them, confounded at once all the hopes and expectations with which the Indians, in particular, had flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered themſelves; it was now impoſſible to get any further ſervices from them; they became ſullen and intractable, and upon the General finding ſome fault with their conduct, they abandoned the army and went off in a pet, at a time when it ſtood moſt in need of their aſſiſtance. This Indian deſertion brought on others among the Engliſh, as well as the Provincial and Canadian troops.</p>
               <p>Burgoyne had ſtill however, ſome hopes of being ſuccoured by an army from New-York; with much difficulty he received a letter from Sir Henry Clinton in cyphers, informing him that he was about to make a diverſion in his favour upon the North river, by attacking Fort Montgomery and ſeveral other of the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fortreſſes: Burgoyne by way of anſwer, preſſed him for aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, gave an account of his ſituation, and informed him that his proviſions could not hold out longer than the twelfth of the enſuing month.</p>
               <p>The army under the command of General Gates, increaſing from day to day, obliged Burgoyue to fortify with the greateſt attention, and to add conſiderably to the number of guards, which neceſſarily increaſed the fatigue and weakened the troops: the late ſucceſſes of the militia had likewiſe made them more enterpriſing than before, and thoſe of New-Hampſhire and the upper parts of Connecticut, commanded by General Lincoln, recovered Ticon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deroga and Mount Independence, made themſelves maſters of lake George, and thus cut off Burgoyne from all communication with Canada.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of October this unfortunate General was obliged to diminiſh his rations, and then determined, whatever might be the conſequence, to force himſelf a paſſage through the country. For this purpoſe he picked out the choiceſt of his troops, and the braveſt and beſt experienced of his officers: but the Americans perceiving his deſign, came down by thouſands to attack him. It was then that the Engliſh began to ſink under the numbers of their enemies; they were forced to retire within their lines, into which General Arnold purſued them with his uſual impetuoſity, and would infallibly have forced them, had he not received a wound.</p>
               <p>Colonel Breyman, who commanded a German corps de reſerve, was ſtill more unfortunate; his camp was attacked and carried,
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:018167_0075_0FA55F03D87765B0"/>
his baggage pillaged, his cannon taken, and he himſelf periſhed in the action. This day the Engliſh loſt a part of their braveſt men, and nothing could exceed their miſery and diſtreſs; they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured the whole night to change their poſition, hoping to oblige the enemy to change theirs alſo. This buſineſs was accompliſhed with incredible ſilence and activity, and in the morning they offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed battle to the Americans, who declined it; conſidering, with good reaſon, that it would be better to fatigue and harraſs a brave and deſperate enemy, than to expoſe themſelves to the chance of a deciſive action.</p>
               <p>The Engliſh General was now informed, that the enemy had diſpatched forward a conſiderable body, to ſurround him entirely. This, he took every meaſure in his power to prevent, and upon the night of the ninth of October, began to march, leaving his ſick and wounded to provide for themſelves; but the care General Gates took of theſe has been ſince gratefully acknowledged by the Engliſh themſelves.</p>
               <p>A heavy rain, that laſted the whole night, rendered their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs very ſlow; and at break of day he perceived the Americans poſted and fortified on the heights around him. He then took a reſolution to march towards Fort Edward, but his road cutters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing repulſed, and the oppoſite ſhore of the river lined with enemies, he concluded to call a council of war; upon conſidering the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they ſaw no other probable way of reaching this Fort than by a night march, and the ſoldiers carrying their proviſions on their backs: But while they were preparing to execute this forlorn pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, they learnt that the enemy had taken ſufficient precautions to prevent the execution of their deſign.</p>
               <p>Nothing could have been more wretched—nothing more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable than the condition of this army. Worn down by a long ſeries of ſevere duty, marches and actions; forſaken by the Indians in the needful moment, weakened by deſertion, dejected and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by the timidity of the Canadians and provincial troops, their regular corps reduced by repeated loſſes, to the number of on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly three thouſand five hundred, their braveſt officers killed, the reſt forced to be continually under arms, harraſſed day and night, by an enemy that ſeemed to grow out of the ground on every ſide, having loſt all hope of relief, and but three days proviſions left, their laſt reſource was to make the beſt terms they could with the enemy. The General, willing however, in an affair that regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the future well-being of every individual in the army, to have their unanimous voice, as far as poſſible, called a council of war, inviting not only the generals and ſtaff-officers, but all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding captains: theſe univerſally gave it as their opinion, <hi>that the army could not do otherwiſe than treat with General Gates</hi>; and the Engliſh have ſince done the latter the juſtice to declare, that, conſidering the ground on which he ſtood, he ſhowed not the leaſt mark of inſolence or arrogance.—</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="unknown:018167_0076_0FA55F0470D918B0"/>The ſubſtance of the principal articles was, that the army ſhould march out of their camp with the honours of war, and their artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, to an appointed place, where they ſhould pile their arms: that a paſſage ſhould be granted them from Boſton to Europe, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condition of their not ſerving in America during the preſent war.—They reckoned their loſs from the ſixth of July, to the capitulation, incluſive, to amount to near ten thouſand men.</p>
               <p>The great fault of Burgoyne, and what prepared the way to all his misfortunes, was his march to Fort Edward; if he had return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Ticonderoga, and proceeded to Fort George, he would doubtleſs have avoided theſe diſaſters, but, as has been obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he feared that a retrograde movement would ſlacken the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of his troops, and give the Americans time to recover from their ſurpriſe. A General is always blameable when he ventures far into unexplored countries; but Burgoyne, who had ſeen the Americans fly, on all ſides, at his approach, notwithſtanding their ſuperiority in number, and thoſe vaſt fortifications which both na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and art had rendered impregnable, could he believe that theſe very men would afterwards dare to ſhow themſelves, ſurround him on every ſide, and fight him in the open field?</p>
               <p>The ſhame of re-iterated defeats, the immediate calamities they felt, and greater ſtill to be expected, the dread of Indian cruelty and indiſcriminate plunder; all theſe conſiderations muſt have wrought wonderfully on the minds of the Americans to have produced ſo ſudden and univerſal a change; let it be remembered, however, that the very elements aſſiſted in the reduction of Burgoyne; the heavy rains threw continual obſtacles in his way, particularly in the affair of Bennington, where, by delaying the march of Colonel Breyman, General Starke had an opportunity of attacking and defeating Colonel Baum, before the other's arrival; the Indians, likewiſe, forſook him at the very time when they could be of uſe to him; his expected reinforcements never joined him; and Clinton, who then commanded at New-York, and might with the greateſt eaſe have ſailed in force up the North River, was too ſlow in making the diverſion. All that genius, activity and courage could ſuggeſt was put into practice by Burgoyne; his marches were judicious, his poſitions advantageous, and his ſkirmiſhes obſtinate: But the Americans, reanimated by hope, and emboldened by deſpair, became every day more numerous active and warlike.</p>
               <p>As to Lord Cornwallis, he had to contend with enemies better diſciplined and longer inured to war, but he had the advantage or Burgoyne in long experience in America, in a more exact know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the country, in being better ſupplyed with proviſions and ammunition and not having to ſtruggle with ſuch ſevere weather and impaſſable tracts of wilderneſs: He had alſo the moſt perfect confidence of his troops and was become ſo formidable to the enemy, that General Waſhington was thought to be the only man that could, as ſuch, be placed in competition with him. Burgoyne had conſtantly to do with enemies who were either ſtrongly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:018167_0077_0FA55F05DC9AEBF8"/>
or infinitely more numerous than his own troops. Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wallis, on the contrary, at the head of an army of at leaſt eight thouſand choice troops, and always ſuperior to his diſperſed enemies, yet, ſtrange as it may ſeem, did not think proper to attack the Marquis de la Fayette, who never had more at any time than two thouſand, nor to hinder the landing of three thouſand men under the orders of M. de Saint Simon, to prevent th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m from joining the Marquis. If he had marched down upon them at their firſt land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he would have found a body of men totally ignorant of the country they were in, their arms and ammunition yet on board the veſſels, and not a ſingle intrenchment thrown up: ſuperior to them ſtill, after their junction with the Marquis, and threatened with the approach of the armies of General Waſhington and Count Rochambeau, ought he not to have haſtened, by forced marches, to attack and diſperſe them, that he might afterwards have it in his power to make head againſt the others? <note n="*" place="bottom">It was believed, at firſt, that Cornwallis's army did not conſiſt of more than four or five thouſand men: without this preſumption it would have been highly imprudent in M de Saint Simon to have landed his troops, before the arrival of General Waſhington and Count Rochambeau. But if notwithſtanding that, their landing had been attended with all conſequences, he would certainly have been liable to ſevere reprehenſion.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But if, after the inſtructions of Clinton, and his promiſes of ſpeedily relieving him, he nevertheleſs thought it improper to hazard any attack, how advantageous ſoever it might promiſe to be, he ought at leaſt to have done all in his power to retard and prolong the ſiege; for whatever might have been the relief promiſed by Clinton, contrary winds might have delayed its arrival, and a few days gained would have been of the greateſt importance to him. He likewiſe knew that Count de Graſſe had declared that he could not remain but a ſhort time in the bay; ſo that, retarding his departure, would have been deranging his plans, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently hindering him from ſerving his country elſewhere: The ſeaſon being, alſo, pretty well advanced, the autumnal rains muſt have made the ſiege very fatiguing to our troops, and perhaps have occaſioned contagious diſtempers among them, in a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try where the air and water are leſs wholeſome than more north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. <note n="†" place="bottom">This is the more probable, as the lines being very extenſive, in reſpect to the number of men, the duty was more conſtant. Some ſoldiers were eleven nights without lying down in their tents, a greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſeven or eight, and the reſt four or five.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The diſtance between York and Williamſburg is twelve miles, and this whole interval is covered with very thick woods; it would certainly have been an eaſy matter then, for Cornwallis to have made lines of <hi>abbatis</hi> throughout this foreſt, and have ſtopped up
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:018167_0078_0FA55F06418F6DE8"/>
the roads from poſt to poſt; three thouſand ſlaves at leaſt, which he had taken from the planters, would have rendered this mode of defence ſtill more practicable—all our military connoiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeurs have given it as their opinion that a few detachmen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s and ſome field pieces, might have retarded the combined army at leaſt a month in its approaches to the works at York, and probably would have deſtroyed us a great number of men. The lands adjoining the town were covered with Indian corn, and by taking it away or burning it, he would have obliged the aſſailants to get food for their horſes at a greater diſtance, and by that means delayed the tranſportation of the artillery, which was landed ſeveral miles from the camp.</p>
               <p>Cornwallis thus ſhut up in York, with artillery badly enough ſerved, and his works diſadvantageouſly conſtructed, had it not in his power to ſally out upon us without riſquing too much, while the beſiegers had time to prepare to receive him, and even to cut off his retreat: being thus incapacitated from acting offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, he could no way extricate himſelf but by ſome deſperate attempt.</p>
               <p>If he had known how to profit by circumſtances, the relief pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed by Clinton might have ſaved him, or at leaſt made a great diverſion in his favour. The Engliſh ſquadron, conſiſting of twenty-ſeven or twenty-eight ſhips of the line, with four thouſand land forces on board, appeared before the capes on the 26th of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that is to ſay, ſeven days after the ſurrender. Count de Graſſe's fleet, being thirty-ſix ſhips of the line, was then at anchor within the <hi>Horſe-Shoe,</hi> a ſand bank, over which veſſels of war cannot paſs, except through a narrow channel on the eaſt ſide; the wind blowing at that time right in, compleatly prevented the ſquadron from getting under way, and conſequently could not have hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Clinton from effecting a landing for his troops. I cannot ſay whether it was a fear of bad weather that inclined the Count to make choice of this place, but his over great precaution was, I am ſure, an obſtacle to his purſuit of the Engliſh, the wind being fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable enough, had the fleet been in any other place.</p>
               <p>May we now aſk which of the two Engliſh Generals has mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted the beſt conduct? For my part I am of opinion, Burgoyne would have ſucceeded better in defending York, and that Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wallis <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>And yet Cornwallis has received univerſal applauſe in England, while Burgoyne experienced nothing but ſatire, contempt and invective.

               <p>THIS great and happy event, in which the French have had ſo conſiderable a ſhare, will ſoon give a new turn to Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can affairs. The ſouthern ſtates ſo long harraſſed and diſtreſt, will now aſſume new ſpirit and activity. The power of Congreſs, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore weak and wavering, will be conſolidated, and the prejudices againſt our nation will vaniſh.

               <p>This country is interſected and watered in every part, with lakes, rivers, creeks and rivulets. The lakes, and ſome of the rivers open a communication with very diſtant regions, a conveniency which cannot be enjoyed in other parts of the world to any great perfection, without the previous aſſiſtance of art, and the ſoil and labour of men in digging canals.

               <p>Our European cities and towns, for the moſt part, afford us to this day ſtriking proofs of the calamities, ignorance, miſery and barbarity of our anceſtors, in their unpleaſant, unhealthy ſituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in their walls planted round with battlements, their formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble turrets of defence, their cloſe and compact buildings, almoſt without air or light, and their crooked, muddy ſtreets, equally incommodious and diſguſting; but the American towns are upon a different plan; not walled in, as if mankind were to live in eternal diſtruſt of each other, they are built on agreeable ſalubrious ſpots of land, waſhed by pure and navigable waters, ſurrounded by fertile fields, laid out in ſpacious ſtreets croſſing each other in direct lines, and ornamented with buildings every where beautiful convenient and regular.</p>

lay the ſoldier under the wretched neceſſity either of violating the laws of humanity, of religion, of his country—or to loſe at once the fruit of his ſervices and dangers, and appear no longer among his countrymen except with diſgrace and infamy. <note n="‡" place="bottom">
                     <p>In a diſpute betwixt a French and an American officer (the only one that has happened) the Frenchman firſt drew his ſword; the American refuſed to follow his example and finding his long halbert a more certain weapon of defence, wounded his adverſary therewith. In France he would have been driven with diſgrace out of the army, but General Waſhington contented himſelf with puniſhing the American, not for having combated with unequal arms, but for raiſing a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbance in the army.</p>
                     <p>The practice of duelling deprives us of ſeveral thouſand men yearly; a loſs the more conſiderable, as they are for the moſt part experienced officers, accuſtomed to diſcipline and able to bear fatigue, but whoſe places are often ſupplied by raw young fellows, ruined by debauchery, and moſt of whom ſink under the weight of the ſervice. Is it impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then to deſtroy this inhuman practice, which, notwithſtanding the efforts of ſeveral princes, remains to this day? By no means—firſt of all let the <hi>fencing ſchools</hi> be ſuppreſſed; in theſe places, young fellows ſoon grow idle and corrupt, acquire a wrangling ſpirit, and a bully<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing behaviour, which is a plague to ſociety, and moſt frequently proves fatal to themſelves. The Knights of the age of chivalry, whom we are apt to call barbarous and ignorant, were leſs ſo in this reſpect than ourſelves. They exerciſed at arms, but only with a view to encourage an art which ſtrengthed their bodies, and rendered them more active and redoubtable in fight. But of what adva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>age is the art of fencing among us? what good could an army of fencing maſters do in repelling an invaſion? If, then, this art avails nothing to the defence of a country, and is dangerous to the citizens, why not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it, and prohibit the practice? Except fire arms, the cutlaſs is the only weapon that the troops make uſe of in actual ſervice, and why cannot the management of it be learnt in ſchools, appropriated to the corps in ſervice only, and the carrying of it be forbidden to all other citizens, and even (as is the practice of ſome nations) to the military themſelves, when not upon real duty. Let no officer be expell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from his corps for having refuſed a challenge, but rather let ſuch a conduct be the means of his advancement, eſpecially if his ſkill and bravery have been tried on other occaſions. The man who is capable of ſacrificing vulgar prejudice to the good of his country, certainly merits its thanks; and whoever ſhould reproach ſuch a one, ought to be driven away or puniſhed, be he officer or ſoldier. Whoever ſends a challenge, ought to ſuffer diſhonour and diſgrace, and the commanders ſhould be alſo obliged, under ſevere penalties, not to ſuffer <hi>duelliſts</hi> in the army, any more than they now do men that refuſe to fight. Such officers as have diſputes with each other, ſhould be compelled to ſubmit them to the deciſion of their equals: this would have far more effect upon a giddy young fellow, than being obliged to fight a duel, where he might flatter himſelf that his ſkill and dexterity would bring him off conqueror. The French, would not be reputed leſs brave, for not having private fights among themſelves. The Gauls, the Greeks, and the Romans at no time cut each others throats for an offenſive word, and yet we cry them up for prodigies of courage—Such eaſy and ſimple methods would infallibly change our manners, and bring about a revolution in morals that would do more honour to the preſent age, than the moſt ſublime diſcoveries.</p>

               <p>The indolent, paſſive character of theſe people, would, it is true, lead one to ſuſpect that they will never arrive to the power and importance that ſo many natural advantages ſeem to promiſe. But then it muſt be conſidered that this national character ariſes from cuſtom, climate and a manner of living which will one day be greatly changed: a regular, retired manner of life, ignorant of the impulſes of ambition, unacquainted with extravagant pleaſure, and not expoſed to great and ſudden changes of fortune, unaccuſtomed to variety, and leſs laboriouſly than agreeably ſpent, cannot have that activity and energy which preſſing neceſſities and unruly paſſions excite and keep up. Food, weak and unſubſtantial; drink without a mixture of ſpirit, rather diſſolving than digeſtive; an air impregnated with humid particles, from the evaporation of the foreſts, muſt neceſſarily flacken and relax the nerves, give a ſlower, but more regular circulation to the blood, and conſequently render the feelings leſs acute, the imagination leſs lively, and leſs animated, the humour more cold and dull, but not ſo inconſtant as with us. Yet, when a more numerous population ſhall have levelled theſe immenſe foreſts, and laid open the ſoil to the genial influence of the ſun, when the air ſhall have become more free and thin, and new plantations, and an extenſive commerce ſhall have made the uſe of ſpirituous liquors more common, when the people ſhall ſettle nearer together and have more intercourſe than at preſent; then the paſſions will awake and be rouſed to action, and the Americans will ſhow at once what they are to be.</p>
               <p>But what a ſpectacle do theſe ſettlements even now already exhibit to our view, conſidering that they are but of little more than a century ſtanding, and have been conſtantly under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul of Engliſh policy, always ſuſpicious and tyrannical, which ſeized the fruits of their induſtry, and rendered itſelf the ſole poſſeſſor of their commerce!</p>
               <p>Spacious and level roads already traverſe the vaſtly extended foreſts of this country; large and coſtly buildings have been raiſed, either for the meeting of the repreſentatives of the States, for an aſylum to the defenders of their country, in diſtreſs, or for the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of inſtructing young citizens in language, arts and ſcience.

Theſe laſt, which are for the moſt part endowed with conſiderable poſſeſſions and revenues, are alſo furniſhed with libraries, and are under the direction of able maſters, invited hither from differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent parts of Europe: ſhip yards are eſtabliſhed in all their ports, and they already rival the beſt artiſts of the old world in point of naval architecture; numerous mines have been opened, and they have now ſeveral founderies for caſting of cannon, which are in no reſpect inferior to our own; and if the height of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitects ſkill has not yet covered their waters with thoſe prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous bridges, which are wont to be extended over the waves, and unite the oppoſite ſhores of large rivers, as with us, ſtill induſtry and perſeverance has ſupplied the want thereof; planks laid upon beams, laſhed together with ſtout rings, and which may be taken apart at the pleaſure of the builder are by their buoyancy as ſolid and uſeful as our firmeſt works, deſigned for the ſame ends. In other places when a river is too deep for fixing the foundation of a bridge on its bottom, a ſtout maſs of timber work is thrown over in a curve line, ſupported only at the extremities, the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſtrength of the ſtructure upholding it in every other part.

Thus an abandonment of the place became abſolutely neceſſary, and in ſuch circumſtances the retreat that was made, under General St. Clair, was certainly in every ſenſe proper and preferable to waiting the event of an aſſault, in which, from the inequality of numbers, the place would in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, have been carried, and not a ſoldier left to oppoſe the progreſs of the enemy ſouthward.

               <p>When the illegal, oppreſſive acts were framed, and ſent over to deſtroy their privileges, with what prudence, reſolution and courage did they not unite to defend them!—and here we ought to pauſe, and fix our attention, to form a proper judgment of the Americans. Men, ſcattered through extenſive countries, different in climate, and claſhing in their intereſts and modes of worſhip, to the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the whole world, formed aſſociations, which coincided as exactly in their deciſions, as if the whole matter had been precon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed. Great-Britain vainly flattered herſelf, that by ſhutting up the port of Boſton, ſhe had effectually intimidated theſe provinces, and raiſed ruinous diſſentions among them; yet, after this arbitrary act, their complaints were but the more urgent, and the common danger did but ſtrengthen their union the more: the maritime towns in the neighbourhood of Boſton, inſtead of being dazzled with the immenſe advantages which were promiſed them, viewed the meaſure with indignation and horror. The town of Salem, to which the privileges of the Boſtonians were now transferred, wrote thus to the Governor of the province:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>We are deeply affected at the public calamities; and the miſeries of our brethren, in the capital of the province give us the greateſt concern; we will continue to hope however that your excellency will do your endeavour to lighten the accumulated miſchiefs that have fallen upon that unhappy people. Some may imagine that the ſhutting up the harbour of Boſton will turn the whole commerce of that place into our channel, and be greatly to our profit; but Nature, when ſhe formed our port, refuſed it equal advantages, and has not afforded us thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies that would enable us to become rivals.

All the reſt of the continent manifeſted the ſame firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and eſtabliſhed every where committees of correſpondence with the general Congreſs.</p>
               <p>And thus this prohibitory bill, that was publiſhed and laviſhly diſſeminated through the country, far from ſpreading a univerſal conſternation, had only, ſays the Engliſh hiſtorian, the effect which the poets attribute to the torches of the Furies, that of burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and conſuming in every place where they happened to paſs.</p>
               <p>New acts, relative to the lodging of the troops in the province of Maſſachuſetts-Bay, completed the general indignation: they now thought of nothing but ſhutting up the ports, making contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions to ſuccour their ſuffering brethren in Boſton, and holding a general Congreſs. In Boſton, the committee of correſpondence paſſed an act, in which they obliged themſelves, in the moſt ſolemn manner, by taking God to witneſs, to abſtain from all commer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial intercourſe with Great-Britain, until the repeal of the prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitory port act, and whatever elſe militated againſt their privileges; not to conſume or purchaſe any articles imported ſince the laſt of Auguſt,— not to trade with thoſe who did import,—to renounce all connexion with ſuch as ſhould refuſe to ſubſcribe to this agreement, and publiſh their names, to be held in everlaſting diſgrace.</p>
               <p>The ſeveral provinces ſtrove who ſhould be foremoſt in entering into this league. In vain did General Gage, Governor of Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts-Bay, declare it, by his proclamation, illegal, deſtructive, contrary to the fealty they owed the king, tending to deſtroy the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal authority of the parliament of England, and injurious to the public peace and ſecurity; in vain did he employ threats, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the judges to ſeize upon thoſe who ſhould ſubſcribe it, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance it, or have any ſhare in publiſhing it.</p>
               <p>Virginia, in addition to her more early determinations, now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, that ſhe would import no more ſlaves from Africa, or the Weſt-Indies; and no Britiſh manufactures, after the firſt of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember, if their grievances were not redreſſed by the 15th of Auguſt, 1775; that after this period, ſhe would not export tobacco or any other merchandize to Great Britain, and that to ſupply her own neceſſities, ſhe would cultivate thoſe productions moſt neceſſary, and raiſe and multiply herds of cattle. Maryland, and the two Carolinas, took the ſame meaſures; and at Newport, this ſentence was every where ſtuck up—<hi>Unite or die.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="unknown:018167_0086_0FA55F0C59F07CD8"/>The people of the town of Marblehead, whoſe harbour was beſt ſituated to profit by the ſhutting up of Boſton, generouſly offered to the Boſtonians their town, their port, and ſupplies of proviſions; propoſed to be preſent at the loading and unloading of their effects, and to tranſact all their buſineſs for them, without expecting a farthing of reward.</p>
               <p>Their charters gave the Americans a right to chooſe their own repreſentatives. But General Gage, in violation thereof, received from the court of London, a liſt of thirty-nine perſons appointed to ſit in council; thirty-four of whom took their ſeats. But the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple immediately declared them enemies to their country, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened to treat them as ſuch, and pronounced them incapable of holding their places.</p>
               <p>The lawyers and juries of the province, at the opening of the courts, refuſed to take the uſual oath, or to have any connexion with them, while the regiſters of the courts aſked pardon of their country, in the public papers, for having iſſued warrants for ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moning the jurors to attend, with promiſes not to commit the ſame fault again; declaring, at the ſame time, that they would never forgive themſelves for it, altho' their countrymen ſhould: Entrance into the courts of juſtice was refuſed the judges; they were ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by the populace, wherever they went, were purſued into their very houſes, and forced at laſt to conceal themſelves, not only from the public, but from each other.</p>
               <p>The old conſtitution being thus annulled by act of parliament, the people at the ſame time rejecting the new one, there was no longer law nor government in the province of Maſſachuſetts-Bay: However, even in this ſtate of anarchy, they committed no acts of exceſs to be reproached with; ſuch an influence had the old laws upon their minds, at the moment they were to be annihilated!</p>
               <p>At length, the general Congreſs opened at Philadelphia, on the fifth of September, 1774, and publiſhed in the moſt open and ſolemn manner, the ſentiments, the views and the reſources of the confederated provinces. The inſtructions given them by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituents, bore a ſtriking likeneſs to their character, and the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent modes of thinking among them; but were perfectly conſonant in the moſt material points, and tended to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
               <p>In their addreſs to General Gage they complain of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive acts of parliament, of his rigorous mode of executing them, of the fortifications raiſed at Boſton, the plundered pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of individuals, the diſorderly conduct of his troops, and the cutting off the intercourſe between the town and country.</p>
               <p>They publiſhed at the ſame time, a declaration of the immutable natural rights of the provinces, the principles of the Engliſh conſtitution, and their different charters. "No one, ſay they, can diſpoſe of our lives, our liberties and our property without our conſent; the colonies have yielded up theſe unalienable rights to no power whatever; our anceſtors, from the time of their emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration, have enjoyed the privileges of Engliſh born ſubjects; by
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:018167_0087_0FA55F0CE9F94CE0"/>
their emigrating to America they, by no means, gave up or loſt theſe rights; and, conſidered as ſuch ſubjects, they cannot but have a ſhare in the legiſlative council, and ſince they are not admitted to, and cannot be repreſented in, the parliament of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, their legiſlative power muſt exiſt in their provincial aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies; they cannot therefore be taxed arbitrarily, or without their own conſent, and if they enjoy equal privileges with the mother country, they have alſo the ſame right to be tried by their peers: beſides, all theſe privileges have been confirmed by royal charters, and recognized by acts of parliament."—They then declare, unanimouſly that "if theſe grievances are not redreſſed, they will import no more commodities from Great Britain;" and afterward enter into ſome diſcuſſions relative to the conduct of the merchants, the encouragement of manufactures, and the conſumption of commodities.</p>
               <p>They likewiſe addreſſed a petition to his majeſty, a memorial to the people of Great Britain, an addreſs to the colonies in general, and another to Canada.</p>
               <p>In the petition to his majeſty, they obſerve, that an army is kept up in the colonies in time of peace, without their conſent, that a naval force was employed to countenance unjuſt impoſitions upon trade; that the authority of commander in chief, and Brigadier General, was become abſolute in every government in America; that the commanding <hi>General</hi> was in time of peace, nominated <hi>Governor</hi> of a colony; and that the number of expenſive, oppreſſive officers was unneceſſarily and prodigiouſly increaſed; that the judges were become wholly dependant upon the crown for their ſalaries, and the duration of their commiſſions, that the agents of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were diſcountenanced, and inſtructions given to prevent the payment of their ſalaries, &amp;c. In ſhort they omitted nothing that could diſplay their attachment and ſubmiſſion to their ſovereign, or their love and veneration for their mother country.—They next tell him, "We have inherited from our anceſtors that paſſionate love of liberty, which placed your illuſtrious family on the throne." They then go on to beſeech him by all that is moſt ſacred, by the intereſts of his kingdom, by his own, by the ſecurity and proſperity of the laws, by the happineſs of his ſubjects, whoſe father he is, not to ſuffer ſuch intimate bonds of affection to be broken aſunder in expectation of certain events, which, altho' they might poſſibly turn out at laſt to his wiſh, would never compenſate for the inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table loſſes that would attend them.</p>
               <p>In the memorial addreſſed to the people of Britain, they bring into view the rights they ought to enjoy as free men, citizens and coloniſts, the ſmall regard they entertain for the preſent Engliſh miniſtry, the attachment they had always ſhown for their mother country, the numerous ſervices they had rendered her the laſt war, and the taxes with which they were burdened upon her account, and which were fooliſhly ſquandered upon court favourites. They prove undeniably that ſucceſs againſt them would be as
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:018167_0088_0FA55F10E5249B20"/>
dangerous to the liberties of Great-Britain as to thoſe of America.
<q>America once ſubjected, ſay they, would herſelf become the inſtrument of ſubjecting you.</q>
               </p>
               <p>They laſtly build their hopes of a re-eſtabliſhment of peace and harmony, friendſhip and brotherly affection among all his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's ſubjects, upon the greatneſs and juſtice of the Britiſh nation, by chooſing a wiſe, independent parliament, animated with a love of the public good, and a deſire to defend their violated rights againſt a wicked and ill deſigning miniſtry.</p>
               <p>In their addreſs to the Canadians, they diſcover the greateſt caution and diſcretion, and make uſe of ſuch arguments as are moſt conformable to the genius and intereſts of that people. They demonſtrate from reaſon, fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>They ſhew them that, forming a ſmall people in compariſon of their numerous and powerful neighbours, it is their intereſt and happineſs to have the united colonies for their ſteady friends, ſince nature had joined their reſpective countries together by an indiſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble connexion, and ſeparated them alike from their tyrannical oppreſſors by extenſive tracts of ocean.
<q>Difference of religion, obſerve they, cannot be an obſtacle to our union; ſuch differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence exiſts in the <hi>Swiſs Cantons,</hi> and yet they are not the leſs united.</q>
—They go on to aſſure them, that it is the wiſh of the colonies to conſider them as allies; and that ſuch an alliance has been unanimouſly aſſented to in their aſſemblies; that a viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>their</hi> rights ſhall be looked upon as an inſult offered to their own, and that they now invited them to accede to a confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy, the object of which was the ſecurity of the natural and civil privileges of the members of the community.</p>
               <p>This invitation of the general Congreſs, and the addreſſes, containing quite a new political ſyſtem, were revered almoſt as much as the Bible among the people, who adhered ſtrictly to the opinions therein contained, in every particular: they flattered themſelves that ſuch petitions and addreſſes as theſe could not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They encouraged the erecting of powder-mills, manufactures of ſalt-petre and ſmall arms were alſo ſet on foot. Some of the provinces went ſo far, as to ſeize upon the ammunition and arms in the public ſtores; and thus it turned out that the acts of parliament, the ſeverity of which

We ſhall get our tobacco at an eaſy barter, and not throw annually an immenſe balance of ready money into the hands of a rival nation, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe it; and our iſlands will always have a demand for the American lumber to contain their rum, molaſſes and other productions.</p>
               <p>It has often been ſaid, that we of France ought to be upon our guard, leaſt at the firſt appearance of peace the national prejudices of the Americans ſhould incline them to renew their old connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with the mother country, forget our ſervices, and break the alliance.—But we have little reaſon to apprehend this, when we conſider that the Engliſh have been too long ſhedding blood in theſe countries, and too long plundering the inhabitants, for them to think of regaining their real friendſhip very eaſily. The Engliſhman, who will long conſider the American in the light of a ſlave eſcaped from the fangs of his nation, will conſequently for ſome time affect an air of ſuperiority, even after a peace; and contempt, which is more difficult to be got over by a generous ſpirit than open hatred, will not eaſily be forgiven by the much injured American.</p>
               <p>The Congreſs, whoſe reſolves have always been dictated by wiſdom and equity, and whoſe deciſions have never been blamed by any, will not, ſurely, tarniſh their honour and glory by a want of fidelity to their firſt ally; they will not erect a monument to infamy, upon which the whole world, and all future ages would read— <hi>France firſt acknowledged the Independence of America, and made the firſt treaty of alliance with her, ſupplied her with ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, aſſiſted her with her treaſures, and defended her with her fleets and armies: America ungratefully violated her oaths, and burſt aſunder the ties of friendſhip, as ſoon as ſhe could do it without danger to herſelf.</hi>

               <p>Altho' ſhe ſhould be capable, during the preſent war, of abſtracting her quarrel from ours, and making a peace before us, ſtill what would be the reſult? her power would no longer be incorporated with that of Great Britain, and ſo our great object would be nevertheleſs accompliſhed. Peace in America would likewiſe ſave us the keeping on foot an expenſive army in this country, the loan of immenſe ſums, and ſupplying them with large quantities of warlike ſtores for their own troops.</p>

Even now, or very lately, the writings and ſermons of their miniſters, were as much calculated to attack and ridicule their rivals, as to edify their hearers; and Philadelphia, the center of tolerancy, has ſeen its ſectaries ſupporting their religious privileges by blows and violence, Different times and circumſtances may render ſuch feuds of the utmoſt ill conſequence.</p>

world, or grown to what it is, had not its <hi>author</hi> expreſſly forbid toleration; and the <hi>chriſtian world</hi> has always diſcountenanced it, except only ſuch ſects as were unſettled, and wavering in their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinal opinions. Philoſophy, whoſe buſineſs it is to unite men, and moderate their paſſions, has certainly inclined them in time paſt to civil toleration, but aſpiring to examine into, and judge of every thing, it at firſt neceſſarily occaſioned ſpeculative, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards political, intolerancy; becauſe the laws cannot be long indifferent in thoſe matters, in which the paſſions of men are parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly intereſted.</p>
               <p>The happieſt government, and which promiſes the moſt laſting proſperity, is that which connects all the members of a ſociety in the ſame faith, and the ſame form of worſhip. True policy ought, then, conſtantly to endeavour to recall mankind to a unity of faith; but a deſire of attracting foreigners, and the ſpeedy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling of a country, has tempted ſeveral ſtates to tranſgreſs this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, by opening an aſylum to all religions without exception. Now, if it can be demonſtrated, that a well circumſtanced nation, where they all profeſs one faith, doubles its number of inhabitants every twenty years, would it not be more honourable to live in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious harmony, with ſuch a degree of population, than to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever quarrelling about creeds and tenets, and torn by religious di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions? This would be ſerving the preſent age and poſterity both at once.</p>
               <p>People, whom edicts of toleration invite into a country, thereby undoubtedly acqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

Louis the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth, by revoking the edict of Nantes, deſtroyed at once in his kingdom, the principle of inteſtine diviſions, and this perhaps (as ſome have ſaid) might have been good policy, but not the moſt juſt; becauſe contracts made with Heretics, are not at all the leſs ſacred for that.</p>
               <p>The ruler of a country ought to conſider himſelf as the father of his ſubjects alſo; out of a principle of tenderneſs, he ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly aim to ſtrengthen the bands which connect his numerous fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; and can there be a more powerful one than a religion which inſpires the ſame ſentiments, preſcribes the ſame duties, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes the ſame rewards? — How many millions live and die ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to each other, merely on account of diverſity of opinion in religious matters! but the man who feels the influence of true vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and catholiciſm, who keeps eternity conſtantly in view, and pants for a more intimate union with the pure ſpirit of the Divinity, perceives his affections expanding, and his heart glowing with rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, when he can entertain rational hopes of enjoying the future friendſhip of his fellow men on the other ſide of the grave, in the regions beyond this tranſitory ſtate of being.</p>
               <p>One of the moſt affecting ſcenes, and which will do the moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the world, will be when all nations ſhall unite in erecting the ſame temples for the ſervice of the Deity, and tuning the

ſame anthems to his praiſe; and philoſophy, which pretends to render mankind happier and better, ought to direct all her views and efforts to this great end: But can ſhe flatter herſelf with paving the way to ſuch a revolution in ſentiment, while ſhe employs her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſolely to overturn and deſtroy all religions whatever?— Before ſhe enterprized ſo boldly, ſhe ſhould have offered the world a ſyſtem of faith built upon better foundations, comprizing a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er number of moral truths; and which would have pointed out more diſtinctly the extent and limits of human reaſon, than that already received; that ſhould have more inclined the human race to the love of virtue and the dread of vice; which would have been better ſuited to all times and all places, to all conditions, and all temper.</p>
               <p>By acting in a different manner, ſhe reſembles a law giver, who diſliking the laws of the nation over which he preſides, ſhould ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Philoſophy ſhould confine her endeavours to the ſtudy and examination of the pretences that every religion makes to be thought the true one, to mark what they have moſt perfect or moſt defective in their uſages and forms, their diſcipline and their doctrines; to keep aloof from thoſe raſh diſputes and controverſies, which render men neither better nor wiſer, and to ſhew the world, that mild perſuaſion and good example, will reclaim mankind much ſooner to the ſide of truth and virtue, than an imperious, inſolent mode of conviction, which can only irritate.</p>
               <p>Perhaps this deſtructive and ambitious philoſophy of our day will be ſucceeded ſome time or another by one of a more moderate and conciliating temper. At this moment new empires are burſting into exiſtence, and mankind will unavoidably begin to perceive the neceſſity of exerciſing their <hi>reaſon</hi> to a better purpoſe than heretofore; more connected by commerce, they will receive and communicate knowledge with greater facility than ever; the genius and talents of one individual man, and the ſpirit of party diviſions will no longer have the ſame influence as formerly; the ſhameful errors of fanatics, and the contracted notions of bigots and devotees will now vaniſh, and though they ſhould revive under a thouſand different forms, this new and rational philoſophy will, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, at laſt recall all the nations of the world to a unity of ſentiment and worſhip: perhaps the hope of ſuch an event may be vain, but the idea is certainly flattering <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </opener>
               <p>I AM unable to deſcribe to your Excellency, the painful anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety under which I have laboured, ſince the reception of the letter you did me the honour to write me of the 23d inſtant. The motions of the naval force under your command, which your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency ſays may poſſibly happen, ſince the information commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to you by the Baron de Clozen, obliged me to point out the conſequences that may follow; and warmly to urge a perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance in the plan agreed upon between us. Permit me, in the firſt place, to repeat to your Excellency, that the attempt upon York, under the protection of your ſhipping, is as certain of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs as a ſuperior force and a ſuperiority of meaſures can render any military operation; that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> duration of the ſiege may be exactly aſcertained; and that the capture of the Britiſh army is a matter ſo important in itſelf, and in its conſequences, that it muſt greatly tend to bring an end to the war, and put our allied arms in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain poſſeſſion of the moſt ineſtimable advantages.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="unknown:018167_0097_0FA5652DB2EDAC88"/>If your Excellency quits the Bay, an acceſs is open to relieve York, of which the enemy will inſtantly avail themſelves. The conſequences of this will be not only the diſgrace of abandoning a deſign on which are founded the faireſt hopes of the allied forces, after a prodigious expence, fatigue and exertions; but the proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſbanding of the whole army; for the preſent ſeat of war be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch, as abſolutely precludes the uſe of waggons, from the great number of large rivers which interſect the country, there will be a total want of proviſions, unleſs this inconvenience is remedied by water carriage. This province has been ſo exhauſted by the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages of the enemy, and by the ſupport already given to our forces, that ſubſiſtence muſt be drawn from a diſtance, and that can be done only by a fleet ſuperior in the Bay.</p>
               <p>I e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rneſtly beg your Excellency would conſider, that if, by moving your fleet from the ſituation agreed on, we loſe the preſent opportunity, we ſhall never hereafter have it in our power to ſtrike ſo deciſive a ſtroke, that the Britiſh will labour without in ermiſſion to fortify a place ſo uſeful to their ſhipping; and that then the period of an honourable peace will be farther diſtant than ever.</p>
               <p>The confidence I have in your Excellency's manly ſpirit and naval talents leaves me no doubt that the conſideration of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences that muſt follow your departure from the Bay will deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine you to uſe all poſſible means for the good of the common cauſe. From the aſſurances of the moſt expert ſailors, I am perſuaded that your Excellency may take ſuch a poſition in the Bay, as to leave nothing to be apprehended from an attempt of the Engliſh fleet; that this poſition will at the ſame time facilitate the operations of the ſiege, ſecure the tranſportation of our proviſions by water, and accelerate our approaches by l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nding our heavy artillery and warlike neceſſaries to York River almoſt cloſe to our trenches.</p>
               <p>The force ſaid to have arrived under Admiral Digby, as the news comes from the Britiſh themſelves, may not only be exagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, but perhaps abſolutely falſe; but ſuppoſing it to be true, their whole force united cannot be ſuch as to give them any hopes of ſucceſs in the attacking your fleet. If the poſition for your ſhips to lie at an anchor, which we agreed upon, has ſince appeared impracticable, there is ſtill another meaſure may be adopted; which, though much inferior as to the ſecurity and facility it will give to our land operations, may ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll be of advantage to our affairs. The meaſure, I mean, is to cruiſe off the Bay, ſo as to keep the Capes always in ſight, and to prevent any Engliſh veſſels getting in.</p>
               <p>Whatever plan you may adopt, I am to preſs your Excellency to perſevere in the ſcheme ſo happily concerted between us; but if you ſhould find inſurmountable obſtacles in the way, let me ultimately beg of you not to relinquiſh the laſt mentioned alternative of preventing all veſſels from the enemy entering the Bay of Cheſapeak.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="unknown:018167_0098_0FA5652E649A3D40"/>"The Britiſh Admiral may manoeuvre his fleet, and endeavour to draw you from the main object we have in view; but I can never believe, that he will ſeriouſly wiſh to bring on a general ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with a fleet, whoſe force, I will anſwer it, is ſuperior to the moſt exaggerated accounts we have of theirs. Paſſed experience has taught them not to hazard themſelves with equal numbers; and has drawn from them, though unwillingly, the moſt reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful opinions of their enemy.</p>
               <p>Permit me to add, that the abſence of your fleet from the Bay, may fruſtrate our deſign upon the garriſon at York. For in the preſent ſituation of matters, Lord Cornwallis might evacuate the place with the loſs of his artillery, baggage, and a few men, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices; which would be highly juſtifiable from the deſire of ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the body of the army.</p>
               <p>The Marquis de la Fayette, who does me the honor to carry this letter to your Excellency, will explain to you better than any other perſon, or than I can do by letter, many particulars of our preſent poſition. Your Excellency is acquainted with his candour and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, which entitles him to your confidence. I have ordered him not to paſs the Cape for fear of accident, in caſe you ſhould be at ſea. If this be ſo, he will incloſe this diſpatch in a letter from himſelf.</p>

               <p>I HAVE the mortification to inform your Excellency, that I have been forced to give up the poſts of York and Glouceſter, and to ſurrender the troops under my command, by Capitulation, on the 19th inſtant, as priſoners of war to the combined forces of America and France.</p>
               <p>I never ſaw this poſt in a very favourable light; but when I found I was to be attacked in it in ſo unprepared a ſtate, by ſo powerful an army and artillery, nothing but the hopes of relief would have induced me to attempt its defence; for I would either have endeavoured to eſcape to New-York, by rapid marches from the Glouceſter ſide, immediately on the arrival of General Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington's troops at Williamſburg, or I would, notwithſtanding the diſparity of numbers, have attacked them in the open field, where it might have been juſt poſſible that fortune would have favoured the gallantry of the handful of troops under my command: but being aſſured by your Excellency's letter, that every poſſible means would be tried by the navy and army to relieve us, I could not
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:018167_0099_0FA5652F258AB3D8"/>
think myſelf at liberty to venture on either of thoſe deſperate attempts: therefore after remaining two days in a ſtrong poſition in front of this place, in hopes of being attacked, upon obſerving that the enemy were taking meaſures which could not fail of turning my left flank in a ſhort time; and receiving, on the ſecond evening, your letter of the 24th of September, informing me, that the relief would ſail about the 5th of October, I withdrew within the works on the night of the 29th of September, hoping, by the labour and firmneſs of the ſoldiers, to protract the defence until you could arrive.</p>
               <p>Every thing was to be expected from the ſpirit of the troops, but every diſadvantage attended their labour, as the works were to be continued under the enemy's fire, and our ſtock of intrenching tools, which did not much exceed 400 when we began to work in the latter end of Auguſt, was now much diminiſhed.</p>
               <p>The enemy broke ground on the night of the 30th and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, on that night and the two following days and nights, two redoubts, which, with ſome works that had belonged to our outward poſition, occupied a gorge between two creeks or ravines, which c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>me from the river on each ſide of the town. On the night of the 6th of October, they made their firſt parallel, extending from its right on the river to a deep ravine on the left, nearly oppoſite to the centre of this place, and embracing our whole left, at the diſtance of ſix hundred yards. Having perfected this parallel, their bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries opened on the evening of the 9th againſt our left; and other batteries fired at the ſame time againſt a redoubt advanced over the creek upon our right and defended by about 120 men of the 23d regiment and marines, who maintained that poſt with uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon gallantry. The fire continued inceſſant from heavy cannon, and from mortars and howitzers throwing ſhells from ſix to ſixteen inches, until all our guns on the left were ſilenced, our works much damaged, and our loſs of men conſiderable. On the night of the 11th they began their ſecond parallel, about three hundred yards nearer to us. The troops being much weakened by ſickneſs, as well as by the fire of the beſiegers, and obſerving that the enemy had not only ſecured their flank, but proceeded in every reſpect with the utmoſt regularity and caution, I could not venture ſo large ſorties as to hope from them any conſiderable effect; but otherwiſe I did every thing in my power to interrupt this work, by opening new embrazures for guns, and keeping up a conſtant fire with all the howitzers and ſmall mortars that we could man. On the evening of the 14th they aſſaulted and carryed two redoubts that had been advanced about three hundr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>g our left flank, and during the night included them in their ſecond parallel, on which they continued to work with the utmoſt exerſion. Being perfectly ſenſible that our works could not ſtand many hours after the opening of the batteries of that parallel, we not only continued a conſtant fire with all our mortars, and every gun that could be

                     <desc>•</desc>

                  </gap>em; ſpiking eleven guns, and killing or wounding about one hundred of the French troops who had the guard of that part of the trenches, and with little loſs on our ſide. This action, though extremely honourable to the officers and ſoldiers who executed it, proved of little public advantage; for the cannon having been ſpiked in a hurry, were ſoon rendered fit for ſervice again, and bef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>re dark the whole parallel and batteries appeared to be nearly complete. At this time we knew that there was no part of the whole front attacked, in which we could ſhew a ſingle gun, and our ſhells were nearly expended. I had therefore only to chooſe between prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſurrender next day, or endeavouring to get off with the greateſt part of the troops; and I determined to attempt the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ter, reflecting, that though it ſhould prove unſucceſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ful in its immediate object, it might at leaſt delay the enemy in the proſecution of further enterpriſes. Sixteen large boats were prepared, and upon other pretexts were ordered to be in readineſs to receive troops preciſely at ten o'clock; with theſe I hoped to paſs the infantry during the night, abandoning our baggage and leaving a detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to capitulate for the town's people and for the ſick and wounded; on which ſubject a letter was ready to be delivered to General Waſhington. After making my arrangements with the utmoſt ſecreſy, the light infantry, the greateſt part of the guards, and part of the 23d regiment, embarked at the hour appointed, and m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſt of them landed at Glouceſter; but at this critical moment, the weather, from being moderate and calm, changed to a moſt violent ſtorm of wind and rain, and drove all the boats ſome of which had troops on board, down the river. It wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſoon evident that the intended paſſage was impracticable, and that the abſence of the boats rendered it equally impoſſible to bring back the troops which had paſſed, which I had ordered about two o'clock in the morning. In this ſituation, with my little force divided, the enemy's batteries opened at day-break. The paſſage between this place and Glouceſter was much expoſed; but the boats having now returned, they were ordered to bring back the troops which had paſſed during the night, and they joined us in the forenoon, without much loſs. Our works in the mean time were going to ruin; and not having been able to ſtrengthen them by abbatis, nor in any other manner than by a ſlight fra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ing, which the enemy's artillery were demoliſhing wherever they fired, my opinion entirely coincided with that of the engineer and principal officers
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:018167_0101_0FA56530A2236528"/>
of the army, that they were in many parts aſſailable in the forenoon, and that by the continuance of the ſame fire for a few hours longer, they would be in ſuch a ſtate as to render it deſperate with our numbers to attempt to maintain them. We at that time could not fire a ſingle gun; only one eight inch mortar and little more than one hundred cohorn ſhells remained: a diverſion of the French ſhips of war that lay at the mouth of the North river was to be expected; our numbers had been diminiſhed by the enemy's fire, but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>

Under all theſe circumſtances, I thought it would be wanton and inhuman to the laſt degree to ſacrifice the lives of this ſmall body of gallant ſoldiers, who had ever behaved with ſo much fidelity and courage, by expoſing them to an aſſault, which, from the numbers and precautions of the enemy, could not fail to ſucceed. I therefore propoſed to capitulate. The treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in general that we have received from the enemy, ſince our ſurrender, has been perfectly good and proper; but the kindneſs and attention that has been ſhown to us by the French officers in particular, their d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>licate ſenſibility of our ſituation, their generous and preſſing offers of money, both public and private, to any amount, has really gone beyond what I can poſſibly deſcribe, and will, I hope make an impreſſion on the breaſt of every Britiſh officer, whenever the fortune of war ſhould put any of them into our power.</p>
               <p>Although the event has been ſo unfortunate, the patience of the ſoldiers in bearing the greateſt fatigues, and their firmneſs and in rapidity under a perſevering fire of ſhot and ſhells that I believe has not often been exceeded, deſerves the higheſt commendation and praiſe.</p>
               <p>A ſucceſsful defence in our ſituation was perhaps impoſſible, for the place could only be reckoned an intrenched camp, ſubject in moſt places to enfilade, and the ground in general ſo diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous, that nothing but the neceſſity of fortifying it as a poſt to protect the navy could have induced any perſon to erect works upon it; our force daily diminiſhed by ſickneſs, and other loſſes, and was reduced, when we offered to capitulate, on this ſide, to little more than 3,200 rank and file fit for duty, including officers, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and artificers; and at Glouceſter about 600, including cavalry. The enemy's army conſiſted of upwards of 8000 French, nearly as many continentals, and 5000 militia. They brought an immenſe train of heavy artillery, moſt amply furniſhed with ammunition, and perfectly well manned.</p>
               <p>Lieutenant-Colonel Abercromby will have the honour to deliver this diſpatch, and is well qualified to explain to your Excellency every particular relating to our paſt and preſent ſituation.</p>

               <p>Theſe are the pillars on which the glorious fabric of our inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency and national character muſt be ſupported: liberty is the baſis; and whoever would dare to ſap the foundation or overturn the ſtructure, under whatever ſpecious pretexts he may a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>On the three firſt articles I will make a few obſervations, leaving the laſt to the good ſenſe and ſerious conſideration of thoſe imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately concerned.</p>
               <p>Under the firſt head, although it may not be neceſſary or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for me in this place to enter into a particular diſquiſition of the principles of the union, and to take up the great queſtion which has been frequently agitated, whether it be expedient and requiſite for the ſtates to delegate a larger proportion of power to Congreſs, or not— yet it will be a part of my duty and that of every true patriot, to aſſert without reſerve, and to inſiſt upon the following poſitions: that unleſs the ſtates will ſuffer Congreſs to exerciſe thoſe prerogatives they are undoubtedly inveſted with by the conſtitution, every thing muſt very rapidly tend to anarchy and confuſion: that it is indiſpenſible to the happineſs of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual ſtates, that there ſhould be lodged ſomewhere, a ſupreme

Many other conſiderations might here be adduced to prove, that without an entire conformity to the ſpirit of the union, we cannot exiſt a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> an independent power—it will be ſufficient for my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to mention but one or two which ſeem to me of the greateſt importance: It is only in our united character as an empire, that our independence is acknowledged, that our power can be regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or our credit ſupported among foreign nations. The treaties of the European powers with the United States of America, will have no validity on a diſſolution of the union —we ſhall be left nearly in a ſtate of nature; or we may find by our own unhappy experience, that there is a natural and neceſſary progreſſion from the extreme of anarchy to the extreme of tyranny, and that arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary power is moſt eaſily eſtabliſhed on the ruins of liberty abuſed to licentiouſneſs.</p>
               <p>As to the ſecond article which reſpects the performance of public juſtice, Congreſs have, in their late addreſs to the United States almoſt exhauſted the ſubject; they have explained their ideas ſo fully, and have enforced the obligations the ſtates are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to render compleat juſtice to all the public creditors, with ſo much dignity and energy, that in my opinion no real friend to the honour and independency of America, can heſitate a ſingle mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment reſpecting the propriety of complying with the juſt and honourable meaſures propoſed: if their arguments do not produce conviction, I know of nothing that will have greater influence; eſpecially when we recollect, that the ſyſtem referred to, being the reſult of the collected wiſdom of the continent, muſt be eſteemed if not perfect, certainly the leaſt objectionable of any that could be deviſed, and that if it ſhall not be carried into immediate execution, a national bankruptcy, with all its deplorable conſequences, will take place before any different plan can poſſibly be propoſed and adopted. So preſſing are the preſent circumſtances! and ſuch is the alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native now offered to the ſtates!</p>

               <p>In this ſtate of abſolute freedom and perfect ſecurity, who will grudge to yield a very little of his property, to ſupport the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon intereſts of ſociety, and enſure the protection of government? Who does not remember the frequent declarations at the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the war, that we ſhould be compleatly ſatisfied, if at the expence of one half we could defend the remainder of our poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions? Where is the man to be found who wiſhes to remain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted for the defence of his own perſon and property, to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions, the bravery, and the blood of others, without making one generous effort to repay the debt of honor and of gratitude? In what part of the continent ſhall we find any man, or body of men, who would not bluſh to ſtand up and propoſe meaſures purpoſely calculated to rob the ſoldier of his ſtipend, and the public creditor of his due? And were it poſſible that ſuch a flagrant inſtance of injuſtice could ever happen, would it not excite the general indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and tend to bring down upon the authors of ſuch meaſures, the aggravated vengeance of Heaven? If after all, a ſpirit of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union or a temper of obſtinacy and perverſeneſs ſhould manifeſt it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in any of the ſtates; if ſuch an ungracious diſpoſition ſhould attempt to fruſtrate all the happy effects that might be expected to flow from the union: if there ſhould be a refuſal to comply with the requiſitions for funds to diſcharge the annual intereſt of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic debts; and if that refuſal ſhould revive again all thoſe jealouſies, and produce all thoſe evils which are now happily removed. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, who have in all their tranſactions ſhewn a great degree of magnanimity and juſtice, will ſtand juſtified in the ſight of God and man: and the ſtate alone which puts itſelf in oppoſition to the aggregate wiſdom of the continent, and follows ſuch miſtaken and pernicious councils, will be reſponſible for all the conſequences.</p>
               <p>For my own part, conſcious of having acted, while a ſervant of the public, in the manner I conceived beſt ſuited to promote the real intereſt of my country: having in conſequence of my fixed belief, in ſome meaſure pledged myſelf to the army, that their country would finally do them compleat and ample juſtice; and
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:018167_0107_0FA5653788716850"/>
not wiſhing to conceal any inſtance of my official conduct from the eyes of the world, I have thought proper to tranſmit to your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency the encloſed collection of papers, relative to the half pay and commutation granted by Congreſs to the officers of the army; from theſe commutations, my decided ſentiments will be clearly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, together with the concluſive reaſons which induced me, at an early period, to recommend the adoption of this meaſure in the moſt earneſt and ſerious manner. As the proceedings of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, the army and myſelf, are open to all, and contain, in my opinion, ſufficient information to remove the prejudices and errors which may have been entertained by any, I think it unneceſſary to ſay any thing more, than juſt to obſerve that the reſolutions of Congreſs now alluded to, are undoubtedly as abſolutely binding up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the United States as the moſt ſolemn acts of confederation or legiſlation. As to the idea, which I am informed has in ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances prevailed, that the half-pay and commutation are to be regarded merely in the odious light of a penſion; it ought to be exploded forever—that proviſion ſhould be viewed, as it really was, a reaſonable compenſation offered by Congreſs, at a time when they had nothing elſe to give, to the officer of the army for ſervices then to be performed—it was the only means to prevent a total dereliction of the ſervice; it was a part of their hire, I may be allowed to ſay, it was the price of their blood and of your inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency; it is therefore more than a common debt; it is a debt of honor; it can never be conſidered as a penſion or gratuity, nor be cancelled until it is fairly diſcharged.</p>
               <p>With regard to a diſtinction between officers and ſoldiers, it is ſufficient that the uniform experience of every nation of the world, combined with our own, proves the utility and propriety of the diſcrimination: rewards in proportion to the aids the public de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives from them, are unqueſtionably due to all its ſervants. In ſome lines, the ſoldiers perhaps have generally had as ample a compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation for their ſervices, by the large bounties which have been paid to them, as their officers will receive in the propoſed commutation: in others, if beſides the donation of lands, the payment of arrear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages of cloathing and wages (in which articles all the component parts of the army muſt be put upon the ſame footing) we take into the eſtimate the bounties many of the ſoldiers have received and the gratuity of one year's full pay, which is promiſed to all, poſſibly their ſituation (every circumſtance being duly conſidered) will not be deemed leſs eligible than that of the officers; ſhould a farther reward, however be judged equitable, I will venture to aſſert, no one will enjoy greater ſatisfaction than myſelf, on ſeeing an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption from taxes for a limited time (which has been petitioned for in ſome inſtances) or any other adequate immunity or compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, granted to the brave defenders of their country's cauſe: but neither the adoption or rejection of this propoſition will in any manner affect, much leſs militate againſt the act of Congreſs, by
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:018167_0108_0FA56539122CC948"/>
which they have offered five years full pay, in lieu of the half-pay for life, which had been before promiſed to the officers of the army.</p>
               <p>Before I conclude the ſubject of public juſtice, I cannot omit to mention the obligations this country is under to that meritorious claſs of veteran non-commiſſioned officers and privates who have been diſcharged for inability, in conſequence of the reſolution of Congreſs of the 23d of April 1782, on annual penſion for life; their peculiar ſufferings, their ſingular merits and claims to that proviſion, need only be known, to intereſt all the feelings of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity in their behalf— nothing but a punctual payment of their annual allowance can reſcue them from the moſt complicated mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery—and nothing could be a more melancholy and diſtreſſing fight, than to behold thoſe who have ſhed their blood or loſt their limbs in the ſervice of their country, without a ſhelter, without a friend, and without the means of obtaining any of the neceſſaries or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of life, compelled to beg their daily bread from door to door! Suffer me to recommend thoſe of this deſcription, belonging to your ſtate, to the warmeſt patronage of your excellency and your legiſlature.</p>
               <p>It is neceſſary to ſay but a few words on the third topic which was propoſed, and which regards particularly the defence of the republic: as there can be little doubt but Congreſs will recommend a proper peace eſtabliſhment for the United-States, in which a due attention will be paid to the importance of placing the militia of the union upon a regular and reſpectable footing—if this ſhould be the caſe, I would beg leave to urge the great advantage of it in the ſtrongeſt terms: The militia of this country muſt be conſidered as the palladium of our ſecurity and the firſt effectual reſort in caſe of hoſtility—it is eſſential, therefore, that the ſame ſyſtem ſhould pervade the whole; that the formation and diſcipline of the militia of the continent ſhould be abſolutely uniform, and that the ſame ſpecies of arms, accoutrements and military apparatus, ſhould be introduced in every part of the United-States: No one who has not learnt it from experience, can conceive the difficulty, expence and confuſion which reſult from a contrary ſyſtem, or the vague arrangements which have hitherto prevailed.</p>
               <p>If in treating of political points, a greater latitude than uſual has been taken in the courſe of this addreſs, the importance of the criſis and the magnitude of the objects in diſcuſſion, muſt be my apology: It is, however, neither my wiſh or expectation that the preceding obſervations ſhould claim any regard, except ſo far as they ſhall appear to be dictated by a good intention, conſonant to the immutable rules of juſtice, calculated to produce a liberal ſyſtem of policy, and founded on whatever experience may have been acquired by a long and cloſe attention to public buſineſs: here I might ſpeak with the more confidence from my actual obſervations, and if it would not ſwell this letter (already too prolix) beyond the bounds I had preſcribed myſelf, I could demonſtrate to every mind open to conviction, that in leſs time, and with much
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:018167_0109_0FA5653ADFAA56A8"/>
leſs expence than has been incurred, the war might have been brought to the ſame happy concluſion, if the reſources of the continent could have been properly brought forth; that the diſtreſſes and diſappointments which have very often occurred, have, in too many inſtance<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, reſulted more from a want of energy in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental government, than a deficiency of means in the particular ſtates; that the inefficacy of meaſures ariſing from the want of an adequate authority in the Supreme Power, from a partial com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the requiſitions of Congreſs in ſome of the ſtates, and from a failure of punctuality in others, while it tended to damp the zeal of thoſe which were more willing to exert themſelves, ſerved alſo to accumulate the expences of the war, and to fruſtrate the beſt concerted plans; and that the diſcouragement occaſioned by the complicated difficulties and embarraſſments, in which our affairs were by this means involved, would have long ago produced the diſſolution of any army, leſs patient, leſs virtuous, and leſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevering than that which I have had the honor to command: But while I mention theſe things, which are notorious facts, as the defects of our foederal conſtitution, particularly in the proſecution of a war, I beg it may be underſtood, that as I have ever taken a pleaſure in gratefully acknowledging the aſſiſtance and ſupport I have derived from every claſs of citizens, ſo ſhall I always be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py to do juſtice to the unparalleled exertions of the individual ſtates on many intereſting occaſions.</p>
               <p>I have thus freely diſcloſed what I wiſhed to make known be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſurrendered up my public truſt to thoſe who committed it to me. The taſk is now accompliſhed. I now bid adieu to your Excellency as the chief magiſtrate of your ſtate; at the ſame time I bid a laſt farewell to the cares of office and all the employments of public life. It remains then to be my final and only requeſt, that your Excellency will communicate theſe ſentiments to your legiſlature at their next meeting, and that they may be conſidered as the legacy of one who has ardently wiſhed, on all occaſions, to be uſeful to his country, and who, even in the ſhade of retirement, will not fail to implore the divine benediction upon it.</p>
               <p>I now make it my earneſt prayer, that God would have you, and the ſtate over which you preſide, in his holy protection; that he would incline the hearts of the citizens to cultivate a ſpirit of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination and obedience to government; to entertain a brotherly affection and love for one another, for their fellow citizens of the United States at large, and particularly for their brethren who have ſerved in the field; and finally, that he would moſt graciouſly be pleaſed to diſpoſe us all, to do juſtice, to love mercy, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mean ourſelves with that charity, humility, and pacific temper of mind, which were the characteriſtics of the divine author of our bleſſed religion, and without an humble imitation of whoſe exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in theſe things, we can never hope to be a happy nation.</p>

                  </gap>Britain coming ſo unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly to a treaty of pacification, the failure of the harveſt, which threatened a famine, is particularly urged, as perhaps nothing but the ſupply of grain which the peace may enable us to draw from America could effectually prevent that awful event. Peace would have been worthily obtained by the ceſſion of Gibraltar; it would have been ſaving an immenſe expence, and that too for an object now become inſignificant—our Mediterranean trade. Yet the miniſtry are entitled to commendation for wiſely yielding to the voice of the people in retaining it, whether that voice was judicious or not. Weakened, humbled, and on the brink of ruin, ſafety, not glory, was the principal object by which our ſtateſmen were to be directed. The treaty with America is juſt and liberal. The Americans had it in contemplation to compoſe a book of all their ſufferings, and to make it a ſchool book for their children, and ſuch an inſtitution would have continued an evil ſpirit for ages; but ſince the acknowledgement of Independency, and the peace, the deſign has been laid aſide. Granting them Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency was nothing more than what in fact they had already obtained.</p>
               <p>As to the limits, they are the only ones that could have been choſen without giving afterward occaſion to much diſorder and contention. The Canada furr trade will be in part affected, but that object was not ſo great as to merit a continuance of the war, and as to retaining the ſorts ſouth of the Britiſh boundaries, ſuch a treaty would have proved not ſo much a termination of the old, as the beginning of a new war.</p>

               <p>Concerning the Canada boundaries, government had two views; one political, a permanent peace; to obtain which, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to prevent every ground of future jealouſy; the other view was commercial; monopolies begin to be exploded, and to have contended about a few furrs, would have been incompatible with a deſign of ſuch a magnitude and importance, as an enlarged plan of commerce.—And with regard to the fiſhery, if a ſhare had not been granted the Americans, they would have ſtolen in upon us, in ſpite of all our endeavours, and we ſhould have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in endleſs altercations with them.</p>
