            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>IN one of thoſe villages, immediately under the ridge of chalky hills, called the South Downs, where the ſoil changing ſuddenly to a ſtrong clay, renders the country deep, and the roads bad; there dwelt, a few years ſince, the rector of a neighbouring pariſh, of the name of Leſſington.

                  </gap> that which belonged to his own living, three miles diſtant. His family conſiſted of a wife, two ſons, and four daughters.</p>
               <p>One of the ſons had a fellowſhip at Oxford. The other was a younger partner in a reſpectable tradeſman's houſe in London.</p>
               <p>The daughters were reckoned handſome. The two eldeſt had been, for ſome years, the toaſts at the convivial meetings in the next market towns. The third was now a candidate for an equal ſhare
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:029524_0004_0FE1D3365509AE60"/>
of ruſtic admiration, and her claims were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally allowed. But the youngeſt, who was about eighteen, when this narrative commences, though ſhe was ſtill conſidered as a child by her ſiſters, and treated as ſuch by her mother; was thought by ſome of the few perſons who happened to ſee her, to be much the handſomeſt of the four, though her beauty was of a very different cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter from that of her ſiſters.</p>
               <p>Perhaps in theſe days of refinement the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination might be in ſome degree aſſiſted, by the romantic ſingularity of her name. She was called Roſalie at the requeſt of a lady of the Catholic religion, the wife of a man of very large fortune, who ſometimes inhabited an old family ſeat, about three miles farther from the hills. Mrs. Leſſington had been for ſome years her moſt intimate friend, and accepted with pleaſure her offer of anſwering for, and giving her name, to the youngeſt of her girls. Mrs. Vyvian, the daughter of an illuſtrious Catholic family, being born at Naples, had received the name of the female ſaint ſo highly venerated in the two Sicilies; and before her marriage, had lived a good deal alone with an infirm father at Holm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood Houſe, which, having deſcended to her mother from noble anceſtors, became hers, and was part of the great fortune ſhe brought to Mr. Vyvian.</p>
               <p>During the ſolitary years when ſhe attended the couch of a parent, the victim of complicated diſeaſes, the ſociety of Mrs. Leſſington had been her greateſt conſolation. It continued ſo till her
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:029524_0005_0FE1D33888EFEEF0"/>
marriage—a marriage which ſhe was compelled to conſent to, by her father's peremptory com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. Mrs. Vyvian afterwards paſſed ſome years on the continent with her huſband; and returned to England mother of three children, a ſon and two daughters. And whenever this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily inhabited the old manſion-houſe of Holm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, Roſalie paſſed all her time with them. When young Vyvian was about thirteen, his ſiſters twelve and eleven, the young ladies were ſo much attached to their companion, that Mrs. Vyvian, to indulge them, took her with them to London, and afterwards to their eſtate in the North. Young Vyvian, the only ſon of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, being ſent abroad, Roſalie remained with his mother and ſiſters above two years, making only ſhort viſits at home. At the end of that period, Mr. Vyvian thought proper to have his daughters introduced into the world, and in a ſtile of life to which Roſalie could have no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions. She therefore returned to the parſonage; and though ſhe could not but be ſenſible of the great change in her ſituation, her good ſenſe, and the peculiar mildneſs of her diſpoſition, ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled her, if not to conquer her regret, at leaſt ſo far to conceal it, that, though generally pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, ſhe was neither ſullen nor melancholy; and entered with placid reſignation into a way of life, ſo different from that to which ſhe had (ſhe now thought unfortunately) been accuſtomed.—Her mother, who probably remembered that ſhe had been ſenſible of ſomething like the ſame uneaſy ſenſation when ſhe bade adieu to the ſociety of
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:029524_0006_0FE1D33D30F32C78"/>
her friend, then Miſs Montalbert, to marry Mr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Leſſington, ſeemed to pity, though ſhe forbore to notice, the dejection which was occaſionally viſible in her youngeſt daughter, in deſpite of her endeavours to hide it. As to her father, he treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her as he did the reſt, with general kindneſs, but no marked affection. Her ſiſters were not unkind to her, ſo long as ſhe affected no ſuperiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but ſeemed better pleaſed to be conſidered as too young to be admitted of their parties, than to make one, where ſhe knew ſhe ſhould find no enjoyment: And they were, on their parts, content to leave out, as long as they could, a perſon who would be at leaſt a formidable competitor for the prize of beauty. The eldeſt was courted by a gentleman-farmer of conſiderable property in the county, the ſecond by an attorney in a neighbouring town: And as theſe lovers were accepted, parties of pleaſure were continually ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> for the Miſs Leſſingtons—ſometimes to the ſea coaſt, or the races or cricket matches, Mr. Leſſington attended his daughters on theſe expeditions, till the eldeſt was married. The care of Miſs Catharine and Miſs Maria, was then left to her; and the Vicar of Mayfield returned to the duties of his pariſhes, and his farm.</p>
               <p>On theſe occaſions, Mrs. Leſſington and her youngeſt daughter being left alone, their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation ſometimes turned on the family of Vyvian. It was a ſubject of which Roſalie was never weary, though it was not always that her mother would indulge her with talking upon it. Roſalie was ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly and gratefully attached to Mrs. Vyvian, even
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:029524_0007_0FE1D33FD11E6E58"/>
more than to her young friends; and frequently mentioned to her mother, how much ſhe had been hurt at remarking, during the latter part of her ſtay in the family, that this amiable and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent woman was extremely unhappy. One day when they were ſitting at work together, this converſation was renewed—"You hear nothing, Madam," ſaid Roſalie to her mother, "of our neighbours at Holmwood Park, being to come down ſoon."—"Nothing," replied her mother coldly; "I ſuppoſe, from what Mr. Allingham ſaid," (Mr. Allingham was the Catholic prieſt of the neighbouring town), "that we ſhall not ſee them here this year."—Roſalie ſighed.—"He told me" added Mrs. Leſſington, "that Mrs. Vyvian was ſo much indiſpoſed when he ſaw her in town, that the phyſicians talked of order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her to Cheltenham. It is more than two months ſince I have had a letter from her."— Roſalie ſighed again.—"It is her mind" ſaid ſhe, "that preys upon her frame; and will I am afraid, deſtroy her."</p>
               <p>"I hope not," replied Mrs. Leſſington, "for I think her ſpirits have been always much the ſame ſince I knew her. Perhaps they are not mended by Mr. Vyvian's having renounced his religion, and by having her children brought up Proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, contrary to his promiſe, when he himſelf changed. Beſides, you know he is a harſh and haſty man, poſitive, violent, and ill-natured enough to make a woman, like Mrs. Vyvian, unhappy, if there is no <hi>other</hi> cauſe."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="unknown:029524_0008_0FE1D3416D255B98"/>"Ah! that <hi>other,</hi>" ſaid Roſalie: "I have heard a great deal about it."</p>
               <p>"About what?" cried Mrs. Leſſington in a tone of ſurpriſe.</p>
               <p>"About the—the—the lover," replied Roſalie, bluſhing "that Mrs. Vyvian was ſo much at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to before ſhe was married to Mr. Vyvian."</p>
               <p>"I don't know," ſaid her mother, colouring as if by ſympathy, "who could tell you, child, of any ſuch fooliſh ſtory."</p>
               <p>"Nay, dear Madam, but was it not ſo?"</p>
               <p>"Was it not, how? <hi>I</hi> really know nothing about it; and yet I believe nobody ſaw ſo much of my friend Mrs. Vyvian, as I did at that time; for though it was long after I married, I uſed to be almoſt as much with her as when we were both ſingle."</p>
               <p>"The gentleman is ſtill living, Madam," ſaid Roſalie.</p>
               <p>"I again aſſure you, Roſe," replied her mother, peeviſhly, "that I know nothing of—of <hi>any</hi> gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman. But I think I heard your father come into his ſtudy—Do, child, aſk him for the key of the cloſet above."</p>
               <p>Roſalie obeyed. But ſhe well knew her father was not in his ſtudy, and ſaw that her mother only ſent her to ſeek him, that ſhe might eſcape from converſation, which, for ſome reaſon or other, ſhe was ſtrangely unwilling to continue. This was not the firſt time Roſalie had remarked, that her mother ſolicitouſly avoided recounting any circumſtance that uſed to happen in her gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh days, at thoſe periods when ſhe was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:029524_0009_0FE1D3439DA0BF50"/>
with the family of Montalbert: and if ever ſhe unconſciouſly began to ſpeak of Miſs Montalbert, now Mrs. Vyvian, ſhe either ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped as ſoon as ſhe recollected herſelf, and chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the converſation, or ſpoke in a manner par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly guarded, and only of trifling occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>"What can be my mother's reaſon?" ſaid Roſalie, muſing to herſelf as ſhe went to walk in their little garden. "There is ſome myſtery certainly. Surely the marriage with the man Mrs. Vyvian was ſo attached to, could not have been broken off on <hi>her</hi> account?—Impoſſible! for though my mother, I believe, has been a very handſome woman, ſhe certainly never could be compared to her friend; who even now, in ill health, and half heart-broken, as ſhe is, is much more beautiful than either of her daughters."</p>
               <p>Roſalie ſighing when ſhe thought of Mrs. Vyvian's illneſs, and regretting that ſhe did not this year come into the country, felt all the cold and blank regret, which departed pleaſure leaves. She wiſhed now, that ſhe had paſſed leſs time in the Vyvian family, where ſhe had been accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to the converſation of Mrs. Vyvian, of which ſhe was particularly fond; and to a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of life, very different from that which ſhe was now in—ſtill more different, from what it was probable ſhe would be expected to enter into, when her two elder ſiſters were both married: her father having lately ſaid, half laughingly, and as if he ſuppoſed it would pleaſe her, that ſhe ſhould then go out with Maria; appear at
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:029524_0010_0FE1D3484FCA05D0"/>
aſſemblies, and try to get an huſband too; for he wanted to get his girls off his hands as faſt as he could.</p>
               <p>Roſalie felt, that ſhe had an invincible averſion to this plan of dreſſing and going out in hopes of getting as her father termed it, an huſband. She was convinced, that to be addreſſed by ſuch men as the huſband of her eldeſt ſiſter, or the man to whom the ſecond was ſoon to be married, would render her completely miſerable; for it ſeemed but too probable, that her father would not allow her a negative.</p>
               <p>Youth, however, dwells not long on remote poſſibilities. But though no acute uneaſineſs aſſailed her, the languor and dejection of Roſalie increaſed as the Autumn came on. Solitude was infinitely preferable to the ſociety, ſuch as was at preſent within her reach: But ſecluſion ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect as that ſhe was now condemned to, depreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her ſpirits. In every other period of her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at home, at this ſeaſon of the year, her elder brother had been there alſo, who, being very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to her, delighted to inſtruct her. But now this dear brother was gone <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nto the North with one of his college friends, and was to be at home only for a few days before his return to Oxford. She thought every body was gone to the North; for the Vyvian family were perhaps there by this time, if Mrs. Vyvian's health had allowed her to leave Cheltenham; and never had ſhe felt ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected and forlorn. The hill which aroſe imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately behind the vicarage houſe, afforded a view even half way up, of a great extent of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:029524_0011_0FE1D34ABB6FB6A8"/>
and Holmwood Park, the old family ſeat of Mr. Vyvian, though at near three miles diſtance, ſeemed to be within five minutes walk. Roſalie had now a melancholy pleaſure, in viewing it from the high grounds, as the ſetting ſun blazed on the weſtern windows, while the characters of the inhabitants were forcibly recalled to her mind.</p>
               <p>Mr. Vyvian, a man of very extenſive poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and the head of an ancient Catholic family, had been rather received as an huſband by Miſs Montalbert, becauſe her father commanded her to receive him, than for any other reaſon; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

From that time, the tutors that had been entruſted with the edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his ſon, were removed. His daughters, contrary to the promiſe he had at firſt made to his wife, were no longer ſuffered to go to maſs, or to be inſtructed by the old prieſt, who had for a great number of years reſided in their mother's houſe.

His temper reſembled that of thoſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable beings one ſometimes ſees among the common people, who not unfrequently beat their children till they make them cry; and then beat them for crying. Juſt ſo he contrived to do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly what he knew would make his wife com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely miſerable; and then quarrelled with her becauſe ſhe could not (though ſhe endeavoured to do ſo moſt ſincerely), always conceal her wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs. Till lately, ſhe had found the eſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of her daughters, who too much reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled their father, compenſated in a great meaſure by the attentive gratitude of Roſalie, who uſed to paſs much of her time at Holmwood, while Mrs. Vyvian was there alone, and her family remained in London. But lately ſhe appeared to have loſt all pleaſure, even in viſiting this favorite ſeat; and though when ſhe did write to Mrs. Leſſington, or to Roſalie, her letters expreſſed all her former regard, yet theſe letters became every day more rare. At length ſhe hardly ever wrote to Roſalie. An air of languor and diſquiet pervaded thoſe parts of the letters addreſſed to her mother, that Roſalie ſometimes ſaw; for it now and then happened, that Mrs. Leſſington received letters which her daughter knew to be from Mrs. Vyvian, the contents of which ſhe never diſcloſed, and did not ſeem pleaſed to be queſtioned upon them.—Theſe Roſalie concluded <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

old and faithful friend; though ſhe herſelf had never heard one repining ſentence.</p>
               <p>The venerable prieſt, now the only inhabitant, except ſervants, of the ſolitary manſion of Holm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, had been accuſtomed to walk over now and then to Barlton-Brook, (the name of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh where the Leſſington family reſided); and Roſalie, who honoured his character, and knew how highly Mrs. Vyvian eſteemed him, was never happier than when ſhe was allowed to make his tea for him, or to walk with him part of the way home. During the preſent ſummer, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, theſe viſits had become leſs frequent, and at length entirely ceaſed; a terrible deprivation to Roſalie, though none of the reſt of the family ſeemed conſcious that it had happened. Roſalie at length remarked it to her mother, who an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered drily, that Mr. Hayward was probably ill. "May I not walk over ſome day to Holmwood Mamma, and ſee how he does?"</p>
               <p>"I do not know when I can ſpare you, my dear," was the reply, and the converſation drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped.</p>
               <p>Another, and another week paſſed; and Mr. Hayward did not appear. Roſalie then enquired news of him, of one of thoſe itinerant fiſhmon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers who travel round the country, and who conſtantly carried his wares to Holmwood. The man aſſured her, that he had that day ſeen Mr. Hayward in good health. Roſalie ſoon after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards diſcovered, but with extreme vexation, that her old friend forbore to viſit her, becauſe it had been hinted to him, that the ſuſpicion of
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:029524_0014_0FE1D3538B7430A0"/>
his influencing her on religious ſubjects was likely to be very injurious to her future proſpects in the world: Mr. Grierſon, who had married her elder ſiſter, and Mr. Blagham, the intended huſband of the ſecond, having declared their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of her becoming a Papiſt; in which opinion two young men, who had very much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired her, alſo agreed. The ſiſters of one of them proteſting that <hi>she was sure Miss Rose Lessington was disposed to that religion, which made her give into such mopish ways, and always affect soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, like nuns, and such sort of people.</hi> Thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the innocent pleaſure of converſing with a man, whom, from her infancy, ſhe had conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed almoſt as a ſecond father—a cypher at home— and rather ſuffered as one of the family, than ſeeming to make a part of it, neceſſary to the happineſs of the reſt, Roſalie had no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource than in her own mind againſt the unvary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing medium of life. Her mother though not more ignorant than the generality of women in middling life, had received no better education than a country boarding ſchool afforded, which, five and thirty years ago, were much leſs cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated for the <hi>accomplishments</hi> they communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, than they are at preſent. Since that period, ſhe had ſtudied the <hi>utile</hi> rather than the <hi>dulce.</hi> Having, before her marriage, lived very much in the family of Montalbert, though by no means in the ſtyle of an humble companion (for ſhe had a ſmall independent fortune), ſhe had accuſtomed herſelf to undertake many little domeſtic duties for the friend ſhe loved; and after her marriage,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:029524_0015_0FE1D356007EE848"/>
ſhe had a family which kept her conſtantly occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied; ſo that, never having her curioſity raiſed in regard to books, and never having been accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to read, ſhe had now no reliſh even for books of amuſement; and wondered at the eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhe ſometimes heard her acquaintance ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs for them. It may eaſily be believed, that thus diſpoſed, ſhe had no collection of books likely to amuſe her daughter; who had long ſince exhauſted all the information or entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment afforded, by an odd volume of the Tatler— Robinſon Cruſoe—Nelſon's Feaſts and Faſts— Hervey's Meditations—a volume of Echard's Gazetteer—Mrs. Glaſs's Cookery—and every Lady her own Houſe-keeper.</p>
               <p>The library of Mr. Leſſington, though more extenſive and occupying a room dignified with the name of a ſtudy, was not better adapted to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile the ſolitary hours of a very young woman. It conſiſted ſolely of ſermons—Polemics—ſuch publications as related to Queſtions on infant Baptiſm, and Elaborate Defences of the Thirty-nine Articles—Clarendon's Hiſtory—Rapin, and bad Tranſlations of Mezerai and Froiſſart—an old Hiſtory of Rome, in black letters—Joſephus —Thomas a Kempis—Elucidations of difficult Parts of Scripture—and Treatiſes on the Nature of the Soul. Among all theſe it was the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory only that could attract Roſalie; and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this ſolitary ſummer, ſhe became a tolerable hiſtorian: though ſhe did not find it either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to enlarge her philanthropy, or furniſh her with rules for the conduct of her life; ſince
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:029524_0016_0FE1D3579DD69878"/>
ſhe flattered herſelf, that beings ſo diſhoneſt and deſpicable as modern hiſtory repreſents, are found only in thoſe elevated regions of human exiſtence where it was never likely to be her lot to move.</p>
               <p>During her frequent viſits to the family of Vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian, where that language was generally ſpoken, Roſalie had learnt to ſpeak French fluently; could read well, and ſpeak a little Italian, which Mr. Hayward had taken great pleaſure in teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her. Theſe little acquirements were, ſhe knew not for what reaſon, more the object of her ſiſters' envy than any other of the advantages her being with the Miſs Vyvians might have given her over them. She ſaw with ſurpriſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, that though her ſiſters were as little, as ſhe now was herſelf, in company where to ſpeak foreign languages, could be of the ſlighteſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, yet that <hi>her</hi> being qualified to do ſo, vexed and humbled them. She therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed what indeed there was now little merit, and leſs difficulty in concealing; and having no books to read in either language, and no longer an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> opportunity of converſing with Mr. Hayward, ſhe felt, with infinite concern, that this ſource of amuſement and of knowledge would very ſoon be loſt to her.</p>
               <p>The only pleaſure ſhe now found was in draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; in which, though no great proficient, ſhe was far enough advanced to find herſelf improve very materially, by following, and continually practiſing the few rules ſhe had learned. To ſeat herſelf on the turf of the down above the houſe, on the root of a thorn, or one of thoſe

beech trees which were ſcattered about the foot of the hill, and make ſketches of detached pieces of the extenſive landſcape ſtretched before her; or of the old and fantaſtic trees that formed her ſhady canopy, was now become her only enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And very ſincerely did ſhe regret, and very reluctantly did ſhe obey, the ſummons, ſhe too frequently received to return to the houſe, either to make tea for ſome accidental viſitors of her new brother-in-law's acquaintance, or to ſuperintend a ſyllabub in the ſummer houſe.— Theſe parties calling at the parſonage, now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came frequent; for this new member of the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lived in the vale, a few miles from Barlton Brook; and the houſe of his father-in-law lay directly in the horſe way to what is called in tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

On the coaſt, within a few years, many bathing pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces have been eſtabliſhed, where the ſick and the idle paſs the ſummer or autumnal months. The variety of people thus collected make a viſit to the ſea-coaſt, a pleaſurable jaunt to the inhabitants of the neighbouring country; and Mr. Grierſon, a man perfectly at eaſe in his circumſtances, and lately married to one of the moſt celebrated beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the county, failed not to amuſe his bride and her friends with many of theſe tours. His fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture brother-in-law, Blagham the attorney, who lived at Chicheſter, was a great promoter of what he called "a little ſociability." He gratified at once two paſſions; the love of what he called pleaſure, and the proſpect of future advantage,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:029524_0018_0FE1D35FA73166C8"/>
to which he always looked forward with peculiar earneſtneſs. While he was buſtling about with Grierſon and his wife, together with his "own intended," as he choſe to call her, he was diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſkill in ordering dinners, in hiring boats for water-parties, in conſoling "<hi>the ladies,</hi>" when they were ſick, and, "<hi>cutting jokes upon them when they got better</hi>"—in making ſure bets at Broad <note n="*" place="bottom">A down in Hampſhire, on the borders of Suſſex, the reſort of both counties for cricket matches.</note> Halfpenny, for "Egad, Sir, he always knew what he was about"—and in hedging well at poney races. And while this went on, "Egad, Sir, he never loſt ſight of the main chance—not he. Egad, Sir, he had all his eyes about him."</p>
               <p>And it was true, that while thus entered into what he called "the enjoyments of life, <hi>and a little sociability,</hi>" he made acquaintance among the yeomanry, or the few of that rank of men who are ſtill <hi>called</hi> ſo: among men, however, who had made money to put out at intereſt, and who employed him to find for them good ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and to tranſact other matters for them. So that though a young man in the honourable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of an attorney, and newly eſtabliſhed in the already well-ſtocked city of Chicheſter, he was conſidered as very likely to make his fortune; and Mr. Leſſington had, in the contemplation of ſuch a proſpect, granted him the hand of the fair Catharine, his ſecond daughter; rich indeed only in herſelf—in very handſome wedding clothes, which were now preparing for her—and in her connections and acquaintance among the gentlemen's families of the county.</p>

               <p>IT was on a beautiful afternoon towards the end of Auguſt, when Roſalie, retired to her uſual ſeat on the hill, was again engaged in her now favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite occupation. The rays of the ſun declining early in the afternoon, gilt the landſcape with tints more than uſually luxuriant.

                  </gap>ly, yet not to be repelled. Her pencils and drawing cards were laid down on the turf, while, with folded arms, and her head reclined againſt the tree ſhe was ſitting under, ſhe fell into a reverie. A long row of old pines, ſtretched their groteſque heads from the eaſtern ſide of the houſe towards a riſing ground, where this wild and irregular avenue was terminated by an octagon temple, now falling faſt to ruin; where Roſalie remembered to have paſſed many hours, when ſhe was a child, the happy thoughtleſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of the little Vyvians, who uſed to call this old ſummer-houſe their houſe, and to carry thither their play things, and make their ſportive arrangements, while their governeſs a little old

Frenchwoman, was accuſtomed to ſit on the ſteps knitting or netting. The ſteps Roſalie could diſtinguiſh from her ſolitary ſeat on the hill: But the playful groupe, and their old little guardian, were gone. Roſalie recollected how happy ſhe had been there: And already ſhe had acquired that painful experience that had made her fear ſhe ſhould taſte of unalloyed happineſs no more. Her friend and protectreſs, Mrs. Vyvian, who now ſeemed to have deſerted, from ſome unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable change of taſte, the habitation ſhe was once ſo fond of, appeared before her in imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more pale and dejected than uſual. She fancied ſhe ſaw her ſlowly coming out of the little conſervatory, which ſhe had cauſed to be built, and in which ſhe took peculiar pleaſure. She had a noſegay in her hand for each of her girls— Roſalie was once received under that appellation —and ſhe beckoned to them as ſhe ſaw them walking in the ſhrubbery, and, with one of her penſive ſmiles, gave to every one her little preſent. The Abbé Hayward, that excellent and venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man, met her. Benignity and pious reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation were in his countenance, as he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to find ſome converſation that might cheer the depreſſed ſpirits of Mrs. Vyvian. She bade her daughters and Roſalie walk before them; and, making a ſhort tour in the plantations, ſeemed to remove her languor, and enable her to meet her family at ſupper with ſome appearance of cheerfulneſs.</p>
               <p>Such were the ſcenes Roſalie was recalling to her mind, and ſuch the figures with which me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:029524_0021_0FE1D364D92149E0"/>
was buſy in peopling them, when her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations were diſturbed by figures very differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, who preſented themſelves under all the diſadvantages of contraſt. . . . Blagham, and two other young men, whom ſhe did not recollect ever to have ſeen before, came whooping and hallooing from the houſe, and aſcended the hill towards her. As it ſoon became very ſteep, Blagham leaped from his horſe, and ran towards her; and the other two followed him.</p>
               <p>"Why, my ſweet Roſe," cried he, "my Roſe of the world! why do you cruelly hide yourſelf among thorns? Only to be looked after —eh! my pretty Roſe,—Aye, 'tis the way of you all:—there's my Kate below yonder, would fain ſerve me the ſame ſauce—but I'm come to drink tea with you, my dear little ſiſter, that is to be, and to introduce two of my friends to you." The friends by this time were come to the ſpot. "This, Madam, is Captain Mildred of the 98th, now quartered in our town; and this," <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ded he, with all ſolemnity, "this is the Rev. Philibert Hughſon, a worthy clergyman, and Rector of Higginſton cum Sillingbourn in this county." Roſalie had nothing to do but to cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſy to them both. Her future brother-in-law, however, had not yet done with her; but, ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping back, he made a ridiculous bow, and in a theatrical tone, exclaimed, "And, now, gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, give me the ſuperlative pleaſure of introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>your</hi> admiration Miſs Roſalie Leſſington, fourth and youngeſt daughter of the Rev. Joſeph Leſſington, Maſter of Arts, Vicar of Cold Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and Curate of Barlton Brooks in this county:
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:029524_0022_0FE1D36C4E57E3E8"/>
A young lady, of whoſe perſonal perfections, gentlemen, I dare not ſpeak; but who is, I may venture to ſay, endowed with every qualification to render the marriage ſtate completely happy." —Shocked and amazed at this impertinent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, Roſalie felt her cheeks glow with anger and indignation; but recovering herſelf, ſhe aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed coldly, if her mother had ſent for her?</p>
               <p>"She has—ſhe has"—cried her perſecutor, who, ſhe now perceived, had added to his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral impertinence all that which liquor gives when it overflows a ſhallow brain,—"She has, fair flower of the deſart, and we are the beatified ambaſſadors charged with the delectable commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Come then, bright nymph!"—</p>
               <p>He was proceeding in this ſtyle, when Roſalie, taking from him the hand he would forcibly have held, ſaid, "I wiſh my mother had ſent ſome perſon who was more in poſſeſſion of his reaſon."—"Ah! Madam," cried the young man, who was announced as the Rev. Philibert Hughſon, "there are moments when reaſon is loſt in wonder and delight, and when"— "What, Sir?" interrupted Roſalie, in a tone ſo unexpected, that the young divine was unable to proceed, and even bluſhed as he attempted to finiſh a ſpeech, which he probably thought was in the ſtyle of the ſociety he was with.</p>
               <p>As they walked down the hill towards the houſe, ſhe turned to Captain Mildred, who, as he had hitherto been ſilent, had not offended her; and whom, being an officer, ſhe hoped was a gentleman, and entered with him into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:029524_0023_0FE1D36DE90BD7D0"/>
converſation, while Blagham, too drunk to make much ſpeed, ſtaggered after them, and Mr. Hughſon went ſidling down a little before her. As if ſtill ſolicitous to attract her notice, yet half afraid of another rebuff, he was trying to recal his conſciouſneſs of ſelf importance.— The Rev. Philibert Hughſon was what is called a dapper, tight-made, little man. His face nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther well nor ill, but with ſomething in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of it that ſoon let an obſerver of faces in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his character. If the Rev. Philibert Hughſon had even ventured to think, in the ſame unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained manner in which he ſometimes ſpoke, it is very certain he thought himſelf a d—d clever fellow. The ſecond ſon of a very rich father, he had been a buck of the firſt rate at Cambridge, ſpent four times as much as he was allowed, and contrived to get ſome thouſands in debt. He was an excellent judge of horſe-fleſh, and a great connoiſſeur in carriages. He knew the dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and properties of every vehicle from a phaeton to a ſulky; had poſſeſſed them all by turns, and had changed them oftener than his clothes, or his friends. He had made a merit of taking orders, when he knew his careful father had bought the valuable livings of Higginſton cum Sillingbourn, worth together above eight hundred a year. Nor did he determine to make this ſacrifice, and, from the ſmarteſt fellow at Cambridge, ſink into a country parſon, till he had ſtipulated for the payment of his debts, and a handſome ſum in ready money. He then cut off his hair, turned his green coat into a grey one,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:029524_0024_0FE1D36F88DCF778"/>
and reſolved to be very orthodox and very good. His father moſt devoutly hoping he would keep his word, complied with all his conditions, and was delighted when he had ſworn that he felt an irreſiſtible call from heaven, and was inducted to the living of Higginſton cum Sillingbourn. The moſt pleaſant circumſtance attending his new ſituation, was, that this cure of ſouls was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in the beſt country poſſible for killing phea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants, and not half a mile from him partridges were equally plenty. A pack of the beſt fox hounds in England were within five miles; and he had greyhounds of his own, of the true Orford breed. To take advantage of all theſe pleaſures, he had begun by ſitting up and enlarging the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, filling them with high-prized hunters, and ſending to Newmarket for boys to attend them. He ſtored his cellars—furniſhed his houſe for his brother ſportſmen who had promiſed to viſit him —bought a new phaeton; changed it for a curri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle; then imagined a new whiſky of his own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, calculated for the Suffex roads. And, in ſhort, during the eight months that he had been in poſſeſſion of the living, had felt ſo many irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible impulſes, beſides that which had given ſo valuable a member to the church, that he had already received from the friendſhip of his dear friend Blagham a trifling accommodation of the 'needful'; for to apply to the old gentleman ſo ſoon was hardly diſcreet; parental patience, like ſome other virtues, being ſometimes apt to wear out, if too frequently called into uſe.</p>
               <p>Mr. Blagham had not been many days introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:029524_0025_0FE1D371267561F8"/>
to the Rev. Philibert Hughſon, before he diſcovered that ſomething very advantageous might ariſe from cultivating his acquaintance. He perfectly underſtood the way to recommend himſelf, and ſet about it with ſo much zeal, that he became very ſoon the deareſt friend he had in the world. . . . . . . Blagham thought he could not do better than endeavour to recommend one of the ſiſters of his intended wife: And he had already tried to perſuade his friend that he was in love with Maria, in which he would probably have ſucceeded, if, at a convivial meeting where the beauty of the neighbouring damſels was can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſſed, ſome young man, who had accidentally ſeen Roſalie, had not warmly aſſured him, that ſhe was the prettieſt girl in the county; and when another ſpoke of the celebrity of her ſiſters, agreed that they were fine women, but aſſured Mr. Hughſon, to whom he ſat near, in half a whiſper, that there was no more compariſon between them and the youngeſt ſiſter, than between light and darkneſs. This had greatly raiſed the curioſity of Hughſon, who had ſince preſſed his friend Blagham to carry him to the houſe of his intended father-in-law; a requeſt which was heard with pleaſure, and immediately granted.</p>
               <p>Equally raſh and headſtrong in whatever he undertook, Hughſon was paſſionately in love at firſt ſight; and as immediately determined to purſue the object that had thus ſtruck him, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing doubting her ready and even joyful accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a man ſo unexceptionable in point of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and ſo very clever a fellow.

impreſſion he took no pains to conceal his admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but perſecuted the diſtreſſed and reluctant Roſalie with ſpeeches to which it was impoſſible for her to reply. She looked timidly towards her father for protection: but ſhe ſaw, that far from being willing to afford it to her, he ſeemed delighted with the attention Mr. Hughſon paid her; and ſmiled and rubbed his hands, as who ſhould ſay, "Oh! oh! here comes a chapman for another of my girls."—Mrs. Leſſington ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be impreſſed with the ſame idea, and overwhelmed the little man with civility; while Maria, to whom he had before ſhewn a great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, and who ſeemed to have been much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pleaſed with it, was piqued at his now ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing himſelf entirely to her ſiſter; and ſhewed that ſhe ſeverely felt the mortification, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to conceal her vexation, by laughing and talking with Captain Mildred, who, being one of thoſe military heroes whoſe talents are greater in the field than in the cabinet, ſhe found it rather difficult to keep up the gaiety ſhe affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for Captain Mildred beſides that his head was very ſcantily ſtocked with ideas, was too fine a man to give himſelf the trouble to produce the few he had, to amuſe a country parſon's daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. He only came with Blagham and Hughſon, becauſe he had nothing better to do with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and had beſides an inclination to buy one of Hughſon's horſes, which he was in hopes of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a bargain, and which he had therefore been depreciating, and trying to put the little divine out of conceit with; telling him that the horſe in
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:029524_0027_0FE1D37991CD8690"/>
the firſt place had been ſtrained behind, and would never ſtand ſound. "And beſides," ſaid he, "my dear Doctor, it grieves all your friends to ſee you upon ſuch a tall, long-legged animal. By Heavens! Jack Norton of our regiment cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to me the other day, as you rode through Eaſt Street, and aſked me who that little fellow upon the tail horſe was: 'For damme,' ſays he, 'he puts me in mind of Tom Thumb upon an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant.'—Such was Captain Mildred, on whom neither beauty nor wit could make the ſlighteſt impreſſion, and who, equally ſtupid and ſelfiſh, had every qualification for a rogue, except talents. But he had a tolerable perſon, a red coat, and was ſaid to be a man of fortune; ſo that he had been reckoned among the miſſes a very charming man, and their mammas had invited him to their concerts and their card parties.</p>
               <p>Before the tea was finiſhed, at which Roſalie ſo reluctantly aſſiſted, Mr. Hughſon received from both her father and mother the moſt preſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing invitation to renew his viſits as often as he could. "And I hope, my good Sir," cried Mr. Leſſington, "I hope you will not let the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſhooting ſeaſon deprive us of the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of ſeeing you; for, I aſſure you, we ſhall have excellent ſport round about this village. I myſelf know of a great number of birds. I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect my ſon too. My eldeſt ſon, will be here ſhortly: and I am ſure he will be greatly flattered by the honour of your acquaintance."</p>
               <p>"I am ſure he will not," ſighed Roſalie to herſelf; "for never can a man be imagined
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:029524_0028_0FE1D37B2C0948F0"/>
whom William would like ſo little. But, alas! my father knows he is not coming."</p>
               <p>Plans were now talked of for the next week, which Hughſon ſpoke of as dedicated to the gun, with childiſh eagerneſs. He gave to Mr. Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſington a very long and elaborate deſcription of a new gun he had bought, which had coſt him five and twenty guineas: not indeed that he wanted any ſuch thing, for he was an admirable ſhot— killed nineteen out of twenty, and was reckoned as ſure as any man in Norfolk. "I remember about two years ago," ſaid he, "I went out, only I and my father's gamekeeper: and we killed, that is, I killed, about forty brace in about five hours; for he hardly ever fired."</p>
               <p>"Birds were remarkably plenty I ſuppoſe," ſaid Mr. Leſſington.</p>
               <p>"Why no, really not ſo very remarkably plenty—I have ſeen them as much ſo: but, my dear Sir, Norfolk is the county for game. . . . why, I have ſeen, Sir, of a morning, when the birds were at feed, the very ground covered with them; ſo that you could not have thrown a peb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble without touching them—as cloſe, Sir,—as cloſe"—</p>
               <p>Leſſington, who by a glance from Roſalie's eye, ſaw that Hughſon was doing himſelf diſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice with her by this ſort of rhodomontading, ſaved him the trouble of finding the compariſon he was ſeeking for, by ſaying, "Yes, yes—I have been in Norfolk—I know there is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious quantity of game in that county."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="unknown:029524_0029_0FE1D37D5E98FA30"/>But Hughſon, elevated with wine and inſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by love, could no longer check the violent inclination he always felt, to relate ſome very marvellous ſtory, and to make himſelf the hero of it. He thought it was impoſſible to find any audience better diſpoſed to liſten and believe, with the exception only of Captain Mildred, whoſe coldneſs he imputed to envy. He began, therefore, and told ſome of the moſt extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary adventures that ever were heard:—how he once, with his ſingle arm, defended ſeveral offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of dragoons from the inſults of an enraged populace, whom ſome of them had offended, juſt for throwing an old woman over a bridge into the river in a frolic. . . . "The old woman," ſaid he, "ſwam like a cork, and was taken out not a bit the worſe. My friend, Ned Whatley, as honeſt a fellow as ever lived, gave her a crown, and bid her not make ſuch a d—d yelling, ſince there was no harm done.

So, Sir, out I went among them all, and began to reaſon with them. They hiſſed, however, and began to be very troubleſome: but that I did not mind. I ſeized

But I ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with the other hand, and was going to drag both him and the firſt raſcal into the room, when up comes a great ſtrapping wench with a red hot poker in her hand.

               <p>"And pray, Hughſon," ſaid the Captain, with an air of incredulity, "what were your friends the officers of horſe doing all this while?"— "Doing?"—anſwered he—"Doing?—Why —why they were—they were ſhut up in the room. What <hi>could</hi> they do, you know."</p>
               <p>The evident fallacy and folly of ſuch a ſtory would not have been tolerated in any other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. But Mildred was too heavy and too indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In the buſtle of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, Roſalie left the room, as if to get her hat.

Perhaps her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and mother might chide her on her return to the houſe. But ſhe had ſo invincible a diſlike to being expoſed to the impertinence of Blagham, or the ridiculous ſpeeches of his new friend, that there was nothing ſhe had not rather ſubmit to, that temporary ill-humour could inflict, than to be expoſed to ſuch teaſing and diſguſting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.</p>

               <p>THE copſe into which Roſalie had thrown herſelf, like an affrighted bird, was very exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, ſtretching along the edge of the hill, and making a curve as if to let in the few houſes that compoſed the village.

               <p>Now, however, there were ſome winding paths through it, made to ſolitary farms around: And a nobleman, to whom the greater part of it belonged, had cut ridings from the Downs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his own houſe in two or three directions, to facilitate the way of the ſportſman. The path along which Roſalie went, was ſo intricate, that ſhe forgot how far or whither it carried her, till ſhe found it became duſk, and was ſtopped by arriving at one of theſe ridings or cuts through the wood. She then recollected how far ſhe had wandered from home, and was turning to go back, when three gentlemen on horſeback, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by two ſervants, came gal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Rather wondering than alarmed, Roſalie ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and the gentleman who had firſt ſpoken, ſaid, politely taking off his hat—"We are going, Madam, to Holmwood Park, which we plainly diſtinguiſhed from the hill, and to which my friend here, <hi>who ought to know,</hi> thought he could lead us by a nearer way than that which we were directed to take. But he now thinks he has ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

the wrong turning, and that we are too much to the left. Can you inform us how we can beſt make our way out of the wood? for if we could ſee the houſe again, we could eaſily reach it."</p>
               <p>Roſalie was about to anſwer, that the way they were in, led directly to a common, which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined the Park at Holmwood, when the young man, of whom the inquirer had ſpoken, as one who <hi>ought</hi> to know the way to it, jumped from his horſe, and exclaimed, "I cannot have forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten you, whatever elſe I have forgotten during two years abſence. It is Roſalie, my dear play-fellow and companion."</p>
               <p>"It is indeed," anſwered ſhe; "but, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens! Mr. Vyvian, how tall you are grown? Upon my word, I ſhould hardly have recollected you. How is my dear Mrs. Vyvian?—How are your ſiſters?"</p>

So many and ſo rapid were the queſtions that Mr. Charles Vyvian now had to make, that he wholly engroſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the converſation: And as they ſlowly walked down the green avenue before them, he ſeemed totally to have forgotten whither he was going, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> that he had any other buſineſs in the world
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:029524_0034_0FE1D38F27D93F88"/>
than to converſe with Roſalie as long as he could. It was now, however, ſo nearly dark, that ſhe thought it would be wrong to proceed any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.—"I muſt wiſh you a good night," ſaid ſhe, "and make the beſt of my way through the wood home."</p>
               <p>"Indeed, but you muſt not think of returning by yourſelf," anſwered Vyvian.—"Harry," ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded he, ſpeaking to Montalbert "let us go home with Miſs Leſſington.—Shall we not, Harry?"</p>
               <p>Harry anſwered, "With great pleaſure:" and the oppoſition of Roſalie was in vain.</p>
               <p>"But we need not go down this way, ſurely," ſaid Vyvian; "we may go along the path I ſaw you in, and ſo through your father's orchard or garden, or ſomething—I am ſure I remember ſuch a way."</p>
               <p>Roſalie anſwered, that it was certainly a much ſhorter road, but it was only a foot-path, and that there was a ſtile to paſs.</p>
               <p>"Never mind the ſtile," cried the young man, "we will leap our horſes over."</p>
               <p>He then led the way into the path, which only allowed two perſons to walk abreaſt. Mr. Montalbert and the Count de Torriani followed; the former murmuring loudly againſt Vyvian's monopoly, and the narrowneſs of the path.</p>
               <p>Roſalie expected to have found her father and mother returned from their walk, and in no very pleaſant humour, becauſe ſhe had left them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but, on entering the houſe through the garden, the noiſe ſhe heard in her father's book-room convinced her that the party whom ſhe ſo earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

wiſhed to avoid were not gone, but were, on the contrary, ſet in to drinking; an alteration of plan which did not at all ſurpriſe her, when Mr. Blagham and Mr. Hughſon were of the party.</p>
               <p>Young Vyvian, whoſe ſole meaning was to ſee her ſafe, was however now compelled in common civility to inquire for her mother and her ſiſters. Mrs. Leſſington, amazed at his ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den appearance, received him with a mixture of civility and confuſion, for which Roſalie knew not how to account. Mingled with this extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary expreſſion, there was alſo ſome anger towards her, and ſomething that ſeemed like a diſpoſition to reproach her for having introduced viſitors ſo unexpected.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Leſſington expreſſing her ſurprize at ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, when ſhe imagined he was at Chelten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, or in the North with the reſt of the family, he ſaid, "The Count de Torriani and my couſin Harry, having an inclination to ſee Holmwood, we agreed to make a tour round the Coaſt, to paſs about ten days at Brighthelmſtone, and to make Holmwood in our way back.

Roſalie did not ſeem to think any anſwer neceſſary to this: and Mrs. Leſſington put on a look of great gravity and reſerve, but ſaid nothing; and as at that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Mr. Montalbert did not ſeem to find any thing to ſay, a profound ſilence enſued for a minute, which was interrupted by the noiſy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of Mr. Leſſington and his friends. The former being appriſed of the arrival of young Vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian, came to pay him his compliments: And the others were about to depart, or at leaſt to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it, though the whole party, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting even the maſter of the houſe, ſeemed to have taken ſuch large potations, that they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be but little in poſſeſſion of their ſenſes. Mr. Leſſington, however, buſtled up to young Vyvian, expreſſing the greateſt delight in meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him: And, amidſt the confuſion, Mr. Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>albert approached Roſalie, to whom he had yet hardly had an opportunity of ſpeaking, though his eyes had declared how much he wiſhed it.

               <p>"You do me too much honour," anſwered Roſalie; "I was, indeed, very young—but (an involuntary ſigh forced its way as ſhe ſpoke) thoſe were my days of unallowed felicity; it was my golden age, and every ſcene has imprinted itſelf deeply on my memory. . .

brave, and may, perhaps, render ſome brave men cowards. However, that might be, Hugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon attempted no reply: But ſtill, unwilling that this ſtranger ſhould engroſs the attention of Roſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, he determined at leaſt to keep as cloſe to her as he could, and therefore ſquatted down in the window ſeat near her, being in truth not very well able to ſtand.</p>
               <p>Montalbert, ſhocked at his vulgarity and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinence, and having no idea that much cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony was neceſſary towards a man, whom he ſuppoſed to be a little, dirty, drunken curate, ſpoke in a ſtill lower tone to Roſalie, and what was yet more mortifying, he ſpoke in Italian, while, with open mouth and watery eyes, her unfortunate admirer ſat gaſping and ſtaring be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind her totally diſregarded.</p>
               <p>Montalbert, as well as Roſalie, had forgotten not only that he was in the room, but that any other perſons were in it but themſelves. From an oblivion ſo pleaſing, however, they were ſoon rouſed by Vyvian, who, diſengaging himſelf with great difficulty from the mandling civilities of Mr. Leſſington, who was very drunk and very tedious, came haſtily to Montalbert and told him they muſt go. Vyvian then took Roſalie's hand, and ſighing ſaid, "Alas! how little I have ſeen of you, and <hi>that</hi> only by chance; can I not come to-morrow to take leave of you, Roſalie? for you know I am going abroad again almoſt immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and who knows when we ſhall meet once more? Tell me, Roſalie, do you think I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

had by this time ſidled up near her daughter, to whom ſhe did not allow time to reply, but with an air moſt repulſively grave and formal, ſhe ſaid, "I am very ſorry, Mr. Vyvian, it happens ſo, as your time is ſo ſhort; but my daughter is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly engaged to-morrow. We are all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly engaged. It is extremely unfortunate indeed. Another time I hope we ſhall be more lucky."</p>
               <p>This rebuff ſeemed particularly mortifying to Vyvian. He bowed coldly to the mother, and then, gently preſſing the hand of Roſalie, which he ſtill held, he ſaid in a whiſper, "I <hi>must</hi> ſee you again; where are you going to?"—"I do not know, indeed," anſwered Roſalie, "for this is the firſt I have heard of any engagement. I am afraid it is on ſome party with theſe men." She could add no more; for a ſervant informed Mr. Vyvian and the other gentlemen that their horſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and Miſs Catharine made upon them. "I ſhould not have known Mr. Charles Vyvian," ſaid the latter. "How very tall he is."</p>
               <p>"He is tall, indeed" replied her mother; "but you may ſee he is a mere boy. That young man, would you believe it, Mr. Hughſon, is hardly ſeventeen? He is the ſon of Mr. Vyvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, you know, of Holmwood, with whoſe lady I uſed to be ſo intimate. My daughter Roſe uſed to live there a good deal when ſhe was a child, and this young man looks upon her as one of the family."—Hughſon, checking a hickup which had nearly broken the ſentence, cried, "Indeed! —really!—nothing to be ſure can be more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral."</p>
               <p>"Pray, Ma'am," ſaid Miſs Catharine, "who is that other gentleman; I don't mean the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Count, but the other Engliſhman? He is a remarkable handſome man."</p>
               <p>"I am ſurpriſed dear Miſs Kitty ſhould think ſo," ſputtered Hughſon. "To my fancy now, he does not look at all like an Engliſhman—not the leaſt."</p>
               <p>"Why, certainly," replied Mrs. Leſſington, "he can hardly be called an Engliſhman; for in the firſt place, his mother was a foreign lady; and, though his father is an Engliſhman, he liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed chiefly abroad, and this gentleman has never been in England above half a year at a time, though they have a very fine ſeat in the North of England, and a great fortune in the family."</p>
               <p>"He ſeems to be a very proud man," ſaid Hughſon. "I believe I have affronted h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> though I am ſure I don't know what I ſaid."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="unknown:029524_0041_0FE1D3A14399EFA0"/>"I believe, indeed, that you did not," ſaid Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalie, "and you will pardon me, Mr. Hughſon, if I ſay, that you ſeemed to intend to affront him."</p>
               <p>Hughſon who had no clear idea of what he <hi>had</hi> ſaid, would have taken her hand, but ſhe ſnatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it away, and haſtened out of the room. Soon after ſhe had the ſatisfaction of hearing the whole party leave the houſe, and ſcamper away with a degree of raſhneſs which ſhe thought muſt make her ſiſter uneaſy for the ſafety of her lover.</p>
               <p>Roſalie, whoſe ſpirits were fatigued by the events of the afternoon, could not, however, compoſe herſelf to ſleep. The ſight of Charles Vyvian had recalled all thoſe ſcenes which ſhe had vainly been trying to forget, and to think of with leſs concern: And his manners, but ſtill more thoſe of his relation, Mr. Montalbert, formed ſo decided a contraſt to thoſe of the perſons with whom it was now her lot to be aſſociated, that ſhe found ſhe ſhould, by continually making the compariſon, be rendered more uneaſy than ever. She ſaw too, by her mother's manner, that ſhe would have yet to undergo ſome ſevere reproofs for having brought Charles Vyvian and his two companions home with her; and though it was eaſy to account for their appearance, which it muſt be known was merely in conſequence of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally meeting her, yet ſhe knew that the circumſtance of her ſo abruptly quitting company, in which it was her father's wiſh that ſhe ſhould remain, would bring upon her reproaches that ſhe ſhould not ſoon or eaſily appeaſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="unknown:029524_0042_0FE1D3A885E55E70"/>The next day verified her apprehenſions. Her father ordered her to attend him in his ſtudy at an early hour of the morning, as he was going out. She entered dejectedly. Her mother was there, and both looked coolly upon her, as they bade her ſhut the door and ſit down. Mr. Leſſington thus began:</p>
               <p>"Roſe, it is fit and right that you ſhould know that you have extremely diſpleaſed me."</p>
               <p>"I am extremely ſorry for it, Sir. It was by no means my intention."</p>
               <p>"You think then, perhaps, that it is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to ſlight my friends, and ſhew that you deſpiſe them—gentlemen whoſe notice does you ſo much honour, and whoſe good opinion perhaps may be ſo material to you. Do you conſider, girl, that you have no fortune? That a clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's income dies with him? That it is your buſineſs to endeavour to procure an eſtabliſhment, inſtead of affecting theſe fine romantic airs?"</p>
               <p>"I affected no airs, Sir. I obeyed your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and made tea for the gentlemen. I did not know you wiſhed me to remain with them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, eſpecially as you muſt have perceived that they were not in a ſituation in which they could be pleaſant company for women."</p>
               <p>"Prudiſh airs—Were not your mother and your ſiſters with you? And do you think I would have aſked either them or you to ſtay in improper company?—Let me hear no more of all this, but liſten to what I have to ſay to you.

Then, turning to Mrs. Leſſington, he added, "you will not fail to enforce what I have ſaid, and to impreſs on the mind of this young woman, that, though ſhe has hitherto found me an indulgent father, I know how to make myſelf be obeyed."—He then left the room, and Mrs. Leſſington ſaid, "You ſee, Roſe, that your father is peremotory.

               <p>"Dear Madam," ſaid Roſalie, "what occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion can there be for all theſe menaces of anger, if I do not liſten to Mr. Hughſon, when it is not even known whether Mr. Hughſon will ever think of me again?"</p>
               <p>"Perhaps your father has reaſons, with which he may not think proper to acquaint you, why he knows Mr. Hughſon means to addreſs you."</p>
               <p>"Very certainly, Madam, Mr. Hughſon could not communicate to my father what he could not know himſelf laſt night; for ſo far from being capable of thinking what he intended for the future, he knew not what he was about then;

but, admitting it to be ſo, why muſt I be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to liſten to him? Indeed, my dear Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, this Mr. Hughſon is a man it is utterly impoſſible for me to like."</p>
               <p>"It would be ſomething new, Roſe, and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unlike the heroines whoſe adventures you have ſtudied, if you ſhould happen to like the man recommended to you by your friends, and in every reſpect eligible.

               <p>"Roſalie bluſhed deeply, without exactly know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing why. "Dear Madam," ſaid ſhe, "what a ſtrange thing that is to ſay."</p>
               <p>"As ſtrange as true," replied Mrs. Leſſington. "Its truth, I am much afraid, will be too ſoon verified; but have a care, I promiſe you not only that nobody will defend you in this <hi>dangerous ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity,</hi> but that it will be the certain means of eſtranging from you thoſe friends who love you beſt. . . . . .

               <p>"For God's ſake, my dear mother!" ſaid Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalie, with tears in her eyes, "what do you mean? This is the firſt time you ever talked to me in this manner! How I have deſerved it now, I am entirely ignorant. Did I ever ſay I liked any particular perſon?—or—"</p>
               <p>"Pho! pho!" cried Mrs. Leſſington, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting her, "you cannot deceive <hi>me.</hi> But let me earneſtly exhort you, Roſalie, never to think of the perſons to whom you know I allude, but to determine to follow, like a reaſonable woman, the advice of thoſe who know better what is fit for you than you do yourſelf."</p>
               <p>Roſalie remained ſilent. Her ſoul abhorred the idea of receiving Hughſon as a lover; nor could ſhe endure that a mother ſhould for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment believe her capable of heſitating about him. The converſation ſhe had held, however, was ſo new, and ſo ſtrange, that ſhe had not courage to defend herſelf; and after a ſhort pauſe, Mrs. Leſſington thus went on:—</p>
               <p>"Did you ever know any woman who married juſt according to her own romantic whims in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out in life?—Did I do it, do you think?— Did Mrs. Vyvian?"</p>

                  <pb n="44" facs="unknown:029524_0046_0FE1D3B5B9DE1258"/>"That was very different," ſaid Mrs. Leſſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton. "My friend was—" She ſtopped, as ſhe had often done before when their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation had been led to the ſame topic; and then immediately changing it, ſaid, "But you now know my opinion, and your father's commands. We are going to-day where you will again be in company with Mr. Hughſon: And it is expected of you, that you will behave to him as a friend of your father's, and a gentleman whoſe partiality does you honour."</p>
               <p>"Whither am I to go, Madam?" ſaid Roſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie in a dejected tone.</p>
               <p>"To Chicheſter," replied her mother dryly. . . "We dine with Mr. Blagham. His uncle is to be there with ſome other friends. Your ſiſter Catharine's ſettlement is to be ſigned. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a party of friends dine with him on veniſon; and we ſhall remain there all night, perhaps go to the aſſembly the night after: You will, therefore, put up a ſmall packet of cloaths, and act accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly."</p>
               <p>From the manner in which this was ſaid, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalie knew no remonſtrance againſt an expedition ſo very irkſome to her would be liſtened to; and that, however, hateful to her, ſhe muſt obey. She retired, therefore, with an heavy heart to her own room, and began to dreſs, and to prepare for the party.</p>
               <p>But her mother's oblique reproaches had made a great impreſſion on her mind. She imagined they muſt allude to Mr. Charles Vyvian or Mr. Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>albert; but probably the former, as her mother
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:029524_0047_0FE1D3B76B455CB0"/>
could hardly ſuſpect her of a partiality for a man ſhe had not ſeen ſince ſhe was ten or eleven years old. In regard to Mr. Vyvian her heart acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her; but ſhe was at the ſame time conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous that nothing could do ſo great a diſſervice to Hughſon, in <hi>her</hi> opinion, as putting him a moment in compariſon with ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>ROSALIE was ſoon ready to proceed on an expedition, from which ſhe found no pretence would excuſe her. She mounted her ſiſter Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharine's poney with reluctance. Her father, mother, and Miſs Leſſington, were in the poſt chaiſe. The other ſiſter was alſo on horſeback; and it did not add much to Roſalie's proſpect for the day, that it was her ſiſter Maria who had been put out of humour the preceding evening by the unfortunate and undeſired preference Hugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon had ſhewn Roſalie; and who, now ſullen and
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:029524_0048_0FE1D3B90AFF2B98"/>
pouting, endeavoured to ſhew her ſiſter that ſhe had not forgotten the mortification.</p>
               <p>They had aſcended and were riding along the hill; but the morning being hot and ſultry, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalie turned her horſe towards its edge, where began a wood that ſhaded one ſide of it, and the aſh and beech afforded a temporary ſkreen. Several roads wound up the hill from the villages below, and as Roſalie was croſſing one of theſe, ſhe ſaw Montalbert ſuddenly appear, who, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching her with the common ſalutation of the morning, rode along by her ſide without noticing the reſt of the party.</p>
               <p>Roſalie conſcious that this would give great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to her father and mother, and unwilling to increaſe the diſlike they ſeemed already to have taken to him from the little attention he ſhewed to them the preceding evening, inquired if he would not ſpeak to them?</p>
               <p>"Bye and bye," ſaid he coldly; "but good God, is it never poſſible to have a moment's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation with you?—I have a great reſpect for Mr. and Mrs. Leſſington, becauſe they are ſo nearly related to you: But you know I have not the pleaſure of being acquainted with them."</p>
               <p>There was ſomething of peculiar dejection in the manner of Montalbert as he ſpoke.</p>
               <p>"You are not well?" ſaid Roſalie.</p>
               <p>"Not very well," replied he; "but the hot weather of England never agrees with me. There is ſomething ſtrangely oppreſſive in it. I don't know whether it is that which has affected poor Charles; but, I aſſure you, he is ſeriouſly

               <p>"I am very ſorry," ſaid Roſalie with quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, "it will ſo diſtreſs my dear Mrs. Vyvian!— Has he ſent for any advice?"</p>

Roſalie in the mean time, not thinking about him, was inquiring of Charles Vyvian why he prolonged his ſtay in the country, when he was well enough to go?

               <p>Hughſon then, endeavouring to ſmile and ſmirk in order to conceal the extreme vexation he felt, advanced to take her hand; but, from ſome unuſual courage which at that moment ſhe felt, ſome ſudden impulſe for which ſhe could hardly account, and which ſhe afterwards thought blameable, ſhe ſnatched away the hand Hughſon would have taken, and telling him diſdainfully that ſhe did not know that ſhe ſhould dance any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But, accuſtomed as he had been to fancy that ſo clever a little fellow, with his fortune and expectations, might have his choice among the young women of a whole county, he could not repreſs the mortification he felt.

               <p>VERY bitter were the reproaches which Roſalie was compelled to hear during their way home. She bore them with patience and ſilence, conſcious perhaps that they were not wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merited. She was, indeed, willing enough to acknowledge that ſhe ſhould not ſo rudely have repulſed Hughſon in poſitive diſobedience of her father's commands. But why her mother ſhould make her converſation with Charles Vyvian ſo great a crime, ſhe could not imagine, ſince in fact ſhe had ſhewn a much greater diſpoſition to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

His converſation made a deeper impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the more ſhe reflected on it. Montalbert was not only the moſt elegant and agreeable man ſhe had ever converſed with, but he appeared to her to be the moſt unlikely man in the world to amuſe himſelf with the cruel, yet too frequent folly of making profeſſions that mean nothing. Montal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert therefore loved her. An idea ſo ſoothing acquired new power to charm her in proportion as ſhe reflected on all he had ſaid, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which he ſaid it. How fortunate would be her deſtiny, ſhould ſhe become the wife of ſuch a man, and how was it poſſible that her mother, who muſt ſee the marked preference he gave her, could heſitate a moment between him and ſuch a man as Hughſon! It was true, Mr. Montalbert was a Catholic, but of what conſequence was that? Was not her mother's earlieſt and be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>At breakfaſt every body affected to reſent to Roſalie what had paſſed the evening before.— And while Mr. Leſſington regarded her with evident marks of diſpleaſure, and would not ſpeak to her, while her mother, ſtill more angry, talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at her, and encouraged Blagham, in his ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures on the company who were at the aſſembly, to ridicule the two travelled men, who were, he ſaid, the greateſt coxcombs he ever recollected to have ſeen—to which Hughſon very warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſented, caſting at the ſame time a look of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment at Roſalie, as if to ſay, "Yet you Miſs, preferred theſe men to me?"</p>

               <p>Before Mr. Leſſington, who never ſpoke with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out due conſideration and emphaſis, could return an anſwer, 'Miſs Maria ſaid, "Oh! there they go."</p>
               <p>"Who go," inquired her mother.</p>
               <p>"My ſiſter Roſe's great and fine friends<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>" anſwered Maria, "Mr. Vyvian and Mr.— I forget his name, that very fineſt of all fine men."</p>
               <p>Roſalie who had ſeen them as well as her ſiſter, could not help bluſhing. Montalbert had looked earneſtly in as he paſſed, and checked his horſe a moment when he perceived he had caught her eye.</p>
               <p>"I hope," ſaid Mrs. Leſſington auſterely, "that Mr. Vyvian is returning immediately to his mother, who is extremely ill, who knows no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of his being here, and who would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely unhappy were ſhe to be informed of it.

                  <pb n="68" facs="unknown:029524_0070_0FE1D401BAF1AD08"/>Roſalie whoſe conſcience was perfectly clear in regard to Vyvian, anſwered calmly, "He told me ſo himſelf, Madam; and I anſwered, becauſe I thought your converſation addreſſed particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to me."</p>
               <p>"Humph,"—ſaid Mrs. Leſſington contemptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly—"ſilence, child, would often become you much better."</p>
               <p>The other young ladies had a great deal to do in the town; for Miſs Catharine was now to be married in three days. Mantua-makers and mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liners were therefore to be hurried; and, as ſoon as breakfaſt was over, they went out together for that purpoſe, attended by Blagham and Hughſon, while Roſalie remained where ſhe was, having no ambition to accompany them. Her prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for her ſiſter's wedding were confined, (as it was intended that Maria only ſhould accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the bride,) and about theſe ſhe was by no means ſolicitous.</p>
               <p>Diſagreeable and uneaſy to her as the remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances and reproaches were that ſhe was ſtill obliged to hear, ſhe flattered herſelf that one good effect would ariſe from the circumſtances of the preceding evening—that Hughſon, convinced of its inefficacy, would carry his ſuit no farther, and that his pride would prevent her being teazed with addreſſes, which her ſiſter ſeemed diſpoſed to receive favourably.</p>
               <p>But in this hope ſhe was diſppointed. The admiration Roſalie had ſo univerſally excited, while her ſiſter had been hardly noticed, the whiſpers of approbation that he had heard from
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:029524_0071_0FE1D404252E2C58"/>
the moſt faſhionable ſet in the room, for whoſe opinion the whole country around had the moſt implicit deference, as well as the impreſſion ſhe ſeemed to have made on Vyvian and Montalbert, were altogether circumſtances ſo far from deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Hughſon from purſuing her, that they ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only to inflame his ambition: And, though he affected to direct his attention towards Miſs Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, for a while, in hopes of piquing Roſalie, he ſoon renewed thoſe expreſſions of affection and proteſtations of unwearied perſeverance, from which Roſalie foreſaw ſo much perſecution and trouble.</p>
               <p>As Hughſon was to perform the marriage cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony between his friend Blagham and Miſs Kitty Leſſington, he went back with the family; and by his troubleſome aſſiduities, and ridiculous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts at gaiety and wit, deprived her of the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction ſhe would have derived from having left a place ſo very diſagreeable to her as the provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial town where they had paſſed the laſt three days. . . . .

known to have private meetings with any one— but what <hi>meetings</hi> can I have?—Is not Mr. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talbert immediately going back to Italy: And is there any probability of my ever ſeeing him again?—Ah! no."—The argument concluded with a deep ſigh: But it had not helped to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine her. From an almoſt intuitive ſenſe of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, for ſhe had received but little inſtruction on ſuch matters, ſhe was conſcious that ſhe ought not to go out with a view of meeting Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talbert. Yet to think that ſhe had ſeen him for the laſt time, to let him go with impreſſions of her having a predilection in favour of ſuch a man as Hughſon, of her being happy among ſuch ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety as ſhe was condemned to, it was impoſſible to determine on. Sleep the enſuing night was driven from the pillow of Roſalie by theſe debates; but it was at this ſeaſon, long before day appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with its firſt dawn, however, ſhe left her bed; for it would very ſoon be neceſſary to determine whether ſhe would venture to commit ſuch an impropriety as meeting Montalbert, or ſuffer him to depart under the impreſſions he would carry with him, if ſhe ſaw him no more.</p>
               <p>His dejection when he ſpoke of immediately leaving England, his reſpectful manners, the warm and lively affection he ſeemed to have for her, the advantageous light in which his honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able addreſſes appeared to her, all contributed to diſpoſe her to meet him. Againſt it there was only that internal ſenſe of prudence, (which like the voice of conſcience, could not be entirely ſtifled,) and the fear of offending her mother.
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:029524_0073_0FE1D40767FED4A0"/>
Yet why ſhould her mother be offended?—Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in every way whether as to fortune<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> rank of life, family, or proſpects, there could, ſhe thought, be no compariſon between Montalbert and Hughſon; and if to have her married well was the wiſh of her parents, why ſhould they be angry at her not declining an acquaintance which ſeemed likely to end in an eſtabliſhment above their hopes. There was ſome truth, but more ſophiſtry, in the arguments ſhe uſed with herſelf to conquer her remaining apprehenſions; when, having determined to venture, ſince it could be but for once, ſhe left the houſe, and trembling and looking behind her at every ſtep, haſtened through the heavy dews and grey fogs of a late October morning to the copſe where ſhe had firſt unexpectedly met Vyvian and Montalbert, and where he had told her he ſhould be very early on this morning, the laſt of his ſtay in the country, in hopes of her giving him an opportunity of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a long leave of her.</p>
               <p>As ſhe had uſually been a very early riſer, and frequently walked to ſome neighbouring village, or farm-houſe, before the reſt of the family went riſen, the ſervants and labourers, who ſaw h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

hardly draw her breath, and her heart beat ſo violently that ſhe leaned againſt the ſtyle which in one place divided the wood. "Whither am I going?" ſaid ſhe; "to meet a man, who, till a week ſince, was a ſtranger to me! How am I ſure that he will not deſpiſe me for this eaſy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance; perhaps I ſhall forfeit his good opinion —perhaps—ſurely it were better to retreat." There was, however, no longer time to heſitate; for at the end of the path before her Montalbert appeared.

               <p>"Good Heavens!" replied he, "and will you already leave me?—No, Roſalie, our time is precious, and I will not throw it away in a profu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of words.

I am a younger brother; and though the fortune of my family is very conſiderable, much of my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations depend on my mother, who is a native of another country, who has hardly ever been in England, and who diſlikes the cuſtoms, the manners, and, above all, the religion of this.

I fear, to her own—ſhe has however, always been to me an affectionate, if not a tender mother, and it would be equally ungrateful and impolitic, were I to act in abſolute defiance of her known wiſhes. Yet, ſurely, a medium may be found. Without incurring her diſpleaſure, I may eſcape the miſery of reſigning the only woman I ever ſaw, with whom I wiſh to paſs my whole life."</p>
               <p>"I do not ſee how," anſwered Roſalie, tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and faltering. "No, Sir; however flattered I may be by your good opinion, I entreat you to think of me no more, otherwiſe than as a friend. The obſtacles between us are inſurmountable, and—"</p>

               <p>"I am perſuaded you think ſo now," anſwered Montalbert with vivacity; "but who ſhall aſſure me, Roſalie, that you can always reſiſt the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, the commands of your father—fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily convenience, and what is called the voice of prudence, and all thoſe motives that may be urged to enforce your obedience?

               <p>"On ſo ſhort an acquaintance, can I, ought I, to promiſe this?" replied Roſalie with increaſed emotion.

He inſiſted on being allowed to cut off a lock of her hair, and on her taking a miniature of himſelf which he drew from his pocket, and which he owned had been drawn in London for his mother.

Terror now ſeized her. "It is my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther," ſaid ſhe. "If he finds you with me, what ſhall I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>"And why to ſeek me," replied ſhe, "if there was no ſuſpicion of my being improperly abſent? It is not uſual for them to inquire or call after me."</p>
               <p>Montalbert now ſaw her ſo affected with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, that he would not longer detain her; but kiſſing her hand, and preſſing it a moment to his boſom, he told her he would find the means of writing to her, and diſappeared, while Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalie endeavouring to recollect and compoſe herſelf, took the path that led towards home.</p>

               <p>HAD it indeed been Mr. Leſſington himſelf, who had thus loudly ſummoned his daughter to return home, it would have been difficult for her to have concealed from him the agitation of her mind, notwithſtanding her utmoſt endeavours to compoſe herſelf. But it was only Abraham a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant who was occaſionally bailiff, coachman, foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, groom, or whatever was wanted in the family, who, approaching her out of breath, cried, "Lord, Miſs, I've been ever ſo long look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a'ter you. . . . . Why, here a been all on em looking for your coming; for what d'ye think."</p>
               <p>"Indeed, I don't know," replied Roſalie, breathleſs, and terrified at this preamble.</p>
               <p>"Ah! Miſs—Miſs!—you can't gueſs whoſe come?"</p>

both on um be comed to be preſent at the wedding, and a rare time we ſhall all on us have on't I warrant too."</p>
               <p>"I am very glad, indeed," ſaid Roſalie, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved from a thouſand apprehenſions of ſhe knew not what. "I thought my brother William would not be here till to-morrow; and as for Frank, I did not know he was expected." She then haſtened into the houſe, and in meeting her brothers particularly the eldeſt, to whom ſhe was much attached, the embarraſſment of her manner was not remarked, nor was any enquiry made where ſhe had been.</p>
               <p>It was not till ſhe retired to dreſs for dinner that ſhe was at liberty to reflect on all that had paſſed with Montalbert. The promiſe ſhe had given ſeemed to be a relief to her ſpirits, when ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered that it ſhould make her conſider herſelf as betrothed to the only man in the world whom ſhe preferred to all others; that ſhe had now the beſt reaſons in the world to ſtrengthen her reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, never to liſten to Hughſon; reaſons, which if ſhe dared plead them, her father himſelf could not diſapprove. She ran over in her mind every look, every ſentence of Montalbert, and ſincerity and tenderneſs ſeemed to dwell upon his tongue. What but real affection could induce him to ſpeak, to act as he had done? and what could be ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate as her inſpiring ſuch a man with a paſſion ſuch as he profeſſed to feel for her? A conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of attractions, which till very lately ſhe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuſpected that ſhe poſſeſſed, gave her a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary pleaſure; but ſhe felt that thoſe attrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:029524_0080_0FE1D41CB8E552A8"/>
would have been without value<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had they not ſecured for her the heart of Montalbert.</p>
               <p>Soon dreſſed for the day, ſhe ſat in the window of her bed chamber, penſively looking towards the quarter where Holmwood Houſe was ſituated, though ſhe could not diſtinguiſh it. "He is gone!" ſaid ſhe. "Already he is on his way to London; in a few days after he arrives there he will leave it—will leave England—the ſea will be between us!" She took out the picture he had given her, and, for the third time ſince it had been in her poſſeſſion, fixed her eyes earneſtly upon it. The candour and integrity of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance ſtruck her particularly. "Never," ſighed ſhe, "can the heart that belongs to theſe features be otherwiſe than generous, tender, and ſincere." She was thus feeding the infant paſſion which had taken entire poſſeſſion of her mind, and was loſt in thought, holding the picture ſtill in her hand, when her elder brother opened the door. "Are you dreſſed Roſalie?" ſaid he, "and may I come in?"—"O yes! yes! brother," anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhe, hurrying the picture into her pocket, "pray come in."</p>
               <p>"I have a great deal to ſay to you, my dear Roſe," ſaid he. "Come, give me a place in the window by you. You are very much impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, my love, ſince I ſaw you laſt; I don't won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the havoc you make; but my mother complains of you, Roſe."</p>
               <p>"On what account, my brother? I am ſure I never intentionally offended my mother."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="unknown:029524_0081_0FE1D41E59631988"/>"But ſhe tells me that you have now an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of marrying extremely well; but that from ſome unaccountable perverſeneſs, or unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable prejudice, or perhaps," added he, fixing his eyes earneſtly on hers, "perhaps through ſome unhappy predilection, you drive from you, with contempt and diſdain, a man every way unexceptionable."</p>
               <p>"You have ſeen him, brother," anſwered Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalie, "and can tell whether you think him all that my mother has repreſented."</p>
               <p>"I have only ſeen him for a moment, and have hardly exchanged ten words with him. His perſon is neither good nor bad; but ſurely my ſiſter has too much ſenſe to refuſe a man mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe he is not an Adonis."</p>
               <p>"But indeed, brother, it is not that. Mr. Hughſon is a man, whom it is impoſſible I can ever like. He is ſilly, noiſy, and conceited; a boaſter, and a ſort of man whom I know will diſpleaſe you when you ſee more of him. I dare ſay his fortune is greater than I have a right to expect.

                  </gap> there is much worldly wiſdom in marrying a man with whom I might enjoy a ſhort affluence, that would only make me feel more ſeverely the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence he might reduce me to."</p>
               <p>"All that is very well," ſaid William Leſſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton; "but tell me, Roſalie, what do you ſay as to this prepoſſeſſion in favour of another, of which my mother accuſes you?"</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="unknown:029524_0082_0FE1D424B7EA6C30"/>"I can ſay nothing," replied ſhe, "becauſe I —becauſe I know that—indeed I do not know who ſhe means."</p>
               <p>"Is there no ſuch predilection exiſting then, Roſalie?"</p>
               <p>"Not for the perſon my mother thinks of," anſwered ſhe, colouring ſtill higher.</p>
               <p>"You allow there is for ſome other then?"</p>
               <p>"Not at all. I am ſure I did not ſay any thing like that; but if there were, why, my dear brother, ſhould it of neceſſity be in favour of a perſon who would diſgrace my family?"</p>
               <p>"There may be very improper attachments, Roſalie," replied he very gravely, "which may not be diſgraceful in the uſual acceptation of the word: As, for example, if a young woman ſhould be flattered into a partiality for a <hi>boy</hi> of a <hi>different</hi> religion, and in whoſe power it could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ulfil any promiſes which a childiſh paſſion might induce him to make." The coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of Roſalie changed to a deeper ſcarlet. "I ſee how it is, my ſiſter," added he, "and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>"Before you go, my dear William," cried Roſalie, recovering herſelf a little, "let me aſſure you, that my mother has no grounds whatever for her ſuſpicions, but becauſe Mr. Charles Vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian has appeared particularly pleaſed at our m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>"And is <hi>that</hi> all, Roſalie?"</p>
               <p>"That is all, upon my honour, replied ſhe, in regard of Mr. Vyvian."</p>
               <p>Young Leſſington, who did not know Montal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert even by name, appeared ſatisfied, and they went down together; when, from the beginning of the dinner, converſation, and quantity of wine which Hughſon very ſoon ſwallowed Roſalie flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered herſelf that long before the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>The repulſive gravity with which Mrs. Leſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington anſwered him, was but ill ſeconded by the

increaſing confuſion of her daughter, who heſitat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, bluſhed, and ſtammered out a few incoherent words; ſymptoms which did not eſcape her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who narrowly watched her, and who ſailed not to impute it all to a very different motive from the real one.</p>
               <p>Montalbert, in the mean time, was on thorns.

This ſhort ceremony paſſed with great formality on all ſides: and Vyvian and Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talbert followed the woman of the family into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other room, the latter ſat himſelf down with great

ſolemnity to write out his ſong, which having done in the plaineſt Italian he could imagine, but written as if it was in meaſure, he gave it to Roſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie; and Vyvian, who had been talking earneſtly to her the whole time, reluctantly took his leave alſo, and they both departed.</p>
               <p>They were hardly out of the room before Mrs. Leſſington, whoſe anger and ſuſpicions were rouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed anew, demanded to ſee the paper Montalbert had given her.

She looked at it a moment; and believing from the manner in which it was written it was really a ſong, gave it her back again, not without evident marks of diſpleaſure, and many hints of her reſolution to inform Mrs. Vyvian where her ſon was, and of the impropriety of his conduct, if he did not leave th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The next day the wedding of her ſecond ſiſter and Mr. Blagham was celebrated. The party were more noiſy and diſagreeable than is even uſual on ſuch occaſions. Hughſon was the moſt drunk, and conſequently the moſt impertinent; and never was an hour ſo welcome to Roſalie as that which took them all away, by the favour of a full moon, and left her alone with her mother.</p>
               <p>Till now the tumult, with which ſhe had been ſurrounded, had not allowed her a moment, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thoſe allotted to repoſe, to indulge reflections on what had paſſed.

and bewildered thoughts. Her mother, buſied in arranging her houſe, left her to herſelf. Her father had accompanied the bride and bridegroom to their houſe, and was afterwards to go on a tour with them into the eaſtern part of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. It was at once a matter of pleaſure and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe to Roſalie, that he had never once propoſed her being of the party: and ſhe remarked that he now appeared much leſs anxious than her mother to promote with her the ſuit of Mr. Hughſon; it ſeemed as if he would have been as well contented that his daughter Maria ſhould enſure this important conqueſt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Leſſington was one of thoſe men who have juſt as much underſtanding as enables them to fill, with tolerable decency, their part on the theatre of the world.

He kept a poſt-chaiſe; not, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, a very ſuperb and faſhionable equipage, but very well for that country. His cart horſes drew it, but they were ſleek and well trimmed: and Abraham truſſed up in a tight blue jacket, and his broad cheeks ſet off by a jockey cap, made a very reſpectable appearance as conductor of a vehicle which gave no inconſiderable degree of conſequence to its owners in a country thinly inhabited by gentlemen. Mr. Leſſington was the moſt punctual man imaginable at all meetings of the clergy, where he did equal honour to the ſublunary good things that were to be eaten, and the ſpiritual good things that were to be liſtened to.

But Mr. Leſſington had promiſed her ſomething handſome at his death: and there was no doubt in the mind of the lawyer of his ability to fulfil his promiſe.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Leſſington and Roſalie had now been at home alone three days. The former had ſettled her houſe, and was quietly enjoying the order ſhe had reſtored after all the buſtle they had lately been in; while Roſalie, with mingled emo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>It was in the evening of the third day, that as ſhe was walking in a ſort of court, that was before the houſe next a road, an horſeman ſtopped, and inquired if this was not the parſonage? On Roſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie's anſwering in the affirmative, he produced a letter, which he ſaid he had been ſent with from Lewes.</p>
               <p>

In her way to the kitchen, ſhe was met by her mother, who, ſeeing her extreme agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a letter in her hand, for ſhe had not had preſence of mind to conceal it, immediately fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied it came from Charles Vyvian, who was always haunting her imagination.

               <p>Though nothing was more likely than ſuch an event, from the form and manner of life of her huſband, it had never once occurred to her as poſſible. The ſhock, therefore, was great; and the widow's grief not a little increaſed by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, that their income ariſing from church preferment was at an end.</p>
               <p>Roſalie felt as ſhe ought on the loſs of a parent. But as it was more to the purpoſe to endeavour to aſſuage her mother's ſorrow than to indulge her own, ſhe gave her whole attention to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.

omiſſion, than as it proved her father's total want of affection for her—a conviction that coſt her many tears; nor were thoſe tears tried by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark ſhe made on the behaviour of her ſiſters and her younger brother, who all ſeemed pleaſed, though they affected concern. The behaviour of her elder brother, however, would have given her comfort, could ſhe have conquered the pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful idea, that her father had thrown her off as a ſtranger to his blood. As ſoon as the funeral was over, her brother William took occaſion to talk to her alone. "Be not ſo dejected, my dear Roſalie," ſaid he; "unpromiſing as your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects appear, you have at leaſt the conſolation of knowing that you have always a friend in me, who will never forſake you."</p>
               <p>"You are too good, deareſt William," replied the weeping mourner; "but do not imagine that it is the want of a ſhare of my father's little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty that grieves me—no; if he had but <hi>named</hi> me with kindneſs, I ſhould not have been ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy. But when I think that he muſt certainly have died in anger with me, and that either from my ſeeming to refuſe Mr. Hughſon, or ſome other cauſe, he was irritated againſt me."</p>
               <p>"If you reflect a moment, my ſweet ſiſter, on the date of the will, you will ſee that this could not be. The will is dated above three years ſince, when the very exiſtence of ſuch a man as Hughſon was unknown to him, when you were only between fourteen and fifteen years of age, when you had been more with Mrs. Vyvian than at home, and when it was every way impoſſible
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:029524_0093_0FE1D443B3939148"/>
that you could have given him the leaſt offence. I rather think that this ſtrange circumſtance aroſe from the opinion he entertained, that Mrs. Vyvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an would provide for you."</p>
               <p>"How could my father think that," ſaid Roſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, "when he muſt have known that Mrs. Vyvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, notwithſtanding the large fortune ſhe brought, has not even the power to hire or diſcharge a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and is hardly allowed enough yearly to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as her rank requires, leaſt, as her croſs tyrant of an huſband ſays, ſhe ſhould ſquander his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune on begging friars and mummers of her own religion? She had, indeed, a ſettlement of her own: but I heard him reproach her with having diſpoſed of it in ſome ſuch way: but, however that may be, my father muſt have known that it was not in her power to do any thing for me. Of late, too, he muſt have thought that it was not her wiſh, for ſhe has appeared almoſt entirely to have forgotten me."</p>
               <p>"There is, however, no other way of account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the circumſtance: and the more I reflect on it, the more I am perſuaded that this is the truth."</p>
               <p>Roſalie, though far from being convinced by the reaſoning of her brother, was conſoled by his tenderneſs, and by degrees regained her ſerenity, which was, however, again diſturbed by a letter from Montalbert, in which he renewed all the profeſſions he had made on their parting; told her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

She knew that her being left deſtitute of fortune would make no alteration whatever in his affection. The little ſhe would in any caſe have poſſeſſed could never indeed have been any object to him, even if fortune had ever once been in his thoughts. She wrote to him, therefore, of what had happened; and without affecting to deny the partiality ſhe felt for him, and lamenting the little probability of their meeting properly, ſubmitted it to him, whether it would not be more prudent to forbear meeting at all till there was leſs danger of offending her mother. She told him, that of the future deſtination of the family ſhe knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: but that, from what ſhe could learn, her mother had ſome thoughts of taking a ſmall houſe in or near London, when the period arrived, in which ſhe muſt quit their preſent habitation.</p>
               <p>Roſalie now found herſelf for a while relieved from the irkſome importunities of Hughſon, who was obliged to be abſent. Her mother too ſeemed to have relaxed a good deal in the earneſtneſs ſhe had formerly ſhewn on this ſubject: and had not her extreme uncertainty, in regard to Montalbert been a conſtant ſource of anxiety, ſhe would at this period have taſted of more tranquillity than had long fallen to her ſhare.</p>

                  </gap> herſelf into a reſolution of doing this, her natural timidity checked her. She recollected how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial it was to her lover, that their engagements ſhould remain a ſecret: and ſhe was beſides de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred by the fear that her brother would, from education and principle, in all probability, ſtren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly oppoſe her becoming the wife of a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic.</p>
               <p>But naturally ingenious and candid, it was impoſſible for her ſo well to diſſimulate, but that Mr. Leſſington ſaw there was ſomething more on her mind than ſhe ever ventured to expreſs. The impreſſion that his mother had given him of ſome attachment between her and young Vyvian fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently returned to his recollection; though he thought it could be only a childiſh paſſion on the part of Vyvian, who could think no more of it after he left England, he dreaded leaſt the ſpirits and health of Roſalie might ſuffer, as he had ſeen ſo often happen to young women, who had been incautiouſly led to liſten to vows and promiſes that were meant by the men that made them only as the amuſement of an idle hour.</p>
               <p>In his frequent converſations with his ſiſter, therefore, and intermingled with the leſſons he ſometimes gave her, he found opportunities con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually to hint at the weakneſs and danger of attending to ſuch ſort of profeſſions; while, at other times, he took notice, how generally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

their own knowledge. On theſe occaſions, he fixed his eyes on thoſe of Roſalie: and, ſure that he meant more than he expreſſed, her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance betrayed her conſciouſneſs; for whatever her brother ſaid, when he remotely alluded to Vyvian, was equally applicable to Montalbert: and whatever reſolutions ſhe ſometimes made, when ſhe was alone, to avow ingenuouſly the truth, theſe hints entirely deprived her of the courage ſhe had been thus trying to obtain.</p>
               <p>Montalbert, who, by means of a ſervant at Holmwood Houſe, on whoſe fidelity he could depend, continued to write to her and receive her letters, became now impatient to learn where was to be her future reſidence. As this ſeemed ſtill uncertain, he implored leave to come down incog. to the neighbourhood of Holmwood; than which, he ſaid, nothing was more eaſy, as he could be concealed in the houſe of a farmer, a tenant of Mr. Vyvian's, who, being a Catholic, was entirely devoted to his ſervice, and of an integrity on which he could rely. Roſalie, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, extremely alarmed at ſuch a propoſal, urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo many reaſons why it ſhould not be executed, and aſſured him it would make her ſo extremely miſerable, that he, for that time, conſented to relinquiſh it, which was done with leſs reluctance, when ſhe informed him, that within a few days her mother had talked in more poſitive terms of their immediate removal to London, or to its neighbourhood; that her broth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Roſalie was at a loſs to comprehend by what means Montalbert prolonged his ſtay in England ſo much beyond the time, when he told her, his mother expected his return to Naples, where ſhe generally reſided. This ſurpriſed her ſtill more, when ſhe found by part of a letter from Mrs. Vyvian, which Mrs. Leſſington read to her, that Charles Vyvian was already gone. The ſentences of the letter which her mother choſe to communicate ran thus:—</p>
               <p>"I have determined, in order to be near Dr. W—, without reſiding immediately in London, to take an houſe at Hampſtead, and my uphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterer informs me he has found one that anſwers my deſcription. Mr. Vyvian has, in his cold way, aſſented to my engaging it, taking care, however, to let me underſtand, at the ſame time, that he thought my not being well or able to live in London was a mere whim, and that the air of Hampſtead was not at all better than at his houſe in Park Lane, or even ſo good. Till now I did not know that he had taken an houſe in Park Lane, inſtead of that in Brook Street; but, alas! my dear old friend, there are many other reaſons, beſides the difference of the air, that will make me adhere to my intention of going to Hampſtead.

The oldeſt, though not yet ſixteen, her father thinks of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying to a man of high rank, with whom ſhe got acquainted while ſhe was with her father's ſiſter in Yorkſhire. He has not, however, the title to which he is to ſucceed; but his uncle, whoſe heir he is, being old and without children, and having ſome political connection, I know not what, with Mr. Vyvian, it is by them that this union is propoſed: while the mother of the young man, who has an immenſe fortune in her own diſpoſal, has hitherto ſhewn a diſinclination to the match, in the perſuaſion that my daughter is ſtill a Catholic.

And really, conſidering the way in which her family treat her, I really think it is extremely fortunate that her tender heart and weak ſpirits have taken that turn; otherwiſe, to be treated, poor dear woman, as ſhe is, to have ſuch a huſband, and ſuch children, would certainly break her heart."</p>

               <p>In a fortnight afterwards, all their arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments being made, they departed for ever from a part of the country where Mrs. Leſſington had reſided above ſeven and twenty years, or rather from her native country, for ſhe was born not far from Holmwood Houſe.

it is her being ſo nearly related to you, or the memory of her paſt kindneſs, or both, but to me there is an attraction about Mrs. Vyvian that I never was conſcious of in any other perſon. The eminent beauty ſhe once poſſeſſed is gone, and its ruins only remain: but the delicacy, the faded lovelineſs of her whole form, is, perhaps, more intereſting than the moſt animated bloom of youth and health. She had not ſpirits for the firſt two days after her arrival to receive us all. My mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther only was admitted to ſee her. Yeſterday however, my ſiſter and I were allowed to attend her at an early hour of the afternoon. Maria was going to the play with a family who live here, who are diſtantly related to the huſband of one of my ſiſters, and who imagained, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not without reaſon, that to make parties for us to viſit public places is the firſt kindneſs they can ſhew to ſome of the family. Only Maria, however, accepted this invitation: for I had hopes of paſſing the evening with Mrs. Vyvian: a pleaſure I would not have exchanged for the moſt brilliant ſpectacle that London offers.</p>

I hope I ſhall never again ſee this man; for I feel ſuch an antipathy to him that it would really be painful to me. As to the young ladies, I find they are frequently to viſit their mother: but I ſhall avoid them as much as poſſible; for they are ſo much changed ſince we played together as children of the ſame family, that there is no longer any affection probably between us—I ſhall be deſpiſed as the daughter of a country curate; and though, I hope, I am not proud, I do not love to be deſpiſed. . . . . . Ah! Montalbert, it is your partiality that has, perhaps, taught me to feel this ſenſation more than I ought to do.

her as a mother, though only the half ſiſter of your father. The ſweetneſs of her manners, even that weak health, and that air of penſive ſorrow, which her own children, at leaſt her daughters, ſeem to conſider as the effect of bigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try or unſociable humour, make her to me an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of tenderer attention.

               <p>That ſhe was totally deſtitute of fortune gave not a moment's concern to Roſalie.

But, with the eaſy faith of youth, truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the attachment of her lover would ſave her from every diſtreſs, and that before ſhe ſhould be deprived of her ſurviving parent, whoſe life was apparently a very good one, ſhe ſhould be the wife of Montalbert.</p>
               <p>He now ſaw her almoſt every day; for as he had always been very attentive to Mrs. Vyvian, there was nothing remarkable in his frequent viſits to her; nor was it ſtrange that he ſhould renew his ſlight acquaintance with her friends.</p>
               <p>Miſs Leſſington, whoſe acquaintance increaſed every day, had continual invitations to ſtay at the houſes of ſome of them for ſeveral nights together. Roſalie failed not ſometimes to receive the ſame kind of compliments: but ſhe generally declined them, ſaying, that ſhe could not leave her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alone. But, in fact, ſhe had no wiſh to mix in thoſe ſocieties, or to enter into thoſe public amuſements, which gave ſo much pleaſure to her ſiſter. And Maria, apprehenſive of the ſuperior elegance of Roſalie, ſhewed a viſible diſinclination to her joining theſe parties, and gradually diſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>couraged her friends from giving theſe invita<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In a very ſhort time, therefore, the attornies' and brokers' wives, to whom Mr. Blagham had

Miſs Leſſington was left in undiſturbed poſſeſſion of all the admiration the ſet of men that belonged to theſe "worſhipful ſocieties" had to beſtow, and Roſalie at liberty to paſs her time in company much more agreeable to her.</p>
               <p>Her mother, leſs refined, and loving cards ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther too much, was not equally difficult as to her companions; though ſhe had really as much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for Mrs. Vyvian as ſhe was capable of feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for any body, ſhe could not help being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſenſible of a want of variety.

To be continually in preſence of a beloved object, to ſee or ſuppoſe that his attachment every moment becomes ſtronger, to liſten to arguments to which the heart yields but too ready an aſſent, was a ſituation of all others the moſt dangerous for a young woman who had not ſeen her nineteenth year. Montalbert, beſides the advantages of a very handſome perſon, had the moſt inſinuating manners and the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting addreſs. He was naturally eloquent— love rendered his eloquence doubly formidable; and Roſalie had nothing to oppoſe to his earneſt entreaties for a ſecret marriage, but the arms with which he had himſelf furniſhed her—the fear of a diſcovery on the part of his mother, which he owned would injure, indeed ruin, his future proſpects in life.

               <p>But notwithſtanding the frequent opportunities they now had of meeting, and even of paſſing whole hours alone together, how was it poſſible that a private marriage could be effected?—Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalie knew that to eſcape to Scotland, and return without being miſſed, and without avowedly elop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was impoſſible. Montalbert allowed it to be ſo, but he had another expedient ready—they might be married by a Catholic prieſt. Roſalie had heard but in a vague way, that ſuch mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages were not valid: but Montalbert reaſoned her out of this perſuaſion.

By ſuch arguments he ſometimes ſhook the wavering reſolution of Roſalie, who, except the

She had no other perſon to whom ſhe was account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, unleſs it was her elder brother, whom ſhe loved too much to be quite eaſy as to his ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: but, on the other hand, it was in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Every opportunity that occurred, Montalbert preſſed his ſuit with redoubled ardour. He urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with all the vehemence of paſſion, the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of his immediate return to Italy, as he had already on various pretences, prolonged his ſtay two months beyond the time he intended.—There was now danger that his mother might ſuſpect that ſome of thoſe connections, ſhe was ſo averſe to, were the occaſion of his prolonged abſence, and might engage ſome of her friends in England in an inquiry that would be the cauſe of diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what nobody now ſeemed to ſuſpect. This and numberleſs other reaſons Montalbert always had ready to offer, why there was no time to

deliberate. He had already conquered one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle—the difficulty of finding a Catholic prieſt who would venture to perform the ceremony.</p>
               <p>Beſides the conſequence, both in England and in Italy, of his family and his connections, the eaſe with which a diſpenſation might be obtained whenever his mother withdrew her oppoſition, and the pecuniary advantage Montalbert pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, the prieſt, with whom he had at length ſucceeded, knew that Roſalie was the daughter of of a country clergyman<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and had no relations who were at all likely to be diſpleaſed at her marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a man ſo greatly her ſuperior, and of courſe not likely to proceed againſt one who had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He rather wiſhed to detach Montalbert from his purſuit, by repreſenting the great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance between him and Roſalie in temporal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, as well as the difference in ſpiritual affairs, which appeared to him ſo momentous. Finding it, however, very bootleſs to argue with a man of three and twenty, madly in love, he conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do as Montalbert required, and reconciled his conſcience by that accommodating reflection at hand on ſo many occaſions, "If I do not do it ſome other will." He ſtipulated with Montal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert, however, that if there ſhould be any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of his incurring the heavy penalty for marrying a minor, that he ſhould be immediately ſent to Rome at the expence of Montalbert; an expedient which Montalbert immediately agreed to, as indeed he would have done to any demands the father thought proper to have made, however unreaſonable they might have been.</p>

But he heard this requeſt always with impatience, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring, that if ſhe determined to tear herſelf from him, to abandon him to all the horrors of that deſpair which her loſs would inflict, ſhe could find no way more certain than what ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Roſalie, terrified at the ſtep ſhe was about to take, again recoiled, and intreated to be releaſed from her inconſiderate promiſe.</p>
               <p>Though the attachment between theſe young people ſeemed not even to be ſuſpected either by Mrs. Vyvian or Mrs. Leſſington, yet the conflict in the mind of Roſalie had ſuch an effect on her frame, that the former one day obſerved it to her as they were ſitting together alone.

She heſitated: and the conſcience of Roſalie at that moment accuſing her, a faint bluſh overſpread her countenance as ſhe eagerly cried, "Afraid my dear Madam, of what?"</p>
               <p>"Nay, of nothing, Roſalie, that need alarm you. I will tell you my fears—either you have ſome affection that makes you uneaſy; or the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt total ſecluſion in which you live is too much for your ſpirits."</p>

               <p>WHAT had paſſed the preceding evening be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Mrs. Vyvian and Roſalie was no ſooner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated to Montalbert, than it ſerved as an additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal argument to enforce the conſent he had been ſo long ſoliciting. Montalbert was of a warm and impetuous temper. Though he had never yet been emancipated from the government of an high-ſpirited and imperious mother, he was not the leſs bent on pleaſing himſelf, than are thoſe who have never been contradicted. It ſeemed, indeed, as if the ſevere reſtraint he had ſo long habitually been under, diſpoſed him to be more earneſt in a circumſtance on which the whole happineſs of his life depended: and when Roſalie aſked him how he could hope ever to reconcile his mother to a marriage, to which he hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

with his choice. "I will certainly not make my mother uneaſy." ſaid he. "I will ſo far pay a compliment to her unfortunate prejudices, as to conceal from her what would make her ſo. But to relinquiſh the only woman I could ever love, is ſurely a greater ſacrifice than ſhe ought to demand of me. If, indeed, I were about to diſgrace her, Roſalie, by uniting myſelf with a woman without reputation, or of a very mean and unworthy origin, I ſhould feel that I ought not to be forgiven. But why, becauſe our modes of worſhipping God are different—why, becauſe my mother was born in Italy, and you in England, ſhould an imaginary barrier be raiſed, which muſt ſhut me out from happineſs for ever? What has reaſon and common ſenſe to do with all this?"—Roſalie was compelled to acknowledge that it had very little. Still, however, the idea of a clandeſtine marriage ſhocked her. She ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited moſt earneſtly that her mother might be made acquainted with it. This he ſtrenuouſly oppoſed; repreſenting, that if Mrs. Leſſington knew it, it would not be a ſecret from Mrs. Vyvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, "Who, however, ſhe may love you," ſaid he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

You know, Roſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, how much I love my aunt.

But with great virtues, and I know hardly any one who has ſo many, ſhe is not without prejudices, which greatly add to her own unhappineſs. It is unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to point out to you what theſe are; nor need I tell you, Roſalie, that they are exactly ſuch as would induce her to think it her indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible duty to inform my mother of our attachment.

               <p>During the ſtay Montalbert made at her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's ſeat in the north, Miſs Vyvian had been piqued at the little attention he had ſhewn her, and mortified to obſerve his neglect of thoſe charms, which <hi>she</hi> thought, and which her maid aſſured her, ought to attract the homage of all the world.

               <p>Mrs. Vyvian, however, hurt at ſuch a wild and improper ſpeech, had not time to expreſs, as much as ſhe dared do, her ſenſe of its indeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, before ſhe was ſtruck with the pale counten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Roſalie, who ſeemed ready to fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Montalbert was about to reply, when Mrs. Vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian, as if unable to check herſelf, roſe from her ſeat, and taking Roſalie's hand, ſaid, in a tremu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous voice, "I am ſorry, my dear Miſs Leſſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, that you are ſo ſhocked at the unkindneſs and rudeneſs of Miſs Vyvian; I will take care that you ſhall not again be ſubject to it. My woman ſhall wait on you home, and I beg you and your mother will accept my apology, thus haſtily made, till I can renew it in perſon."</p>
               <p>Roſalie, who had never ſeen Mrs. Vyvian ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert ſo much ſpirit before, but who was more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified than ever, leſt the retort of her daughter ſhould bring on a quarrel of which ſhe would be the cauſe; alarmed too at the hint given about Montalbert, and almoſt ſinking under her appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of every kind, was glad to quit the room, which ſhe did immediately; but, diſabled by the violence of her emotions to go farther than the next, ſhe ſat down and burſt into tears.</p>

               <p>Miſs Barbara now fancied it neceſſary for her to enter into a defence of her ſiſter. "I am ſure, Madam, my ſiſter meant nothing; but one muſt really feel it grating to find that Miſs, that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try parſon's daughter, preferred to us.

               <p>"It is you and your ſiſter Barbara, ſaid the unhappy mother, while ſobs ſtifled her voice, who have eſtranged yourſelves from me; it is you and your ſiſter. . . . . . . ." She could not go on. Montalbert, ſhocked by the ſight of her diſtreſs, approached her, and, tenderly taking her hand, ſaid, "Deareſt Madam, do not, I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The agony of Mrs. Vyvian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled. "Nay, but I intreat you," continued he, "to be calm. Allow me to ſend your wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to you."</p>
               <p>"O no!" cried ſhe, with a deep ſigh, "do not leave me, Montalbert. I have in you all the conſolation which is left me, now that my ſon is ſent far from me."</p>

               <p>It ſeemed as if the unfortunate mother was utterly incapable of anſwering. She repeated in a faint voice, "The Abbe Hayward!—My ſon— My ſon at Holmwood!"—Her daughters, who appeared thus to have plunged a dagger in her heart, left her without any attempt to mitigate the pain they had inflicted; and ſhe remained alone with Montalbert, who, during this conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, had exhibited ſymptoms of anger and diſquiet, which Mrs. Vyvian was too much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to obſerve. It was ſome moments before ſhe recovered herſelf enough to command her voice. "Tell me, dear Montalbert," cried ſhe at length, "what does Miſs Vyvian mean?— Tell me, when was my Charles at Holmwood? —When did he thus viſit Mr. Leſſington's family?"</p>
               <p>"Never, Madam, I can venture to aſſure you, with the leaſt improper deſign. . . .

next day: for ſome reaſon or other, he did not ſeem to wiſh you and his father ſhould know he had viſited Holmwood. This I only know by his enjoining the Count to ſecrecy, when being obliged to return to London, he left us there."</p>
               <p>"You ſtaid there then ſome time?"</p>
               <p>"I cannot be correct," anſwered Montalbert, heſitating; "our ſtay, whether there or elſewhere, ſeemed to me to be a matter of no conſequence at the time—nor could I imagine why it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to keep a man's viſit to the ſeat of his father a ſecret. As near as I can recollect, we were there about ſeven or eight days."</p>
               <p>"Seven or eight days!" repeated Mrs. Vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian; "and did Charles paſs ſo much time at the houſe of Mr. Leſſington?"</p>
               <p>"Indeed he did not. I believe I may venture to aſſure you, he never was there but when I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied him.

               <p>A little ſoothed by theſe aſſurances, Mrs. Vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian became more calm; and at that moment ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Abbe Hayward coming up the garden, of which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="128" facs="unknown:029524_0130_0FE1D4AEAAE66430"/>Their conference was long and ſerious. Mr. Hayward aſſured Montalbert, that he would quiet the ſpirits of Mrs. Vyvian relative to the ſuppoſed viſits of her ſon at Barlton Brooks; and recommended it to Montalbert very earneſtly to conceal, as far as was now poſſible, the diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able dialogue which had paſſed that morning. "You know Mr. Vyvian," ſaid he, "and how violent and unfeeling he is. . . . . . . There is no knowing what rudeneſs and reproaches he may throw on that excellent lady, if this family diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute goes to any length. . . . . . .I tremble for her peace."—The council this good man gave was perfectly reaſonable. Montalbert felt that it was ſo; yet there was ſomething in his manner, when he ſpoke of the Leſſington family, which gave Montalbert an idea of ſome myſtery that he could not comprehend. He returned, however, no more to the houſe, but haſtened to find Roſalie at that of her mother.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Leſſington had gone to London early in the morning, was to go to a play that night, and to an opera the next, a ſpectacle which ſhe had not ſeen for many years, and about which ſhe had expreſſed as much eagerneſs as a girl. It was in hopes of making his advantage of this abſence, that Montalbert had met Roſalie at Mrs. Vyvian's in the morning. Roſalie, dreading importunity which ſhe had no longer reſolution to contend with, had taken ſhelter there. Mrs. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>There now ſeemed no alternative between re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning Montalbert for ever, depriving him of his inheritance by a diſcovery, or conſenting to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice her own ſcruples.

There was, in fact, neither difficulty nor danger of detection in this arrangement. The country ſervants of Mrs. Leſſington, a maid and a boy, took every thing that was told them for granted. The ceremony was ſoon over; and a teſtimony of its performance being given to Roſalie, the prieſt departed for London with the friend of Montalbert, while he himſelf went to Mrs. Vyvian's, where he intended to dine, and where he hoped his aunt would, without any ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitation, ſend for Roſalie. In this, however, he was miſtaken. He found Mrs. Vyvian ſo much affected by the ſcene of the day before, that ſhe was confined to her bed. She admitted him to her bed ſide: and he was ſhocked to ſee the havoc which even a few hours acute uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs had made in her enfeebled frame.

               <p>It was but too certain, however, that he had that morning received the moſt poſitive commands from his mother to ſet out immediately, mingled with ſome ſevere reproaches for his having delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his journey, from time to time, ſo much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond that which he had originally fixed for his ſtay.

As he could not retreat without being ſeen, and his
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:029524_0136_0FE1D4BF083EA820"/>
uneaſy curioſity was excited by this unexpected and unwelcome return, he advanced towards Mrs. Leſſington, and was beginning a ſpeech about Mrs. Vyvian, whoſe name he meant to uſe as an excuſe for his calling; but, without ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to attend, ſhe began to apologize for not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in her power to aſk him in, being, ſhe ſaid, in great alarm on account of her daughter.</p>
               <p>"What daughter?—and oh! for Heaven's ſake, what is the matter?"—were words that were on the point of iſſuing from Montalbert's lips, who thought only of Roſalie: when this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcretion on his part was prevented by Mrs. Leſſington's proceeding to tell him, that her eldeſt married daughter, who was near her time, had ſuffered from being overturned in a cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talbert, alarmed leſt Roſalie was going too, troubled ſo much, that he had not courage to aſk but to leave the houſe without knowing was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible.

<pb n="135" facs="unknown:029524_0137_0FE1D4C5D35D8500"/>
for their journey; for amidſt her maternal anxiety for her daughter, the elder lady was by no means indifferent to the appearance ſhe was to make among her former country neighbours and though ſhe was ſtill in deep mourning, ſhe obſerved that it was not the leſs neceſſary to be "tolerably dreſſed."</p>
               <p>Miſs Maria was of courſe more ſolicitous on this important matter than her mother: and in the midſt of their giving orders to one to run to the mantua-makers, and another to fetch home a new bonnet, &amp;c. &amp;c. they neither of them ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to recollect that it was neceſſary to make ſome arrangement about Roſalie, or even to remember that ſhe was in the houſe.</p>
               <p>She remained, therefore, a few moments in the parlour with Montalbert, who, advancing trembling to her, inquired eagerly if ſhe alſo was going? "I think not," anſwered ſhe. "But my mother in her hurry, ſeems totally to have forgotten me."—"I pray Heaven," ſaid he, "that you may be left behind! If you go, I ſhall be diſtracted. When will it be decided? —How can I know?"</p>
               <p>"I had better go up to my mother," anſwered Roſalie, "offer to aſſiſt her, and aſk for her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands."—"O haſten," cried Montalbert, "my angel, or I ſhall die with impatience!—I <hi>must</hi> ſtay till I know what is to be your deſtination, and will make ſome pretence for my intruſion." Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalie then went up to her mother, who ſeemed to be awakened, by her preſence, to ſome ſenſe of recollection as to what was to become of her

youngeſt daughter during her abſenſe. "I don't know, child." ſaid ſhe, "how to take you with us very well, as your brother Blagham is in town for two days on law buſineſs, and is deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of going down with us in a poſt chaiſe."— Roſalie's heart beat ſo, that ſhe could hardly breathe.</p>
               <p>"I declare," continued her mother, "I know not how to manage about you. To be ſure it will be but a diſagreeable journey<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I ſuppoſe my dear you do not want to go?"</p>
               <p>"If I could be of any uſe to my ſiſter," ſaid Roſalie, heſitating.</p>
               <p>"Oh! as to <hi>that,</hi>" anſwered Mrs. Leſſington, "there is no <hi>occasion</hi> to be ſure; but it will be lonely for you at home, unleſs, indeed, Mrs. Vyvian would be ſo good as to take you."</p>
               <p>Roſalie knew, from the ſcene of the preceding morning, that Mrs. Vyvian could not, without expoſing herſelf anew to the inſults of her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which was painful even to think of.</p>
               <p>This, however, ſhe could not now explain to her mother, who, after a moment's heſitation, proceeded. . . . . ."I have a mind to ſend to Mrs. Vyvian; yet I don't know—perhaps it will be inconvenient to her. There are times when I know it would be painful to her to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany;—but—let me—ſee—I dare ſay my friends the Hillmores would take you for a few days, and then you might come back; and Mrs. Vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian would, perhaps, nay I am ſure ſhe would, have you with her as much as her ſpirits will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and by that time—moſt probably, you know we ſhould be come back."</p>

                  <pb n="137" facs="unknown:029524_0139_0FE1D4C94FAB7598"/>Though Roſalie knew the Hillmores were the moſt diſagreeable people in the world, ſhe had neither courage to object, nor preſence of mind to propoſe any other plan. She thought ſhe ſaw in her mother's manner an evident wiſh to get her off her hands, on the preſent occaſion, without much ſolicitude as to the propriety of her ſituation during her abſence: and at that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhe felt happy in the conſciouſneſs of being the wife of Montalbert, who would, in every event, defend and protect her.</p>
               <p>She remained ſilent, however: and Mrs. Leſſington, who was ſtill buſily engaged in pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, at length turned to her, and ſaid, "Well, child! and what do you ſay to the plan of paſſing the little time we ſhall be away between Mrs. Vyvian and Mr. Hillmore's?"</p>
               <p>"I know very little of Mr. Hillmore's family," ſaid Roſalie timidly; "but I dare ſay, Madam, you are ſure they would be kind enough to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>"Do go down and ſee: no—I will go myſelf." She then deſcended to the room where Montal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert ſtill remained, who, when he heard the commiſſion ſhe gave him to his aunt, accepted it

with tranſport he could with difficulty diſguiſe. "I only waited here," ſaid he, "to know if I could be of any uſe to you in your preſent hurry; and you cannot oblige me more than in employing me." He then haſtened to Mrs. Vyvian, to whom he delivered a meſſage rather ſuited to his own purpoſes than very exact as to correctneſs; and modulating Mrs. Vyvian's anſwer in the ſame way, he returned inſtantly to Mrs. Leſſington, who, concluding the diſpoſal of Roſalie ſettled her own way, told her ſhe would have a note for her friends, the Hillmores, which ſhe haſtily wrote, and then directed Roſalie to ſtay a few hours af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her to adjuſt the houſe and put every thing away, which her preſent hurry did not allow her to attend to. After which a hackney-coach was to convey Roſalie to Mincing Lane, where Mr. Hillmore lived, and ſhe was herſelf to deliver the note that was to ſecure her reception for the firſt three or four days of her mother's abſence: after which, if that abſence continued, ſhe was to return and remain under the protection of Mrs. Vyvian.</p>
               <p>This arrangement was ſo exactly calculated to anſwer all the wiſhes of Montalbert, that he now trembled with apprehenſion leſt it ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked. He would not, however, venture to ſtay, leſt Mrs. Leſſington ſhould entertain any ſuſpicions of the cauſe of his extraordinary zeal. He therefore wiſhed her a good journey, and left her. Soon after which Roſalie ſaw her mother and ſiſter get into a poſt-chaiſe, which was order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſtop to take up Mr Blagham at the houſe of

The hackney-coach, therefore, that was to have conveyed her to Mincing Lane, and in which ſhe did not ſet out till towards evening<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> went no further than to the ſuburbs of London, where Montalbert waited for her with another, from whence they got into a poſt-chaiſe, and were ſoon at a diſtance from London.</p>

Her repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations were ſo forcible, and he felt them to be ſo juſt, that his reluctance at length gave way to the conſideration of his wife's tranquility: and
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:029524_0142_0FE1D4D259A450D8"/>
he conſented to her return to town, whether he conducted her, and putting her into a coach, followed it at a diſtance on foot, till it ſet her down at the houſe of her mother's friends.</p>

While this went on, he lived in a miſerable ſtate of reſtraint, never ſeeing his wife but for a ſhort time in the preſence of Mrs. Vyvian, unleſs ſhe happened to be there of an evening, in which caſe he went home with her, but attended by a ſervant, under petenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The laſt interview he could obtain with his wife was ſhort and hazardous. Neither of them could ſay farewel; and when he was gone, and Roſalie knew ſhe ſhould ſee him no more, ſhe felt ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, that, apprehenſive of the remarks that might be made, ſhe retired to her bed under pretence of a violent head ach, though the pain ſhe felt was in her heart.</p>
               <p>This pretence could not, however, be long continued: and Roſalie returned, though reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantly, to the common buſineſs of life, while Montalbert, ſcarcely knowing what he did, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued his way to the ſea coaſt from whence he was to embark for France, meaning to paſs through that country to Italy. But the greater the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance became between him and the object of his love, the leſs ſupportable it became. A thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times he was tempted to return, and rather hazard every future conſequence than ſubject himſelf to the preſent miſery of a ſeparation ſo painful. Arrived at the borders of the ſea, this diſtracting irreſolution redoubled. It was yet in his power to return to all he held dear on earth— a few leagues of land only were between them, but ſoon immenſe worlds of water would divide them: and he was conſcious, that the ſingle cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance

of its being out of his power to return when he would, muſt increaſe all the impatience he now felt. Yet his reaſon told him, that his temporary abſence ought to be undergone, ſince it might ſecure the repoſe hereafter of the woman he loved.</p>
               <p>As it was now a time when multitudes of Engliſh, who had long been prevented by the war from viſiting the continent, were haſtening to France, Montalbert was not many hours waiting for a wind, before he met ſome of his acquaintance, from whom it was impoſſible for him to eſcape.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>apſing into his former deſpondence, he wandered along the French coaſt, looking with aching eyes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards England, and again tempted to return to it. —At length, however, after two days indulgence of this weakneſs, for ſuch he owned it was, he once more reaſoned himſelf into a reſolution to proceed, and though with an heart which became more heavy every league, he haſtened towards Naples, making no ſtay at Paris, or any other town through which his route lay.</p>
               <p>While he was thus obeying the imperious dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of duty, Roſalie, concealing the wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her heart, endeavoured to paſs the time of this cruel abſence in perfecting herſelf in thoſe branches of knowledge moſt agreeable to him. But very unpleaſant were the many hours ſhe was obliged to paſs among people who had no ideas in common with her, who were engaged in other purſuits, and who ſeemed to conſider her, what indeed ſhe really was, a being of quite another ſpecies, who, in being among them, was evidently diſplaced.</p>
               <p>The only time ſhe paſſed with any degree of ſatisfaction, was that when ſhe was admitted to ſit with Mrs. Vyvian, and to converſe with the Abbe Hayward.—Miſs Vyvian was now married and gone, accompanied by her father and ſiſter, to the ſeat of her huſband's family in great parade. Her mother, of whom ſhe had taken a cold leave, ſunk into deeper dejection than ever
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:029524_0153_0FE1D5368DDD1E38"/>
not that ſhe felt as a misfortune this more certain ſeparation from a daughter, who had long ceaſed to return her maternal tenderneſs; but it ſeemed as if her frame could no longer reſiſt the ſorrow inflicted upon her by the abſence of a ſon ſhe adored, aggravated by the ingratitude of his ſiſters.</p>
               <p>Roſalie appeared to be more dear to her than ever, and there was now no impediment to their being often together. But Mrs. Vyvian, whoſe health viſibly declined, was not always well en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough to leave her bed, or to be amuſed with Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalie's endeavours to relieve her long hours of ſolitude by reading or muſic. When ſhe was able, however, to ſit up, the duties of her religion, which ſhe fulfilled with the moſt ſcrupulous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs, alone detained her from the ſociety of Roſalie. Whatever might be the dejection of Mrs. Vyvian's mind, her penetration was not blunted: and ſhe ſaw that ſomething unuſual preſſed upon the ſpirits of her young friend: again then ſhe ſpoke to her of what ſhe apprehended— "you are certainly not well, Roſalie," ſaid Mrs. Vyvian, as they were ſitting alone together, "<hi>or</hi> you are unhappy?"—"I am well, indeed, my dear Madam," ſhe replied; "as to being unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, I am not particularly ſo. I own to you, that the continual round of company in which my mother is engaged, is far from adding to the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs of my life; and ſometimes I languiſh for an abode in my native country, as ſolitary as our parſonage under the ſouthern hills."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="152" facs="unknown:029524_0154_0FE1D4EE0D6BE9C0"/>"There is more in it than that, dear girl," ſaid Mrs. Vyvian, with a look that expreſſed her incredulity.</p>
               <p>"You would not ſurely wonder if there were," anſwered Roſalie. "I have often wondered at my own inconſequence in not being more depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, when I recollect, that, whenever I loſe my mother, I ſhall become a friendleſs and deſtitute orphan."</p>
               <p>"Not, if I live," ſaid Mrs. Vyvian. Then, pauſing a moment, ſhe added, in a ſlow and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn voice—"for, as I think, my early indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to my daughters, or rather to myſelf, in having you ſo much at Holmwood during your infancy, has perhaps been the means of ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you from your family, I conſider it as my duty to make you what little amends I can. Much, alas! is not in my power, for the unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentional injury I have done you."</p>
               <p>The tears roſe in the eyes of Roſalie as Mrs. Vyvian concluded this ſentence. "O no deareſt Madam," anſwered ſhe—"your kindneſs to me, never, never, injured me: ſo far otherwiſe, that I think I ſhould, <hi>but</hi> for that kindneſs, have been the moſt unhappy creature in the world. At leaſt I know that the only moments for which I would wiſh to live are thoſe when you permit me to be with you."</p>
               <p>"And therefore it is, my love, that I think I have injured you. Your mother, your ſiſters, are happy among acquaintance and parties of their own, from which you fly with diſguſt: nor is this
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:029524_0155_0FE1D53827D62E60"/>
all—I am ſenſible that you have refuſed a very advantageous match from the ſame prepoſſeſſion."</p>
               <p>"I aſſure you, my dear Mrs. Vyvian, that, as far as I am able to judge, I ſhould have refuſed Mr. Hughſon, though I had never enjoyed the advantages of being admitted to Holmwood. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, had I been in the moſt humble condition of life, I am ſure I ſhould have preferred remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it, and even embracing the hardeſt labour, to giving my perſon to a man from whom my heart recoiled."</p>
               <p>A deep and long-drawn ſigh, as if ſome painful recollections had ariſen at that moment, half interrupted the anſwer of Mrs. Vyvian, who ſaid, "You are certainly right in the ſentiment, Roſalie: but it is ſometimes not in the power of young women to reſiſt parental authority. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, admitting that a man, leſs diſagreeable than you repreſent this Hughſon to have b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The eyes of Mrs. Vyvian, which, though <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Roſalie, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to be ſteadily at work, looked up, and met theſe penetrating eyes. A deep bluſh ſuffuſed her cheeks; ſhe was conſcious of it, and became more confuſed. Yet, making an effort to recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect herſelf, and to ſpeak with compoſure, ſhe ſaid, "O nothing is ſo—ſo very unlikely, as that <hi>any</hi> man ſhould have a preference for me!—I
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:029524_0156_0FE1D4EFACBA39D0"/>
never thought whether I ſhould refuſe any other offer or no: becauſe it is ſo improbable, that it is hardly worth while to ſuppoſe about it."</p>
               <p>"Not ſo improbable as you affect to imagine, Roſalie; but you are not ſincere. I do not wiſh my dear, to diſtreſs you; and we will drop the diſcourſe at this time. But another day, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, I may talk to you further; for I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing very ſerious to ſay to you: and I think, Roſalie, you will not deceive me, ſince it may be very material to us both."</p>
               <p>More and more confuſed, and not doubting but that by ſome means or other Mrs. Vyvian had diſcovered her marriage, ſhe was too much agitated to allow herſelf to conſider, whether, if this were really the caſe, it was likely Mrs. Vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian ſhould ſpeak as ſhe had done. But trembling and breathleſs ſhe haſtened to put her work into the work-baſket, and, affecting to underſtand what her friend had laſt ſaid as an hint to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, ſhe ſmiled, and replying that ſhe was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways happy to anſwer any queſtions from her, and that ſhe hoped always to be ingenuous with ſo good a friend, ſhe haſtened away, which Mrs. Vyvian did not oppoſe.</p>

               <p>THE night that followed this converſation was the moſt uneaſy Roſalie had ever yet known. From what had paſſed ſhe could not doubt but that Mrs. Vyvian knew of her marriage. Yet it was incomprehenſible if ſhe did, that ſhe ſhould have expreſſed ſo little anger or diſapprobation: yet what elſe but her knowing of the mutual at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment between her nephew and her protegee could have urged her to ſpeak as ſhe did?</p>
               <p>The various conjectures that agitated the mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Conſcious that ſhe merited the loſs of Mrs. Vyvian's good opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that the longer this myſtery was contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued on her part, the more unpardonable it would appear, ſhe endeavoured to reaſon herſelf into a reſolution of unboſoming herſelf to Mrs. Vyvian, and rather enduring her reproaches for precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy and indiſcretion, than ſuffer the miſery of living in continual dread of being detected in a falſehood. The moſt probable conjecture ſhe could form, was, that Mrs. Vyvian knew the
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:029524_0158_0FE1D4F50135B910"/>
truth, and had held the converſation ſhe had heard the preceding evening to give Roſalie an opportunity of declaring what was already known. This ſuppoſition ſtrengthened her wavering re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves: and ſhe aroſe in the morning, believing ſhe had force of mind enough to diſcloſe the ſecret that weighed upon her mind. But when a note came from Mrs. Vyvian requeſting to ſee her as ſoon as ſhe had breakfaſted, her courage at once forſook her, and hardly could ſhe find ſtrength to obey the ſummons.</p>
               <p>On her arrival, however at the houſe of Mrs. Vyvian, ſhe found nothing remarkable in the manner or looks of her friend, who ſeemed as to her health to ſuffer leſs than uſual. Roſalie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, as ſhe had been accuſtomed to do, if ſhe ſhould fetch a book. Mrs. Vyvian anſwered no; and bid her take her work.</p>
               <p>For ſome time the converſation ran on indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent topics. At length, contriving to bring it without abruptneſs to the point ſhe w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>"I am not my own miſtreſs, you know, my dear Madam," ſaid Roſalie, ſpeaking this equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, for it could not be called a falſehood, in ſo low a voice as hardly to be heard.</p>
               <p>"That is true," anſwered Mrs. Vyvian; "but I think, indeed I am <hi>sure,</hi> your <hi>friends</hi> would not diſapprove the propoſal in queſtion—indeed there can be but one objection to it, which I think would not have much weight; the gentleman is a Catholic."</p>
               <p>"A Catholic!" repeated Roſalie faintly.</p>
               <p>"You are ſurpriſed, I ſee; but you know, Roſalie, there <hi>are</hi> conſiderations that may influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence perſons to overlook this difference of opinion.

               <p>The firſt attempt Roſalie made to anſwer this queſtion failed; ſhe was unable to articulate a ſyllable. Collecting, however, all her reſolution, ſhe at laſt found courage to ſay, "I am very ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, Madam, that I ought to feel extremely grateful for the notice of any man of whom you have a good opinion;—but—my dear, dear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

"I cannot any longer conceal the truth from you —<hi>I am already</hi> married."</p>
               <p>"Already married!" exclaimed Mrs. Vyvian with a tone and look of amazement;—"Already married!—Merciful Heaven! and to whom?"</p>
               <p>"Can I hope, deareſt and beſt of women, to be forgiven, when I tell you—O no!—I dare not —you will reproach me, perhaps deteſt me, and caſt me off for ever."</p>
               <p>"Speak," ſaid Mrs. Vyvian, trembling as much as the unhappy girl—ſpeak". . . . . . She had her ſalts in her hand; and her eyes were eagerly fixed on the face of Roſalie, who was compelled to ſupport herſelf by holding the table.</p>
               <p>"Since you have juſt ſaid, Madam, that a Catholic might, in your opinion, make ſuch an alliance.". . . . . .</p>
               <p>"A Catholic!" cried Mrs. Vyvian, ſtill more faintly.</p>
               <p>"I might hope, perhaps," continued Roſalie, "to be forgiven for every thing, but the preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of becoming part of your family—of marrying a very near relation of your own."</p>
               <p>Roſalie might have continued her confeſſion without interruption another hour. Mrs. Vyvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an heard no more, but ſunk back in her chair to all appearance lifeleſs.</p>
               <p>In an agony of terror, to which no words can do juſtice, Roſalie flew towards her, then to the bell, which ſhe rang with violence: and when her ſervants came, ſhe aſſiſted in carrying Mrs. Vyvian to her room, though ſhe was herſelf <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

ſaid ſhe,—"I ſhall never be forgiven. . . . . No, I ſee that my more than mother cannot, will not, forgive me.—O Montalbert! why are you not here to plead with me for pardon?—What will become of your unhappy Roſalie, if her firſt, her beſt friend abandons and abhors her, while you are far far off, and unable to protect her from the inſults of the reſt of the world?"</p>
               <p>While Roſalie was making this mournful mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologue on one ſide of the bed, the applications uſed by Mrs. Vyvian's woman were ſo ſucceſsful, that ſhe opened her eyes; but, turning them on Roſalie, ſhe ſeemed ſhocked by the ſight of her, and without ſpeaking, waved her hand that ſhe might leave her.</p>
               <p>This was too much. Roſalie, regardleſs of the preſence of the ſervant, threw herſelf upon her knees by the bed ſide, and attempted to take Mrs. Vyvian's hand—ſhe ſnatched it from her with abhorrence, and, ſpeaking with great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, ſaid, "Wretched, moſt wretched girl— if you would not ſee me die before your face— go—I conjure you go."</p>
               <p>"Hear me but for one moment; let Hallam leave the room while I ſpeak to you for the laſt time, if it muſt be ſo."</p>
               <p>The maid, who underſtood nothing of all this, and who felt no curioſity to know what it meant, reſtrained by ſome degree of terror, retired with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being bid; and Roſalie again moſt earneſtly imploring for pity and pardon, Mrs. Vyvian, in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>"You are my daughter," ſaid Mrs. Vyvian, the unhappy child of an unfortunate man, whoſe very name I never ſuffer to eſcape my lips."</p>
               <p>This confirmed Roſalie in the apprehenſions that her mind was deranged; but, heart ſtruck with horror, ſhe could not ſpeak. Mrs. Vyvian, after a ſhort pauſe, proceeded—</p>

               <p>"Yes, Roſalie," ſaid ſhe, "you are my child —I am not mad—I am only miſerable—yet not ſo very miſerable as I thought I was. Oh! why have ſo many cruel people been endeavouring to embitter the ſad hours of my unhappy life, by repeating to me continually that Vyvian was ſo ſtrongly attached to you, that neither reaſon nor abſence could cure him of his paſſion.

But not knowing what to ſay that ſhould expreſs the mingled emotions ſhe felt, ſhe remained ſilent, ſtill holding the hand of Mrs. Vyvian, who ſeemed to be collecting ſome of the preſence of mind her late terrors had ſo entirely diſſipated.</p>
               <p>The pauſe had ſomething of horror in it. Roſalie watched her countenance with a fearful and anxious eye, ſtill aſſailed by the idea of ſome temporary derangement of intellect: For how could ſhe, whoſe parents were never even doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, be the daughter of Mrs. Vyvian?—The whole ſcene appeared to be a dream: and, during this ſilence, Roſalie apprehended that ſhe ſhould again ſee her relapſe into phrenzy. Till theſe fears gradually ſubſided, as Mrs. Vyvian began with ſome degree of calmneſs to inquire into the particulars of the marriage; it was legally and properly celebrated according to all her ideas.</p>
               <p>"But tell me," added ſhe, when this inquiry was at an end—"was Montalbert ingenuous with you?—Did he tell you that he depends for every thing but a bare ſubſiſtence, on the bounty of his mother?—Did he tell you, that mother has prejudices the moſt unconquerable againſt the natives and the eſtabliſhed religion of England? . . . . . . . Ah! my poor dear girl, the ſame ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart that deſtroyed <hi>me,</hi> has been, I fear, moſt dangerous to you.

Let it ſuffice, my deareſt love, for the preſent, to tell you, that there are the moſt material reaſons why you ſhould conceal, even from Mrs. Leſſington, this unexpected explanation between us. Let her not know, I conjure you, what has happened. But let her, at leaſt for a while, ſuppoſe the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret known only to her and to me.

which Mrs. Vyvian now ſpoke, obeyed her as well as ſhe could; but, as ſhe kiſſed her hand, and would have bade her adieu, the new ſenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhe felt, while ſhe conſidered as her mother the friend whom ſhe had always ſo tenderly loved, quite overcame her ſpirits, and her tears blinded her. Mrs. Vyvian, yielding for a moment to the tenderneſs ſhe had for ſo many years ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, claſped her daughter fondly to her boſom, and, for almoſt the firſt time in her life, called her by the dear name of her child. There was ſome danger that they would both have indulged too long in theſe effuſions of natural affection, but a rap at the chamber-door compelled them haſtily to recover themſelves. It was a meſſage from the venerable Mr. Hayward, who, return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from his morning walk, had heard of Mrs. Vyvian's being greatly indiſpoſed, and now ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited leave to enquire after her. Roſalie, therefore, who knew that for every wound of the mind Mrs. Vyvian found a reſource in the ſpiritual conſolation offered her by this excellent man, haſtened to follow her wiſhes as to leaving her; &amp; remaining only a few moments in another room to recover herſelf yet a little more, ſhe left the houſe of her real, and returned to that of her ſuppoſed mother.</p>
               <p>Nothing could be leſs in harmony with her feelings than the groupe ſhe found aſſembled there. A large party from the city, ſome of whom were entirely unknown to her, had been on a jaunt of pleaſure to a village about ten miles diſtant and, on their way back to London, had been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:029524_0167_0FE1D54E0CB9F328"/>
by Miſs Leſſington, who was one of the company, to dine and paſs the reſt of the day at her mother's houſe at Hampſtead.</p>
               <p>Some of the gentlemen, who ſeemed to be of that rank of beings who are called "<hi>City Bucks —Young Men of Spirit—Fine Flashy Fellows</hi>" —were, in Roſalie's opinion, the rudeſt and moſt inſupportable ſet ſhe had ever ſeen. Agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted almoſt beyond endurance, as her ſpirits were, ſhe was yet under the mortifying neceſſity of remaining for ſome time in this company, which did not ſeparate till one of the men propoſed finiſhing their pleaſurable party by a jaunt to Ranelagh. It was now early ſpring, and it was not without difficulty that ſhe was at length al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to decline going, and ſaw Miſs Leſſington and this groupe of good folks, ſo perfectly content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with themſelves, depart without her.</p>
               <p>She was then left alone with her ſuppoſed mother; but to conceal from her the perturbation of her mind was by no means difficult. Mrs. Leſſington, whoſe new manner of life was much more pleaſing to her than that ſhe had lived in, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the ſtrange diſcovery of the day. To find herſelf the daughter of Mrs. Vyvian, though of her father ſhe was yet ignorant, ſeemed to be knowledge more flattering, more elevating than any event that could be imagined.—She was now ready to account for a thouſand things which had before ſeemed extraordinary. The little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection Mr. Leſſington had ever ſhewn for her; his leaving her name entirely out of his will; the indifference of Mrs. Leſſington, who ſometimes, and particularly lately, had ſeemed to forget her aſſumed character of mother, and to expreſs only what ſhe felt, the cold civility of a common ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance; the want of even the ſlighteſt family reſemblance between her and the other children of the family, and innumerable other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which crowded together upon her recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection. But if on one hand ſhe now ſaw only ſtrangers among thoſe whom ſhe had hitherto conſidered as her neareſt relations, ſhe beheld in Mrs. Vyvian a mother whom her heart bounded to acknowledge. To be her daughter, to be with her knowledge the wife of Montalbert, left her hardly any thing to wiſh but that the hour was come when ſhe might <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>ROSALIE now ſaw the beloved parent, whom ſhe yet dared not own, every day. And the diſcovery of her marriage with Montalbert, which ſhe had ſo much dreaded, had been the means of procuring her the knowledge of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> indulged all the tenderneſs of her heart. The eldeſt Miſs Vyvian, now Mrs. Boſworth, was ſtill at the family ſeat of her huſband with her ſiſter, and her father was gone into the north du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the receſs of parliament. No impediment, therefore, exiſted at preſent againſt Roſalie's paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing almoſt all her time with Mrs. Vyvian, and ſo happy di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> this indulgence make her, that, had Montalbert been in England, ſhe would hardly have had a wiſh left ungratified.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="168" facs="unknown:029524_0170_0FE1D505514A9AF0"/>It was now indeed that ſuch a friend was more neceſſary to her than ever; and it was more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite that this dear friend ſhould know ſhe was a wife, ſince ſhe found it was probable ſhe ſhould become a mother. Nothing was more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately preſſing than that Montalbert ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of this. But without the concurrence of Mrs. Vyvian, and indeed without her aſſiſtance, ſhe dared not hazard a letter, which, if it fell into the hands of his mother, might be of the moſt fatal conſequence. The two letters ſhe had received from Montalbert were but too ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive of his deſpondence and uneaſineſs; and though he ſeemed to ſtifle part of the anguiſh of his heart from tenderneſs towards his wife, ſhe ſaw that the reception his mother had given him was far from having been pleaſant, and that, while he yet acknowledged the neceſſity of his journey, he regretted that he had made it.</p>
               <p>But Mrs. Vyvian, who had received letters from her ſon, knew yet more. She had learned that one reaſon for the impatience, expreſſed by the mother of Montalbert for his return to Naples, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> lately loſt her huſband, a Roman of high rank, and was now a very rich widow. Charles Vyvian related all the advantages offered by ſuch an alliance. On the beauty of the young widow, and her predilection in favour of Montalbert, with whom ſhe had been acquainted before her firſt marriage, he dwelt particularly; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> added, laughingly, that he ſuppoſed Harry had left his

heart in England, for at preſent he ſeemed as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible to the charms of the lady, as deaf to the remonſtrances of his mother.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Vyvian was extremely diſtreſſed by this intelligence, which ſhe carefully avoided com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating. Though ſhe loved Montalbert ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely, ſhe had many doubts whether in affairs of love he had more honour than other gay young men. She had reaſon formerly to believe his principles were very free, and ſhe could not but fear, that he might conſider his marriage with Roſalie, celebrated as it had been contrary to the laws of England, as an engagement ſo little bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that he might break it whenever ambition or the love of variety might induce him to it.</p>
               <p>The ſituation, therefore, of this beloved child, more dear than ever to her, was a dreadful weight on the ſpirits of Mrs. Vyvian: and ſhe now felt renewed, in the perſon of Roſalie, all thoſe cruel ſenſations which had corroded her own heart, when, betrayed by an unhappy paſſion into g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Yet, circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced as ſhe was herſelf, ſhe could not protect her openly, and even trembled every time ſhe reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that, with the return of the family of her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the indulgence of ever ſeeing Roſalie muſt be reſigned; and that they muſt equally ſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="170" facs="unknown:029524_0172_0FE1D5078964A1F0"/>Every day rendered the ſituation of Roſalie more critical. Though Mrs. Leſſington ſeemed, as if by a tacit agreement with Mrs. Vyvian, not to notice the preference Roſalie ſo evidently gave to the latter, and to ſuffer her to act as ſhe pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, others, who ſtill ſuppoſed her a member of the Leſſington family, could not be but ſurpriſed at her aſſociating ſo little with them, nor help re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marking, that whenever they did ſee her among them, there was ſomething peculiar in her man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and appearance. The men, who had admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her beauty, but who had been repulſed by her coldneſs, now diſcovered, as they always do on ſuch occaſions, that the poor girl was in love: and while the elder ladies thought her proud, conceited, and full of airs, ſome of the younger entirely agreed with them; while others, more candid or more ſenſible, pitied her on the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition that ſhe had an "unhappy attachment;" or, as the damſels of the lower rank would have expreſſed it, "that ſhe was croſſed in love."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Vyvian was too deeply intereſted to have a moment's tranquility; and when the hour of Mrs. Boſworth's return approached, this anxiety became more and more inſupportable: and it was certain that health ſo delicate could not long reſiſt ſuch painful ſolicitude.</p>
               <p>After long deliberation and conſulting with the Abbe Hayward, who had long been aware of who Roſalie really was, Mrs. Vyvian determined to write to Montalbert with the ſame precautions as thoſe Roſalie uſed by his directions. This ſhe executed, not without finding it the moſt difficult
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:029524_0173_0FE1D559CC4F2750"/>
and painful taſk ſhe had ever undertaken. To avow the diſſimulation of her whole life to her nephew, to explain to him circumſtances of which ſhe knew he muſt be entirely ignorant, words were not eaſily found. At length, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the letter was written and ſent off: and ſhe returned once more to her long and penſive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences with the object of it, with whom alſo a taſk yet remained quite as diſtreſſing to her.</p>
               <p>This was to tell Roſalie to whom ſhe owed her birth; to give a relation of circumſtances which ſhe knew muſt appear very ſtrange to her. Mrs. Vyvian ſaw her often look as if ſhe at once dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and expected this explanation; but never yet had ſhe acquired courage to begin the converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Roſalie was too timid to make any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries that led to it.</p>
               <p>But Mrs. Boſworth and Miſs Vyvian would now return in a ſhort time: and then the mother and daughter muſt no longer indulge themſelves with being together for whole days as they were now—a heavy preſentiment of future evil, to which the former was too apt to yield, told her, that if the preſent time was loſt, future opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties might be wanting.—The next morning, therefore, after having made her reſolution<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhe put it into execution.</p>
               <p>Roſalie, whom ſhe had deſired to come early, was ſeated at work by her bed-ſide, for ſhe was too much indiſpoſed to leave it; when Mrs. Vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian, opening a little caſket which ſhe had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly placed near her pillow, put into the hand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

voice, ſaid, "It is the likeneſs of—your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther! —It repreſented a man of two or three and twenty: the countenance expreſſed under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and vivacity of ſentiment, and the whole figure was remarkably handſome. Roſalie gazed on it in ſilence, and with ſenſations that cannot be deſcribed. "Do you ſee no reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, my Roſalie," ſaid Mrs. Vyvian, "to a face you know?—Ah! do you not trace in theſe features the likeneſs you bear to. . . . . . .?— Believe me, my child," continued ſhe, unable to reſtrain her tears, "this morning is the firſt time for many years that I have allowed myſelf to look at that picture; and now I reſign it for ever. —Take it, my dear girl, and may you not reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble him in fortune as in features."</p>
               <p>"Does my father yet live, Madam?" Roſalie would have ſaid; but ſhe could not articulate the ſentence. Her mother, however, underſtood her. "He does," replied ſhe, "but not in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. I ſhall never ſee him more—nor am I guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or wretched enough to wiſh it.—Never have theſe eyes beheld him ſince that fatal hour when I was compelled to give to another the hand which was his in the ſight of God. But, though my hand was not at my own diſpoſal, never has it acknowledged any ſovereign but him to whom my firſt vows were given: yet I very ſincerely tried, when under the cruel neceſſity of giving myſelf to Mr. Vyvian, to fulfil the duties that were impoſed upon me. He knew that I was compelled to marry him. He was indelicate and ſelfiſh enough to conſider only the convenience of
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:029524_0175_0FE1D55B9A9C2628"/>
my fortune, and a perſon, which was then an object to a man, licentious and diſſolute as he was. Yet I <hi>think</hi> he never has had any juſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to complain of my conduct ſince I have borne the name of his wife. He knew I neither did nor ever could love him—for I told him ſo when I married him. He was contented to poſſeſs my fortune and my perſon—my heart he never thought worth the experiment that ſome men would have made to have gained it." A deep ſigh and a long pauſe, which Roſalie did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt, now followed.—</p>
               <p>In a few moments Mrs. Vyvian ſeemed to have regained her reſolution, and thus proceeded—</p>
               <p>"You ſhould have an idea of what ſort of a man, my father, Mr. Montalbert, was, before you can imagine how I was ſituated. I do not believe you know more than his name; for Mrs. Leſſington was probably cautious of entering into any part of my unfortunate hiſtory.—Mr. Montalbert then, my father, was the elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a family, which, from its name, was evidently of Norman extraction—a boaſt that is generally deemed a ſufficient ground for the pride of anceſtry in England. The Montalberts, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, could carry their genealogy much farther, and were content to begin it only among the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors of the Eaſt. As Engliſh Peers, they adhered to the unfortunate James the Second, were baniſhed with him, and loſt their property, their title, and their rights as Britiſh ſubjects. My father, being much connected with noble families more fortunate, had intereſt enough
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:029524_0176_0FE1D50F9721B120"/>
to obtain reſtitution of a ſmall part indeed of the great fortunes of his family, but ſufficient to give him once more a footing in England, where he was happy enough to marry one of its richeſt heireſſes. My mother who was the only offspring of an alliance between two noble houſes, inherit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all their poſſeſſions, and gave them and herſelf to my father, in deſpite of the oppoſition of ſuch of her family as pretended to any right of giving their opinion; for her father and mother being dead, there were only uncles or couſins whoſe diſſent could not prevent her following her own inclinations.</p>
               <p>"This great property was divided between me and my brother, the father of Montalbert, your huſband, but not equally; for he had of courſe the greateſt ſhare. The noble caſtle and the eſtates, belonging to it in the north, are the principal part of what remains to him in England; for having early formed connections upon the continent, he never loved or lived long in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. His life was not long, for he died ſoon after the birth of your huſband; ſo ſoon, indeed, that he had neglected to make for him the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he ought to have made, and, by a prior will, Harry Montalbert was left almoſt entirely depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent on his mother.</p>

about fifteen; and, from that time, you may imagine, my life was very recluſe; for then the country around it was leſs inhabited, and the roads leſs paſſable than they are now.</p>
               <p>"Harſh as my father was, I loved him very tenderly, and therefore did not murmur at the confinement thus impoſed upon me at a time of life when other young women enter the world and enjoy its pleaſures: nor did the fatigues of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant attendance in a ſick chamber, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to read ſometimes for half the night, for a moment deter me from doing my duty, or for a moment induce me to repine.</p>
               <p>"I have ſince thought, Roſalie, that this peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od, with all its little hardſhips and inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, was the happieſt of my life.—My friend Mrs. Leſſington, though then married, and ſome years older than me, was ſtill often my compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſhared a taſk which without her I could not have executed ſo well. Whenever I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed from the chamber of my ſuffering parent, I ſaw around me ſcenes of nature, which ſeemed to put on new beauties as if to reward me for my perſeverance in painful duties; and if I taſted not of pleaſures, which are accounted happineſs by very young women, I was at leaſt content. Thus, without much variation, paſſed more than three years of my life.</p>
               <p>"My father had a relation in Ireland, whoſe anceſtors having ſuffered in the ſame cauſe as that in which the Montalberts had loſt their property, had not been ſo fortunate in re-eſtabliſhing their affairs; but their deſcendant was, with a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:029524_0178_0FE1D511324BFA00"/>
family, obliged to live on a very ſmall eſtate, and in great obſcurity in the north of Ireland.</p>
               <p>"One of the ſons, however, having been ſent young to the Eaſt Indies, had done ſo well, that he wrote to have <hi>two</hi> of his three brothers follow him, informing his father, that though he could not make remittances for the purpoſe of ſitting them out, he was ſure when they arrived there, of getting them into ſituations nearly as advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous as his own.</p>
               <p>"In conſequence of this, their father ſent his third and fourth ſons to England, to ſolicit among their friends and their relations the means of equipping them in ſuch a way as might enable them to avail themſelves of theſe advantageous proſpects. The eldeſt of the two ſoon found aſſiſtance in London, and departed; but the younger having been ſeized with a violent fit of illneſs in London, was under the neceſſity of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the laſt ſhip of the ſeaſon ſail without him; and at the invitation of my father, who had taken moſt of the expence of his equipment upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he came down to Holmwood to recover his health, while he waited for an opportunity of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing his brother, which was not likely to offer for ſome months.</p>
               <p>"Ormſby was about one and twenty when he was thus received into the houſe of my father, who ſoon learned to conſider him as a ſon; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming ſo attached to him, that he was not eaſy in his abſence.</p>
               <p>"Even at this diſtance of time, I reflect with
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:029524_0179_0FE1D55EDD2BC600"/>
wonder on the careleſſneſs with which my father ſuffered two very young people to be continually together, without appearing to think of the proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility there was that they might form an attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to each other. It is true that I have myſelf diſcovered inattention of the ſame ſort in regard to you and Montalbert; but beſides the prepoſſeſſion of your predilection in favour of Vyvian, with which my mind was diſtracted, the character of Montalbert was ſo different from that of Ormſby, that it never occurred to me that there was equal hazard in your being continually in his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny."—</p>
               <p>Mrs. Vyvian now ſeemed to be ſo much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigued, and to be ſo little able to continue a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative ſo affecting to her ſpirits, that Roſalie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated her to forbear concluding it till ſhe was leſs likely to ſuffer by dwelling on ſcenes which it gave her ſo much pain to recal. But the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability that their long and private conferences might be leſs frequent when they were continually liable to be broken in upon by Mrs. Boſworth and her ſiſter, and the neceſſity there was that Roſalie ſhould know the circumſtances of her birth, and what were Mrs. Vyvian's wiſhes as to her future conduct, determined her, to exert herſelf to the utmoſt of her power, to conclude all ſhe had to relate—the ſingular circumſtances of her former life.</p>

               <p>IN the evening Mrs. Vyvian found herſelf able to proceed, and thus continued her narrative:—</p>
               <p>"My friend Mrs. Leſſington, who had now a family of children, was no longer at liberty to give me ſo much of her time as ſhe had hitherto done; but, at this period, the living of May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, which was in my father's gift, becoming vacant, I was fortunate enough to procure it for her huſband, and had the comfort of ſeeing her ſettled within four miles of Holmwood.</p>
               <p>"Greatly, indeed, had I need of the prudence and ſteadineſs of a friend. . . . . . . Imagine, my Roſalie, how I was at this time ſituated. Ormſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, though he lived ſo much with me, was yet ſo ſenſible of the diſtance fortune had placed between us, that, for many months after he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came an inmate in our houſe, he never breathed the moſt diſtant expreſſion of his affection. Yet, young as I was, I could not miſtake the meaning of his looks, and thoſe ſilent attentions he inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly paid me. He <hi>seemed</hi>—ah! he <hi>was</hi>—too artleſs to diſguiſe entirely his ſentiments. But the ineffectual ſtruggle he made to do ſo, was a
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:029524_0181_0FE1BAB52208DC30"/>
ſpectacle infinitely more dangerous for me than the warmeſt profeſſions could have been. He had even the generoſity to avoid me for ſome time, and, as if by tacit conſent, we met only in my fathers room, where he now almoſt always ſupplied my place, and ſat whole days, and often whole nights, with a tenderneſs and patience that, in my opinion, overpaid the debt of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude which he owed him. But ſometimes, when my fathers old ſervant was able to give that attendance for which he was often diſqualified by illneſs, Ormſby was unexpectedly releaſed; and it was at one of theſe periods that the explanation was brought on, which afterwards coſt me ſo dear.</p>
               <p>"My father had been extremely ill for many days. It was ſpring, a ſeaſon that always brought on the moſt painful paroxyſms of the gout: his old ſervant, hardly leſs a victim to this diſeaſe than himſelf, had been laid up, and Ormſby had been my father's attendant for ten days, almoſt without taking off his clothes, and certainly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having had any interval of reſt.</p>
               <p>"Barford, my father's ſervant, having a little recovered, came down to his relief; for no other perſon was ſuffered to enter the room, but Ormſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, myſelf, and this man.</p>
               <p>"At this time Ormſby was ſo much fatigued, that he could hardly ſupport himſelf. He haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to procure what refreſhment a change of clothes afforded, and then to relieve a violent head-ache, the effect of want of ſleep, he wandered into the garden for the air. . . . . . You remember,
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:029524_0182_0FE1D5198C6877C8"/>
Roſalie, the temple at the end of the avenue of ſtone pines—thither I often went with my work, or with a book, when I was alone; behind it is, you recollect, a copſe, which, at the ſeaſon of the year now preſent, for it was the middle of May, echoed with the muſic of innumerable birds. Every object breathed of peace and beauty; and as <hi>my</hi> heart had long ſince learned to aſſociate the idea of Ormſby with every ſcene that gave me pleaſure, I was meditating on fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture poſſibilities of happineſs, when the object of my dangerous contemplations ſuddenly appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed coming towards the place where I ſat.</p>
               <p>"To the lively intereſt he always inſpired was now added, that which aroſe from the fatigue he had evidently undergone. He was pale, and his eyes were heavy for want of reſt. I ſaw him with a ſlow and languid ſtep aſcend the little turf hill on which the temple is ſituated. I could not have eſcaped from it without his ſeeing me, if I had wiſhed to have done ſo. But, in truth, I had no deſire to fly from him; and though I trembled as he approached me, it was with a ſort of delightful apprehenſion; for I fancied he would now ſpeak to me, if not in direct terms—yet in ſuch as would leave me no longer in doubt as to his real ſentiments: yet while I wiſhed this, I dreaded it: and when he entered the place where I ſat, I know not which of us appeared the moſt confuſed. He had long ſtudiouſly avoided me, and certainly did not now expect to meet me. But as he knew I had ſeen him, and perhaps had not reſolution enough to deny himſelf the unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:029524_0183_0FE1D567079066C0"/>
opportunity of ſpeaking to me, he came into that wing of the temple, and, after the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſalutation of the morning, ſat down near me.</p>
               <p>"I inquired after my father, though it was not an hour ſince I had been in the room; but it gave me occaſion to ſay, though in a faltering voice, how much I was obliged to Ormſby for his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

which was ſo likely to ariſe between two young perſons. I had imagined, that, finding us both neceſſary to his comfort, he intended to unite us. My fortune muſt be ſuch, as I ſuppoſed, made any conſideration as to that of my lover entirely needleſs.—Alas! how little is the inexperienced mind of youth capable of judging of thoſe motives that influence men in advanced life. Though my father was retired from the world, he had not loſt in retirement the paſſions that influence the men of that world. On the contrary, living where he was the lord of many miles, where none, either in his houſe or around it, ever diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted his will, he had, like a deſpot, entirely forgotten that others had any will at all. Of a marriage of love he had no idea; nor did it ever occur to him, as a thing poſſible, that a depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent relation, who was indebted to his bounty for a ſubſiſtence, could dare to lift his eyes to a daughter of the houſe of Montalbert, for whom, though he had never yet hinted at them, my father had very different views.</p>
               <p>"But love, too apt to liſten to the voice of hope, ſuffered us not to ſee the miſery we were laying up for ourſelves; and even amidſt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches Ormſby often made himſelf, for what he termed treachery and ingratitude, the flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing illuſions into which we were betrayed by youthful inexperience, not only quieted theſe alarms of conſcience, but made us liſten with ſomething bordering on reſentment to the remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances of my friend, Mrs. Leſſington, who took every occaſion of repreſenting the danger of my
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:029524_0185_0FE1D568A3A467A8"/>
indulging a predilection for Ormſby. I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to perſuade her, as I had perſuaded my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that I ſhould one day become his wife, with the permiſſion of my father. Mrs. Leſſington, who undoubtedly knew the world and my father's temper much better than I did, left nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid that was likely to convince me of this danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous error. She even threatened to inform my father of the truth, unleſs I endeavoured to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer this fatal prepoſſeſſion; and ſhe aſſured me if ſhe did, the conſequence would be the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate diſgrace and diſmiſſion of Ormſby. This menace which I knew ſhe would never execute, had an effect exactly oppoſite to that which ſhe intended. The idea of Ormſby driven from the houſe, ſuffering poverty and mortification, and abandoned by the world only for his attachment to me, endeared him to me infinitely more than he would have been had I ſeen him ſurrounded with affluence and proſperity. Nothing is ſo dangerous as pity; and my friend, in attempting to ſave me, haſtened my ruin by exciting it.</p>
               <p>"I cannot, Roſalie, trace the progreſs of this fatal paſſion. My confeſſor, who alone might have checked its progreſs, was ſurely careleſs of his charge, or was poſſibly become indifferent to the welfare of a family he was ſoon on the point of quitting. He went to Rome exactly at the time when he might perhaps have ſaved me, and it was ſome time before he was replaced by Mr. Hayward.</p>
               <p>"During that interval, as Mrs. Leſſington was gone into the weſt on a viſit to her huſband's
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:029524_0186_0FE1D51D08A32A98"/>
relations, Ormſby was more than ever alone with me. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>very hour, indeed, in which the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the one or the other was not neceſſary in my father's room, we paſſed together. From an habit of indulging myſelf in the illuſive hope that I might one day be his wife<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I inſenſibly learned to conſider myſelf already ſo in the ſight of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. . . . . . Ormſby was young and paſſionate: he was not an artful ſeducer; but I had no mother, I had no friend, and thoſe who candidly reflect on my ſituation will ſurely compaſſionate, though they may not perhaps acquit me.</p>
               <p>"How ſoon, alas! was this deviation from rectitude and honour ſeverely and bitterly puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Though my father had been wilfully blind or ſtrangely negligent, the ſervants, and from them the neighbours, ſaw enough to make them ſuſpect more. We had little or no communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the gentlemen's families around us, divided from them as we were by the difference of religion, habits and connections. But in ours, as in every other neighbourhood, there were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficious and impertinent people, whoſe greateſt pleaſure was to inquire into the affairs of others, and diſturb as much was in their power the peace of families. The country town adjoining to Holmwood produced at that time, as indeed it has done ſince, but too many of this deſcription. —I, who hardly knew that ſuch perſons exiſted, was, however, marked out for the victim of their malignity; and, as if the terrors that now inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly beſet me were inſufficient, for I found my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf likely to become a mother, one of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

officious fiends completed, or rather accelerated, the evil deſtiny that hung over me.</p>
               <p>"While I waited with agoniſing impatience the return of Mrs. Leſſington, whoſe counſel was ſo neceſſary in my preſent alarming ſituation, Ormſby, more wretched than I was, attempted to ſooth and conſole me; and I was inſenſible of any other comfort than what I derived from weeping in his arms. Little dreaming of the ſtorm that was ready to burſt upon us, I ſought him as uſual one morning in the plantation, where we were accuſtomed as it was yet early autumn, to meet in a morning before either the family were likely to interrupt us, and before my father demanded either his attendance or mine. I found him not. Suppoſing it earlier than I had believed, I traverſed for ſome time the walks of the wood without uneaſineſs—but at length his abſence ſurpriſed and then alarmed me. I returned ſlowly towards the houſe, more and more amazed that Ormſby did not appear— I met the under gardener, and, without any preciſe deſign, I aſked him ſome trifling queſtion —the man, inſtead of anſwering, looked at me with a countenance expreſſive of terror and ſurpriſe; then without anſwering, hurried away; while I, dreading I knew not what, quickened my ſteps towards the houſe, and was met in the lawn that immediately ſurrounded it by my own maid, a young woman who had been lately ſent to me from France by a friend, and who was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready much attached to me. <hi>Her</hi> countenance ſtartled me infinitely more than that of the man
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:029524_0188_0FE1D51EA516CFE0"/>
I had juſt paſſed—I haſtily inquired what was the matter?—Helene attempted to utter a few words in French; but her voice failed her; and, ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my hands, ſhe looked at me with ſuch an expreſſion of terror and an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h, that the only idea it conveyed was the death of my father. Before my incoherent and breathleſs inquiries, or her attempts to anſwer them ſucceeded, my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's old butler came out, and, though he ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed equally terrified, he had juſt command enough of himſelf to tell me that I muſt immediately attend his maſter. Without having any diſtinct notion of the cauſe for which I was thus unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly ſummoned, I obeyed in ſuch confuſion of mind that I know not how I reached the room.</p>
               <p>"My father was not as uſual at ſo early an hour in his bed, but ſitting in a chair. I ſaw that ſomething had greatly diſturbed him, and my guilty conſcience whiſpered to me that our fatal ſecret was diſcovered. . . . . Trembling, ſo that I could not move acroſs the room without the aſſiſtance of Helene, I at length approached the place. My father's eyes were ſternly fixed on my face. His lips quivered, and his voice fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, while he reached his hand towards me, and gave me a letter he held in it.</p>

I ſprang from the bed, and, in a ſtate of deſparation, was ruſhing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards my father's room, when Helene, terrified at my attempt, threw herſelf before me, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>"Such was the diſtracted ſtate of my mind, that it was only when my ſtrength was entirely exhauſted that Helene could prevail upon me to liſten to her arguments. At length I ſunk into ſilent deſpair, becauſe I had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

ſome medicine for me, which ſhe hoped would quiet my agitated ſpirits, but the benefit of the counſel ſhe knew ſhe ſhould receive from the Abbe Hayward, who, though he had not been more than a week in the houſe, had gained the confidence and good opinion of every one in the family.</p>
               <p>"When ſhe was gone, I endeavoured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal to my mind the words, the looks, and geſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of my father. . . . .

Her voice ſailed, and Roſalie, terrified at the ſituation in which ſhe ſaw her mother, entreated her to forbear any farther exertion till ſhe was more able to undertake it. It was more than an hour before ſhe was ſufficiently recovered for Roſalie to leave her; at length, finding Mrs. Vyvian more compoſed, ſhe retired to the houſe ſhe uſed to call her home, having ſettled to be again at her mother's bedſide at a very early hour the following morning.</p>

               <p>ONCE more ſeated by the bedſide of her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who, on this morning, was too much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed to be able to leave it, Roſalie liſtened in ſilence to the continuation of a narrative in which ſhe was ſo deeply intereſted.</p>
               <p>"While Helene was gone," ſaid Mrs. Vyvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, "I collected ſtrength enough to riſe and go to the window of my bed-chamber. It was now night, but there was light enough to enable me to diſcern every object on the lawn round the houſe. I gazed, however, without knowing why, or on what:—the thought of Ormſby gone—loſt to me forever—perhaps deſtroyed— filled me with ſuch undeſcribable horror, that my power of reflection ſeemed to be annihilated. Impreſſed with that one idea, my heart ſeemed petrified; the certainty of inſtant death would have been received as a matter of indifference. All that I wiſhed was, to be aſſured of the fate of Ormſby—I thought that if I knew what was become of him, I could brave the ſevereſt anger of my father, and die content, ſince I believed my death inevitable. . . How diſmal every object

that I ſurveyed from my window appeared!—not a human being appeared round the houſe: the woods that you may recollect terminate the lawn on one ſide were almoſt half ſtripped of their leaves; but they looked black, dreary, and fit for deeds of horror.—Yet do not, my dear Roſalie, believe, that however cruel I at that moment thought my father, I could ſuppoſe him capable of ſo dreadful a crime as that of directing the death of Ormſby; but I figured to myſelf, that, rendered deſperate by the force that had been uſed to tear him away, he had reſiſted, and ſunk under the numbers of unfeeling men who were ready at every hazard to obey my father's orders—no otherwiſe could I account, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent confuſed ſtate of my mind, for his having diſappeared without ſending me one line—one la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>"I cannot diſcriminate the various emotions that agitated my mind during the abſence of Helene, who, on her return in about an hour, found me ſtill ſitting at the window, as if I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to ſee Ormſby paſs, as he ſometimes uſed to do under it of an evening, when he uſed to tell me he had peculiar delight in watching the light in my room, and ſeeing me paſs acroſs it, long before he dared to tell me he loved me.</p>
               <p>"But now, alas! he was to appear there no more—and when Helene returned and came into my apartment, carefully locking the door after

               <p>"She tried to command herſelf, that ſhe might prevail upon me to be tranquil enough to attend to my own ſafety. It was, however, ſome time before I was in a condition to liſten to her.</p>
               <p>"Helene at length related to me that the houſe was now apparently quiet, but that an a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>'Ah, Madam,' ſaid Helene in French, 'how I trembled when I heard this. . . . . . . . .

That dear good man, the Abbe Hayward, looked at me as if he wiſhed, but dared not, ſay any thing to comfort me. I got out of the room as well as I could, and went, looking I believe more white than a ghoſt, into the ſervant's hall, where I ſaw no perſon but the coachman and the gardener; neither of them ſpoke to me—they ſeem even afraid of ſpeaking to each other. I paſſed into the houſekeeper's room, under pretence of aſking for ſomething for you: Mrs. Nelſon was there, with the two houſe-maids and the laundry-maid; but inſtead of aſking me any queſtions about you, as Mrs. Nelſon almoſt always does if you are at any time the leaſt ill, ſhe never inquired after you, though ſhe knew you had been confined to your room ill the whole day; as to the maids they ſeemed like ſtatues, and while I ſtaid on one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence or other, in hopes of gaining ſome intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,

Mrs. Nelſon would have ſent one of them to the ſtore-room, but ſhe turned as pale as death, and ſaid it was impoſſible to go unleſs one of the other maids went with her. Mrs. Nelſon gave her a ſtrange look<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but ſaid nothing, and they went away together.'</p>
               <p>"All this, ſo ſtrangely obſcure and unacount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, redoubled my inquietude.—Something very unuſual then had happened in the houſe, which had impreſſed terror on the minds of its inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants—What could this be but ſome violence that had been offered to Ormſby, which was known to all the ſervants, but which none of them dared to ſpeak of?—There were few events, the certainty of which could be ſo dreadful as the ſtate of horrible ſuſpence I was now in. I think that my intellects, unable to ſuſtain, ſunk under it, and that the artificial calm that followed was the effect of the agonies in which I paſſed this melancholy day, and the night that followed it.</p>
               <p>"Still placed in the window, with my eyes fixed on the lawn and woods that ſurrounded it, I heard the incoherent narrative of Helene, and continued to torment myſelf with every terrific idea that my ſickening brain could raiſe. . . . . Hideous ſhadows ſeemed to flit before me—I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt imagined that, in the murmurs of the wind, I heard the dying groans of Ormſby—that I heard him call upon me, and bid me adieu.— From the indulgence of waking dreams ſo horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, I was ſtartled by a rapping at the door of the anti-room that led from the ſtaircaſe to my

bedchamber. Helene, fearing ſhe knew not what, heſitated, and dared not open it; ſhe aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me what ſhe ſhould do, but I was utterly incapable of anſwering, and we were at length relieved from our terrors by hearing the voice of Mr. Hayward, who deſired to be admitted.</p>
               <p>"He ſpoke to me with ſo much ſoothing kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and reaſoned ſo properly with me, that tears, which had been for many hours denied me, flowed from my eyes: I dared not, however, aſk—for I yet knew but very little of Mr. Hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward—I dared not aſk what was become of the unfortunate Ormſby; but, as if this worthy man had read the thoughts, I had not courage to expreſs—he gradually managed his converſation ſo as to bring it to the point he wanted to ſpeak upon.—'I was extremely concerned,' ſaid he, 'that the precipitancy of Mr. Montalbert's man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner alarmed you as it did. . . . . Indeed I have told him, that I greatly blame his needleſs harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs produced only by an anonymous letter, and certainly unſounded. I can eaſily imagine how the abrupt manner in which he ſpoke to you might have the effect it had, and I have at length per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded him to believe, that without any improper attachment to Mr. Ormſby, you might be affected in the manner you were.

               <p>"I ſighed, but dared not aſk what was the fate of this unfortunate Ormſby. . . . . . . . . . .

               <p>"Still, however, the ſad uncertainty of what was become of him ſeemed ſo heavily to preſs on my heart, that it was ready to burſt. . . . I could not ſpeak; but Mr. Hayward who appeared to be well acquainted with the painful ſenſations which were probably pictured on my counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, went on, in the moſt ſoothing manner, to tell me what was, he thought, the beſt part I could take for my peace of mind, and for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>"Mr. Hayward ſtopped, expecting that I might by this time have ſo far recovered my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, as to be able to promiſe that I would attempt at leaſt to regulate my behaviour by his advice— but I remained ſilent. . . . . .

               <p>"When I recovered, Helene was chaſing my temples, and taking other means to bring me to myſelf; the Abbe Hayward was traverſing the room in the agitated manner of a perſon who has received ſome alarming intelligence, and knows not how to act. When he ſaw that I was a little reſtored, he approached me, and, in a voice hardly articulate, ſaid, 'Moſt unhappy young woman, this is no time to flatter—deſtruction hangs over you, and it is only in your own pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to eſcape it; for without your own efforts, nobody can ſave you.

All my thoughts are ſo full of horror, that the death with which I am threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened would be a welcome releaſe from ſuch into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable torture.'</p>

                  <pb n="201" facs="unknown:029524_0203_0FE1D5CC6EE55F00"/>'I ſolemnly aſſure you,' replied Mr. Hayward, 'that I do not know what is become of our unfortunate friend, nor, perhaps, ſhall I ever know. . . . . . I dare not make any inquiry; and all I have been able to learn is, that, on receiving the infamous ſcrall laſt night, your father ordered every body out of his room, and remained alone, or only with Ormſby, for ſome time. He then directed two of the grooms to be ſent to him, and that the ſteward might alſo attend. . . . . . Mr. Ormſby appeared no more. Theſe two men, the grooms, have never been ſeen ſince; but there is no track of a carriage around the houſe, nor has any body been ſeen to leave it. The ſteward ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the moſt profound ſilence, and all that is known in the houſe is, that ſomething has happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed which has obliged Mr. Ormſby ſuddenly to leave it; that he has deeply offended Mr. Montalbert; and that it is required of all who would not enrage their maſter, and be diſmiſſed from the family, never to mention the name of Ormſby even to each other.</p>
               <p>'My father <hi>did</hi> ſee him?' inquired I—'had they any converſation which urged on this preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate violence?'</p>
               <p>'I believe they had, but I know nothing cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly—any attempt on my part to draw from Mr. Montalbert more than he chuſes to entruſt me with, would not only be abortive, but would, in all probability, deprive me of every future op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of ſoftening the aſperity of his reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

               <p>'You believe then,' ſaid I, 'that the life of poor Ormſby is ſafe?'</p>
               <p>'Believe it!'—exclaimed Mr. Hayward— 'ſurely I believe it. . . . To whatever extremities the unhappy prejudices or violent paſſions of Mr. Montalbert may drive him, and none can have greater apprehenſions on that ſubject than I have, hitherto I hope and believe that Mr. Montalbert has taken no unjuſtifiable meaſures in regard to this luckleſs young man.'—Then deeply ſighing, Mr. Hayward added—'In my opinion his future fate depends entirely upon you—it is in your power to ſave or to deſtroy him.'</p>
               <p>'Gracious Heaven!'—exclaimed I—'what right has my father over this ill ſtarred young man?—<hi>My</hi> life may be in his power—he gave it me, and moſt willingly would I reſign it; but Ormſby ſurely ought not to ſuffer.'</p>
               <p>'Mr. Montalbert,' interrupted Mr. Hayward, 'will conſider but little what he <hi>ought</hi> to do, or what he has a <hi>right</hi> to do, when vengeance is in queſtion; but ſurely I need urge this ſubject no further—you are perfectly acquainted with his temper—you know that he is maſter of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try

His ſervants, his dependents, his tenants, are in ſuch habits of obeying him, that he is in ſome meaſure capable of exerciſing a ſort of deſpotiſm, which, though frequent enough in other countries, is ſeldom ſeen in this. . . . . . . I will now leave you, my dear Miſs Montalbert—again beſeeching you to conſider what I have ſaid, and to command your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as much as poſſible to-morrow.'</p>
               <p>"Mr. Hayward then left me, and ſent to my faithful Helene to attend me, who had been ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent during our converſation; but my ſenſes were yet ſtunned by the violence of the ſhock I had received—I could not ſhed a tear and ſat like a ſtatue repeating almoſt unconſciouſly to myſelf —'Ormſby is gone!—he is loſt for ever—he is condemned to ignominy and diſgrace, and it is <hi>I</hi> who have undone him, who may perhaps occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion his death!</p>
               <p>"I know not now by what arguments Helene at length prevailed upon me to take ſome refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to undreſs myſelf. . . . . . . I believed that by the contrivance of Mr. Hayward, who, as I afterwards found, kept a ſmall diſpenſary of medicines in his own room, Helene gave me ſome remedy that aſſiſted in quieting my ſpirits—for after paſſing ſome time in a ſtate of mind which I cannot even at this diſtance of time reflect upon without horror, I ſunk into inſenſibility, from which I was ſuddenly ſtartled by a fancied noiſe, and awoke only to recollect all the bitterneſs of my deſtiny."</p>

deſcription at this diſtance of time could but do little juſtice to the ſtate of my mind, even if I were capable of diſcriminating now the variety of miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries I then ſuffered under. It ſeems, on retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection, the moſt extraordinary circumſtance in the world, that in ſuch a ſtate of mind as I was in, I ſhould have acquired reſolution enough to appear before my father, as Mr. Hayward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended, on the following day; but this I did do: and though I cannot but ſuppoſe that my figure and countenance bore ſufficient teſtimony of the ſtate of my heart, he ſeemed determined not to notice the deadly paleneſs of my counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, or the feeble and uncertain ſtep with which I approached him: yet, when he ſuppoſed I did not remark him, he caſt towards me looks of indignation and reſentment, the meaning of which I could not miſtake. I ſhuddered when I obſerved them, but in my turn affected to be as tranquil as before this ſtorm that had wrecked for ever my happineſs and my peace.</p>
               <p>"It was highly probable that the violent agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation I had undergone, as well as the dreadful uneaſineſs that preyed on my mind, for the fate of my unfortunate lover, would finiſh my inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etudes for the future, and bury in oblivion the fatal ſecret of this hapleſs affection; but this did not happen, and now every hour as it paſſed ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſuch inſupportable dread of what was to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in future to the miſeries of the preſent moment that to exiſt long in ſuch a ſtate ſeemed impoſſible <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>"Nothing could be more dreary and deſolate
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:029524_0208_0FE1D583AD4C1990"/>
than every object appeared round the houſe. It was the dark and melancholy month of Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and nature ſeemed to be in uniſon with my feelings. I looked now on the ſame ſcenes as I had ſo lately beheld luxuriant in foliage, and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminated with the ſummer ſun—the ſame ſcenes in which Ormſby had ſo long been a principal object. . . . Now—as the leaves fell ſlowly from the ſallow trees, they ſeemed to ſtrew his grave— the wind, as murmured hollow through the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rennial foliage of the pines and firs, ſounded to <hi>my</hi> ears as if it was loaded with his dying groans —I heard him ſigh among the thick ſhrubs that bordered the wood walks; he ſeemed to reproach my calmneſs—yet it was not the tranquility of indifference, it was the torpor of deſpair.</p>
               <p>"I went out alone, that I might weep at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; yet, when I found myſelf in the ſilent ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the woods, I was unable to ſhed a tear, but ſat down on one of the benches, and gazed on vacancy with fixed eyes, and without having any diſtinct idea of the objects I beheld. In theſe diſmal rambles rain and tempeſt, and once or twice night, overtook me. I was careleſs or inſenſible of outward circumſtances; and certainly if my father had not determined to ſhut his eyes to the truth, as if the only alternative was between extreme ſeverity and total ignorance, he muſt have diſcovered from my conduct that all his ſuſpicions did not go beyond the reality.</p>
               <p>"Some very fatal cataſtrophe would have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the ſtate of mind I was in, had not the pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="207" facs="unknown:029524_0209_0FE1D5D825ADACF8"/>
the aſſiduous care of Helene, ſaved me from my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: the one exhorted me to patience, and a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on the mercy of Heaven; the other ſoothed and flattered my ſickening ſoul with the hope of better days, and enabled me to endure the preſent by encouraging me to look forward to the return of Mrs. Leſſington, who alone ſeemed to be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to adviſe and ſuccour me in a ſituation which every hour and every day rendered more peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Hayward frequently followed me into the depth of the woods, argued, remonſtrated, and then ſoothed and endeavoured to conſole me. I heard his arguments, and even his reprooſs, with ſubmiſſion and calmneſs; but when he told me that I ought to be cheerful, to be reſigned, to endeavour to conquer my affection for Ormſby, and to attempt by every means in my power, to conceal that it had ever exiſted to ſo fatal an exceſs—I loſt my patience, and my reſpect for this good man did not prevent my flying from him with ſomething like reſentment and diſguſt.</p>
               <p>"So paſſed a month—a wretched month, during which time the name of Ormſby had never reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my ears, ſave only when Mr. Hayward, in the converſation which he thought it neceſſary to hold with me, reluctantly named him, or when I could ſo far command the agonies with which my heart was torn as to name him to Helene, and liſten to the conjectures with which ſhe attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to relieve me as to what was become of him.</p>
               <p>"Of this, however, ſhe knew no more than
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:029524_0210_0FE1D58A01325DB0"/>
I did; yet, from the looks and manners of the ſervants with whom ſhe converſed at the times when they were neceſſarily altogether, a thouſand vague ideas floated in her mind, to which ſhe ſometimes gave utterance with more zeal than prudence. From her I learned, that the two men who had diſappeared when Ormſby was ſo ſuddenly ſent away had never ſince returned, and that the places they filled were now occupied by others. I heard too, that though the name of Ormſby was never mentioned whenever the ſteward, my father's old ſervant, or the houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper were preſent; yet that the inferior ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants were continually whiſpering ſtrange things, and that the people in the neighbourhood talked of nothing elſe; ſome of them going ſo far as to ſay, that inquiry ought to be made by people authoriſed, for that Mr. Ormſby had certainly been ſpirited away; while others gave dark hints, that, conſidering the revengeful temper of Mr. Montalbert, it would be well if ſomething worſe than being ſpirited away had not befallen the poor young man.</p>
               <p>"All this I heard with alternate anguiſh and depreſſion, of which it would be difficult to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey any idea to another. The fatal predilection that I had for Ormſby was then known, for no other reaſon could be given for ſuch conduct to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him as was imputed to my father. I now ſaw none of the neighbours, for of the very few who had been accuſtomed to viſit at the houſe, not one at this time approached it, and as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved curioſity would have prompted them to
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:029524_0211_0FE1D5D9DC0877C8"/>
come if they had no other motive, I thought it certain that my father had taken meaſures to prevent their viſits. This I was not diſpleaſed at, for <hi>their</hi> looks would have been more uneaſy to me than were thoſe of the ſervants; whenever I ſaw any of <hi>them</hi> I was covered with confuſion, and fancied they would remark and account for the ſad change in my face and figure, of which I could not fail to be myſelf conſcious.</p>
               <p>"But if I fled thus from the obſervation of ſervants, what was my fear when compelled to appear before the ſevere and ſcrutiniſing eyes of my father?—I had always an awe approaching to dread of him, even in thoſe comparatively happy days when no reproaches of conſcience aſſailed me. . . . . Now I endeavoured to attend on him with the ſame aſſiduity as I uſed to do before Ormſby became a ſharer in the taſk, or rather undertook it entirely; but whether it was that my timidity made me aukward, and that, therefore, I was incapable of acquitting myſelf as I formerly did, or whether my father, more really angry than he choſe to avow, took theſe occaſions to vent in peeviſhneſs ſome part of the reſentment and indignation he felt. Certain it is, that his harſhneſs and aſperity were almoſt inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable, and the unkind expreſſions he ſometimes uſed, the looks of rage and diſdain he caſt upon me, were not unfrequently ſuch as affected my ſpirits ſo much as to throw me into fainting fits, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

and I know not what would have been the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of ſuch a ſeries of preſent ſuffering, added to the dread of the future, had they continued much longer.</p>
               <p>"Yet before the return of Mrs. Leſſington, to which only I looked forward with the leaſt hope of mitigating my woes, I had ſome trials of fortitude to encounter more difficult to ſuſtain than any I had yet experienced.</p>
               <p>"At the end of a long row of elms, of which now a few ſingle trees only remain, you recollect a high mount now planted with firs, poplars, and larches, into which, as it is railed round, nobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy now enters; you perhaps remember too, the very large yew tree that ſhadows a great ſpace of ground near it, and which is alſo railed round.

               <p>"An avenue of ancient trees was terminated by this church, at the diſtance of ſomething more than a quarter of a mile from the houſe.

<pb n="211" facs="unknown:029524_0213_0FE1D5DB791B9160"/>
this monaſtery. Their coffins, placed in niches along the walls, had been formerly ſeen by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral perſons, who had given a very terrific ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the ſkeletons in theſe diſmal receſſes; accounts which were now traditional in the neighbouring villages, and were of courſe greatly exaggerated.—The mournful relics that had been ſeen under the earth were imagined to viſit its ſurface, and the place was univerſally believed to be haunted. The ſtyle of the building that remained, where light was admitted through long windows obſcured by pieces of coloured glaſs, and now darkened by the ivy that mantled almoſt the whole edifice; the walls of great thickneſs, in ſome places green with the damps that continually ſtreamed from the roof, in others marked with the remains of Latin ſentences, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding the half-effaced repreſentations of the crucifixion, all contributed to give an air of wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and horror to this almoſt-deſerted building; where, though at the Reformation, as it is called, under Henry the Eighth, it became a pariſh church, yet ſervice was performed in it only once a year, as a mere matter of form, for the pariſh contained only the houſe of Holmwood, and three cottages belonging to my father, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

So that when it was his pleaſure to deſtroy this ſmall church entirely, and unite the pariſh it belonged to with another, there were none to oppoſe the act of parliament he ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited and obtained for that purpoſe. At the time, however of which I am ſpeaking, this deſolate ſpot inſpired all that melancholy ſort of horror
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:029524_0214_0FE1D58E03C12A98"/>
which naturally gives riſe to the reports of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural appearances; there was not a ſervant who would on any account have gone thither of a night, and even the gardeners and workmen, who were at any time occupied near it, related ſtrange ſtories of uncommon noiſes, as of mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and complaint, and more than once have ran in terror to their fellow labourers, declaring that ſome obſcure figures had iſſued from the vaults beneath, and then melted into air.</p>
               <p>"Such was the ſtern ſpirit of my father, and he ſo little knew how to make allowances for any weakneſs which he had never felt, that had any domeſtic betrayed fears of this ſort before him, they would have been diſmiſſed with diſgrace, nor did my brother and I, while children, though we knew all the legends of the country, ever dare ſpeak to him of the ſtories we had been taught. Thus compelled to ſtifle our infantine fears, they were gradually ſubdued as our reaſon became ſtronger; and <hi>we</hi> were accuſtomed not only to find our way in the dark all over the extenſive old buildings of Holmwood, but to traverſe without fear the avenue that led to, and even the area that ſurrounded, the ruined church, though we credited the probable account that in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

from my attendance after dinner early enough to allow me to take my ſolitary walk before it was too dark.</p>
               <p>"The intelligence I had received on this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular evening from Mr. Hayward, that he had heard Mrs. Leſſington would be at home in two or three days, had given ſome relief to my ſpirits, and, rather leſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It was a calm and ſtill evening—ſo ſtill, indeed, that every bird was heard whoſe ſlender feet perched on the leafleſs boughs, or flitted among them, and the bells of the ſheep folding in the diſtant fields, and the remoter ſound of a mill and mill ſtream, were brought in low murmurs to the ear.</p>
               <p>"The well-known objects around me were becoming indiſtinct, but I continued to walk ſlowly on—I even ſat down for a few moments on the remains of a ruſtic tomb, and liſtened to the dull ſighing of the wind as it ſung round the but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes, and waved the black boughs of the old yew tree. As I ſat muſing, I recollected the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries I had often heard of ſpectres being ſeen, and ſtrange noiſes being heard round theſe receptacles of the dead.—So little pleaſure had I in look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forward to any thing that life could now afford me, ſo long had my thoughts been accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to conſider death as the only end of all my miſeries, that I felt no horror in the idea of ſeeing, or, if it were poſſible, of converſing with departed ſpirits. A ſort of chilly and ſhuddering ſenſation, however, warned me to return before it was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

I continued, however, to gaze ſteadily on the place where I fancied this ſhape had appeared: the illuſion was over—I ſaw nothing. Without any emotion of fear I proceeded, therefore, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly to that ſpot, for it was my direct path to the houſe; I entered it, and, looking down the ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, again fancied I ſaw an object moving at a diſtance about fifty yards <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> by ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing white that lay juſt before me in the path. It ſeemed to be a book, a letter, or a folded handkerchief: I ſtooped and took it up—it was a ſheet of paper, folded like a large letter, and tied with a bit of black ribband. The circumſtance rather ſurpriſed than alarmed me: I wondered what it could be, becauſe I knew that the path was never frequented, or at leaſt never by perſons who were likely to drop a paper. I put it into my pocket, and went haſtily towards the houſe; when I got thither, I found my father had been enquiring for me, and I ſoon diſcovered that his temper was much diſturbed. . . For more than two hours I was compelled to ſtay with him, and to liſten to reproaches and ſarcaſms uttered with the utmoſt ill-humour. Alas! I ſhould have borne theſe more calmly, had I not felt that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved his indignation; but now they pierced my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>"The writing appeared to be Ormſby's; but the lines were crooked, and the letters ill formed, as if they had been traced by a weak and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain hand. As I gazed on the paper, that, and every object round me, ſwam before my eyes— again I read the words, again attempted to recal what I had ſeen, or ſuppoſed I had ſeen, in the elm walk, and it ſeemed poſſible that it was Ormſby himſelf—for who elſe could have appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there?—Yet, from whence did he come?— Where had he ſo long been confined, or how could he now eſcape?—If it were indeed himſelf, why did he not approach?—if it had been but to have ſpoken one word to me, with the aſſurance that he lived. . . . Ah! it could not be Ormſby! —Ormſby would never have ſeen me ſo near him,

This uncertainty, and my own conjectures, equally endleſs and uncertain, ſoon became ſo inſupportable, that my reaſon once more threatened to forſake me, and I believe I ſhould have loſt it, had I not communicated to Helene what had happened, and explained to her the purport of the letter. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

I thought too, that if by any ſtrange means which I could not comprehend, nor hardly think poſſible, Ormſby yet lingered round Holmwood, he would be prevented by the preſence of a third perſon from ſpeaking to me. Life was now in my eyes of ſo little value, that to fear, unleſs it were fear of my father, I was inſenſible; and I believe that I ſhould have met with indifference, or rather torpor, the moſt terrific figures that imagination has ever dreſſed out to deter from crimes, or to enforce repentance. In my ſolitary and gloomy walks, however, I ſaw no more any object like that which had before alarmed me, nor did I hear any noiſe but ſuch as I could eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly account for. Every evening, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the weather, or any thing but the precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion neceſſary in regard to my father, I took the

               <p>"But imagine, my Roſalie, if it be poſſible, imagine what I ſuffered, when, about five days after the circumſtance of my finding the letter, I was alarmed by the ſudden entrance of Helene into my room, who breathleſs with ſome new ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, endeavoured to explain ſomething, which it was long before I underſtood. At length I made out, that a neighbouring gentleman in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion was come, as the ſervants believed, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend my father with peace officers, for that a regular complaint had been laid, it was not known by whom, of the ſudden diſappearance of Ormſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; and at length the accuſation of having mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him had been ſo often repeated, and the clamours of the country, where certainly my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had many enemies, had become ſo loud, that the gentleman in queſtion could act no otherwiſe than he did.</p>

I began, however, to carve as uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al for him, but he fixed his eyes on my face, with a look ſo menacing and ſtern, that it was with the utmoſt difficulty I ſupported myſelf. . . . . . . I looked in vain for comfort in the faces around me; the old butler looked as if he pitied, but could not aſſiſt me; and the footman ſeemed to be under ſuch terror, that having made two or three awkward blunders, he received a very ſevere reprimand, and was ordered to leave the room. Our ſilent and melancholy meal was ſoon over, for my father ate little, and I in vain at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to ſwallow.

I will not ſuffer myſelf to ſuppoſe you have forfeited that title. On your part you will be pleaſed to make up your mind, and to diveſt yourſelf of a manner and behaviour which I will ſuffer no longer.

               <p>"This terrible ſentence, which ended in ſo loud a tone as almoſt to ſtun me, deprived me for a moment of my recollection. As ſoon, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, as I was able, I aroſe from my chair, and with difficulty reached the door, my father's eyes following me with a look ſo ſcrutinizing and ang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that I wiſhed at that moment the earth might open beneath my feet, and ſwallow me for ever. I found Helene near the door; for, alarmed by the tranſactions of the morning, and probably by the report of the footman, ſhe waited there for me.

At length the tears and prayers of my faithful Helene reſtored to me ſome degree of recollection.

               <p>"Though I knew great part of this reaſoning was fallacious, I affected to be more calm, that Helene who would not be diſmiſſed, might talk to me no longer.

               <p>"One conſolatory circumſtance happened in the morning, which enabled me to go through it. I received a letter from Mrs. Leſſington, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form me ſhe was arrived at home, and would ſee

I even took courage to meet the piercing eyes of my ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, my ſometimes cruel father, and to repeat, when dinner was over, my queſtion, whether I ſhould read to him?—He again anſwered, No— though with leſs harſhneſs than the evening be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.

An early moon, however, lit up, with faint but cheering radiance, the winter ſky, and her rays glancing through, the leafleſs trees, and falling on the gray trunks of a few arbeals and birches that were ſcattered among the more gloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my elms towards the middle of the line, I could have indulged my ſhuddering fancy in ſuppoſing them, indiſtinctly ſeen as they were, to be ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres beckoning me to the only ſure aſylum of all ſorrows in the cemetery beyond.</p>
               <p>"Why ſhould thoſe fear who have nothing to hope?—Of beings of this world I had no dread; for I was ſo miſerable that religion only arreſted my feeble hands, or they would have been lifted againſt a life which might have been called a living death. Supernatural beings I had never learned to fear. If ſuch were ever permitted to appear, I hoped it might be with tidings of mercy. Thus arguing and reflecting, I had reached the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

the avenue, and ſtood a moment looking at the half-ruined church, and meditating on the horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble idea taken up by the people of the country, that Ormſby was deſtroyed and buried is this place. . . . . What an opinion muſt they have of the violence and ferocity of my father's ſpirit! What an idea of the provocation he had received before they could have ſuppoſed him likely to be driven to extremities ſo dangerous and dreadful! —It was impoſſible but the cauſe for ſuch ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance muſt be ſuſpected. The ſecret of our attachment, my diſgrace and ſhame, then were known, or, what was nearly the ſame thing, gueſſed at. Though I no longer ſuppoſed it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that my father could for a moment harbour a thought ſo contrary to humanity as the deſtruction of the unhappy Ormſby; yet there were a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand daggers for my heart in the reflection that ſuch a hiſtory was the converſation of the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding country, and that the real or imaginary crimes of our family were diſcuſſed by the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and enjoyed by the malicious.</p>
               <p>"But even theſe reflections were eaſe compared to thoſe that aſſailed me when I remembered the converſation of the evening before, and repeated to myſelf the dreadful name of Vyvian.—There is a kind and a degree of grief that annihilates the feelings from its violent preſſure, as the extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of bodily pain are ſaid to deprive the ſufferer of ſenſation. This was the effect which the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of my father had on my mind, now that, alone, and amidſt the ſilence of the night, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

of the future, I forgot the preſent, and was unconſcious of the dreary ſcene around me, till I was ſtartled from my reverie by the ſight of a man, who, coming from among the ruins, ſlowly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached. Rivetted to the ſpot by fear, mingled with a ſtrange deſire to know whether this was a being of another world, or whether it brought me intelligence of Ormſby, I had no power to ſtir. The figure approached, and, as if encouraged by my remaining where I was, ſpoke to me in a low voice, and ſaid ſomething as if entreating me not to be alarmed. But I heard only the beginning of the ſentence; the voice was, I thought, Ormſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by's, and a thouſand ſenſations, which I could neither diſcriminate then, nor can deſcribe now, contributed to deprive me of my ſenſes. The predominant idea, however, was, the hazard Ormſby was in, in thus returning round the houſe, for of any ſupernatural appearance I had none.</p>
               <p>"On recovering ſome degree of recollection, I found myſelf on the ground, and a man kneeling by me, whom I ſtill believed to be Ormſby, till he explained himſelf nearly in theſe words—</p>
               <p>'I have long waited for an opportunity of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to you, Miſs Montalbert—recover your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection—your preſence of mind—the life of Ormſby depends on you.'</p>
               <p>'Of Ormſby?' cried I faintly.</p>
               <p>'Of Ormſby!' anſwered he—'my unfortunate brother. . . . . It is you who muſt either releaſe him; who muſt either reſtore him to life and liberty, or condemn him to end his miſerable days in poverty and impriſonment.'—I have not
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:029524_0231_0FE1D5F7A60B0F38"/>
ſtrength<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Roſalie, to relate every word as it paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſuffice it therefore to tell you, that it was one of the brothers of poor, unhappy Ormſby, who related, that he had come from Ireland on finding that my father had impriſoned Ormſby for debt; and that he had declared to the elder Mr. Ormſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by by letter, that he never would releaſe him, unleſs under the moſt poſitive promiſe, that he would go immediately to India—never again ſee or correſpond with me, and renounce, in the moſt ſolemn manner, every claim that I might have given him to my perſon or my affections. This Ormſby had poſitively refuſed to do. My father, irritated to phrenzy by a circumſtance that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed all his ſuſpicions, declared, in terms of the greateſt violence, that Ormſby ſhould periſh in priſon. His father could do nothing for him; but ſent over his ſecond ſon, only two years older than Ormſby, to endeavour to appeaſe the anger of Mr. Montalbert, by engaging his brother to make the conceſſions that were required of him.</p>
               <p>'I have now,' ſaid the young man, 'lingered about the place more than a fortnight, in hopes of having an opportunity of ſpeaking to you. At the riſk of my life I have attempted to make my way into the houſe, and probably have owed my preſervation to the notion impreſſed upon your father's ſervants, that the reſtleſs ſpirit of my brother, whom they ſuppoſed to have been mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, haunted the houſe and gardens. . . . . . . Now, deareſt Madam,' continued George Orms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, 'if you have, indeed, honoured my brother with your regard, reſolve to ſave him—reſolve
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:029524_0232_0FE1D5AA17E53000"/>
to reſtore to my poor, unhappy parents the peace this fatal circumſtance has robbed them of.'— I aſked faintly, what I could do?—He anſwered, that by conſenting to marry the man propoſed to me by my father, I ſhould end at once the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Ormſby, and ſecure my own peace. I ſhuddered, and was on the point of declaring why it was impoſſible for me to do this, when the noiſe of voices at a diſtance compelled him haſtily to quit me. He retired again among the ruins; and I, without knowing how I found ſtrength, walked towards the houſe. I met Helene and one of the men ſervants coming in ſearch of me. Helene, in accoſting me trembled ſo ſhe could hardly ſpeak—I leaned on her arm and reached the houſe, where I had again to encounter the angry looks and fierce interrogatories of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I know not how I anſwered. Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed by the ſcene I had juſt paſſed, I ſunk once more under the violent agitation of my mind, and could hardly be ſaid to be ſenſible till the ſoothing voice of Mrs. Leſſington, at my bed ſide the next morning, reſtored me in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to my reaſon. But notwithſtanding the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect reliance I had on her friendſhip, I ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have had courage to relate to this dear friend the extent of my imprudence &amp; its conſequences; but Helene had already told her ſo much, that ſhe entered at once upon the ſubject as ſoon as I appeared in a ſtate to attend to her. By tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the blame from me to my father, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled me in ſome meaſure to myſelf; and, with ſome degree of compoſure, I ſuffered her to
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:029524_0233_0FE1D5FE66ED2A08"/>
ſpeak of what could be done in circumſtances ſo dreadful and diſtreſſing.</p>
               <p>"Nothing, however, could be immediately determined upon. I agreed with her, that it was neceſſary her huſband ſhould know my cruel em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſment, for without his aſſiſtance and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation ſhe could do nothing. She gave me in the mean time every conſolation in her power; but I thought I perceived, notwithſtanding ſhe evaded the converſation, that ſhe thought I ought to relinguiſh every idea of ever again ſeeing Ormſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, and that if I could eſcape from the perils of my preſent melancholy ſituation, I ſhould diſpoſe myſelf to act in compliance with my father's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
               <p>"Many were the conferences we now had; but probably it would have been impoſſible to have ſaved me from that death, which my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther might have thought could alone wipe away the diſhonour I had brought upon his family, had not providence interfered in my favour.</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Leſſington now met and converſed with George Ormſby. They agreed that the only means of ſaving his brother was to procure his renunciation of every pretenſion to me in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever form my father ſhould dictate. This I alone could engage him to do; and this at length Mrs. Leſſington extorted from me in a few lines, by which I <hi>asked</hi> this of him. With a trembling hand, and eyes overflowing with tears, I ſigned the fatal paper. Mrs. Leſſington aſſured me, that George Ormſby went immediately with it to
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:029524_0234_0FE1D5B29AC418B8"/>
London.—In about ten days afterwards, Mrs. Leſſington, who remained at Holmwood, inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me ſhe had heard from him; that his brother Charles was releaſed, and on his voyage to India. There was ſomething in all this that I could not comprehend; but I dared not truſt myſelf either with inquiries or conjectures—Ormſby was loſt to me for ever; and I, ſometimes in the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of my ſoul, accuſed him of having abandoned me, though, in more reaſonable moments, I was compelled to acknowledge that his ſtay would have been deſtructive to us both. . . . . . My father, who, as it appeared from his conduct, knew much of the truth, though the loſs of my honour was yet unknown to him, became ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what leſs ſevere towards me. Yet I ſhrunk more than ever from his eye, and my timidity and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror muſt have betrayed me, if the change in my perſon, now every day more evident, could have eſcaped obſervation; but whether it was that the violence of temper, which my father had yielded to in regard to Ormſby, had aggravated his athri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic complaints, or whether his conſtitution was entirely breaking up, he became at this period ſo ill, that a phyſician, who had always ſucceſsfully attended him, was ſent for from London; he gave him ſome relief, but declared, that unleſs he went to town, where conſtant attendance could be given him, the conſequence would be greatly to be apprehended.</p>
               <p>"The reſult of this advice was, that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to London. Thither alſo my friends Mr. and Mrs. Leſſington removed. And Mrs Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſington
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:029524_0235_0FE1D600A01D9A78"/>
being then near her time, it was ſo managed, that when the hour arrived when you, my beloved child, came into the world, you were concealed by Mrs. Leſſington for three weeks, and then produced as twin with the daughter of which ſhe was delivered, who is ſince dead.</p>
               <p>"You may imagine, my Roſalie, how very difficult it was to conceal the fatal ſecret of your birth—you may imagine, for I cannot deſcribe, what were the terrors I had to encounter—the anguiſh of heart with which, when I had once beheld you, once preſſed you to my heart, I ſaw you torn from me, and knew that I ſhould never dare to call you mine, or again to ſhed over you the tears excited by the reſemblance your infant features bore to thoſe of your father.</p>
               <p>"But, on calmer reflection, I agreed with Mrs. Leſſington, who repreſented to me inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly, how thankful I ought to be for the good fortune with which I had ſaved my reputation, if not my life. The ſuſpicions that had been enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, in conſequence of my father's violent conduct towards Ormſby, were now, ſhe ſaid, blown over and forgotten.

I was not however, the leſs miſerable, though I owned the truth of all Mrs. Leſſington urged; and whenever I was alone, I gave way to that anguiſh of heart, which, while I was with her, I endeavoured to repreſs or conceal, becauſe I would not be thought ungrateful, or inſenſible of the obligations I owed to her friendſhip.</p>
               <p>"During my father's very ſevere illneſs, I heard no more of Mr. Vyvian. Indeed I ſeldom ſaw my father, and when it was unavoidable, only for a few minutes. Mrs. Leſſington, in whom he had great confidence, and expreſſed a regard unuſual for him to feel, had contrived to obtain his leave for me to ſtay with her while ſhe was very ill and unable to come to me; and by this management only it was that I eſcaped ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation at the period when I could ſo little bear it. As my father recovered, however, my more conſtant attendance was again neceſſary. He now ſometimes ordered me to read to him, and, when he was ſtill more at eaſe, to play at cheſs with him. I was, indeed, but a poor ſubſtitute for Ormſby or Mr. Hayward; but I fancied that the latter ſometimes got out of the way, as if on purpoſe to make me more neceſſary to my father, and to leave us together.</p>
               <p>"It was in one of theſe tete-a-tete parties, that my father, without much ceremony or much preface, aſked me, whether I had reflected on what he had determined upon in regard to Mr. Vyvian, who would now in a fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

entirely, and ſent you into the country. The latter ſeemed to have loſt his uſual humanity and tenderneſs, and to think that duty, which I had once violated, had now ſtronger claims upon me than before the fatal indiſcretion I had been guilty of. From your father I heard nothing. His family reported every where that he was married to a woman of fortune, with whom he became acquainted on her voyage to India, whither ſhe was ſent for by an uncle, whoſe heireſs ſhe was. This I believed, as I had done many other ſtories that were among the artifices that were uſed to force me into this deteſted marriage. They ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded but too well, or rather the extreme terror I had of my father left me no means of eſcape. I became then the wife of Mr. Vyvian. I have been ever ſince the moſt miſerable of women; my ſon only, and the conſolation of having ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed myſelf to duty, alone ſupported me. Before, however, I was driven into this miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble union, I executed, as I was then of age, a deed of gift, in which I made over, during my life, to Mr. and Mrs. Leſſington, the intereſt of four thouſand pounds, which was the gift of a relation, and which I poſſeſſed independent of my father, but without the power of alienating the principal. This is part of the money which Mr. Vyvian has ſo often reproached me with <hi>wasting,</hi> as he terms it, on begging monks and canting hypocrites; though, had I really beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it on my neceſſitous fellow creatures, I ſhould have thought myſelf well juſtified in ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of it.</p>

                  <pb n="237" facs="unknown:029524_0239_0FE1D603D93552C8"/>"I had not been married above fifteen months when my father died, and left Mr. Vyvian in poſſeſſion of that fortune, which was undoubtedly his chief motive for overlooking my reluctance which I repeatedly avowed to him, and which he well knew accompanied me to the altar. After my father's death, he no longer affected to treat me with the leaſt regard. We went abroad for ſome years, which ſerved in ſome meaſure to relieve and diſſipate the heavineſs of my heart. I had often the conſolation of hearing from Mrs. Leſſington: and in her letters, with the account ſhe gave me of her family, my Roſalie, as one of that family, was always mentioned. When I returned to England, I found you, child of my fond affections, all that my fancy could form of lovelineſs and perfection.

Montalbert; and the eagerneſs with which Mrs. Leſſington and Mr. Hayward had adopted the views of Mr. Montalbert, though they knew her ſituation, were a combination of circumſtances which ſeemed to leave no doubt in the mind of Roſalie but that her mother had been betrayed by ſome or all of thoſe whom ſhe conſidered as her beſt friends. Their motives were probably good; but Roſalie could not help reflecting, that had not ſuch been their conduct, ſhe might now have been the acknowledged daughter of the moſt tender and affectionate of mothers; ſhe might have known and been bleſſed by the fondneſs and protection of her father; and they might in a happy union have effaced the remembrance of their early indiſcretion; for the death of Mr. Montalbert would ſoon have left his daughter at liberty: and her life would not have been paſſed in the miſeries of ſuch a marriage, nor her ſpirits have been overwhelmed with the conſciouſneſs of being the wife of one man while her whole heart was another's.

               <p>Roſalie ſaw that, from this unlucky arrrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhe ſhould be deprived of the conſolation ſhe might derive from the advice and converſation of her beſt friend, when ſhe moſt wanted ſuch comforts. The averſion that Barbara Vyvian ſeemed to have to her was even greater than that of Mrs. Boſworth; and on recollecting ſeveral circumſtances that had happened ſince the eſtrangement the ſiſters had ſhewn towards her, Roſalie could not but imagine that they knew, or ſuſpected, her near relationſhip to their mother. . . . . . . . Ingenuous and liberal as her own heart was, ſhe imagined not that it was poſſible for envy only, malignant hatred of ſuperior excellence and beauty, to call forth the ill-humour and provoke the ill offices of theſe young women, though ſhe had already had a ſpecimen of the effect of thoſe odious paſſions in the behaviour of the Miſs Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingtons, whom ſhe once thought her ſiſters.</p>
               <p>In this family ſhe now ſeemed to be almoſt a ſtranger. The character of Mrs. Leſſington, ſince the death of her huſband, ſeemed totally changed; and her paſſion for cards, and for the ſociety of the ſet of people among whom ſhe now lived, abſorbed almoſt every other feeling but her paſſion for money. To Roſalie ſhe was not only become perfectly indifferent; but ſeemed weary of the taſk of affecting ſentiments ſhe did not feel. From the preſent ſituation of Mrs. Vyvian, it was probable ſhe would never be able to increaſe the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

adopting her daughter, and her former and long attachment to her, ſeemed, if not entirely forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, at leaſt inſufficient now to urge her to any exertions of friendſhip and attention. She ſeldom ſaw Mrs. Vyvian, and, when ſhe did, her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation related entirely to people with whom the latter held no intercourſe, and her viſit ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be always a matter of ceremony rather than of choi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. Though the ſolitude in which Roſalie was left, was infinitely the moſt pleaſing circumſtance of her preſent reſidence, yet ſhe could not but imagine that the ſtyle in which ſhe was treated in the family muſt occaſion ſuſpicions of the truth. The difficulties of concealing for a ſeries of years ſuch a ſecret, appeared the more wonderful the longer ſhe thought of it. But, from theſe meditations on the extraordinary e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents Mrs. Vyvian had related to her, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered herſelf only to reflect on what was to be her future fate. Her mother had been abandoned by the man to whom ſhe had ſacrificed her honor and her peace. And though probably it was to preſerve her life and his own that this ſeparation had been ſubmitted to, though it was certain that compulſion had at firſt been uſed to bring about this cruel ſeparation, and that reaſon and a reſpect for the object of his unfortunate love had after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards prevented Mr. Ormſby from making any attempt to write to her, Roſalie could not think, without extreme pain, that even <hi>such</hi> an attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was not proof againſt time and abſence. Mrs. Vyvian had ſaid, that ſhe believed that though Ormſby ſtill lived, he had forgotten <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

entirely. She added, that ſhe moſt ſincerely <hi>hoped he had;</hi> but, as ſhe ſaid this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> her tears fell more abundantly, and her heart ſeemed to feel all the bitterneſs that attends the conviction of being forgotten by thoſe we have fondly loved. Roſalie thought that nothing could ever induce her even to <hi>say,</hi> that ſhe wiſhed to be forgotten by Montalbert.</p>
               <p>It was now ſome weeks ſince ſhe had heard from him. There had even been time for an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to Mrs. Vyvian's le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>When ſhe ſaw her mother in the morning, it was with increaſed concern ſhe obſerved the deep dejection into which Mrs. Vyvian had ſunk. The little ſtrength which ſhe had collected to enable her to relate to Roſalie what it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary ſhe ſhould know, was now exhauſted: and pale and languid, ſhe appeared to ſuſtain with difficulty the fatigue of leaving her bed to receive her daughters, who were to be with her at noon: the one to take leave of her again for ſome time, the other to become a reſident in a houſe which offered ſcenes ſo different from thoſe to which ſhe had long been accuſtomed.</p>
               <p>As the ſight of Roſalie ſeemed rather more deeply to affect than to relieve her mother, ſhe ſhortened her viſit, and returned to her uſual home, where ſhe paſſed the day entirely alone;

               <p>In the evening ſhe ſat down to write to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talbert, and had nearly finiſhed her letter, when a maid (for there were only two female ſervants in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But a young Sicilian nobleman, with whom I was brought up, and who is diſtantly related to my mother, was exactly at that period returning to Sicily for a few months. I communicated my diſtreſs to him, and he managed the difficulty ſo well, that I obtained a ſhort leave of abſence, and am now ſuppoſed to be with him in Sicily. A thouſand circumſtances may happen to betray me. But I truſt much to the friendſhip and prevoyance of my friend to guard againſt detection at preſent; and, for the future, I know my Roſalie will not ſhrink from any trial of that affection which makes the happineſs of my exiſtence—even though a greater ſacrifice were required of her than to quit her preſent abode."</p>
               <p>The anſwer that Roſalie gave to this was, that with him every place and every country would be equally pleaſant to her.

There you may live, my Roſalie, unremarked and unqueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; and there I can paſs months with you,
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:029524_0248_0FE1D616A64A5288"/>
without incurring, on the part of my mother, any ſuſpicion, or any other remonſtrance, than muſt in every event ariſe from my refuſal of the match ſhe wiſhes to make for me. When, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſhe finds I am determined, and loſes her apprehenſions of my forming ſome attachment to an Engliſh-woman and a Proteſtant, I ſhall be left at liberty to wander about Italy occaſionally as I uſed to do: and we may be happy at the preſent with each other, without riſking the loſs of that proſperity hereafter, in which it is the firſt wiſh of my heart to place you."</p>
               <p>This plan appeared to Roſalie not only practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, but delightful. The unfeigned pleaſure with which ſhe embraced it ſeemed to redouble the ſatisfaction with which Montalbert expatiated on their future proſpects. He appeared, indeed, to have thought of every thing, and ſettled what ſhould be ſaid to perſons in England, to account for her departure. It was to be given out, that Mrs. Vyvian had procured for her a ſituation in a foreign family of diſtinction, who were deſirous of having a young Engliſhwoman as inſtructreſs to their daughters; an eſtabliſhment, which, as Roſalie Leſſington was left entirely without for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, was extremely advantageous and deſirable. —However improbable ſuch an arrangement might appear to thoſe who were acquainted with Italian cuſtoms and manners, Roſalie and Montal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert agreed, that there were none of that deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among thoſe who were likely to inquire of the Leſſington family; ſhe had appeared, indeed, ſo little in their ſocieties, that it was probable ſhe would ſoon be wholly forgotten.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="247" facs="unknown:029524_0249_0FE1BAB9B7A46280"/>Mrs. Boſworth and Miſs Vyvian were certainly more likely to inquire after her with more active malignity, and, doubting any ſtory that was at all unlikely, to form conjectures to her diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. But, as the journey of Montalbert, at this period, was unknown to them, as they had no communication with the Leſſington family, and were both too proud to annex any conſequence to Roſalie, except what ſhe had derived from their fears of their brother's or their mother's too great affection for her, it was probable that when they ſaw her, and heard of her no more, they would ceaſe to think about her.</p>
               <p>It was, however, a very inconvenient circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to them, that the preſence of Barbara Vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian prevented Montalbert's ſeeing her mother, with whom it was ſo neceſſary for him to conſult. As he could not ſtay more than a week in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, there was not a moment to loſe. Many purchaſes were to be made for Roſalie, as well as many precautions to be taken; and it was proper that Mrs. Vyvian and Mrs. Leſſington ſhould meet to adjuſt ſeveral points relative to a perſon in whom both were intereſted.</p>
               <p>After ſome debate how to obtain admittance to Mrs. Vyvian, it was agreed that this could be done only by the means of Mr. Hayward. To him, therefore, Montalbert immediately wrote, engaging him to meet him at a tavern early the following morning. Then reluctantly, and not without her repeating her remonſtrances on the impropriety of his ſtaying any longer, he took leave of Roſalie, and retired for the night to the
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:029524_0250_0FE1D618E03BEC30"/>
houſe, where, in purſuance of his appointment, Mr. Hayward came to him the next day at ſix o'clock.</p>
               <p>They together contrived ſo well, that Mrs. Leſſington was admitted to the apartment of her friend without any ſuſpicion on the part of Miſs Vyvian; and in a few days every neceſſary ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement was made, and Roſalie ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part.</p>
               <p>There were in England only two perſons, of whom to take leave for ſo long a time, perhaps for ever, gave her ſevere pain. Theſe were her real mother, for whom her affection ſeemed to be greater than if ſhe had been accuſtomed always to conſider her in that endearing relationſhip, and the eldeſt Mr. Leſſington, from whom ſhe had for ſo many years received inſtruction, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards whom ſhe had been uſed to look for future protection and regard. To him, however, ſhe could have no opportunity of ſaying farewel, as he was gone into Wales with a young man of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, from whom he had expectations of prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Roſalie dared not even write to him, as Mrs. Leſſington, for ſome reaſon or other, object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it; ſhe was compelled, therefore, to go without bidding him adieu.</p>
               <p>Her parting with her mother was attended with many tears on both ſides; but each wiſhed to ſhorten a painful ſcene, which it was not ſafe long to continue, as Roſalie and Montalbert were introduced into the houſe by ſtealth. This ſad farewel being over, they got into a hackney <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Having recovered from the latter, and wondered at the novelty which a French town preſents to one who never before croſſed the channel, the travellers proceeded, after a few days reſt, to Paris, and from thence to Lyons. Roſalie, though delighted with her journey, and acquiring new ideas at every ſtep, was impatient to proceed, becauſe ſhe dreaded nothing ſo much as that the mother of Montal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert ſhould diſcover, by his protracted ſtay, that
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:029524_0252_0FE1D61A7B258290"/>
he had been to England; while he, more ſolicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for the health of his lovely wife, than influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced by any other motive, regulated his journey rather by her convenience, than by the neceſſity of appearing in proper time from his ſuppoſed Sicilian voyage, leaving to his friend, the Count of —, the care of keeping up appearances for him as well as he could.</p>
               <p>Had not apprehenſions of what might happen to embitter his future felicity a little derogated from the enjoyment of the preſent, it would have been difficult to have found a happier being than Montalbert. While he pointed out to Roſalie the beauty of the country through which they were paſſing, every ſcene, every view, ſeemed to acquire new charms. The pleaſure which the varied proſpects of nature gave to her young and unadulterated heart, the deſire of information ſhe expreſſed, and the ſenſe and ſolidity of her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, communicated to him delight more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite than that which he felt in contemplating the beauty of her form and face, which he could not but obſerve, attracted univerſal admiration wherever ſhe appeared, even in the haſte of a journey, and under the few advantages of a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling dreſs.</p>
               <p>In France, ſuperior or even common beauty is generally much noticed; and almoſt at every poſt town Montalbert heard ſome obſervation on the lovelineſs of <hi>la jeune Anglaise:</hi> or, if they remained in any city more than a day, had an attempt made by ſome gay young man or other to be introduced to his notice.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="251" facs="unknown:029524_0253_0FE1D641904A45D8"/>From theſe ſort of acquaintance, however, Montalbert ſhrunk, with a ſenſibility unuſual on ſuch occaſions to his natural character, which was open, unſuſpicious, and ſociable. He not unfrequently was ſenſible of ſomething like jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy, for which he failed not to reaſon with himſelf. But ſtill his diſlike of the adulation which he ſaw likely to be offered to his wife, wherever ſhe appeared, conquered the ſenſe he had of the abſurdity of feeling ſuch a ſentiment in regard to her, who was all innocence and ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city; who certainly lived but to pleaſe him, and was ſo unconſcious of her perſonal attractions as not to have the leaſt idea of the reaſons which made him avoid every ſort of ſociety on the road. She imputed his ſhunning it, to the fear he had, leſt he ſhould be met by ſome of his former ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, who might betray to his mother his preſent expedition.—There was, however, in this reſerve of Montalbert's leſs of perſonal jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy than of another ſentiment. The mind of Roſalie, unadulterated by the falſe refinements of modern education, and yet new to the world, ſeemed, to her huſband, capable of being adorned with all that lends grace to beauty, and gives perfection to genius. She had ſeen ſo little of ſociety ſince her ſhort reſidence near London, that the bloom of the mind (if ſuch an expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion may be allowed) had not been tarniſhed by any commerce with inferior ſociety, or the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſtudies of a circulating library. Her natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral underſtanding was excellent: and ſhe had more judgment than generally attends on ſo much
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:029524_0254_0FE1D61C1AAEA0A0"/>
genius as ſhe poſſeſſed; but hitherto this judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had been unexerciſed, and this genius dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant.</p>
               <p>The little ſhe had read was but ill-calculated to form the firſt: and the ſociety ſhe had been uſually among, had allowed her little ſcope for the latter. But, at a very early period of her life ſhe became conſcious, that ſuch ſort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as ſhe was uſually thrown among, people who only eſcape from dullneſs by flying to defamation, were extremely tireſome to her, though ſhe ſaw that nobody elſe thought ſo, and ſuſpected herſelf of being faſtidious and perverſe. The cold, and ſometimes contemptuous treatment ſhe had met with from her ſuppoſed ſiſters, the little real affection ſhe had ever found from the perſons whom ſhe believed to be her parents, had render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her timid and diffident.—As nobody but Mrs. Vyvian ſeemed to love her, ſhe ſuppoſed that to none but Mrs. Vyvian ſhe ſeemed worthy of affection. Since the explanation that had been given, all the paſſages of her former life appeared in a new light: and ſhe accounted for the indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of her ſuppoſed, and the tenderneſs of her real, parent.</p>
               <p>This extraordinary diſcovery was a frequent topic of converſation between her and Montal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert as they purſued on their journey: and they often canvaſſed the circumſtances that would, if the narrative of Mrs. Vyvian had been leſs au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticated, have given riſe to incredulity.— Montalbert, when he firſt heard it from Roſalie, had remarked theſe circumſtances—"It is
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:029524_0255_0FE1D649B7DF9AA8"/>
ſtrange" ſaid he "that the account you have giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en of your father's preſent ſituation is ſo vague, ſo indiſtinct, that you have no clue to guide you even to the certainty of his exiſtence, none by which you can identify yourſelf to him. I can make every allowance for the ſingular circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in which Mrs. Vyvian was placed; for the timidity of her temper, and for the violence of my grandfather, whom I have always heard re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented as a tyrant, who was not to be, would not be, contradicted. Still it appears equally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate and ſtrange, that ſhe omitted to tell you whether he knew of your birth? whether the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of Ormſby were appriſed of it?"</p>
               <p>In anſwer to theſe remarks, the juſtice of which ſhe however acknowledged, Roſalie bade him recollect, how much of all the circumſtances moſt interreſting to her might be unknown, even to Mrs. Vyvian herſelf.</p>
               <p>"When I remember" ſaid ſhe "the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and manner of my mother, when ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called thoſe ſcenes in which ſhe ſuffered ſo cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when I think how little capable ſhe was, even at this diſtance of time, of dwelling on thoſe parts of her ſtory, where ſhe had occaſion to name my unfortunate father, and the awe ſhe had of her own, as well as the tyranny ſhe had ſince experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced from Mr. Vyvian, and the neceſſity there has ever been for ſecrecy as to a part of her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer life, which would undoubtedly have aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated her actual ſorrows, I cannot wonder, though, perhaps, I may have occaſion to lament the incomplete information this dear unhappy pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:029524_0256_0FE1D6239447C1D8"/>
has given me. . . . . I have ſeen her lips tremble, and cold and death-like dew on her temples, while, in a languid voice, ſhe was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating what I have repeated to you; and I know that no motives leſs powerful than her love and her fears for me could have engaged her to write as ſhe did to you. Long years of ſorrow have ſo broken her ſpirits, that the moſt gloomy ideas ſometimes take poſſeſſion of her mind; ſhe trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, leſt incidents in her life, for which ſurely ſhe has already been puniſhed ſufficiently, ſhould ſtill draw the anger of Heaven on her children, as well as hazard her future happineſs. She thinks, that ſhe ſhould not have deceived Mr. Vyvian; though, had ſhe not done ſo, there is no imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what might have been the conſequence from the furious temper of her father; and the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of having done ſo has made her patiently ſubmit to every unworthy treatment—offering" to uſe her own pathetic phraſe "her ſufferings as a ſacrifice to the God whom ſhe had offended, and hoping their bitterneſs and duration might expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the errors of her early life.—From hence I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for many parts of my mother's conduct," continued Roſalie, "that before appeared myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious—her ſevere penances, her voluntary reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the world—and her patient ſubmiſſion to the undutiful and even cruel conduct of her daughters. And from the pains theſe ladies took to alarm her about their brother's attachment to me, though ignorant of all the agonies they were inflicting, I have an explanation of that forced and involuntary neglect of me, which rendered
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:029524_0257_0FE1D64B585606B8"/>
me ſo very wretched for ſome time, and of which I am perſuaded nothing but this cruel idea could have induced her to aſſume even the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance."</p>
               <p>Montalbert liſtened ſilently to this natural and ſenſible vindication of conduct, which appeared to him more extraordinary and leſs accountable than it did to Roſalie. He thought it, indeed, almoſt impoſſible that Mr. Vyvian ſhould be ſo ignorant of his wife's former attachment as he ſeemed to be; and he was ſure that her father had known, if not all, yet ſo much of the truth, as had induced him to act in concert with Ormſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by's family, or at leaſt to compel them ſo to act with him as to have ſaved his daughter's reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at the expence of her happineſs.</p>
               <p>The converſation on this ſubject was frequently renewed during the progreſs of their journey: and the tears of Roſalie as often flowed from the recollection of the ſad ſtate of ſpirits and health in which ſhe had left her mother. So great were Mrs. Vyvian's apprehenſions of any accident, that might diſcover the ſecret ſo long cheriſhed like a ſerpent in her boſom, that ſhe had deſired Roſalie and Montalbert not to write to her on the way; thus depriving herſelf of what ſhe owned would be one great alleviation of the reſtraint and miſery under which ſhe was condemned to repine. The moments of reflection, therefore, on the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy hours of this beloved parent, were the only moments that paſſed without pleaſure, amounting ſometimes to rapture, when, as ſhe approached
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:029524_0258_0FE1D6257A31D3C0"/>
the Alps, the moſt ſublime and magnificent views of nature were opened to her aſtoniſhed view.</p>
               <p>Accuſtomed of late to the flat, monotonous, and unintereſting views round London, ſhe had frequently ſighed for the more animating land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcapes of her native country; and had no ideas of beauty ſuperior to that which is formed by thoſe green and undulating hills, in ſome places fringed half-way up by beech woods, in others rearing their turfy mounds, covered with ſheep on one ſide above the once impenetrable foreſts of the weald, on the other gradually declining towards the apparently boundleſs ocean that forms the Engliſh channel.</p>
               <p>But when ſhe ſaw the rich and luxuriant coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which nature, "with all her great works about her," ſpreads before the aſtoniſhed travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, between Lyons and Civita Vecchia, the port from whence Montalbert determined to embark for Sicily, in order to avoid both Rome and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, her mind was exalted by ſcenes ſo much ſuperior to any ſhe had ever formed an idea of either from the efforts of the pen or the pencil. She ſeemed tranſported to a world of higher rank in the univerſe than that ſhe had inhabited while ſhe was in England; and ſhe was of an age and diſpoſition to forget, or at leaſt be indifferent to thoſe circumſtances which can hardly fail to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind Engliſh travellers, that, though other countries may have more bold and attractive ſcenery, their own is that where life is enjoyed with the greateſt comfort.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="257" facs="unknown:029524_0259_0FE1D64CF500E0D0"/>Arrived at Civita Vecchia, after an abſence of ten weeks, from England, Montalbert felt ſome degree of uneaſineſs when he knew he muſt hear from his friend, the Count d'Alozzi, what had paſſed during his abſence. From this he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by finding a ſervant of the Count's waiting for him with a ſmall veſſel hired to convey him and Roſalie to Meſſina, where the Count waited his arrival, that, after Roſalie was fixed at the habitation he had prepared for her, they might return together to Naples.</p>
               <p>Montalbert, who now ſaw himſelf freed from the painful ſolicitudes that had ſo long perplexed him, would not, however, liſten to Roſalie's en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties to embark immediately. But, fearful of expoſing her too ſoon to ſea-ſickneſs after the ſati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Montalbert, however, who knew that this was not a place where it was likely he ſhould be known, remained with great tranquillity for three days. All ſeemed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

The weather, however, was mild, and the wind favourable; and a voyage begun thus propitiouſly was as happily concluded, though not till they had been eight days at ſea. On the
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:029524_0260_0FE1D62720F2DC38"/>
evening of the laſt, by as bright a moon as ever enlightened the ſwelling waves of the Mediterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean, they entered the port of Meſſina. Never did the magnificent ſpectacle it afforded give more delight than Roſalie felt, as, ſitting upon deck, Montalbert pointed out to her the beauty of the ſcene. The inconveniences and tediouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the voyage were no longer remembered. As the veſſel ſlowly approached the ſhore, every object, in the beautiful bay, was diſtinctly viſible. The bright light of the moon fell on the long line of magnificent buildings that overlook the Faro of Meſſina, above which roſe the mountains, whoſe outline was boldly marked in the deep blue aether, while Etna, no otherwiſe diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than by its towering grandeur, roſe ſublimely above the reſt.

him to appear publicly with his wife, and, after one day of repoſe at his lodgings, they removed in a carriage, with which they were accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated by the Count to the villa he had lent them, at the diſtance of hardly three miles from Meſſina, where they found every thing that could contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to their convenience; and were, in a few days, as much ſettled, as if they had already inhabited this enchanting ſpot for many years.</p>

Even the verdure

of England was in ſome meaſure enjoyed here amid the glowing ſuns of Italy; for the higher lands are refreſhed by dews, which prevent their being parched like the plains. Beyond the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſure, ſhrubs, which are carefully cultivated in England, grew ſpontaneouſly, and formed a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural wilderneſs of the gayeſt colours and lighteſt foliage. From hence the moſt glorious view preſented itſelf that imagination could picture: the ſea, and the oppoſite coaſt of Calabria; the Lipari iſlands; Strombolo, marked by a black wreath of curling ſmoke ſtaining the mild and clear ſky; innumerable veſſels ſcattered about the blue expanſe of water; and the faro of Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſina giving to the whole a new and ſingular fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, connecting the varieties of an extenſive ſea view with a port, ſeemed almoſt to unite the iſland to the oppoſite continent.</p>

himſelf obliged to make to Montalbert, that he muſt either determine to go back to Naples, or give up the plan of concealment which had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy coſt him ſo much trouble. Roſalie in her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous and intereſting manner, confeſſed their obligations to him, but ſighed, and with difficulty reſtrained from tears; while acknowledging the truth of his obſervations, ſhe trembled at the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of yielding to them.</p>
               <p>Montalbert, with whom reaſon and love were at variance with each other, became every day more gloomy, penſive, and uneaſy. Sometimes he determined to hazard every thing rather than leave her. "After all," ſaid he, as he entered into theſe arguments with himſelf—"after all, what is it that I am contending for?—for what is it that I am ſacrificing thoſe hours that will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn no more?—for money which I may never enjoy—for high proſperity which is not, that I know of, conducive to real happineſs. Is it not true, that a day, an hour, at this ſeaſon of my life, is worth half an age towards its cloſe?—Yet I am throwing away theſe precious hours of youth and health, in hopes of being a very rich man hereafter."</p>
               <p>However, theſe arguments, whatever might be their ſolidity, if tried by the maxims of Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curean Philoſophy, ſometimes yielded to other conſiderations.—He was not devoid of ambition; nor could he wholly diveſt himſelf of that ſort of attachment towards his mother, which, though it had more of fear than of love it it, had become a ſort of principle from habit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="262" facs="unknown:029524_0264_0FE1D630A64122F8"/>His frequent fits of ſilence, his melancholy look, and long ſolitary walks by the ſea ſide, the evident irreſolution and deep depreſſion he labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under, gave to Roſalie the moſt poignant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs. She ſometimes was afraid of increaſing theſe ſymptoms of a mind, ill at eaſe, by appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to notice them. At other times ſhe ventured gently to remonſtrate with him. At length, after a conference of ſome hours with Alozzi, he ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly took a reſolution to depart the next day. Alozzi was returning to Naples, and they were to embark together.</p>
               <p>This reſolution he ſeemed to have adopted in conſequence of having reflected, that, if he did not ſoon go, he might not return time enough for the hour ſo dreaded, yet ſo deſired, when Roſalie might give birth to another being only leſs dear to him than herſelf. This was to be expected now within two months. To be abſent at ſuch a time was infinitely more formidable to his imagination than leaving her now; and, as if this had never occurred to him before, he now reſolutely determined to tear himſelf away.</p>
               <p>Roſalie ſaw him depart with anguiſh of heart, which ſhe endeavoured to ſtifle, that what he felt might not be increaſed. But when Alozzi had carried him off, almoſt by force, ſo dreadful did it ſeem to him to ſay adieu!—ſhe was ſo much affected, that ſhe could not remain at the window till they were out of ſight; but, ſhutting her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in her own appartment, ſhe gave herſelf up to tears.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="263" facs="unknown:029524_0265_0FE1D655CD920790"/>The remonſtrances, however, of her Italian woman, who was already much attached to her, and the care which, under ſuch circumſtances, ſhe owed to her own health, even for his ſake, whoſe abſence ſhe lamented, rouſed her at length from this indulgence of uſeleſs regret. She now ſought to amuſe her mind by contemplating anew the ſcenes around her; but their charms were in a great meaſure loſt. Montalbert was no longer with her to point out the beauties that every where ſurrounded their abode, or to enjoy them with her. There was an aweful ſublimity in the great outline of Etna, its deep foreſts, and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent features, which afforded a kind of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy pleaſure. Not in ſituation to explore the ſcenes it offered more minutely, yet feeling infinite curioſity, ſhe endeavoured to amuſe her mind with the proſpect of future days. Montal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert would return to her; ſhe ſhould be bleſſed in beholding his tenderneſs for his child; ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In the mean time ſhe determined to paſs the heavy, heavy hours in cultivating the talents he loved. She took up her pencils, and, ſtrolling into the garden, placed herſelf on the ſeat where, as they often fat toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he had pointed out to her ſome points of view which were particularly favourable to the painter. She would have ſketched them, but her efforts were faint and uncertain. In ſpite of all her exertions, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ark preſentiments of future evil hung upon her ſpirits. Their depreſſion ſhe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:029524_0266_0FE1D63270077C88"/>
to her perſonal ſufferings. The period, to which it was ſo natural for her to look forward with dread, was now near. She had heard, indeed, that in the climate of Sicily infinitely leſs was to be apprehended than in England. But this ſhe only knew from the report of perſons who might ſay it to appeaſe her ſears and reaſſure her ſpirits. Perhaps it was her deſtiny to be ſnatched from Montalbert, to releaſe him from his embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſment, and to make room for the Roman lady, to whom his mother was ſo deſirous of uniting him.—While theſe thoughts paſſed through her mind, in gloomy ſucceſſion, ſhe repeated, from the little, ſimple ballad of Gay—
<q>
                     <l>"Thou'lt meet a happier maiden,</l>
                     <l>"But none that loves thee ſo!"</l>
                  </q>
At length, however ſlowly, the tedious hours wore away. Montalbert returned. He return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed apparently more enamoured than before this abſence of nine weeks, and Roſalie forgot that ſhe had ever been unhappy.</p>
               <p>When, the firſt joy of their meeting being a little ſubdued, Roſalie ſpoke to her huſband of his mother, ſhe fancied that though he declined converſation on the ſubject, he was in reality leſs anxious about the future conſequences of his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage than ſhe had ever yet ſeen him. When he could not wholly evade ſpeaking on the ſubject, he affected an indifference, which made Roſalie believe he was himſelf at eaſe; for, little ſkilled herſelf in diſſimulation, ſhe did not for a moment imagine that this tranquillity was artificial.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="265" facs="unknown:029524_0267_0FE1D657690D52B8"/>At length the hour arrived when real joy ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to this external calm. Roſalie brought into the world a lovely boy: and her own health was ſo ſoon re-eſtabliſhed, that, in a very few weeks, her beauty appeared more brilliant than before her confinement. More attached to her than ever, Montalbert could hardly bear to have her a moment out of his ſight; yet the time was come, when, if he followed the dictates of that prudence to which he had already made ſo many ſacrifices, he muſt return to Naples.</p>
               <p>Alozzi, whoſe friendſhip for him appeared to be undiminiſhed, failed not to remind Montalbert of the neceſſity of this return. But his remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances, however reaſonable and gentle, were always received with uneaſineſs, and ſometimes with impatience and ill-humour. The viſits of Alozzi had not been more frequent than formerly; on the contrary, he had been more rarely their viſitor than during his former ſtay at Meſſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> though he returned thither before Montalbert, he never appeared at the reſidence of Roſalie till his friend arrived there. Notwithſtanding theſe precautions, however, the fault of Montalbert's temper found food to nouriſh itſelf in the looks of Alozzi, who he fancied, regarded Roſalie <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> too much admiration, and ſometimes fixed on her eyes in which paſſion and hope were too evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently expreſſed. This idea having once ſeized the imagination of Montalbert, became a ſource of inexpreſſible torment: and when he reflected, that he muſt ſoon leave his wife in the houſe of this friend, who was, he perſuaded himſelf, in
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:029524_0268_0FE1D6341059E5D8"/>
love with her, neither her virtues, nor her at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to him, neither the honour of his friend nor the confidence he ought to have had in Roſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, were ſufficient to quiet his apprehenſions, though he felt them to be alike injurious to his own peace, and to that of thoſe whom he moſt loved.</p>
               <p>Sometimes he gazed on Roſalie as ſhe ſat with his boy ſleeping in her arms, and tried to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade himſelf, that if once his mother could ſee theſe intereſting creatures, ſhe would not only pardon him, but receive them to her protection and tenderneſs. Then, recollecting what had paſſed during his laſt viſit to this violent and impracticable parent, he felt that all ſuch hopes were deluſive. He became aſhamed of what often appeared to him an unpardonable meanneſs, and reſolved, at whatever pecuniary riſk, to throw off a yoke which degraded him in his own eyes; to produce his wife and his child and abide the conſequences of his mother's diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
               <p>While Montalbert was thus deliberating, and every hour forming and abandoning projects for the future, a letter he received from Naples, compelled him to adopt the meaſure of immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately going thither. It was from a female rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who uſually reſided with his mother; and who now informed him, that ſhe was extremely ill, and it was abſolutely neceſſary for him to ſee her as immediately as poſſible.</p>
               <p>Wretched is the policy which too often puts at variance the beſt feelings of human nature; which ſets the parent againſt the child, becauſe
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:029524_0269_0FE1D6590BA87F40"/>
expences either affect his eaſe, or are painful to his avarice; which eſtrange the brother from the ſiſter, and make enemies of the amiable and love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly group, who, but a few, a very few years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, were happy aſſociates in the innocent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thoughtleſs hours of childhood.—Ah! wretched is the policy which makes the ſon too often rejoice when ſhe who bore him and nouriſhed him min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles with the duſt; when thoſe eyes are cloſed which have ſo often been filled with tears of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der anxiety as they gazed on him!—and yet all the contrivances, which cunning and caution have invented for the ſecurity of property, have a direct tendency to occaſion all this, while miſtaken views of happineſs, unfortunate miſtakes in the head, or deficiency of feeling in the heart, do the reſt, and occaſion more than half the miſeries of life.</p>
               <p>Montalbert, on receiving the letter that gave him notice of his mother's danger, felt, for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that he was her ſon; but almoſt as ſoon this ſenſe of filial duty and affection was loſt in an involuntary recollection of the releaſe which her death would give him from the pain of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing a clandeſtine marriage, or reducing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his poſterity to indigence if he betrayed it.</p>
               <p>He had no ſooner felt this ſentiment ariſe in his mind than he was ſhocked at and reſiſted it; but again it aroſe: and he found all his affection for his mother weak, when oppoſed to the idea of the advantages he might derive from her quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the world where ſhe alone was the barrier
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:029524_0270_0FE1D6364522F100"/>
between him and happineſs with the woman he adored.</p>
               <p>It was not, however, a time to inveſtigate theſe ſentiments deeply, but to act in purſuance of the letter. He haſtened, therefore, to inform his wife of its contents, who agreed with him entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as to the urgency of his immediate departure, yet wept and hung about him as if impreſſed with ſome unuſual apprehenſion of future ſorrow; and, as ſhe kiſſed her child, ſhe almoſt drowned it with her tears.</p>
               <p>Montalbert, who felt none of this violent grief at an abſence, the duration of which would, as he thought, depend on himſelf, conſoled her with views of future proſperity and uninterrupted hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. Alozzi had a few days before left Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, and was gone to Agrigentum, where he intended to remain ſome time. Montalbert, therefore, who had no doubt but that he ſhould return within five or ſix weeks, felt no uneaſineſs at the thoughts of leaving to frequent interviews with his wife, in his abſence, a man whom all his reaſon did not enable him to ſee with her, in his preſence, without pain.</p>
               <p>The letter Montalbert had received was written in ſuch preſſing terms, that there was no time to be loſt; and he determined to begin his journey on the next day.</p>
               <p>Roſalie, far from feeling the uſual tranquility, ſaw the moment of his bidding her adieu arrive with agonies of ſorrow, which ſhe knew not how to account for—yet could not ſtifle or command. Nothing new had occurred in her ſituation to
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:029524_0271_0FE1D6614B162E38"/>
make this abſence more dreadful than the two preceding ones. Indeed it ſhould have been otherwiſe, for the preſence of her infant, on which ſhe doated with all the fondneſs of a firſt maternal affection, was what was moſt likely to conſole her in this temporary parting from its father: nor had ſhe to ſay, with the unhappy Dido—
<q>
                     <l>"Si quis mihi parvulus aula</l>
                     <l>"Luderet Aeneas, qui te tantum ore referret;</l>

               </p>
               <p>The ſervants about her were the ſame as thoſe with whom ſhe had formerly reaſon to be ſatisfied. The ſituation around her offered all that the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> lively ſcenes of nature could do to aſſuage the pain inflicted by her huſband's involuntary and ſhort abſence. All this ſhe urged to appeaſe the tumult of her ſpirits. She owned the juſtice of it all: but nothing gave her any conſolation; and, when ſhe at laſt allowed him to tear himſelf away, the reſolution to ſee him depart was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by an effort ſo painful, that he was hardly out of ſight before her ſenſes forſook her; and it was many hours before the remoſtrances of Zuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etta, her Italian maid, and of an older woman who aſſiſted in the care of her infant boy, ſo far rouſed her from the deſpondence into which ſhe fell, as to engage her to attend to the care of her own health, on which depended that of the child ſhe nouriſhed at her breaſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="270" facs="unknown:029524_0272_0FE1D63B84CAD268"/>By degrees, however, ſhe became more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. She received a cheerful letter from Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talbert, ſent by a veſſel which paſſed them at ſea. It <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Aſhamed of fears and of deſpondence, which ſeemed, as ſoon as ſhe could reaſon upon them, to have ſo little foundation, ſhe returned once more to the amuſements which uſed to beguile the hours of her huſband's abſence: and all that were not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to the care of her child, whom ſhe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to herſelf, ſhe paſſed in cultivating thoſe talents which Montalbert loved, and in which he had aſſiſted and marked her progreſs with ſuch exquiſite delight.</p>
