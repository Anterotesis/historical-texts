            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE <hi>AUTHOR</hi>'s APOLOGY.</head>
            <p>SEEING this ſubject has employed the pens of ſome of the moſt learned, wiſe, and beſt of men, it may be enquired why I have written, and what need there is of publiſhing again on this ſubject?</p>
            <p>ANSWER. Firſt. Many may read this, who never have read, and probably never will read what has been written by others.</p>
            <p>SECOND. It is poſſible that I may make ſome improvement on the ſubject in the view of ſome: But,</p>
            <p>THIRD. If I have added nothing to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, yet my method of writing may ſtrike the minds of ſome, and do them good, when another's would not: Therefore,</p>
            <p>FOURTHLY. It is poſſible, through Divine Grace, it may convince ſome perſons of theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant truths, and be a mean of ſaving their ſouls.</p>
            <p>FIFTHLY. Another reaſon why I publiſh this diſcourſe is, that hereby I may ſpeak, preach, and do good when I am dead. "He being dead, yet ſpeaketh."</p>
            <p>SIXTHLY. Some have requeſted that it might be publiſhed, and I cannot deny them.— For theſe reaſons, I pray thee have me excuſed.</p>

                  <bibl>JOHN VI. <hi>44.</hi> &amp; V. <hi>40.</hi>
                  </bibl>
                  <p>"No man can come to me, except the FATHER, which hath ſent me, draw him." "And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life."</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>WITHOUT any introduction, we may proceed from theſe important paſſages before us, to make this doctrinal obſervation, viz.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THAT it is utterly impoſſible for any of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to come to CHRIST, and receive that life and ſalvation, which he offers them as a free gift, without the almighty drawing of GOD the FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BEFORE I proceed to the proof of this doctrine, I would a little explain it, and the text out of which it naturally ariſes.</p>
            <p>THIS inability, and impoſſibility of coming to CHRIST, ſeems to be fully contained in our text.</p>
            <p>"NO man can come," implies impoſſibil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity that any ſhould come to CHRIST by any means ſhort of the Almighty drawing of the FATHER.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:034258_0004_0FFC3CD272BB7128"/>FOR there is no propriety in adopting the term <hi>cannot,</hi> or the phraſe "No man can come," if the obſtruction could be removed by any means ſhort of a new creation. Or, in other words: If mankind could be made able or willing to come to Chriſt, by any means ſhort of Almighty power, exerted in drawing ſinners to Chriſt, it would not be proper to ſay, <hi>they cannot come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THEREFORE, when the term <hi>cannot</hi> is uſed with propriety, it always means impoſſibility, either through want of a natural power to do ſomething that we may be willing to do; or elſe becauſe we are wholly unwilling, ſo as to render it impoſſible to do the thing propoſed, unleſs the unwillingneſs be removed by Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty power—by a new creation.</p>
            <p>THE inability which mankind labor under of coming to Chriſt, is one of the two now mentioned: It is either natural or moral ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</p>
            <p>BY natural inability, we mean ſuch a want of natural power and ſtrength, as renders it impoſſible to come to Chriſt or to do any thing elſe, although the mind were willing.</p>
            <p>BY moral inability, we mean ſuch a degree of unwillingneſs to improve our natural abilities in coming to Chriſt, or doing any other thing required, as renders the doing of it impoſſible, unleſs that unwillingneſs be removed by Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power.</p>
            <p>THESE two kinds of inability are often and with propriety expreſſed by the term <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,</hi> both in the ſcriptures and in common lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:034258_0005_0FFC3CD0E4609F40"/>
And the one, or the other, of theſe two kinds of inability, is undoubtedly referred to in our text: "<hi>No man can come to me,</hi>" &amp;c.</p>
            <p>AND now, that we may underſtand the nature of this inability, and ſearch after all thoſe important truths contained in our text, we ſhall purſue the following method:
<list>
                  <item>I. SHOW what it it is to come to CHRIST.</item>
                  <item>II. SHOW in what ſenſe mankind are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to come to CHRIST, or the true reaſon why no man can come to him, except the FATHER draw him.</item>
                  <item>III. CONCLUDE the ſubject by inferences, remarks, and exhortation.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. WE are to ſhow what is implied in coming to CHRIST.</p>
            <p>AND, it implies all the following par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> NOT motion of the body, or moving from one place to another; but an exerciſe of the heart, in which the ſoul unites to CHTIST by love. We went away from GOD by ſin, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of heart againſt him; and we can return to him, or come to CHRIST, only in the exerciſe of love. When one ſtands at a diſtance from another, and ſays come to me, he enjoins upon him bodily motion, that he move from one place to another. But not ſo here. You may come to CHRIST in the fulleſt ſenſe of the term, and remain in the ſeats where you are. For when Chriſt ſays, "Come unto me," he calls upon us to love him with the heart—to receive him by true love. And all that we can do, in exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal reformation and amendment of life, while
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:034258_0006_0FFC3CCEA058DA70"/>
deſtitute of love, is not coming to CHRIST, nor taking one ſtep towards him. And the moſt awakened, convicted, and reformed ſinner, while deſtitute of love, is not a coming ſinner, as ſome have ſuppoſed. But all ſuch are running away from CHRIST, as faſt as ever, and will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, nor come to him. And no one ever does come to him, nor towards him, but in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of true love. It implies too, that you love CHRIST ſupremely—above all—more than fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or mother, brothers or ſiſters, wife or chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, houſes or lands; and that you view CHRIST as altogether lovely, the pearl of great price, ſo that you can ſell and forſake all that you have for him. No one can come to CHRIST, nor be his diſciple, nor love him at all, without ſuch ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme love as this. For thus it is written: "So likewiſe, whoſoever he be of you, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple."<note n="*" place="bottom">Luke xiv. 33.</note> And, "He that loveth father or moth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er more than me, is not worthy of me."<note n="†" place="bottom">Mat. x. 37.</note> And again "If any man come to me, and hateth not," that is, does not love me, more than "his father, or mother, or wife, or children, yea, and his own life alſo, he cannot be my diſciple,"<note n="‡" place="bottom">Luke xiv. 26.</note> or truly come to me. This coming to CHRIST there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore implies, that we give up our vain excuſes: "I have bought a piece of ground, and I muſt needs go and ſee it: I pray thee have me excuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed." "I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them: I pray thee have me excuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed." "I have married a wife, and therefore I
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:034258_0007_0FFC3CCB908C3C90"/>
               <hi>cannot</hi> come."<note n="§" place="bottom">Luke xiv. 17, 81, 19, 20.</note> But when the ſoul does come to CHRIST, he gives up all theſe excuſes, as fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and vain. And nothing appears to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant enough to detain him a moment longer, from coming to CHRIST, and to his glorious feaſt of goſpel grace: But he forſakes his farm, his merchandize, his father and mother, his wife and children, yea, and all that he hath; and ſo comes to CHRIST in the exerciſe of ſpiritual life and love.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> COMING to CHRIST implies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving on him—that you receive his teſtimony, and ſet to your ſeal that GOD is true."<note n="‖" place="bottom">John iii. 33.</note> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to CHRIST, receiving him, and believing on him, or receiving his teſtimony, are terms much of the ſame import. As it is written: "But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the ſons of GOD, even to them that believe on his name."<note n="¶" place="bottom">John i. 12.</note> His name is the LORD JESUS CHRIST. And all ſuch as heartily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in this name, "That JESUS is the CHRIST," the anointed of GOD the FATHER; "That he will ſave his people from their ſins;" That he is the "LORD GOD," and owner of all things, and thus receive his teſtimony in favor of GOD, and againſt themſelves; do by this believing, <hi>Come to CHRIST.</hi> "Unto you therefore which believe, he is precious."<note n="*" place="bottom">1. Pet. ii. 7.</note> And when you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and by believing, come unto CHRIST, you receive him, unite and become one with him, as the branch is one with the vine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:034258_0008_0FFC3CC953A8C6A0"/>
               <hi>Thirdly.</hi> COMING to CHRIST implies obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.—It is obeying the goſpel of our LORD JESUS CHRIST. The goſpel ſays, "Come:" and he that does come, obeys the goſpel; and that obeying the goſpel, is coming to CHRIST.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly.</hi> COMING to CHRIST implies hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility—that we become poor in ſpirit. The proud and unhumbled, will not, and do not come to Chriſt for life. They feel too rich and important. For the goſpel ſalvation reſpects mankind, as poor, in diſtreſs, in debt, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing with hunger. "The poor have the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel preached to them."<note n="†" place="bottom">Mat. xi. 5.</note> "Bring in hither the poor, the maimed, and the halt, and the blind·"<note n="‡" place="bottom">Luke xiv. 21.</note> All who are heartily ſenſible, that this is their loſt periſhing ſtate by nature, and are thus poor in ſpirit, will come to CHRIST for life; and none others will come. Therefore,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly.</hi> COMING to CHRIST implies a praying ſpirit—that you are humble enough to become beggars, and to aſk for mercy, with the publican: "God be merciful to me a ſinner."<note n="‖" place="bottom">Luke xviii. 13.</note> And this brings ſuch into the condition of the promiſe: "Aſk, and it ſhall be given you; ſeek, and ye ſhall find; knock, and it ſhall be opened unto you. For every one that aſketh receiveth."<note n="§" place="bottom">Mat. xii. 7.8.</note> But, "The wicked thro the pride of his countenance, will not ſeek after GOD,"<note n="*" place="bottom">Pſalm x. 4.</note> nor come to CHRIST.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly.</hi> COMING to CHRIST implies a willingneſs to be ſaved by ſovereign grace, thro
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:034258_0009_0FFC3CC70E8B4058"/>
the merits of JESUS CHRIST, and to give GOD all the glory. "Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but to thy name give glory."<note n="*" place="bottom">Pſalm cxv. 1.</note> Thus, he who comes to CHRIST, gives up the idea of eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhing his own righteouſneſs, and caſts away this garment that he has made, as filthy rags, that he may receive CHRIST as his righteouſneſs, and be ſaved by grace alone. As it is written; "By grace are ye ſaved, through faith, and that not of yourſelves, it is the gift of GOD."<note n="†" place="bottom">Eph. ii. 8.</note> But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> and <hi>Laſtly.</hi> COMING to CHRIST implies true repentance, and hatred of ſin. And in that very act, by which men repent of, hate, and forſake their ſins, they do come to CHRIST. "For he ſhall ſave his people from their ſins." And all who hate ſin, will love ſuch a SAVIOUR, and come to him for life. In a word, he that comes to Chriſt, has the ſpirit of CHRIST dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in him. And in the exerciſe of this ſpirit, he does juſtly, loves mercy, and walks humbly with GOD. And thus in leaving his ſins, he comes to Chriſt. All theſe things, and many more, which might be mentioned, are implied in coming to Chriſt. We now proceed,</p>
            <p n="2">II. To ſhow, in what ſenſe men are una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and it is impoſſible for any one, thus to come unto Chriſt; and the true and only reaſon why the drawings of the Father are neceſſary. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt.</hi> WE ſhall ſhow negatively, what is not the inability of ſinners in coming to Chriſt, and then poſitively what it is.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:034258_0010_0FFC3CC586574698"/>We ſhall all agree in this, that the inabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſinners in coming to Chriſt, is not ſuch as to render them excuſable for not coming. Therefore,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſtly.</hi> It is not for want of a natural pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When doing a thing is connected with a <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> to do it, or he could do it if he be willing, then he has natural power to do it. And when a man is willing to do a thing, and yet cannot, we call this natural inabil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity. But this is not the inability of ſinners to come to Chriſt. They could come, if they were willing. Therefore, the impoſſibility there is of ſinners coming to Chriſt, is not want of natural power and ability. If this were the caſe, men could not be ſinners, or blame worthy for not coming. But they are not required to "Aſcend into heaven, that is, to bring Chriſt down from above; or to deſcend into the deep, that is, to bring up Chriſt again from the dead. But what ſaith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart; that is, the word of faith which we preach; that if thou ſhalt confeſs with thy mouth the Lord Jeſus, &amp; ſhalt believe in thine heart, that GOD hath raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved."<note n="§" place="bottom">Rom. x. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.</note> This ſhows in the cleareſt light, that Chriſt and his ſalvation are brought near to mankind, and offered on the moſt eaſy terms. They are not left in heaven, in the deep, nor any where out of our reach; but are brought near to us, and offered as a free gift. "Behold I bring near my righteouſneſs; it ſhall not be
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:034258_0011_0FFC3CC28B7578C0"/>
far off; and I will place ſalvation in Zion, for Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael my glory."<note n="‖" place="bottom">Iſai. xlvi. 12, 13.</note> And, "The gift of GOD is eternal life through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.<note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. vi. 33.</note>— Thus, when ſalvation is brought within our reach, and offered as a gift to all who are will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to take it; then there can be no natural inability or impoſſibility in the way of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it. If Chriſt and his ſalvation be "nigh thee, even in thy heart and in thy mouth," and nothing is required as a condition of enjoying this ſalvation, but to confeſs with the mouth the Lord Jeſus, and to believe in the heart that God hath raiſed him from the dead; then ſalvation is offered on the moſt eaſy terms, and there can be no natural inability in the way of receivivg it. This appears moſt evident, when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that there is no uſe of any natural abilities required in confeſſing and believing, but thoſe <hi>only</hi> which are actually employed in denying, rejecting, and diſbelieving the Lord Jeſus: And we have as much natural power to come unto Chriſt, by believing on him, as we have to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and deny him by unbelief. That is, by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural powers and faculties, we are fitted for moral exerciſe; and we actually have moral exerciſe continually, either in loving or hating; and we are as capable of coming to Chriſt by love, as we are of departing from him by hatred. And this appears yet more evident, and is put beyond all diſpute, when we conſider, that in ſinners being made able to come to Chriſt, and when they actually do come, there is no new
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:034258_0012_0FFC3CC04C91B660"/>
natural abilities given, but only a diſpoſition to improve aright thoſe natural abilities which they before had.</p>
            <p>THEREFORE, natural inability is not the reaſon why ſinners cannot come to Chriſt: For they actually have natural ability, and all the natural ability which they have when they actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally do come.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi> THE reaſon why it is impoſſible for ſinners to come to Chriſt, is not that he is not a proper object of love. No, for he is "Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together lovely"—"The chiefeſt among ten thouſand."<note n="†" place="bottom">Sol. Song. v. 10.</note> If this were not ſo, and there were really no beauty in Chriſt, that we ſhould deſire him, and we could not love him on this account, then we could not be blame-worthy. But Chriſt Jeſus has every lovely qualification; and yet, no man can love him, nor come to him, without the drawing of the Father.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly.</hi> THE reaſon why ſinners cannot believe and come to Chriſt, is not want of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to ground faith upon; not for want of evidence of the real lovelineſs of Chriſt, and the certainty of thoſe truths he requires us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. No, for the lovelineſs of Chriſt's char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter, and the unqueſtionable truth of his teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and all he requires us to believe, is held up to view in the cleareſt light. So that he is really "The light of the world."<note n="§" place="bottom">John viii. 12.</note> Sometimes we cannot love a perſon for want of evidence that he is lovely, nor believe in him for want of evidence that he ſpeaks the truth. In ſuch
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:034258_0013_0FFC3CBEC5B10030"/>
a caſe, there is no blame: But not ſo in this caſe. "For there are three that bear record in heaven; and there are three that bear witneſs in earth," in favor of Chriſt, and of the truth of all his teſtimony. Yet, it is impoſſible for ſinners to believe in him, or come to him, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Father draw them. But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly.</hi> THIS inability does not conſiſt in want of conviction that Chriſt is thus a proper object of love; and of the truth, reality, and importance of his teſtimony, and of ſpiritual and divine things. Many, at leaſt, thro conviction of conſcience, or judgment, have thot that the teſtimony of Chriſt is true, and that he is worthy to be loved by all men; and yet, no man can love him, nor come to him, except he is drawn by God the Father.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> THE ground of this inability is not want of motives to perſuade men to come to Chriſt. But there are the moſt powerful motives or reaſons held up to the view of ſinners to engage them to come unto Chriſt and be ſaved.</p>
            <p>ALL the inexpreſſible joys of heaven, and all the dreadful torments of hell, are holden up to their view; and by the voice of the Almighty, are made to thunder in their ears to give them warning, that they ſhould come to Chriſt for life, and flee from the wrath to come. And there is no proper motive, or argument, but what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the word and providence of God, and there held up to the view of ſinners, to come to Chriſt. Yet, there is a cannot, which will eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally hinder them from coming to Chriſt, "Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Father draw them."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:034258_0014_0FFC3CBC707B58B0"/>
               <hi>Sixthly.</hi> ALTHOUGH ſinners cannot come to Chriſt; It is not becauſe that ſatan, or any other being overpowers them, ſo as to hinder them from coming, contrary to their inclinations. Satan has no power to hinder any one from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Chriſt, only by his artful devices, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuading, flattering, and deceiving. He promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es all the riches and honors of this world, which he has no power to give, if men will worſhip him, continue in his ſervice, and neglect to come to Chriſt, and receive his great ſalvation. But he has no power to force men, contrary to their wills, to purſue after the riches, honors, and pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures of the world, and hereby to neglect coming to Chriſt, and receiving his free ſalvation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly.</hi> THE reaſon why ſinners cannot come to Chriſt, is not that more pleaſure and happineſs are to be enjoyed in ſin, and in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of ſatan than in coming to Chriſt, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the ſervice of God. Satan tries to keep people in his ſervice, and is ſucceſsful in it, by perſuading them to believe, that if they leave his ſervice and become the ſervants of God, they will looſe all their pleaſure and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Yet, this is ſo far from being true, that all the real happineſs there is in the univerſe, among creatures, is in the love and ſervice of God. And "Wiſdom's ways are ways of pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antneſs, and all her paths are peace."<note n="†" place="bottom">Prov. iii. 17.</note> And ſinners have conviction that this is the caſe, even while they greedily purſue the pleaſures of ſin, and cannot leave them to come to Chriſt, and enjoy the moſt refined pleaſures of religion. But,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:034258_0015_0FFC3CB970DA0AE0"/>
               <hi>Eigthly, and Laſtly.</hi> The reaſon why no man can come to Chriſt, except the Father draw him; is not that Chriſt, is not willing to receive all that will come to him. For, he ſays, "come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt." And again "Him that cometh unto me, I will in no wiſe caſt out."</p>
            <p>Thus, we have been ſearching on every ſide, to find what the inability of mankind in coming to Chriſt, does not conſiſt in. And we now come to ſhow poſitively, what that inability real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is, which hinders ſuch multitudes from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Chriſt, and renders it impoſſible for any man to come, except the Father draw him. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſtly.</hi> WHEN we read the latter part of our text, it is evident, beyond all diſpute, what that inability is, which is ſpoken of in the former part; that it conſiſts, wholly conſiſts, in an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate and perverſe <hi>will. "And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But why is the will thus oppoſed, and men ſo wholly unwilling to come to Chriſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive life at his hand?</p>
            <p>Becauſe we have ſet up for independency on God. And Chriſt has come to re-eſtabliſh God's authority over us; and claims to be a King. But, "<hi>We will not have this man to reign over us.</hi>"<note n="‡" place="bottom">Luke xix. 14.</note> Therefore, we connot come to him, nor receive him, as our Lord and King. "Art thou a King then?" "We have no King, but Ceſar." "Who is Lord over us?"</p>
            <p>Not only this; but Chriſt claims to be a prophet alſo; and we do not like his inſtructions,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:034258_0016_0FFC3CB72B189F90"/>
we do not agree with him in ſentiment. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares the righteouſneſs of God, and teſtifies of the world that the works thereof are evil; that we are of our father the devil, and his luſts we will do: He declares himſelf to be the bread of life; and that except we eat his fleſh and drink his blood, we have no life in us. But we are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to adopt the language of the unbelieving Jews: "How can this man give us his fleſh to eat?" This is an hard ſaying, who can hear it?"<note n="§" place="bottom">John vi.</note> We cannot, we will not come to, nor receive ſuch a prophet as this to teach us. No, for we "Say to the ſeers, ſee not; and to the prophets propheſy not unto us right things; ſpeak unto us ſmooth things, propheſy deceits, get you out of the way, turn aſide out of the path; cauſe the holy one of Iſrael to ceaſe from before us." <note n="‖" place="bottom">Iſaiah xxx. 8.9.10.11.</note> We cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure that ſuch a God as this, ſhould be held up to our view. "Away with him, away with him," for we will not have ſuch a teacher as this.</p>
            <p>And beſides; Chriſt claims to be a prieſt, to make atonement for us. This repreſents, that we have committed ſins for which we can make no atonement ourſelves, and for which we deſerve to die. Therefore, we cannot, we will not receive ſuch a prieſt as this.</p>
            <p>Moreover; ſuch an atonement as Chriſt has made, by his death and ſufferings, as an high prieſt, and the goſpel which he preaches, repreſent us, as "Wretched, and miſerable, and poor, and blind, and naked," loſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done. But we do not feel this to be our caſe; therefore we <hi>cannot,</hi> that is, we <hi>will not</hi> come to
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:034258_0017_0FFC3CB5A32F9950"/>
him for life: we are no beggars. No: "Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou ſayeſt, I am rich and have need of nothing; and knoweſt not that thou art wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and miſerable, and poor, and blind, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked." Therefore, you cannot, you will not come to Chriſt that you might have life. You want life, but while you do not believe with the prodigal ſon, that you are periſhing with hunger, and are not "<hi>Poor in ſpirit,</hi>" you will not have this want ſupplied. Your feeling rich in ſpirit, your pride, will not ſuffer you to come to Chriſt, that you might have life; and receive it of his hand, as a free gift, to a poor beggar.</p>
            <p>AND beſides all this; we are ſupremely in love with the world. "I have bought a piece of ground, and I muſt needs go and ſee it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>" I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I muſt go to prove them: I pray thee have me excuſed." I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come," "<hi>No man can come,</hi>" becauſe he loves his farm, his merchandiſe, his wife, or ſomething in the world above Chriſt. And by cleaving to theſe things, all make light of the invitations of the goſpel; and no man can forſake them, and come to Chriſt. "<hi>And they would not come.</hi>"<note n="*" place="bottom">Mat. xxii. 3,</note> "And how can ye believe which receive honor one of another, and ſeek not the honor which cometh from God only?" Ye cannot.</p>
            <p>AGAIN; the will is thus, oppoſed, ſo that "No man can come to Chriſt except the Father draw him," becauſe all are ſinners; wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to ſin, and unwilling to be ſaved from their ſins. ſo that "In them, there dwells no
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:034258_0018_0FFC3CB35CBA08D0"/>
good thing." Hence no man can come, and no man will come to Chriſt, becauſe he "Saves his people <hi>from</hi> their ſins," and will not ſave them <hi>in</hi> their ſins. If Chriſt would ſave people in their ſins; all ſinners would be able, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to come to him, upon the firſt invitation, without any drawing, beſides their own inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But now, they connot come to Chriſt, becauſe they will not leave their ſins, nor conſent to be ſaved from them. And if there were any good thing in them; any thing but ſin; or the leaſt ſpark of virtue, and moral goodneſs; it would lead them to Chriſt—they could, and would then come to him.</p>
            <p>BUT becauſe there is nothing in man by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that is morally good, any more than there is in the devils and damned in hell; and becauſe they are, "Of their father the devil," therefore they <hi>cannot,</hi> they <hi>will</hi> not come to Chriſt. This, and this only, is the great inability, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it impoſſible for ſinners to come to Chriſt, "Except the Father draw them."</p>
            <p>AND now, as a further proof, that this is the inability of ſinners, and the true reaſon why they connot come to Chriſt; the following things are obſerved.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſtly.</hi> WHEN ſinners are drawn to Chriſt by the Father, and actually do come, nothing is done to them, but to make them willing. As it is written: "Thy people ſhall be willing in the day of thy power."<note n="†" place="bottom">Pſalm cx. 3.</note> The power of God is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted <hi>only</hi> on the <hi>will,</hi> in drawing ſinners to Chriſt. Before this, "They would not come." But
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:034258_0019_0FFC3CB02845A588"/>
now they are willing, and do come. For, being willing, is coming. And all inability is now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, when the will is bowed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi> ALL the offers of Chriſt and his ſalvation are made to all who are willing. "The ſpirit and the bride ſay come, and whoſoever will, let him take the water of life freely." "If there be firſt a willing mind, it is accepted, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not." "If ye be willing and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, ye ſhall eat the good of the land, but if ye refuſe and rebel, ye ſhall be devoured; for the mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it."</p>
            <p>THIS ſhows very plainly, that ſalvation is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured to all thoſe, who are willing to take it; and that there can be no inability in the way of enjoying it, but an <hi>unwilling,</hi> and diſobedient mind. If there were, or could be any other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability, there would be no propriety in offering ſalvation to all, who are willing to take it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mentioning the other obſtruction that might be in the way.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly.</hi> THAT good, which the goſpel of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, is promiſed to every one, who will aſk for it. "Aſk, and ye ſhall receive." This ſhows, that there can be nothing to hinder the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt, and his ſalvation, except that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of the heart, and oppoſition of the will, by which we refuſe to aſk, and receive. "For ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery one that wills or deſires this ſalvation, does aſk for it, and receives it. Hence, there can be no obſtruction in the way of aſking ſalvation by Chriſt, but the diſlike of the heart, or oppoſition of the will.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:034258_0020_0FFC3CADEACC7778"/>
               <hi>Fourthly.</hi> SINNERS being invited, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to come to Chriſt, and obey the goſpel, implies that they have natural ability to come, and there can be no inability, to come, except a rebellious will. Otherwiſe,</p>
            <p>GOD would require according to what men have not: He would require obedience, where he has not given natural power to obey; which would be unreaſonable; and is contrary to what God ſays he doth, in requiring only according to "That a man hath:" This is, according to his natural abilities, and talents.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly.</hi> MEN's not coming to Chriſt, is repreſented as diſobeying the goſpel. But, if ſinners labored under any other inability of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Chriſt beſides a ſtubborn will; then, their not coming, could not be called diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the goſpel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly.</hi> THOSE who do not come to Chriſt, are repreſented in ſcripture, as neglecting his "Great ſalvation."<note n="§" place="bottom">Heb. ii. 3.</note> But this <hi>neglect,</hi> neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily implies contempt, making light of, and refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Chriſt and his great ſalvation, when it is brought within our reach, and all other obſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are removed out of the way, except this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing mind, by which the ſalvation is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned and refuſed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly.</hi> AN everlaſting curſe is denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the ſcriptures againſt every one who does not come to Chriſt, by true love. "If any man love not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, let him be an athema, maranatha."<note n="*" place="bottom">1. Cor. xvi. 22.</note> But this curſe would be very unreaſonable, if men labored under any
<pb facs="unknown:034258_0021_0FFC3CAC597F9298"/>
inability of coming to Chriſt by love, except their voluntary oppoſition to him; and hating him with all their heart. "Ye have both ſeen and hated, both me and my Father." And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you cannot, you "Will not come to me that ye might have life." <hi>This cannot,</hi> and this <hi>will not,</hi> imply the <hi>ſame</hi> kind and degree of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability. And the only reaſon why "No man can come to Chriſt, except the Father draw him," is that the unwillingneſs is ſo great, that nothing leſs than the drawing of the Father, in the day of his almighty power, can conquer and make ſinners willing to come unto Chriſt, and receive life through him. "And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life."</p>
            <p>THUS, if all that is done to ſinners in draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to Chriſt, is making them willing; and when they are willing, they do come: then all their inability lies in a ſtubborn will.</p>
            <p>AND if all the offers of Chriſt and his ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are made to all who are willing to receive them; and when any are willing, they do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them; then all inability lies in the will.</p>
            <p>AND if the goſpel ſalvation is promiſed to every one, who will aſk for it, and all who are willing, do aſk, and receive; then all inability of receiving this ſalvation lies in the will.</p>
            <p>AND if the invitations of the goſpel neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily imply, that there is no natural inability in the way of receiving; then they certainly imply, that nothing is in the way of enjoyment, except unwillingneſs to receive.</p>
            <p>AND if our not coming to Chriſt, to the goſpel feaſt, is diſobeying the goſpel; then all
<pb facs="unknown:034258_0022_0FFC3CAA14C1A8E0"/>
inability to come, lies in a perverſe will; for any other inability, could not properly be term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed diſobedience.</p>
            <p>AND if thoſe, who do not come to Chriſt, are neglecters of his great ſalvation, and make light of it; then certainly it is brought within their reach, within the compaſs of their natural abilities, and nothing in them prevents enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but a contemning, proud, and unwilling mind. They ſcorn the thing. They make light of it, and neglect a great ſalvation, which is brot nigh to them, and offered to their choice.</p>
            <p>AND if an everlaſting curſe is faſtened on every one who does not come to Chriſt, by true faith and love; and if this curſe can juſtly be inflicted, then there can be no inability of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Chriſt, by true faith and love, except a wicked and rebellious will.</p>
            <p>THUS, we have found the Achan in the camp—that ſinners <hi>cannot come to Chriſt,</hi> becauſe they <hi>will not come,</hi> except they are drawn, or made willing by God the Father, in the day of his almighty power.</p>
            <p>AND now, if the Lord Jeſus Chriſt juſtly ſuſtains the office of a King, then all are under obligation to obey him. And if our wills are thus oppoſed to him, as we have proved, ſo that we cannot receive him, and "Will not have this man to reign over us," then we violate our obligation, and are without excuſe.</p>
            <p>AND if Chriſt juſtly ſuſtains the office of a prophet to teach us, of a prieſt to atone for us, and a phyſician to heal us; then all men are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der obligations to receive him in theſe offices;
<pb facs="unknown:034258_0023_0FFC3CA6F3762608"/>
and if our wills are ſo oppoſed, that we cannot; then, why is not this inability moſt criminal and wicked?</p>
            <p>AND if the teſtimony of Chriſt, as a proph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et was righteous and good; then all are under obligation to receive it, and ſet to their ſeal that God is true. And if our wills are thus oppoſed to this teſtimony, becauſe it is good, and no man receiveth it, nor can receive it; then, why are we not guilty?</p>
            <p>AND if Chriſt was holy, harmleſs, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled, ſeparate from ſinners, made higher than the heavens, and was God; then all are under infinite obligations to come to him, to receive him, to love him with all the heart, and to obey him as Lord and King. And if no man can come to him, nor receive him becauſe he is thus holy, and they are unholy; even to ſuch a degree, that they will not have this man, this King, this God, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> reign over them; then, their inability, their cannot, which all centers in a rebellious will, muſt be an infinite crime, and no excuſe. For, "Ye will not come to me, that ye might have life." And becauſe of this wicked will, "Ye cannot ſerve the Lord," nor come to Chriſt; "For he is an holy God;"<note n="†" place="bottom">Joſh. xxiv. 19.</note> and ye are unholy. "As it is written, there is none righteous, no not one; there is none that underſtandeth and ſeeketh after God. They are all gone out of the way; they are altogether become unprofitable; there is none that doth good, no not one.

But, if any ſhould here object, and ſay, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability conſiſts <hi>partly</hi> in the <hi>underſtanding</hi>; we have an anſwer at hand. "<hi>Having the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding darkened.</hi>" But how? "Being alien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated from the life of God, through the ignorance that is in them, becauſe of the blindneſs of the <hi>heart.</hi>"<note n="§" place="bottom">Eph. iv. 18.</note> Only ſet the <hi>heart</hi> right; or renew the <hi>will,</hi> and the <hi>underſtanding</hi> will be right alſo. "The natural man receiveth not the things of the ſpirit of God; For they are fooliſhneſs unto him; neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned."<note n="*" place="bottom">1. Cor. ii. 14.</note> Only let the minds of men become ſpiritual, and "Fools be of an underſtanding heart;" then they can diſcern ſpiritual and divine things. In this view, the "Knowledge of God," and "The things of the ſpirit of God," are connected with a new heart. "I will give them an heart to know me." And, "Then ſhall ye underſtand the fear of the Lord, and find the knowledge of God, when thou ſeekeſt her as ſilver, and ſearcheſt for her, as for hid treaſure." But how do men ſeek ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver? They ſeek it with love, and earneſt deſire after it. Their wills are in this purſuit. Hence ſays the apoſtle, "They that <hi>will</hi> be rich," &amp;c.
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:034258_0025_0FFC3CA2F4A07538"/>
But the natural man, who cannot know the things of the ſpirit of God, nor underſtand the fear of the Lord, does not thus ſeek after it, as men ſeek ſilver. His will is to oppoſed to it. And he is "Willingly ignorant;" and "Does not like to retain God in his knowledge." In this view it is written, "How long ye ſimple ones will ye love ſimplicity, and the ſcorners delight in their ſcorning, and fools hate knowledge?"<note n="‖" place="bottom">Prov. i. 22.</note>
            </p>
            <p>THUS, all the ignorance and want of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding there is in the "Natural man," is becauſe of this blindneſs of the heart, by which mankind will not acquaint themſelves with God, nor come to Chriſt, as a prophet to teach them. And therefore it is, that among natural men, or thoſe in a ſtate of nature, "There is none that <hi>underſtandeth,</hi> there is none that ſeeketh after God." And, <hi>when</hi> the heart is ſet right, and becomes ſpiritual, then the underſtanding is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened, in the knowledge of God, and the things; of the ſpirit of God; which things, the natural man cannot underſtand; becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned. "But he that is ſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itual, judgeth all things." Now, he underſtands the fear of the Lord, and finds the knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge of God. And ſo far as the hearts of men are ſet right with God, and they are willing to underſtand and do their duty; ſo far, they are as capable of underſtanding the things of the ſpirit of God, as they are to underſtand the arts and ſciences, or any natural things. Theſe men <hi>can</hi> underſtand; even while their hearts are full of wickedneſs. Let all the blindneſs in man be
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:034258_0026_0FFC3CA0C066F378"/>
removed, which is occaſioned by an evil heart; or, let their hearts be wholly ſet right with God, and made ſpiritual; then all inability to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand ſpiritual things, would be removed, and the underſtanding in men, be as good, as that of Adam in innocency. Therefore, this want of underſtanding in men, and the ignorance in them being occaſioned by the blindneſs of the heart, is no proof of any inability in them beſides an evil heart, or a rebellious will. But it is a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proof, that all the inability of ſinners, in coming to Chriſt, lies <hi>in an evil and wicked heart,</hi> or, a <hi>rebellious will</hi>; by reaſon of which, "There is none that underſtandeth, there is none that ſeeketh after God," and no man can come to Chriſt, "Except the Father draw him." Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus endeavored to ſhow as clearly as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, what it is to come to Chriſt, and the true reaſon why no man can come to Chriſt without the almighty drawing of God the Father, we now proceed,</p>
            <p n="3">III. To conclude the ſubject, by a few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſtly.</hi> We ſee the propriety of uſing the word <hi>cannot,</hi> to expreſs <hi>moral inability,</hi> or unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs. It is certainly uſed ſo in our text. "No man can come to me," certainly means, that men are wholly unwilling; and is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of moral character, even the total depravity, and wickedneſs of the hearts of all men, by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. If there were only ſome degree of unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs in ſinners to come to Chriſt; which might be removed by ſome means ſhort of a new creation, then it would not be proper to ſay they
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:034258_0027_0FFC3C9DCF5FC2B0"/>
               <hi>cannot</hi> come. But when the hearts of men are "Full of evil," and in their fleſhly mind there "Dwells no good thing," ſo that through the total wickedneſs of the heart, their wills are wholly oppoſed to coming unto Chriſt; and they will not come, by any means that can be uſed with them ſhort of a new creation, or the drawing of the Father; then, with great propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, we may ſay, <hi>they cannot come.</hi> Can we come, or do any thing whatſoever, when the will is wholly oppoſed? Eſpecially, if willing to come to Chriſt, is coming, can we then come while we will not? No, for this unwillingneſs implies that we do not come; or it will as certainly prevent our coming, or doing any thing elſe, as if we had no natural power; and is as properly expreſſed by the term <hi>connot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi> We ſee the propriety of exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men to do that which they cannot do, in this ſenſe. Natural inability in coming to Chriſt, or to do any thing elſe, would excuſe them, and render it improper to exhort them to come. But when we have natural ability to come; and no inability beſides unwillingneſs; then we are proper ſubjects of command and exhortation; even altho it be impoſſible to obey, while thus unwilling, and by reaſon of this unwillingneſs. No parent would ever excuſe his child, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect to command him, becauſe he could not, or it was impoſſible for him to obey, only by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a ſtubborn will. When the child ſays, I cannot do this, or that, which the parent knows he has natural power to do, or that his <hi>cannot</hi> conſiſts wholly in unwillingneſs; he then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peats
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:034258_0028_0FFC3C9B884BE2D8"/>
his commands, and adds his threatnings. And is there no propriety in this conduct? Yet, there are ſome, who complain of preachers at this day, ſaying; they will preach in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon that men ſhould come to Chriſt, to the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel feaſt; but tell them in the afternoon, that they cannot come Well, is not Chriſt ſuch a preacher? He invites them to come to him, and in the ſame ſermon, he tells them they cannot come, and they will not come to him, "That they might have life." And if all the inability, the <hi>cannot,</hi> conſiſts in a perverſe will, as we have ſeen; then, with the greateſt propriety he may invite, exhort, and command ſuch impotent, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, or unwilling ſinners to come to him; and threaten them with eternal death, if they do not obey. And all this, whether you view it conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent or not, is in fact done by Chriſt. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites, and commands all to come to him; he ſays, "No man can come to me, except the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther draw him;" and yet threatens them with eternal death, who cannot, and who do not come to him, by faith and love. "He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth ſhall be ſaved; but he that believeth not ſhall be damned. Again: "If any man love not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, let him be accurſed." All this appears perfectly conſiſtent, when we admit the evidence exhibited from ſcripture, that this inability is found only in ſinners, and conſiſts wholly in ſin, in the total depravity of the human heart; in its being deſtitute of every thing that it morally good, and wholly under the influence of a ſtubborn, perverſe, and wicked will. "And ye will not come to me, that ye
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:034258_0029_0FFC3C9A00052850"/>
might have life." In this view of things, min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſters may, with the greateſt propriety preach to ſinners as Chriſt did; and urge upon them the moving invitations of the goſpel; the impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility there is that they ſhould obey it, and come to Chriſt, "Except it were given them from above," and yet preſs upon them their inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable obligations to obey the goſpel, and come to Chriſt, on pain of death; even the ſecond death. As it is written; "The Lord Jeſus ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed from heaven, with his mighty angels, in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: Who ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power; when he ſhall come to be glorified in his ſaints, and to be admired in all them that believe."<note n="†" place="bottom">2. Theſs. i. 7.8.9.10.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly.</hi> From what has been ſaid, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears evident, that the only ground of the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of regeneration, or of almighty power to draw men to Chriſt, lies in the total depravity of their heart, ſo that in them, "There dwells no good thing;" not the leaſt degree of willingneſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and come to Chriſt. Hence the power of God, in regeneration, is exerted <hi>only</hi> on the <hi>will</hi>; in forming that to repentance, love and obedience; or, in making men willing to receive Chriſt and his great ſalvation. "Thy people ſhall be willing in the day of thy power."</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly.</hi> We learn, that as the inability of ſinners conſiſts in their ſinfulneſs, it can afford them no excuſe; but renders them altogether
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:034258_0030_0FFA6B52AB127570"/>
criminal, and inexcuſable. And the more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able men are to come to Chriſt, by reaſon of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſs, the greater is their criminality. And the greater power it requires to make men wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and obedient, or to draw them to Chriſt, argues, and proves, ſo much greater ſtrength of unwillingneſs and ſin. And if it requires an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, creative power, even a new creation, to reconcile ſinners to God, and make, them come to Chriſt; it proves that their hearts are <hi>full of evil,</hi> nothing but ſin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly.</hi> A wrong view of the inability of ſinners, is one principal ground of their ſecurity in ſin. Many ſeem to make their inability to come to Chriſt, a cloak for their great ſin of unbelief. Hence they often aſk, "If I cannot come to Chriſt why am I blame-worthy?" Let me vary the queſtion a little. If I am ſo unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and ſo wicked, that I cannot love Chriſt, nor come to him, why am I wicked at all? Or why am I to be blamed for that in which all my blame-worthineſs and wickedneſs conſiſts? or for having ſuch hatred to Chriſt, the beſt of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that I cannot receive him? This queſtion may be anſwered thus: If I cannot come to Chriſt becauſe I will not; then I am to blame for this very reaſon, <hi>becauſe I cannot.</hi> But if I cannot come when I am willing, becauſe I have not natural power, how am I then to be blamed? We anſwer, you are not: And if you are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, you have come already. But there is no ſuch inability in any man to free him from blame. Yet, this natural inability is that for which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny plead, and by which they mean to excuſe
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:034258_0031_0FFC3C97B12CAB38"/>
themſelves from blame. Hence it is often ſaid, I ſhould be glad to come to Chriſt, if I could, but I cannot. This implies, that the inability in the will is actually removed, and there is yet an inability, which does both keep them from Chriſt, and free them from blame. But this is a wrong view of inability; and ſerves only to keep ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners at eaſe in their ſins. Such therefore, as do not come to Chriſt by faith and love; and yet imagine that they are willing to come, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, are ſtupid, unconvicted ſinners, and never knew the plague of their own hearts. And whenever they are made to ſee the plague of the heart, they will change their voice, and ſay, we could come to Chriſt if we would, but the will not. That is, we are now convicted that nothing is in the way of coming to Chriſt, but an obſtinate and perverſe will; which leaves us without any excuſe, or cloak for our ſin. As Chriſt ſays, "If I had not come, and ſpoken to them, they had not had ſin, but now, they have no cloak for their ſin." If ſinners really believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this, and had thorough conviction of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that their inability was their crime, and no excuſe, it would put an utter end to ſecurity, and make them cry out with the diſtreſſed Jail- "What muſt I do to be ſaved?"</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly.</hi> All pleas in favor of any inabilty to come to Chriſt, which do not conſiſt in a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful unwillingneſs, betray the deceitfulneſs, and great wickedneſs of our hearts. The language of all ſuch pleas, are in favor of independence, and ſhow that we are determined to maintain it —that being unable to come to Chriſt, believe,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:034258_0032_0FFC3C94889EAA40"/>
and obey the goſpel, we are under no obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions—and, that neither the law, nor the goſpel can bind us to obedience, when we "Cannot come," nor obey. Hence we are all excuſed, becauſe we cannot come to Chriſt, and obey the law, nor the goſpel. And here, we may reſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, until God ſhall draw, and make us able, or willing to come.</p>
            <p>Thus ſinners in their own imaginations, have made the law void and of none effect, and brot down all God's commands in the law, and goſpel too, on a level with their diſpoſitions; ſo, that unleſs God make them willing, they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no obligation to obey. And here they reſt; crying "Peace, peace, when there is no peace;" but they are every moment expoſed to be "Suddenly deſtroyed, and that without rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edy."<note n="§" place="bottom">Prov. xxix. 1.</note> And this deſtruction, "From the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Lord, and from the glory of his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er," is coming upon them, for that very inabil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, which is the ground of their ſecurity: or becauſe they "Cannot come to Chriſt," and "Obey not the goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; they ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion," &amp;c. How little ground is there then, or rather, there is no juſt grounds, for this ſecurity of unbelieving ſinners, on account of their ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to repent and believe the goſpel; or on any account whatſoever. Therefore,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly.</hi> We ſee, "That God's law, and his right to command, remain in full force," as ſome juſtly obſerve,<note n="*" place="bottom">I here refer my readers to Mr. Weſt, Mr. Smalley, and Mr. Spalding, on this ſubject of inability.</note> and as is fully expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb facs="unknown:034258_0033_0FFC3C924E1A5A00"/>
in the ſcriptures of truth, notwithſtanding all the inability of ſinners to obey. God doth not give up his right to command, nor leſſen his commands, either in the law, or goſpel, in the leaſt degree, on account of any inability in men to obey them. But all that was required of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am in innocency, is now required of all his poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity—that all ſhould "Love the Lord their God, with all their heart, and their neighbor as themſelves." And that they ſhould be perfect, even as God is perfect. All this appears perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reaſonable, when we conſider, that by the fall, men loſt no <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ability to obey, <hi>except a willing mind.</hi> In all other reſpects, ſinners are as able to keep the law perfectly, as Adam was in inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency. Hence God's demands on ſinners, in his law, are fully kept up to view; and it curſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es "Every one that continueth not in all things written in the book of the law to do them." And gives no hope, that this curſe will ever be taken off, but only by hearty obedience to the goſpel, in coming to Chriſt for life; which ſinners thro unwillingneſs, never can do, "Except the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther draw them." Notwithſtanding the fall, ſinners ſtill maintain their natural abilities to do well, to obey the law, and the goſpel; and it is ſtill required of them to do it, by all the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of God. Yet being prone to evil, as the ſparks are to fly upward, &amp; wholly indiſpoſed to do well; they can do evil, are "Wiſe to do it; but to do good they have no might," "No man can come to me," &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eighthly.</hi> If the inability of mankind to be holy, or to come to Chriſt in the exerciſe of
<pb facs="unknown:034258_0034_0FFC3C90C2B91138"/>
faith and love, conſiſteth in the obſtinacy of their will; then, it is manifeſt, that there is no good reaſon, why they ſhould not be called upon, to come immediately to Chriſt, in the exerciſe of true repentance and faith. And this is the ſum of all goſpel preaching. Teſtifying repentance towards God, and faith toward our Lord Jeſus Chriſt." "And they went out and preached that men ſhould repent."<note n="†" place="bottom">Mark vi. 12. and Acts xx. 21.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Such preachers therefore, and many ſuch there are, who, on account of ſinners' inability to come to Chriſt immediately, in the exerciſe of holy faith and love, are directing them to impen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itent prayers and doings, in order to obtain of God repentance and faith, in this way of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as they call it: Such I ſay, "Yet not I, but the Lord," are "Teaching for doctrines the commandments of men," and making "Void the commandments of God," by ſuch vain tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. For, ſuch directions as theſe, which can be obeyed without, and <hi>only</hi> without repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, are not found in the word of God. Theſe commands to impenitent doings, on account of inability to repent and believe <hi>now,</hi> are taught <hi>only</hi> by the "Precepts of men;" and they do not hang on thoſe two commands, of love to God, and our neighbor; as do all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands in the law, and the prophets.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Mat. xxii. 40.</note> For theſe directions, which we are ſpeaking againſt, are to be performed <hi>without</hi> love, <hi>without</hi> repentance and faith; on account of ſome inability in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, to love and believe immediately. And is
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:034258_0035_0FFC3C8E8719EAB8"/>
it not moſt evident that ſuch preaching has a direct tendency to confirm ſinners in a belief, that their inability is not their crime, but does really excuſe them from obligation to repent and obey the goſpel, as ſoon as they hear it, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay? In this view, and in this only, are impenitent ſinners pleaſed with ſuch directions. For they feel, and they know, that all directions to impenitent prayers and doings, are founded on their inability to be holy <hi>now,</hi> and have a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect tendency to keep their obligation to immed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iate repentance and faith out of view; and do confirm them in their vain excuſe.</p>
            <p>Such preaching therefore, has no tendency to awaken, convict, and convert ſinners; but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly the reverſe. It tends to ſtrip the minds of ſinners, of all true conviction of their ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and to ſtrengthen the "Hands of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he ſhould not return from his wicked way."<note n="§" place="bottom">Ezek. xiii. 22.</note> It tends to confirm ſinners in a belief, that they are able and willing to do their duty, and that in ſome good meaſure they perform it, even while they are unable to repent and believe the goſpel. And thus, ſinners are encouraged in believing a lie, that they can pleaſe God, and have their prayers heard and anſwered without faith. And alſo, by ſuch preaching, men are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to go about to eſtabliſh their own right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs, until they drop into hell. And ſo long as ſinners believe ſuch preaching as this, it is impoſſible for them to feel their need of the atonement and interceſſion of Chriſt, or the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of praying by faith in his name, in order to
<pb facs="unknown:034258_0036_0FFC3C8B8C0F6AE8"/>
have their prayers heard, and graciouſly anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his ſake. For certainly, impenitent, unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving ſinners do not pray in the name of Chriſt, to whom they will not come. And if, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, they can have their prayers heard, and a gracious anſwer to them, even with the gift of repentance and faith; then Chriſt is dead in vain, and his interceſſion is of no value. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, all ſuch directions to any prayers, or to any doings, otherwiſe than in the exerciſe of faith, and all encouragement that ſuch faithleſs prayers will meet with acceptance, and a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious anſwer from God, are directly againſt Chriſt, and tend to deſtroy his kingdom and the ſouls of men. But, you will aſk; muſt not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent ſinners be directed to pray? They cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly muſt. "I will that men pray every where;" that is, all men ſhould pray. But how? "Lifting up holy hands without wrath and doubting." "Repent"—"and pray," ſays Peter, to Simon the ſorcerer, who was in the bonds of iniquity. And there is no ſuch thing as praying in truth and reality, or according to directions in ſcripture, but in the exerciſe of true repentance and faith. And as the ſcriptures di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect ſinners to make no other prayers than ſuch as are of faith; ſo, it gives no encouragement that any other prayers will be heard and accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God. "If I regard iniquity in my heart," as all impenitent ſinners do, "The Lord will not hear me." "But let him aſk in faith, nothing wavering," or doubting.

               <hi>Tenthly.</hi> In view of this ſubject, we ſee the neceſſity of <hi>eternal election.</hi> You fight againſt this doctrine: But what is like to become of you, if this be not true? You cannot, you will not come to Chriſt that you might have life. And if God hath not loved you firſt, "With an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting love," by which he determined to draw you to Chriſt, how are you ever likely to come? If you object againſt coming yourſelves, and will not come; and object too, againſt God's draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you to Chriſt, according to his eternal pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; by what means then do you expect to come? Chriſt ſays, "Ye have not choſen me;" and if he has not choſen you firſt, how is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that you ſhould be ſaved? You ſay, "If this doctrine of election be true, then if I am not elected I cannot be ſaved, do what I will. But what will you do? Will you come to Chriſt? And will you chooſe him, without being drawn by God's everlaſting love, and without his choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing you firſt? If you would, there would be no need of God's drawing you by his eternal, ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, electing love. The election of God, by which, in his everlaſting love, he determined to draw ſinners to Chriſt, is neceſſary <hi>only</hi> becauſe they will not come without it. Chriſt muſt chooſe you firſt, becauſe you have not, and will not chooſe him. He ſays, "Ye have not cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen me, but I have choſen you, and ordained you, that you ſhould go, and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit ſhould remain." How then can any expect to be ſaved, unleſs they are firſt cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen by Chriſt, ſince they have not choſen him? And, if ſinners are firſt choſen by, and in Chriſt,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:034258_0039_0FFC3C8405DD9E10"/>
they were "Choſen in him before the foundation of the world." But, "If I am not one of the elect, then I cannot be ſaved." No, if you will not chooſe Chriſt, nor come to him; and, if he has not choſen you, there can be no hope. If all ſinners refuſe, and none have choſen Chriſt, nor ever will come to him except the Father draw them, then all the hope there is, that any will ever come, and be ſaved, is from God's eternal, electing love, by which he has determined to draw and ſave ſome. And for ſinners to refuſe to come to Chriſt, and to chooſe him; and to object alſo againſt his chooſing them, is very extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary indeed. If you will not chooſe Chriſt, and he has not choſen you, one would think, your caſe muſt be deſperate, and without hope. And ſince there is certainly no hope, that any of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind ever will come to Chriſt, or chooſe him, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Father draw them; then all the hope there is, that any will come, and be ſaved, is from the eternal, electing love of God, by which he has determined to draw and ſave ſome. "I have loved thee with an everlaſting love, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with loving kindneſs have I drawn thee."<note n="†" place="bottom">Jerem. xxxi. 3.</note> "Ye have not choſen me, but I have choſen you." "We love him becauſe he firſt loved us;" even with his eternal, everlaſting, or electing love. This is the cauſe of our loving him. In this view it is ſaid, "Jacob have I loved, but Eſau have I hated: That the purpoſe of God according to election might ſtand, not of works, but of him that calleth"—of him that calleth, "Accord<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing to his purporſe," even his eternal purpoſe
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:034258_0040_0FFC3C8279018180"/>
by which he loved Jacob, and hated Eſau, while they were not yet born, and neither had done any good or evil. "According as he hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen us in him," that is, in Chriſt, "Before the foundation of the world; that we ſhould be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly." Who hath ſaved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works; but according to his own purpoſe, and grace, which was given us in Chriſt Jeſus, before the world began." "Being predeſtinated according to the purpoſe of him who worketh all things after the counſel of his own will." "Elect accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the foreknowledge of God." "Whom he did foreknow, them alſo he did predeſtinate to be conformed to the image of his Son." "Moreover, whom he did predeſtinate, them he alſo called, and whom he called, them he alſo juſtified, and whom he juſtified, them he alſo glorified." "Inſomuch that, if it were poſſible they ſhall deceive the very elect." "I know whom I have choſen." "Knowing therefore, brethren, your election of God." "Make your calling and election ſure." "Even at this preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent time alſo, there is a remnant according to the election of grace." "Shall ſend his angels, and gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other." But who are theſe elect? Is it Chriſt only? As ſome ſay, Chriſt is the elect. But is it not certain that theſe alſo are elect ſouls, "Choſen in Chriſt, before the foundation of the world?" "Speak and hold not thy peace," that is, preach among this people. But what encouragement to preach if the doctrine of election be true? Anſwer.
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:034258_0041_0FFC3C8006807978"/>
"Speak and hold not thy peace," for this very reaſon, to gather in the elect. "For I have much people in this city:" that is, many elect ſouls.<note n="*" place="bottom">Acts xviii. 9.10.</note> "And as many as were ordained to eternal life, believed." Thus, "No man can come to me, except the Father, which hath ſent me, draw him." "And ye will not come to me that ye might have life." But, all that the Fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er hath given to me, ſhall come to me."

            <p>And all thoſe, who underſtandingly oppoſe, and hate this doctrine of election, are evidently of that number, who "Will not come to Chriſt, that they might have life;" but are building their hopes of life, on their own works; and are found fighting againſt "<hi>Election of grace,</hi>" mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe it <hi>is of grace,</hi> and not of works.—"And they would not come."<note n="‡" place="bottom">Mat. xxii. 3.</note>

himſelf enquire in the words of the Apoſtle, "Who maketh" me "To differ?" and you may each one anſwer, with the ſame Apoſtle, "By the grace of God I am what I am." You may aſcribe it all to ſovereign grace. God ſays by his Prophet: "I have loved thee with an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting love, therefore with loving kindneſs have I drawn thee." You love him, and come to Chriſt, becauſe he firſt loved you; as he did Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, with an eternal, electing love: or, "Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the election of grace." "By grace are ye ſaved, through faith, and that not of your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, it is the gift of God. Not of works, left any man ſhould boaſt." You have nothing to boaſt of, except the grace of God, which alone has made you to differ from others, and kindly drawn you home to God, in Chriſt, by bowing your ſtubborn will. In the day of God's gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious power; you have become his willing peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and actually come to Chriſt, to his glorious feaſt of goſpel grace.</p>
            <p>Therefore, be humble, and learn to pity others, who yet remain unwilling, and boaſt not againſt them. And if they ſtrive againſt that election of grace, which you now believe in, and which hath made you to differ; then remember, that you muſt not ſtrive with them. "The ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of the Lord muſt not ſtrive, but be gentle; in meekneſs inſtructing thoſe that oppoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, if God peradventure will give them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, to the acknowledgment of the truth."</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi> Let ſuch as yet remain unwilling, and cannot come to Chriſt, accept the word of exhortation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="unknown:034258_0043_0FFC3C7955452CD8"/>You have heard what is implied in coming to Chriſt; and the reaſon why "No man can come except the Father draw him;" and the remark which have been made on the ſubject.</p>
            <p>Let us now pray, and beſeech you, and "As tho God did beſeech you by us, we pray you in Chriſt's ſtead," ſeriouſly to conſider, and lay theſe things to heart, and to be "Reconcil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to God," in coming to Chriſt his Son. Be entreated to enquire, like the noble Bereans, "Whether theſe things are ſo." For, if indeed they are ſo, then thoſe, who cannot come to Chriſt, are involved in the moſt dreadful and ruined ſtate and condition. They cannot come to Chriſt, becauſe of a ſtubborn will, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them as wicked as devils. And although our not coming to Chriſt is by reaſon of a rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious will, which renders us as full of ſin as the devils; yet we aſk, why are we to blame? Thus you plead the greatneſs, and ſtrength of your wickedneſs as an excuſe, and argument, that you are not blame-worthy. Yet you are creatures, wholly dependent on God, and in every reſpect under obligations to him, and to his law; which like himſelf, is holy, juſt, and good: And which binds all creatures to love him ſupremely; and curſes every one that continues not in all things written in the book of the law to do them."</p>
            <p>Yet, know O ſinners, who cannot come to Chriſt, that your carnal minds are enmity againſt this glorious God; they are not ſubject to his law, neither indeed <hi>can be.</hi> And your carnal minds render you ſo ſtubborn and rebellious, that when Chriſt has come, and in obedience to this
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:034258_0044_0FFC3C77CD3009A0"/>
holy law of God, rendered himſelf a proper object of your love and choice; yet, you hate both him, and his Father, to ſuch a degree, that you will not come to him, except the Fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er draw you, by his Almighty power, in ſubduing your will. Yet you ſay, why am I to blame? But I aſk, why are you not to blame, or blame-worthy? Your own conſciences tell you, as well as the ſcriptures, that your inability to repent and come to Chriſt, is not ſuch as to render you excuſable for not coming.</p>
            <p>It is not want of natural power, as we have ſeen; for this would excuſe you. It is not becauſe Chriſt is not a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per object of love; for he is altogether lovely. If he were not, you would be blameleſs in not receiving him.</p>
            <p>Your inability is not want of evidence to ground your ſaith and love upon. It is not want of conviction of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the truth of thoſe things you are required to believe, or that Chriſt is thus a proper object of love. For your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences tell you that he is, and that his teſtimony is true. It is not want of motives, or arguments, to perſuade you, even the moſt powerful motives, that you do not come to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>It is not becauſe that ſatan overpowers you, ſo as to lead you to purſue after the riches, honors, and pleaſures of the world contrary to your wills. If ſo you are not blame-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy. But you are willing captives to ſatan, the God of this world. Your inability is not becauſe there is more pleaſure and happineſs in the ſervice of ſin and ſatan, than in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God. For your conſciences tell you, as do the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures alſo, that Wiſdom's ways are ways of pleaſantneſs; <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> that in "Keeping God's commands there is great reward." But, in ſin, "Even in laughter the heart is ſorrowful." Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is your inability found in the unwillingneſs of Chriſt to receive you, even all who are willing to come to him. But, it is found only in your own unwillingneſs to come to him— it is found only in ſinners, and in thoſe who are full of evil, nothing but ſin, in whom "Dwells no good thing." "And ye will not come to me that ye might have life." "He is deſpiſed and rejected of men." "And when we ſhall ſee him, there is no beauty in him that we ſhould deſire him."</p>
            <p>And now, is not this the real, and only inability of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in coming to Chriſt? If ſo, why are they not to be blamed? And where can blame be found, if not in thoſe who are ſo full of contempt, and hatred againſt Chriſt, the beſt of beings, that they will not receive him, and <hi>cannot</hi> come to him, by reaſon of unwillingneſs; not ever be made willing, but by a new creation, by the drawing of the Father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="unknown:034258_0045_0FFC3C75526BCA30"/>Be perſuaded then to receive conviction, that the ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of ſinners to repent, believe, and come to Chriſt by love, is found only in their own ſinful and perverſe wills. By this, they not only refuſe Chriſt, "And have not choſen him," but even hate the doctrine, that he has choſen them; or that God has diſtinguiſhed ſome of mankind from others, by <hi>eternal election.</hi> Thus ſinners, in their diſtraction, not only neglect the great ſalvation; but they hate that doctrine of God's electing love, by which he has determined to make ſome willing to enjoy it, and which affords the only ground to hope, that the inability of any one will ever be removed; or that any will ever come to Chriſt and be ſaved. And all thoſe, who cannot come to Chriſt, or have not choſen him, will be equally oppoſed to his chooſing them; that is, to the doctrine of election by grace. But, ſays the objector, you have miſtaken our meaning. We do not object againſt God's chooſing ſome to ſalvation; but that he ſhould chooſe a part, and not the whole. This looks like partiality; and makes God a reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of perſons. Anſwer. This objection ſhows your hearts very plainly; and makes it evident, that all oppoſition to particular and perſonal election, is founded in a belief of the doctrine of univerſal ſalvation—that God will, or ought to ſave all men: And that if God has determined to ſave but a "remnant, according to the election of grace;" this, makes him a reſpecter of perſons, and is derogatory to his charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Hence, it is often ſaid, I had rather be an univerſaliſt, than to believe the doctrine of particular, and perſonal election.</p>
            <p>And indeed, you are an univerſaliſt, if you do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in particular election. For certainly, God has prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to ſave a part, and only a part of mankind; or elſe the whole. And it is impoſſible to oppoſe the doctrine of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal election, but only in a belief of univerſal ſalvation— that God will, or ought to ſave, not a remnant only, but the whole of mankind. Hence it is, that the ſame texts of Scripture are commonly urged againſt particular election, which the univerſaliſts improve to ſupport the doctrine of univerſal ſalvation, viz. ſuch as theſe: "As I live, ſaith the Lord God, I have no pleaſure in the death of the wicked." And again: "Who will have all men to be ſaved, and come to the knowledge of the truth," &amp;c. Yet, in perfect conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with theſe, and all other paſſages of ſcripture, God ſays, "Altho the number of the children of Iſrael be as the ſand of
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:034258_0046_0FFC3C73A1C2F5A8"/>
the ſea, yet a remnant ſhall be ſaved." "And even at this preſent time alſo, there is a remnant according to the election of grace." And "Many are called, but few choſen." And in all this, "I perceive that God is no reſpecter of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: But in every nation, he that feareth God, and worketh righteouſneſs is accepted of him." Thus the doctrine of elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſtill appears to be ſcriptural and good, and all oppoſition to it involves the doctrine of univerſal ſalvation. For, if <hi>election</hi> be true; then, the doctrine of univerſal ſalvation is not. And we oppoſe the firſt, <hi>only</hi> to eſtabliſh the ſecond.</p>
            <p>But, ſome may ſtill object, and ſay; if this doctrine be true, then, if I am not elected, I cannot be ſaved, although I ſhould do well, and live a good and holy life, and commit no ſin all my days: And if I am elected I ſhall be ſaved, let me do what I will, or if I do nothing.</p>
            <p>Anſwer. If you thus live a good and holy life &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit no ſin; but "Fear God and work righteouſneſs," then you will be accepted of him; and want of election will not exclude you from ſalvation. For, by theſe holy exerciſes and forſaking ſin, you will come to Chriſt; and hereby make your calling and election ſure. But, theſe good works you will never do, unleſs God has "Before ordained, that you ſhould walk in them," and thus draws you by his "Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing" and electing love. And if you do nothing, or do not walk in theſe good works, then you cannot make your calling and election ſure; nor ever be ſaved. For "He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth ſhall be ſaved, but he that believeth not ſhall be damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed." And he that doeth nothing, will be damned alſo: For ſuch an one does not believe, and cannot come to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But, you will ſay, we do not yet ſee the propriety of uſing the word <hi>cannot,</hi> to expreſs unwillingneſs, and blame.</p>
            <p>Anſwer. If holy beings "<hi>cannot do evil,</hi>" becauſe they <hi>are holy</hi>; then, it is equally proper to ſay, that <hi>unholy</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings cannot do good becauſe they are unholy &amp; blame-worthy.</p>
            <p>If it be expreſſive of the infinite holineſs and perfection of God, that he "<hi>cannot lie</hi>" and it be <hi>impoſſible for God to lie;</hi> then it is equally expreſſive of the higheſt degree of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in men, that they <hi>cannot</hi> ſpeak the truth, nor love the truth; or that they <hi>cannot come to Chriſt,</hi> who is "the <hi>way,</hi> the <hi>truth,</hi> and the <hi>life.</hi>" And if he, who is born of God <hi>ſinneth not,</hi> &amp; he <hi>cannot ſin,</hi> becauſe he is born of God; and if this <hi>cannot</hi> is expreſſive of an <hi>holy, virtuous,</hi> and praiſe-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy character; then, it is equally expreſſive of a totally ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:034258_0047_0FFC3C7218CD3288"/>
character, when it is ſaid, the wicked "<hi>cannot ceaſe from ſin,</hi>" and <hi>cannot</hi> come to Chriſt, who will ſave them from their ſins. For, they love their ſins, ſo that they cannot forſake them. And they hate Chriſt, ſo that they <hi>cannot come to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Truly, "Ye cannot ſerve the Lord." But why? "For he is an holy God," and ye are unholy. If ye were not, ye could, and ye would ſerve the Lord, and come unto Chriſt. You cannot come to him, receive him, nor love him, becauſe he is "holy, harmleſs, and undefiled; ſeparate from ſinners." But you are unholy, defiled, ſeparated <hi>from</hi> Chriſt, <hi>with</hi> ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; and <hi>only by ſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"Behold, their ear is uncircumciſed, and they <hi>cannot</hi> hearken." But why? "Behold, the word of the Lord is unto them a reproach; they have no delight in it. He feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of aſhes; a deceived heart hath turned him aſide, ſo that he <hi>cannot</hi> deliver his own ſoul, nor ſay, is there not a lie in my right hand?" "Ye ſtiff-necked, and uncircumciſed in heart and ears; ye do always reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt; as your fathers did, ſo do ye." Why then will you any longer plead <hi>not guilty</hi>? And ſay if I <hi>cannot</hi> come to Chriſt, why am I blamed? Do you not ſee, that God views you altogether ſinful, and blame worthy, that you cannot ſerve the Lord, that you cannot hearken, that you cannot deliver your own ſouls; and that you cannot come to Chriſt? All this inability is contained in a deceived heart, which hath turned you aſide, ſo that you cannot deliver your own ſouls, nor ſay, is there not a lie in my right hand? You cannot come to Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you are ſtiff necked, and uncircumciſed in heart, and ears; and hereby ye do always reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt, and will not come to Chriſt. Ye cannot, ye will not come, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you are earthly, ſenſual, deviliſh. In this view of ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, how is it poſſible for any to ſay, "I am not polluted," I have not ſinned; when this totally ſinful character contains all our inability; and is the whole reaſon on our part, why we cannot this day leave our ſins, and come to Chriſt by faith. And in this view, we ſee the propriety of Chriſt's looking round on the unbelieving Jews, with anger; being grieved for the hardneſs of their hearts: And that God ſhould be "angry with the wicked every day;" and threaten them with everlaſting deſtruction for unbelief. Your inability is juſt the ſame as that of the Jews. They could not come to Chriſt; they would not receive him. "He came to his own, and his own received him not." And, becauſe they could
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:034258_0048_0FFC3C709156E760"/>
not receive him, the things of their peace are now hidden from their eyes; and they are going down to deſtruction, from one generation to another, continually. All this is come upon them, becauſe, when Chriſt would have gathered them, &amp; ſaved them, they would not. "Ye will not come to me, that ye might have life." This had a primary reference to the Jews, altho it is equally true of all men, both Jews, and Gentiles, who are under ſin. "No man can," becauſe no man will, "Come to me, except the Father, which hath ſent me, draw him." Now therefore, let us all receive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, that our inability to be holy, to forſake our ſins, and come to chriſt by faith, centers in a rebellious will, and makes it evident that all, who cannot come to him, by faith and love, are "Without excuſe;" and "Have no cloak for their ſin." And as you have heard what it is to come unto Chriſt; let all be exhorted, and perſuaded to accept of his kind invitations, and come unto him: For he ſays, "Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and ye ſhall find reſt to your ſouls." "And the ſpirit and the bride ſay come. And let him that heareth, ſay come. And let him that is athirſt come. And whoſoever will, let him take the water of life freely."
