            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>AS the Rev. Dr. COLMAN ſtood among the firſt Ornaments and Benefactors to his Country, it ſeems but a becoming Gratitude to <hi>him,</hi> and Honour to <hi>ourſelves,</hi> to raiſe a Monument to his Memory. His polite and generous Pen was always ready to do the ſame for others; and ſeized every Opportunity to charm the Living, by the Virtues and Examples of the Dead: Though few Characters and Actions would bear to be tranſmitted down to Poſterity with equal Advantage to his own.</p>
            <p>The following Sheets preſent us with his entertaining and uſeful Hiſtory, which will convey to the Reader ſome Idea of the <hi>Man of God taken from our Head;</hi> in which the Reverend Author has been at great Labour, under a tender State of Health, and the conſtant Avocations of his Miniſtry, to ſearch into Letters, and other Manuſcripts, in order to compile and digeſt what is here given to the Reader. Thoſe who are acquainted with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue and Difficulty attending Diſquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb facs="unknown:006434_0004_1028DAB29A5C17B8"/>of this Kind, will read a Life princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally compoſed of ſuch inconnected Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials with a reaſonable Candor. And it cannot but be regretted, that the Doctor <hi>himſelf,</hi> either neglected the Records of a more regular Diary, or that he deſtroyed ſuch valuable Memorials. As he certainly did from a diffident Modeſty, Numbers of his own Sermons, and in the Judgment of his former Colleague, the Rev. Mr. <hi>William Cooper,</hi> ſome of his moſt uſeful and ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Performances.</p>
            <p>It will not be wondered at, that no written Accounts will convey to Strangers an Idea of Dr. COLMAN, equal to what we had raiſed of him, who have been hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in his Converſation, and ſeen him in all the Decorum of Pulpit-Oratory. Nor can the <hi>illuſtrious Senate</hi> at GLASGOW fully know how gracefully he wore, and how well he adorned their Honours.</p>
            <p>His Converſation was admirably poliſht and courtly, and all his Behaviour was that of the moſt elegant Gentleman, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>But he principally ſhone in the Deſk: Here his Air was compoſed and grave, his
<pb facs="unknown:006434_0005_1028EA4359A8AA20"/>Action juſt and delicate, and his Voice inimitably ſoft and tuneful, managed with the greateſt Propriety, and exquiſite Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Modulation. His Diction was ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated and lofty, but eaſy and plain, like his Models, the <hi>inſpired Claſſicks:</hi> And the Arrangement of his Style, and the Turn of his Periods exactly adapted to the Elevations and Cadences of his own muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Pronunciation. He had a fine Taſte for the ſublimer Improvements of modern Philoſophy. On theſe Themes how would he take Fire, and with uncommon Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Imagination, a Dignity of Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and an Ardor of Divine Eloquence tranſport and Audience, with a Devotion near to angelical! Witneſs, among others, <hi>his ſecond Diſcourſe on the Incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though the fineſt of his Productions have never been printed—ſome of which might have appeared upon this Occaſion, if the Appendix to this Eſſay had not been ſuppreſſed.</p>
            <p>If the Reverend Author of this Hiſtory had not expreſt his Diſinclination to any Encomium from us, yet it had been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
<pb facs="unknown:006434_0006_1028EA45ED2CC608"/>in <hi>itſelf,</hi> and perhaps aſſuming in <hi>us</hi> to attempt one, as he is our <hi>elder Brother,</hi> and has been long known to the World, and reſpected for his Learning and Piety, and his Praiſe is in the Churches for his Uſefulneſs, Courage and Fidelity.</p>
            <p>It may rather ſeem that we ourſelves need an Apology, for our Names appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this Place, unleſs the Deſire of our valuable Friend, the Relation we ſtood in to Dr. COLMAN, the Regards he was pleaſed to ſhew us in his Life-Time, and in his <hi>laſt Will</hi> leaving to ſome of us the Care of his Papers, be our Excuſe.</p>
            <p>May the glowing Examples here exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, inſpire Survivors to an Imitation: May the Mantle of the aſcended Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet fall upon his Sons in the Miniſtry, and particularly may our worthy Brother the Writer of the enſuing Narrative, high in his Father's Affection and Eſteem, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit a double Portion of his Spirit.</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>IT is an Obſervation of one of the greateſt Men, and fineſt Writers of the laſt Age, concerning Perſons eminent for Learning, Piety and Uſefulneſs deceaſed, <hi>"That either not a little, or nothing at all ought to be ſaid</hi> — Their ſplendid Works and Services publickly known are thought (by ſome) abundantly ſufficient to ſupply the Want of an Hiſtory of their Lives, hence it has been ſaid,</p>
            <q>
               <l>Dicta et Facta Eorum ſunt Memoriae Eorum</l>
               <l>—ſcripta loquuntur.—</l>
            </q>
            <p>But I rather think, That the truly Great and Good ſhould have their Speeches and Actions at large narrated and faithfully tranſmitted to Poſterity for their Excitation and Imitation. — That ſuch ought not to be laid in the Grave with Silence and Diſregard ſeems to have been the common Senſe of Mankind from the Beginning of Time—Accordingly <hi>Heathens, Jews</hi> and
<pb facs="unknown:006434_0015_1028EA5F322933A8"/>
               <hi>Chriſtians</hi> have endeavoured by all the various Methods that Art could invent to perpetuate the Names and Memories of their reſpective <hi>Heros</hi> and <hi>Patrons,</hi> and as far as poſſible to confer a Kind of Immortality upon them.</p>
            <p>It muſt be confeſſed that <hi>few</hi> are qualified to draw a ſuperiour Character; and do Juſtice to the Memories of ſome excellent Perſons. It is an agreable <hi>Rule</hi> and Caution I have lately met with, ſcil. <hi>"That as the Lives of good and great Men, require ſkilful Pens; ſo the Writer ſhould be animated with a Portion of that Genius that formed the Character whoſe Perſon he draws"</hi>

            <p>It will doubtleſs then be Matter of juſt Wonder to many to find <hi>me</hi> engaging in a Work of this Nature ſo every Way unequal to the <hi>Subject,</hi> and therefore very unfit to ſet it in its proper Points of Light.

            <p>I have been at much Pains and Labour in Compiling and Methodizing the Narrative, all excepting ſome Parts of the firſt ſhort Chapters being collated from vaſt Numbers of ſcattered Papers &amp;c.

            </p>
            <p>If the Work, imperfect as it is, be kindly accepted, and anſwers the high and noble Ends I had in View, I ſhall rejoice and think myſelf well rewarded</p>

               <head>CHAP. I. The Subject of the Narrative, his Birth, Parentage, Genius for Learning, early Piety, catholic Spirit, Deſire to ſee <hi>England,</hi> and embarking for it.</head>
               <p>DR. BENJAMIN COLMAN, was born in <hi>Boſton New-England,</hi> October 19th 1673, of reputable Parents, being ſecond Son of <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth Colman,</hi> who came from <hi>London</hi> and ſettled there not long before<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>William Colmam</hi> was Son of <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Grace Colmam</hi> of <hi>Satterly,</hi> near <hi>Beckles,</hi> in the Country of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and baptized there <hi>Auguſt</hi> 31ſt 1643. This is all I can find concerning his Family. — But the Name <hi>Colman</hi> is happy and honoured in the Chriſtian <hi>Britiſh</hi> Church, from Time to Time— <hi>Colman</hi> a <hi>Scotch Monk</hi> ſucceeded <hi>Finan,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Oſwig</hi> King of the <hi>Northumbrians,</hi> and was at the Head of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Prieſts and Monks in Oppoſition to the Romiſh Church <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 661, and 664. Vid. <hi>Bede</hi> and <hi>Rapin.</hi>
                  </note>.</p>
               <p>He was of a tender Conſtitution from his Birth, and very backward in his <hi>Speech</hi> and <hi>Reading</hi> 'till he arrived
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:006434_0019_1028EA696AD90650"/>to the Age of <hi>five Years;</hi> when at once he grew for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in both, and entred young and ſmall into the <hi>Grammar School</hi> under the Tuition of the venerable and learned Mr. <hi>Ezekiel Cheever.</hi> His ſprightly Genius and Advances in Learning were ſoon (with Pleaſure) obſerved by his <hi>Preceptor,</hi> inſomuch that in his firſt and ſecond Years he was ſeveral Times called upon by him to reprove and ſhame ſome <hi>dull Boys</hi> of upper Forms when they groſly failed in their Catechiſm, and ſome low Exerciſes. He was fired with a laudable Ambition of excelling at his Book, and a Fear of being out-done. By his Induſtry at Home, he always kept foremoſt, or equal to the beſt of the Form at School; and a great Advantage he had (which at that Time gave him no little Pain) in the Promptneſs, Diligence and Brightneſs of his intimate Companion <hi>Prout,</hi> who uſed to ſpend his Hours out of School generally in Studies with him, the two or three laſt Years of his Life; and their <hi>Preceptor</hi> uſed openly to compare their Exerciſes, and ſometimes declare he knew not which were beſt, and bid <hi>Colman</hi> take heed, for the firſt Time he was out-done <hi>Prout</hi> ſhould have his Place.—But alas! a violent Fever ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the lovely, ſhining, ambitious Boy, and ſuddenly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him to an higher Form, to the great Grief as well as Hurt of <hi>Colman,</hi> who was now left without a Rival, and ſo without a Spur to daily Care and Labour. However, he followed his Studies ſo well that he was qualified for an Admiſſion into <hi>Harvard</hi> College in the Year 1688.</p>
               <p>His early Peity was equal to his Learning.

               <p>After his Admiſſion into College he grew in Piety and Learning, and in Favour with God and Man.

               <head>CHAP. II. A Voyage to <hi>England,</hi> Dangers and Hardſhips undergone in it,—taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner and carried into <hi>France.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT was after the Twentieth Day of <hi>July</hi> in the Year 1695 that Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> imbarked for <hi>London</hi> (by the Will of God) on board the Ship <hi>Swan</hi> Capt. <hi>Thomas Gilbert</hi> Commander—For the whole three firſt Days he was on Shipboard he endured the Extremity of Sea Sickneſs, and at times through the Voyage. On the fourth Day the Veſſel ſprang a Leek, and the Water was heard to pour in on the Star-board Tack, which alarmed the Sail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, and made ſome of them remark his Eveneſs and Calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs when they expected he ſhould have been much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted. When the Winds blew a Storm afterward, he
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:006434_0023_1028EA74501F6D18"/>governed his Fears by looking on the Captain, Mate, and Sailors to diſcover what he ſaw in their Faces. When they came into the warm Seas, a <hi>Dolphin</hi> which they had marked with a Scar on his ſhining Back, kept Company with the Ship for Ten or Twelve Days together, feeding on her Bottom.</p>
               <p>At the End of ſeven Weeks a <hi>Seeker</hi> made after them, and ſoon came up with them. She was a Privateer of 20 Guns and an 100 Men, a light and fleet Ship; The Swan was heavy laden, twelve Guns and 24 Men, Sailors and Paſſengers together. The Swan's Company bore their Broad-ſides and Vollies of ſmall Arms ſix or ſeven Times that Afternoon, defending themſelves and annoying the Enemy; but were taken the next Morning, having their Boltſprit ſhot away, and the Maſt, and Rigging ſo torn and cut, that the Maſts fell all together an Hour after; by which means the Ship became a perfect Wreck, and the Company were much looked at by the French when they came into Port. The French had a great Number of Men killed, for they were ſo full that if a ſhot entered it muſt do Execution.</p>
               <p>God graciouſly preſerved Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> in the Fight, expoſed all the while on the Quarter-Deck, where four out of ſeven were wounded, and one mortally. He was much praiſed for his Courage when the Fight was over; but though he charged and diſcharged like the reſt, yet he declared he was ſenſible of no Courage but of a great deal of Fear; and when they had reecived two or three Broadſides he wondered when his Courage would come, as he had heard others talk. In ſhort, he fought like a Philoſopher and a Chriſtian. He looked Death in the Face, and prayed all the while he charged and fired, —while the Boat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwain and others made a Frolick and Sport of it.</p>
               <p>There was a young <hi>Rake,</hi> a Paſſenger on board, that liſped at Atheiſm, and ſpit at Religion every Day of the Voyage, who was now in the Terrors of Death,— when he ſaw Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> take a Muſket, he was aſhamed to leave the Deck; but the firſt Volley of ſmall Arms laid
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:006434_0024_1028EA771CB9CE38"/>him flat on his Belly without being touched: when the great Guns roared he would have crept through the Boards to hide himſelf; he lay as one Dead, and let the Men tread on him or kick him as they pleaſed. At laſt he peeped up when the firing ceaſed for a Minute, and aſked where they were? Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> told him they lay by to charge again; and in a Moment he flew down into the Doctor's Room, and was ſeen no more till the Ship was taken. Yet this Spark when ſafe in <hi>France</hi> was ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culing Religion again, and ſcorning the Miniſters of it as much as ever.</p>
               <p>When the Ship ſtruck the French Boat came on Board, and the Lieutenant took all the Crews Moneys and put them into the Boat. The Sea ran ſo high that Mr. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> was in great Danger of falling beſide the Boat, and when he was between the two Ships could ſee neither, no not a Times the Maſts of either. This was a new Scene of Danger to him, but the Approach to the Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teer ſeemed greateſt of all. As he got up the Side he found his Hat and Wigg gone; and as he looked over the Side there ſtood the young Atheiſt naked on the Deck. —His turn came next; but as they were haling off his Cloaths, he ſaw a compaſſionate Man lifting up his Eyes and Hands to Heaven.—He cried to him imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately <hi>Miſerere mei Domine!</hi> and he anſwered him, Are you a Miniſter? And though he had often intreated the Company not to call him ſo, he immediately owned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; to be one, and down he came to ſeize him for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; But his Shirt was off before he could get down; and he carried him to his Room, and took away Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Shoes and Breeches; and told him, that if he left them upon him ſome body elſe would preſently have them. At laſt he obtained of him his under Pair of Stockings, by ſhowing him eighteen Piſtoles in the Rollers of the Breeches, but as ſoon as he came on the Deck a Fellow would have the Stockings.</p>
               <p>They then dreſſed him up in a few Rags of the Sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, which ſo changed him that none of the Ship's Crew
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:006434_0025_1028EA78A8244690"/>knew him, but would turn from him till he ſpake to them, and then looked at him with Aſtoniſhment. The Captain ſpake Engliſh well, to whom he addreſſed for ſome Cloathing, but he turned from him with Diſdain; and the Prieſt afterwards told him that he hated him as much.</p>
               <p>Providence ſuffered him to be ſpoiled of all that he had thought to ſave in caſe he were taken, but that which he never meant to ſave was preſerved for him. There was an ingenious French Gentlewoman on Board, Mad. <hi>Allaire,</hi> with four Children, going to her Huſband at <hi>London.</hi> Mr. <hi>Colman</hi>'s chief Delight in the Voyage was her little Son of two Years old—whom he made to love him for his Cakes and Sweetmeats. Madam <hi>Allaire</hi> ſeeing a piece of Gold in his Hand as the Privateers Boat was coming on Board, aſked him to let her ſave it for him, which ſhe did, and it brought him nineteen Pounds at <hi>Nants</hi> which made him rich; ſo that what he had no thought of ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was preſerved for him, and all that he had projected to ſave for himſelf was loſt.</p>
               <p>He was put down into the Hold of the Ship among his ragged Companions, which was at firſt grievous to him; but he found afterward the ſingular Care of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in it: for there he was warm, now his Cloaths were taken away; and there he felt no more any Sickneſs, the Motion of the Ship being nothing ſenſible there, to affect the Head or Stomach.</p>
               <p>He had been in the Hold but half a Day, when Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>Allaire</hi> came on Board. The Captain and Officers of the Ship treated her well. She ſoon enquired after Mr. <hi>Colman,</hi> and hearing he was in the Hold, ſhe entreated the Captain's Favour to him that he might be with them in the great Cabbin. When he refuſed that, ſhe aſked leave for him to come up and ſee them. This was granted. But when Madam firſt ſaw him at the Door, ſhe ſhrieked out as if it had been a Ghoſt, ran to him and wept upon his Neck: and he wept with her. Capt. <hi>Gilbert</hi> burſt out into Tears, and ſo did Capt. <hi>Anderſon</hi> and his Lieutenant,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:006434_0026_1028EA7B5149EB28"/>Paſſengers. He was naked from his Ears to his Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and Madam covered him with ſome of her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens Linnen to keep him warm. He ſat an Hour with them, eat and drank and returned comforted to his Hold.</p>
               <p>Preſently away came a Lieutenant to him, to aſk him if Madam were not his Wife? He told him, No! He ſaid he wondered he would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Why then, ſaid he, did ſhe run to you ſhrieking, and fall on your Neck? He told him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe honoured and loved him as a Gentleman and a Miniſter, and was frighted to ſee him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>uſed ſo bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſly.</p>
               <p>When Mr. <hi>Grant</hi> the Mate of the Ship, firſt ſaw him put down into the Hold with them, he turned to thoſe that ſat nigh him, and ſaid, We ſhall bury Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> in three Days Time: But the next Day Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> ſeeing that his Preſence and Company reſtrained the Sailors from a neceſſary Chearfulneſs in their melancholy Condition; bid them be innocently chearful and divert themſelves; upon which Mr. <hi>Grant</hi> (a very grave, prudent and pious Man, 50 Years old) anſwered with Joy; What Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> do you call upon us to be cheerful? What made us ſad was to think you would die here of Sorrow: if we do but ſee you cheerful we ſhall all be merry.</p>
               <p>Among the Plunder Mr. <hi>Colman</hi>'s Bible was found, and the Captain was ſo civil as to ſend it to him, with a ſtrict Prohibition of not ſhowing it to any of his Men. This was a ſingular Favour of God to him, the Ten Days he was with them, and all the Days of his Captivity.—One of the wounded Men was dying in the Hold, and he had leave alſo to pray with him.</p>

               <p>The firſt Night in the Jayl was a very ſhocking Scene to Mr. <hi>Colman,</hi> but he took a Wiſp of Straw like the Reſt to lay under his Head, and ſlept ſoundly on the Floor till Morning, when the Door was unlocked to let the Priſoners into the Yard. But God gave him and two or three others Favour in the Eyes of the Captain of the Priſon, and he allotted them a better Room by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, one Corner of which they filled with Straw and ſlept there at Eaſe.</p>
               <p>Now he cloathed himſelf from Head to Foot with about Three Pounds Ten Shillings. His Wigg coſt him half a Crown, and the reſt was in proportion. But it made him ſo fine, after what he had worn, that when he came into the Yard thus arrayed, his Company did not know him again till he ſpake, which made them very merry.</p>
               <p>While he was in Jayl he and his Company were vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited by one Mr. <hi>Welch,</hi> whom God ſent to comfort and cheriſh them. Whether he were a Proteſtant or n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> he would not diſcover; but when Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> ſaid to him, that he had never before ſeen ſuch Charity; he anſwered it was one of the ſeven Acts of Mercy to viſit an relieve
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:006434_0029_1028EA834A106698"/>Priſoners. He ſaid nothing about Religion, which a Papiſt ſo compaſſionate as he was, would in all Probability have done. From Day to Day at Noon in came a Joint of Meat dreſſed, and by that Time the Company had eat half their Meat he came with a Bottle of Wine hid under his Coat. He ſent alſo a Blanket or two to cover them. And when at ſeven Days End they were going out of Town, he ſaluted the Provoſt that went with them, aſked him to drink, and treated the Company. So they took each of them a Penny Loaf from his Hand, and bid him farewel: pouring out their Prayers for the charitable Samaritan that had bound up their Wounds.</p>
               <p>Late at Night they came to an Houſe and Barn to lodge in, but the Barn was all Mire without a Wiſp of Straw. Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> with two or three turned back to the Houſe, took up the Candle and went up Stairs. The good Woman ſcreamed out, and up came the Provoſt in great Wrath; but being ſhowed an handful of Money the Woman made a low Courteſy and ſo all was well. Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> travelled Ninety Miles on Foot in Four or Five Days and had the beſt of the Inn wherever he came.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Rennes</hi> he was accoſted by a young Prieſt with a Crucifix in his Hands, and a few Rabble at his Heels, aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in <hi>Latin</hi> what he thought of the Crucifix. Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> ſuddenly anſwered him, That it was not an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of religious Worſhip. He would prove (he ſaid) that it was, ſo the Rabble got about them. The Provoſt told him he was a Miniſter. O <hi>Diabole!</hi> cry'd one of them. He bid the Prieſt reprove him. He ſaid, no it was too true; for all Hereticks are out of the holy Church, and therefore belong to the Devil, and are going to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and are Devils. Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> told him he would not have him ſo far to undervalue himſelf as to hold Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation with the Devil, and bid him farewel.—The next Morning he came very humble and fawning, telling him that the Fathers had great Eſteem of him, and Compaſſion to him, upon the Report he had made to them; and would not have a Man of his Parts and Learning periſh
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:006434_0030_1028EA867A63C8D0"/>through Ignorance and Prejudice. Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> prayed him to give his Thanks to their Reverences.—</p>
               <p>When he came near the Walls of <hi>Dinan</hi> it was a ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful Spectacle to ſee that Part of them covered with Priſoners; but when they entred the Town as many of them as had Money had Liberty to take up Lodgings, for three Pence a Night. Proviſions were exceeding cheap, but the French had no Money to buy. The whole Country was poor that they paſſed through, and as for this Town it ſeemed perfectly to live upon them. Their Stay was long in it; two Months at leaſt; the Cauſe of which was the floating Priſons that King <hi>James</hi> had ſet up which were two great Hulks, one at <hi>St.Malo,</hi> the other at <hi>Dunkirk;</hi> where he put the Priſoners that were taken by Ships bearing his Commiſſion. This the Court of <hi>England</hi> reſented, and would exchange no more Priſoners till theſe Floats were laid down.</p>
               <p>At laſt the Paquets arrived at <hi>St. Malo,</hi> and there Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> and others embarked, near a Thouſand of them on board three Boats. He was put on Board the largeſt, about 90 Tuns, and had 400 Men on board. They ſet Sail towards Evening, and ſet their Courſe to ſteer clear of a Ledge of Rocks a few Leagues off in their Way; But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Midnight they were upon them, and in the midſt of Breakers. A timorous Fellow upon the Deck ſcreamed out, and alarmed the living Lading between Decks, and in the Hold. At once they all roſe, and the Maſters with the Men, though they called to them not to ſtir for their Lives, leſt the Veſſel upon ſuch a Motion within ſhould not feel her Helm. But they had as good have ſpoke to the Wind; every one were for running to ſee themſelves die in the Dark; and Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> was left alone in the Cabbin, with a poor trembling Gentlewoman and her two Daughters from <hi>Barbados.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He had eight Piſtoles left of his Money when the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets arrived. He kept two to carry him to <hi>London,</hi> and the other ſix God gave him an Heart to give among his poor Countrymen to redeem a few of them from remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:006434_0031_1028EA883B28AB28"/>Priſoners for Debt. God wonderfully repaid him this his Charity to his Companions in Tribulation ſoon after his Arrival at <hi>London</hi> as you will hear.</p>
               <p>They landed at <hi>Portſmouth</hi> before the End of two Days, but what with Sickneſs and Cold his Throat ſeemed to be cloſed up: But a warm Supping and Bed, by the Bleſſing of God, made him well the next Morning.</p>
               <p>He had lent 30<abbr>

                  </abbr> to a young Spark from <hi>New-York.</hi> He told him of a rich Uncle he had half Way to <hi>London,</hi> and prayed him to lend him one of his Piſtoles, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paid there. He hired Horſes preſently and they mounted, but he had alſo bought himſelf Bootlaſhes, &amp;c. So that before they reached his Uncles their Moneys were gone, and their Horſes had done their Stage.</p>
               <p>His Uncle was a wealthy <hi>Quaker</hi> and received them gravely. But no Credit would he give to this his Nephew, he knew him too well he ſaid. Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> told him what Credit he had given to him, and ſaved him from the Expences of <hi>Portſmouth</hi>—At Table the good Man talked over the ſad Story of <hi>New-England's</hi> perſecuting and hanging the <hi>Quakers.</hi> Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> informed him what a ſtrange Sort of People the <hi>Quakers</hi> were then, and what Provocations they gave our Fathers; how they diſturbed our worſhipping Aſſemblies, and ſometimes appeared in an indecent and terrifying Manner to our timorous Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: But after all he confeſſed to him it was wrong in us to return their Perſecutions of us in the Manner we did, and that the People of <hi>New-England</hi> all thought ſo now.<note n="†" place="bottom">Vid.

<p>They oppoſed the good Order both Civil and Sacred, erected in the Colony. — They broached innumerable Hereſies, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted innumerable Diſorders.—The Warm Zeal of our Fathers here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon moved them to make many ſharp Laws againſt them hoping by the Terror of them to prevent the Miſchiefs threatned—And the Government unhappily proceeded to the Execution of ſome of theſe Laws in ſcourging and then baniſhing, and upon their Return hanging Three or Four of the chief Offenders.—But all theſe Laws have been diſclaimed, renounced and repealed for Threeſcore Years paſt, and therefore Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> could ſay <hi>that the People of</hi> New-England <hi>were of another Spirit and Temper in his Day.</hi> At preſent the <hi>Quakers</hi> are not ſo much as obliged by any Law of the Province to pay Rates for the Support of the Standing Miniſtry in the Towns where they live. And it is found that they have decreaſed, as our good Treatment of them, and Mildneſs towards them has increaſed.—What a Divine of our own Writes is now almoſt univerſally conſented to, Viz. A Man who is a good Neighbour, and a good Subject, has a Right unto his Life and the Comforts of it; And it is not his being of <hi>This</hi> or <hi>That Opinion</hi> in <hi>Religion,</hi> but his doing of ſomething which directly tends to the Hurt of <hi>Human Society</hi> by which this Right can be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited.—</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> then prayed him to adviſe him how to get to <hi>London.</hi> He told him he would lend him Money to carry him thither. Lodge here to Night, ſaid he, and I will have an Horſe and Guide for Thee in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The good Family entreated him courteouſly in the Evening, and in the Morning his good Hoſt lent him Twenty Shillings: which he called for a Fortnight after and received, with moſt hearty Acknowledgments. But his Kinſman never repayed a Farthing of the Moneys he borrowed.—</p>
               <p>There was another young Gentleman, a Rake with a ſober Face, from <hi>Barbados.</hi> He travelled with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany from <hi>Nants</hi> to <hi>Dinan,</hi> and was lodged in the ſame Chamber with Mr. <hi>Colman.</hi> For him he paid Fifty Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings in <hi>France,</hi> and in the End had like to have had his Throat cut for it. When this Spark came of <hi>London</hi> he found Sir — a <hi>Barbados</hi> Knight; an old gaming Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of his, and won an handful or two of Guineas of him. The Moneys bought him two or three fine Suits, and Linnen agreeable. Which was no ſooner in his Lodgings but he and his Clothes were out of them, and he ſhipped off to <hi>Barbados</hi> again without paying a Penny.</p>
               <p>He bragged how generous he had been to good Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> and given him Five Pounds for his Fifty Shillings.
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:006434_0033_1028EA8DDA7C6158"/>A Friend of Mr. <hi>Colman</hi>'s was ſaying in the Coffee-Houſe he wondered at <hi>L—</hi> for abuſing him after this Manner, and a <hi>Sharper</hi> that ſtood by took up the Argument in <hi>L—</hi> Favour; ſaid he was well acquainted with him, and would ſhew him his Lodgings.—He ſaid he had Money to ſpare, and he would pay him.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> was ſo overſeen as to go with the Man upon his Friend's Advice. Accordingly they took Boat and rowed up to <hi>Chelſea.</hi> He led him to an Ale-Houſe over againſt the Knight's Lodgings. The Servants of the Houſe, and the Maſter of the Ale-Houſe told him that <hi>L—</hi> was returned to <hi>Barbados</hi> above a Week before. By their looking on his Companion, they ſaw that he had known it. So Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> found himſelf kidnapt; and what remained was to get out of his Hands as well as he could.</p>
               <p>He dined him handſomely at the Ale Houſe, and was for returning by Water, but finding no Boat and the Sun haſtning down they walked over the Fields to St. <hi>James</hi>'s. On the Way Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> ſaw his cut-throat Companion on the Look-out at every By-place, and expected to be robbed, if not worſe.

Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> ſaw the Servitor's giggle, paying great Reſpect to this his Gentleman as a Man of Figure, and ready to aſſiſt him. So he put the beſt Face he could on it, and while the Ale was drawing he told him that he was a Sollicito<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>HIS firſt Night at <hi>London</hi> was very melancholy. He had loſt all his Letters from <hi>New-England,</hi> and in them his Directions to his Friends: With Difficulty he found out the Houſe of a Reverend Miniſter, but he could not be ſeen: It grew dark, and he prayed Madam to direct him to ſome ſober Houſe where he might lodge that Night.

               <p>His dear Brother Mr. <hi>John Colman,</hi> though but a young Man and beginning the World himſelf, yet like a Father to him gave him a Bill of Exchange upon Mr.

                  <hi>Ives</hi> for Thirty Pounds Sterling; and what was yet a far greater Piece of Generoſity, he gave him Credit with him without any Limit. He did not treſpaſs on this his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs further then one Ten Pounds. This made Forty Pounds which he never aſked him to repay.—</p>
               <p>The Rev. Mr.<hi>Quick</hi> of <hi>London</hi> was the firſt Miniſter he was acquainted with. He loved the Stranger, and was a very affectionate Gentleman: but extreamly ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and quick in his Temper. His Arms and Houſe were always open to him.</p>
               <p>It pleaſed God (about this time) to viſit Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> with a dangerous Fever, but Madam <hi>Ives</hi> had provided him with a good Nurſe. Dr. <hi>Moreton</hi> viſited him, and God healed him. Mr.<hi>Quick</hi> was often with him in his Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and cheered him by ſaying to him, "That he was as near Heaven at <hi>London</hi> as at <hi>Boſton.</hi> It pleaſed God ſoon to recover him.—</p>
               <p>Before he got abroad he was ſurpriſed with an Invitation from Mr. and Madam <hi>Parkhurſt</hi> in <hi>Cheap-Side,</hi> to accept of half a Year's Board at their Houſe. God made her a kind and loving Mother to him, and a generous Friend afterward to ſome of his Friends from <hi>New-England,</hi> in their Straits.</p>
               <p>This happy Lodging at one of the moſt known and frequented Bookſellers among the Diſſenters, brought him ſoon into an Acquaintance with the City Miniſters, which was a ſingular Advantage and Pleaſure. And ſo it has been to his Country and the Churches thereof ſince, as will be ſeen in the Sequel of this Narrative.</p>
               <p>The Family attended the Miniſtry of the Reverend and learned Mr. <hi>How</hi> and Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> with them. This brought him to the Lord's-Table with him and into his Pulpit. Mr. <hi>How</hi> was pleaſed to embrace him as ſoon as the Exerciſe was over, and told him that his Church had lately choſen the Reverend Mr. <hi>Spademan</hi> of <hi>Roterdam</hi> to be his Aſſiſtant and Succeſſor in the Paſtoral Care, and he had accepted their Call. He aſked Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> if he was inclined to ſee <hi>Holland,</hi> and ſaid his Church would bear
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:006434_0036_1028EA95E3C74958"/>his Charges over; and alſo back again if the People of <hi>Roterdam</hi> did not chuſe him to be their Miniſter, or if he did not like the Place. Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> anſwered him, he greatly deſired to ſee <hi>Holland,</hi> and no Terms could be more agreeable than theſe he propoſed. The Support then was an Hundred and Forty Pounds a Year, paid by the <hi>States,</hi> and he was to be Colleague with the Reverend Aged and Learned Mr. <hi>Joſeph Hill,</hi> by whom the <hi>Greek Lexicon</hi> was corrected and amended.</p>
               <p>He was much pleaſed with this Offer of Providence, and ſpake openly of it, by which means it came to Mr. <hi>Hill</hi>'s Ears. For he was then in the City, and averſe to Mr. <hi>Spademan</hi>'s coming over; of which Mr. <hi>How</hi> ſaid nothing when he propoſed the Matter. Mr. <hi>Hill</hi> had wrote a Book of the Dominion of <hi>England</hi> over the Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Seas, for which K. <hi>Charles</hi> the II. had given him an Hundred a Year for Life. It had been with-held, and he was now ſuing for it. He came to Mr. <hi>Colman</hi>'s Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and aſked him if he was the young Man that was going to <hi>Roterdam?</hi> And told him he did ill to act in Concert with Mr. <hi>How</hi> to get his Kinſman away from him who had now been his Aſſiſtant for ſeventeen Years in the Work of the Miniſtry. Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> aſked him with much Surpriſe, if he were the Reverend Mr. <hi>Hill?</hi> And told him that Mr. <hi>How</hi> had never let him know that he was in the City, or that he was not conſenting to Mr. <hi>Spademan</hi>'s coming away. He told him it was the Hope of being under his Miniſtry, Inſpection and Wing that was one great Inducement to him to go to <hi>Roterdam:</hi> But ſince he had the Opportunity now of ſeeing him, and of aſking his Conſent, he ſhould not go without it. He changed his Face upon this and ſaid, "You ſpeak like an ingenious and modeſt Youth, and have already made good Mr. <hi>How</hi>'s Words to me concerning you, and you deſerve a better Settlement than <hi>Roterdam.</hi>" But he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would nor could part with his Kinſman.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> went to Mr. <hi>How</hi> and told him what had happened. He ſeemed much ſurpriſed at his ſudden
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:006434_0037_1028EA986906EE00"/>Promiſe, not to go without Mr. <hi>Hill's</hi> Conſent. He told him there were enough ready to go: and ſo Mr. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> found it; for before the Week was out one went, without ſaying a Word of it to Mr. <hi>Hill.</hi> He told him Mr. <hi>Spademan</hi> was reſolved to return to <hi>London,</hi> and that Mr. <hi>Hill</hi> had nothing to do to hinder it: If the People choſe, the States paid; and in fine, that he had hurt himſelf by not uſing the Underſtanding God had given him.</p>
               <p>At which Words Mr. <hi>Colman</hi>'s Head turned, and he let him know it, and told him "That he began to queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion his own Underſtanding ſince he was pleaſed to tax his Conduct as he did."—He left him in ſome Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and meeting Mr. <hi>Timothy Rogers</hi> told him the Story, and prayed him to ſet him right if he had erred. He ſmiled on him and ſaid, No; However he queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned whether many in his Circumſtances would have acted with like Honeſty and Simplicity.—Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> aſked the Opinion of another Miniſter or two, who praiſed him for what he had done. But by this Means he loſt the Favour of Mr. <hi>How</hi> for two or three Months, who would ſcarce look upon him as he bowed to him among the younger Miniſters.</p>
               <p>Soon after the Miniſters waited on the King at <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſington,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Bates</hi> made one of his fineſt Speeches to him, upon the Diſcovery of the <hi>Aſſaſſination Plot.</hi> It happened the Coach Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> was in came firſt to the <hi>Park-Gate</hi> which led to the <hi>Palace,</hi> and there ſtood the Reverend Dr. <hi>Bates</hi> with his Chair that had carried him over the Stones, through the City; ſo he had the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to give him his Place in the Coach, and walk on Foot to the <hi>Palace.</hi>—The Courtiers cloſed about the loved King <hi>William,</hi> and the Miniſters about the Doctor, in a Circle; and then the Doctor delivered his Speech with an Eaſineſs and Gravity that were peculiar to him, and charming to all. My Lord <hi>Chamberlain</hi> led the Miniſters down to a Treat in the Buttery, where they eat a Bit of the King's Bread and drank a Glaſs of his Wine.</p>

               <p>The Reverend Mr. <hi>Daniel Williams</hi> (afterwards Dr. <hi>Williams</hi>) being out of the City, Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> was aſked to preach for him, and by that means became known to the Reverend Mr. <hi>Calamy</hi> (afterwards Dr. <hi>Calamy</hi>) his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtant. Mr. <hi>Calamy</hi> fell into an endearing Love to Mr. <hi>Colman,</hi> ſo far as to tell him he hoped they ſhould ſpend their Lives in one Church. And ſoon after being in Dr. <hi>Bray</hi>'s Lodgings at <hi>Whitehall</hi> the Doctor enquired after Mr. <hi>Calamy</hi> with great Reſpect, and run out in Praiſes of his Book concerning Vows; ſaying, that he had bought up thirty of them for the Libraries in the Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, which were then forming.

               <p>Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> was gone to <hi>Bath,</hi> to paſs a Month there for the Benefit of the Waters: And Mr. <hi>How</hi> who had much at Heart a Reconciliation between the leading Brethren of the two Boards, <hi>Preſbyterian</hi> and Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal, drew up a ſhort Paper on the Head of <hi>Juſtification,</hi> and got it ſigned by Dr. <hi>Bates</hi> and others on one ſide, and by Mr. <hi>Mead,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> and others on the other ſide. Mr. <hi>Calamy</hi> ſent down an Account of this to Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> with a Copy of Mr.<hi>How</hi>'s Paper, and up he came full of Reſentment, that the Opportunity of his Abſence ſhould be taken for this, as if he were not for Peace, with Truth, as much as any of them.</p>
               <p>He drew up twenty Objections againſt Mr. <hi>How</hi>'s Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and finding none but Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> in the Bookſeller's Shop, he ſhowed him (young as he was) his Paper of Remonſtrance; and talked over <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               <p>Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> carried his Complaint to the Board the next Monday. It was a full Houſe in Expectation of it, for the Thing made a great Noiſe. The Care of the Board was not to ſplit if ſelf again in two. Accordingly, they only choſe a Committee to take the two Papers, and draw up a third in which all might agree. Dr. <hi>Bates,</hi> Dr.—, Mr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> Mr. <hi>Alſop,</hi> Mr. <hi>Burgeſs,</hi> Mr.—were the Committee. Mr. <hi>How</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams</hi> were to be preſent, to offer what they had to ſay.</p>
               <p>The next thing was where to meet: Mr.—told them, "That as he came along Mr. <hi>Parkhurſt</hi> had kindly offered his Houſe, if they would meet there. It was agreed, and Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> by this means heard all that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed between them, there being nothing but a Glaſs-Door and Curtain between the Gentlemen and him. The Points to be diſputed were nice, and the Gentlemen of a ſuperiour Character, which rendered the Hearing a moſt grateful Entertainment.</p>
               <p>They were all very pleaſant. Not an angry Word paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed between Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> and Mr. <hi>How.</hi> A third Paper was produced, and readily aſſented to by all the eight. So every thing was in <hi>Statu quo,</hi> and a great Flame ſtifled.</p>

<pb n="23" facs="unknown:006434_0040_1028EAA20BF4F578"/>Time perfectly at Eaſe in Body as well as Mind, with his wonted Cheerfulneſs and Smiles. "Yeſterday, ſaid he, I loſt the uſe of this Finger, and the Day before of that, and to-morrow I look this will be gone. Brother <hi>Beverly,</hi> added he, your Faith has outran mine; but now I ſhall know before you: I leave you all in the Dark about the Times and Seaſons.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Beverly</hi> had in Print fixed on the Year 1697 for the Accompliſhment of all the great <hi>Expectanda,</hi> the Fall of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> &amp;c. He was one of the moſt humble and modeſt Men living, and yet was ſo bold as to write his Thoughts, and ſet his Time, as is before ſaid. When his Year came and produced nothing extraordinary, the good Man did in the moſt humble and publick Manner confeſs his Error and Preſumption; aſking Pardon of God and his People.</p>
               <p>In like manner the learned Mr. <hi>Fleming</hi> was a moſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Gentleman in Converſation, but in writing bold and daring. His Motto was <hi>Libere ſed Modeſte:</hi> The <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſte</hi> he wore abroad, the <hi>Libere</hi> he kept at Home, uſed it freely, and ſent it abroad in Print.</p>
               <p>Providence now invited Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> to ſee the two <hi>Univerſities.</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Aſhurſt;</hi> then our Agent for <hi>New-England,</hi> carried him with him to his Country-Seat near <hi>Oxford.</hi> He rode twice with him thither in his Coach, and had the Honour to dine with Dr. <hi>Hall,</hi> Bp. of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> a venerable humble, grave Divine. He waited alſo on Dr. <hi>Hough,</hi> Bp. of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and Maſter of <hi>Magdalen College,</hi> a bright and lofry Gentleman, polite in Dreſs and Behaviour. Alſo the Rev. Dr. <hi>Gaſtrell,</hi> ſince Bp. of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> did him the Honour to ſhew him the ſeveral Colleges, and what was rare and curious in them. He told Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> that he wiſhed the Diſſenters might have a College in each Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity for the educating their Children; He was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded the Church would then prevail, and the <hi>Schiſm</hi> ſoon ceaſe.—Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> agreed with him that it might be a probable Means of putting an End to the <hi>Schiſm,</hi> the Eſſence whereof lay (as he judged) very much in
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:006434_0041_1028EAA3973D4B88"/>Uncharitableneſs, and that proceeded from the Ignorance we are in of each other.—Theſe noble Perſons alſo ſpent a Day with Sir <hi>Henry</hi> at his Seat. The Biſhop of <hi>Oxford</hi> paſſed a Complement or two to Mrs. <hi>Aſhurſt,</hi> one of the lovelieſt Perſons then in the Kingdom, and Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> turned them upon her again when they were gone: But ſhe anſwered, "That was a likely Way to ſtarve indeed, for what ſignified Eight Hundred Pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> only for Life"; ſhe afterward married a Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net with three thouſand a Year in Land.</p>
               <p>It was a vaſt Pleaſure to Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> to know the Piety and Humility of the Lady <hi>Aſhurſt,</hi> Daughter to Ld. <hi>Paget,</hi> and who inherited the high Devotion of her noble Mother. The Lady <hi>Paget</hi> being taxed once for marrying her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to Gentlemen of the <hi>fanatick</hi> Character, replied, I take Notice, Madam, that the Gentlemen of that ſort com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly make the beſt Huſbands.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> was ſo happy as to gain the perfect Eſteem of the Lady and her Family. He lived one Fortnight alone with her in the Country, and Sir <hi>Henry</hi> would long after rally him upon his Lady's Fondneſs for him.</p>
               <p>Afterwards at <hi>London</hi> ſhe would not ſuffer him to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void her moſt publick Reſpects in the Congregation. And the honourable Mr. <hi>Bromfield</hi> came charged the laſt Time from <hi>London</hi> with higheſt Expreſſions of Love from her to him.

He was a young Fellow of nineteen Years old, and one of the Company was telling after a booriſh Manner, how he rode after him, came up with and took him.— But ſaid the miſerable Wretch, "I yielded honourably. "Yes, yes, ſaid the other, that you did.—Well, 'tis but a <hi>Swing,</hi> cryed the <hi>Robber</hi> very impudently.

               </p>
               <p>A ſhivering Horror fell upon the Villain, and all the Room turned and ſtared on the Preacher; as if they had never heard a ſerious Diſcourſe before. This ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> to go on, and he found himſelf helped
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:006434_0043_1028EAAA992827B0"/>to ſpeak very much to his own Satisfaction, on the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for a Quarter of an Hour.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as he mounted again, the <hi>Steward</hi> ſaid to him, "Sir, you have preached a ſurprizing Sermon to one of the moſt ignorant and wicked Villages in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>While Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> was at Sir <hi>Henry</hi>'s pleaſant Seat he received a kind Letter from a Gentleman in <hi>London,</hi> with one incloſed to the Right Reverend the Biſhop of <hi>London;</hi> written as his Friend informed him by his Lordſhip's Order, upon the Recommendation he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of him: But Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> did not ſee meet to wait upon him with it. At the ſame Time Providence was honouring him with an Invitation to ſee the other Univerſity: for he was called back to <hi>London</hi> by a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which informed him, that the Miniſters of the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Board had choſen him to go down to <hi>Cambridge;</hi> the aged Paſtor of a Church there being ſtruck with a Palſy.— Mr. <hi>How</hi> ſeeing him at his Meeting on the Lord's-Day, came to his Lodgings on Monday, and in a moſt obliging Manner welcomed him to Town, telling him he had been abſent himſelf three Sabbaths, while he was in <hi>Oxfordſhire;</hi> and if he had been in the City he ſhould have aſked Nobody but him to have ſupplied his Place. Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> was glad to ſee himſelf forgiven by Mr. <hi>How,</hi> and believed he was indebted principally to him and the Rev. Meſſirs. <hi>Quick, Williams</hi> and <hi>Calamy,</hi> For the Honour the Board had done him in naming him (a Stranger) for the Congregation at <hi>Cambridge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He took Coach on <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> Day, and found in it a Gentlewoman of very good Faſhion and Senſe, with her little Daughter, and was much delighted in the Journey with the agreeable Converſation of the Lady and Prattle of Miſs.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Cambridge</hi> Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> found a ſmall Congregation of inferior People, the Shadow of the Univerſity, like that of all Cathedrals, ſtunting the Growth of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters.</p>
               <p>They liked illiterate Preachers, and when <hi>Davis</hi> and
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:006434_0044_1028EAAD02430E48"/>others of that Sort came to Town, he was left by one half of his Hearers. They were alſo ſadly tinged with <hi>Antinomian</hi> Principles, and his Texts were too legal for them.<note n="*" place="bottom">Like as at this Day in ſome Places of <hi>New-England.</hi>
                  </note> —So he was aſhamed of his Poſt, and wrote ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly to <hi>London</hi> to be releaſed from it.—He ſaw all the Colleges there after a Sort, but had none of thoſe hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary Advantages for doing it as he had at <hi>Oxford.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At twelve Weeks End he returned to <hi>London,</hi> and ſome of the City Miniſters reſolved to take a Turn down themſelves. The Reverend and zealous Mr. <hi>Pomfret</hi> went firſt for a Month, and others followed him.</p>
               <p>But at length they got a handſom Subſcription at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> to the ingenious and learned Mr. <hi>Pearſe,</hi> an excellent Preacher, to fix him at <hi>Cambridge</hi> for two or three Years. He went; and being already well entred into the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks, ſoon made himſelf known to the learned Mr. <hi>Whiſton,</hi> and became his moſt eſteemed Friend. A fatal Friendſhip! for then he alſo drank in Mr. <hi>Whiſton</hi>'s Arrian Principles, which has ſince been the Spring of ſo much Strife and Confuſion and every evil Work among the Diſſenters.</p>
               <p>Within a few Weeks after Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> was invited to the great Town of <hi>Ipſwich</hi> in <hi>Suffolk.</hi>—In his Way thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God graciouſly preſerved him from a very dangerous Snare, which three ill Women laid for him. He found them in the Stage-Coach, ſupped with them in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and was retired to his Chamber: But as he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Bed one of them knocked at his Door, and told him that they had mulled a Glaſs of Wine, chiefly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Cold that was upon him, and he muſt needs take Part of it with them. In their Chamber were two Beds, and he heard one of them gigling behind the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the furthermoſt Bed. He began now to ſuſpect them, when one of them told him, that truly they were afraid to lie in the Chamber alone; that the furtheſt Bed would hold them three; and they begged of him to
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:006434_0045_1028EAAE91DF39D0"/>lodge in the neareſt Bed. He told them he was greatly ſurpriſed at their Motion, and aſhamed of it, that their Fear was groundleſs; no Danger would happen to them in the Inn; if there were any he ſhould make a poor Defence; and that in ſhort, they utterly forgot what they owed to their Reputation and Virtue, or to his. So they begged his Pardon, and he ſuddenly ſtept into his own Chamber.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Ipſwich</hi> he ſpent eleven Weeks very pleaſantly, and with much Satisfaction; but they needed a Preacher only every other Lord's Day. The excellent Mr. <hi>Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fax</hi> divided his Time with them and ſome neighbouring Congregations, as the Biſhop of them all. Being now got to a plentiful Fiſh-market, and near to the Oyſter-Banks, he began to think himſelf again in <hi>New-England.</hi> He viſited <hi>Yarmouth</hi> and <hi>Beckles,</hi> and ſaw his Father's Relations. He lodged at one Mr. <hi>Steward</hi>'s, where he was moſt generouſly entertained.</p>
               <p>More eſpecially he there became known to the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Mr. <hi>Burkit</hi> of <hi>Debham,</hi> which is eight Miles from <hi>Ipſwich.</hi> Mr. <hi>Burkit</hi> held a Lecture which he attended. He was pleaſed to call him the beſt Hearer that he ever had. Every other Lord's-Day almoſt Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> preached at <hi>Dedham,</hi> and the People ſpake of calling him to be their Miniſter. When Mr. <hi>Burkit</hi> heard of it he was ſo good as to beſpeak a Lodging for him at the beſt Houſe in the Town. There was a Gentlewoman, a Widow, that had ſix hundred a Year, a Diſſenter in Principle, but a Conformiſt for Mr. <hi>Burkit</hi>'s Sake, ſitting under his excellent Miniſtry with great Delight. Madam, ſaid he to her, I hear that our Congregation of Diſſenters are about to chuſe that young Man of <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> of whom I told you; if they do, invite him to take his Board with you: It will be a Comfort to you for him to pray in your Family, and I am ſure it will be ſo to him to be in your Houſe, for that little People can do but little for him.—A teaching Inſtance of Moderation, Charity and Brotherly-love this, in a Churchman to a Diſſenter, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:006434_0046_1028EAB06EBCE7A0"/>to be told and imitated. — This is but agreeable to what the Rev. Mr. <hi>Nathaniel Parkhurſt</hi> (who writes his Life and ſeems to be of the ſame Spirit) records of this great and good Man, Page 49. — <q>As he was a Member <g ref="char:startq">“</g>of the Church univerſal, he had a good Reſpect and Eſteem for many of <hi>our</hi> diſſenting Brethren that are ſound in the Faith, and holy and exemplary in their Lives, though they had different Sentiments from him in Matters of leſſer Moment; and as he met with any of them, converſed with them freely; and I doubt not but he has given an acceptable Account of his Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice in this Matter to our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>of whom <g ref="char:endq">”</g>the whole Family in Heaven and Earth is named.</hi>
                  </q> But there happened at this Time to paſs by an itinerant, powerful, illiterate Preacher, who had been a Taylor; and he cut Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> out of the whole Cloth, as he uſed pleaſantly to relate it, and left him but three Votes.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Gale</hi> was the chief Gentleman of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at <hi>Ipſwich:</hi> Venerable for his Age, Gravity, Wiſdom and true Piety. When King <hi>James</hi> the II. had took away their Charter, as he did others, he named Mr. <hi>Gale</hi> Bailiff in his new one. The Day came for it to take Place, and the new Commiſſion was read in the Court-Houſe. Mr. <hi>Gale</hi> ſtood up and with great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty and Reſpect aſked, if there were any Objection to be made againſt the new Corporation taking Place and Authority upon them? — When all being ſilent, He to the great Surpriſe of the whole Aſſembly told them, "That if no one elſe had ought to object he muſt do it himſelf. So in an handſome Speech he ſhewed the Illegality of the preſent Commiſſion; that the Town had done nothing he knew of to forfeit their former Charter; and that it ſtood good till tryed and condemned in a legal Proceſs; and that therefore he was under a Neceſſity to refuſe the great Honour which his Majeſty was pleaſed to do him, how ambitious ſoever he was to ſerve his King and the Town. While he ſpake to this Effect, the People gazed and bowed, and were ready to
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:006434_0047_1028EAB3E5827678"/>worſhip him for his Honour, Honeſty and Courage.—</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Gale</hi> had a Land <hi>Tortoiſe</hi> in his Garden, that for the five warm Months ran up and down his Walks, and eat of a kind of Plantain which he ſet every where for it. In <hi>September</hi> the Creature took into the Ground, and from Year to Year continued there for about ſeven Months. While Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> reſided there it came up in <hi>April,</hi> but miſtook its way, and was found in the Church-Yard, which was parted from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <p>There were Companies of Soldiers that Winter billeted in <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> and ſome other neighbouring Towns; and ſeveral Robberies were committed by them. One Day he was himſelf dogged out of Town by a Soldier, and had ſtraggled into a little Thicket of ſmall Trees or Bruſh, by the Side of a Field adjoyning to the Lord — Park, there he happily turned to gaze about, and look down upon the Town: When the Soldier within a few Rods of him ſtopt ſhort and looked round him: At the ſame Inſtant he jumpt over the Fence, and his Lordſhip's Coach appearing in Sight, he made towards it as faſt as he could, and returned into Town.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Bury</hi> he attended the Seſſions, my Lord chief Juſtice <hi>Holt</hi> being the Judge.—He was aſtoniſhed at the Powers and Sagacity of that great Man and the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch he made of Buſineſs well as his Integrity and Juſtice. Several Wretches received Sentence of Death (at that Time) for Robberies committed by them; the greateſt Rogue of the Gang commonly hanged the reſt.</p>
               <p>But O the Shreiks at the Bar when the Sentence was pronounced upon them, "Mercy, my Lord, Mercy! Tranſportation, my Lord, Tranſportation! A moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting Repreſentation truly (as he has obſerved in his Record) of the Agonies of the Condemned at the great Day.</p>
               <p>My Lord had the following fine and awful Paſſage in his Speech before he gave Sentence. "There are ſome indeed that are innocent and virtuous, who have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly put to Death; and ſome have been hurled down
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:006434_0048_1028EB39141933E0"/>to Deſtruction for their Piety and worthy Deeds: Virtue was grey Hairs to them, and an unſpotted Life was length of Days.—But ſuch Wretches as theſe (ſaid he) we are forced to cut off as we do Wolves and Beaſts of Prey, &amp;c.</p>

They named him to ſucceed in Mr. <hi>Taylor</hi>'s Place at <hi>Bath,</hi> and told him becauſe it was the Reſort of the Gentry of <hi>England,</hi> both the religious and profane. The Rev.

               </p>
               <p>He readily came into this Motion, for he wanted to ſee the Waters which he had heard ſo much of, and he found more than he had heard. He deſired alſo to ſee the <hi>Weſt Country</hi> and <hi>Briſtol.</hi>

<pb n="32" facs="unknown:006434_0049_1028EAB6458596E8"/>the merrieſt Man in the World. Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> was called by him all the dull Things that Wit could invent, but from an Heart full of Love. He was now Aſſiſtant to Mr. <hi>Showers</hi> in <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One Day Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> ſpake his Mind to him freely about their private Baptiſms. He ſuddenly replied, why our People give me but eighty Pounds a Year, and my Baptiſms are worth fifty Guineas to me. He ſaw by this the wretched Snare and Temptation that had baniſhed the Ordinance of Baptiſm out of their publick Worſhip.—</p>
               <p>Indeed he ſaw but one publick Baptiſm all the while he was in <hi>England.</hi> It was at Mr. <hi>How</hi>'s Church; the People got up over one another Shoulders to gaze. Mr. <hi>How</hi> looked round about with an awful Pauſe that drew the Attention and Eye of all preſent upon him, and then began, "I am ſorry it is ſuch a Rarity! That there ſhould be ſuch a gazing at it! &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In the City of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> the Gentlemen of Mr. <hi>Weekes</hi>'s Congregation went in a Body to the Paſtors, and prayed they might have the Baptiſms in publick, promiſing to make the ſame Preſents as they did in private. By this Means they immediately prevailed.</p>
               <p>While Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> ſojourned at <hi>Bath,</hi> a Gentleman came thither to drink the Waters, who was tormented in a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Degree with the Gout. The Wretch lay ſwearing and curſing, inſtead of repenting and praying; wondering what he had done that God ſhould lay ſuch Pains on him more than on others. At laſt ſending his Man down to warm him ſome Broth, he fell on his Sword and died. And went without doubt, to blaſpheme on for ever; Curſe the Author of his Plagues, and gnaw his Tongue for Pain. They brought him in Mad as indeed all Self-Murderers are: But ſuch Juries are worſe than Mad, and deſerve to be buried under the Gallows.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> ſpent two Years at <hi>Bath,</hi> and found good Acceptance with the People and with the Strangers there. Before he had lived among them two Months he became acquainted with more Families of Faſhion in <hi>London</hi> than he had done by living there two Years.</p>
               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:006434_0050_1028EAB907C36D40"/>
               <p>The People at <hi>Bath</hi> had been uſed to a different Sort of Preaching from his, and did not ſeem to reliſh his Way at firſt. So he propoſed to them to think of ſome other, more agreable to their Taſte, and that might better pleaſe and edify them. They bluſhed, and prayed him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue his Services among them: And within a Quarter of a Year were ſatisfied and delighted with them.</p>
               <p>Among the Phyſicians that ply at <hi>Bath</hi> the Summer Seaſon was Dr. <hi>Baynard.</hi>—He was a Gentleman of great Wit, and gave himſelf a great Licence in it, more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially againſt the Conformiſt Clergy. — Mr. <hi>Fleetwood Shepard,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Pocock</hi> (Mayor of the City that Year) were Gentlemen of the ſame Character for Wit and Mirth. No wonder if they were very great and intimate Friends. — Mr. <hi>Pocock</hi> fell ill of a Fever, and Mr. <hi>Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> was his Doctor.</p>
               <p>One Morning after drinking the Waters the Doctor went to ſee his Patient, and <hi>Shepard</hi> with him. <hi>Baynard</hi> found him dying by his Pulſe, and looked ſad upon it; but <hi>Shepard,</hi> ignorant of his Danger, ſaid to him with wonted Pleaſancy and Droll, — "You lie here <hi>Pocock</hi> while we want you daily at the <hi>Bear:</hi> There is the beſt Red come to Town you ever taſted."—<hi>Pocock</hi> caſt a dying Look on him and ſaid, "I ſhall never be with you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.—No, anſwered <hi>Shepard</hi> looſly, "Why then come and ſee us, <hi>Pocock,</hi> for we always loved you dearly.</p>
               <p>Upon this he turned on his Heel, and went down, and <hi>Baynard</hi> after him. They went to the Coffee-Houſe which was but three Doors off from Mr. <hi>Pocock</hi>'s, and at Eleven it was Time to go Home and dreſs. But as <hi>Shepard</hi> ſtepped out of the Door, he fell a trembling and cried out, "Hold me <hi>Baynard,</hi> hold me"! The Doctor caught him in his Arms, and all the Gentlemen (who were many) in the Room ran to the Door, where they ſaw Mr. <hi>Shepard</hi> frighted and ſtaring, and heard him ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, "Don't you ſee <hi>Pocock</hi> there? in the Middle of the Street! Why there he goes,—two Men lead him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long!
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:006434_0051_1028EB37896D5480"/>and now he is got up to the Gate,"— (which was but the Length of a Street from the Coffee-Houſe.)</p>
               <p>When Mr. <hi>Colman</hi>'s Landlord, who was Serjeant of the <hi>Bath</hi> (Mr. <hi>Shelſton</hi>) told him this wonderful Story, as a certain Matter of Fact, that happened but two Years before, he reſolved to enquire of Dr. <hi>Baynard</hi> about it, for he was well acquainted with the Doctor, and he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times came to hear him preach.</p>
               <p>The Doctor aſſured him of the Truth of the whole Account, and when he aſked him what Effect it had on Mr.<hi>Shepard,</hi> he ſaid, He was ſick upon it for two Days, but when he got out again he was as merry and wild as ever. He ſaw nothing himſelf (he ſaid) but heard what <hi>Shepard</hi> ſaid to their dying Friend, and he had no Doubt but that <hi>Shepard</hi> ſaw an Appearance of him.—They ran to the Mayor's Houſe, and were told, he was juſt now dead.</p>
               <p>Well, Doctor, ſaid Mr.<hi>Colman</hi> upon it, Too well are our Saviour's Words verified, <hi>"Neither will they be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded though one come from the Dead."</hi> No Sir, replied the Doctor, "Theſe Things were never meant to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert us: It is the good Word which you preach to us, muſt do that, if it ever be done."</p>
               <p>This Story is ſo remarkable and well atteſted, as few (if any, in all its Circumſtances) are like unto it.</p>
               <p>And doubtleſs the good Providence of God orders ſuch Things every now and then, as ſuperadded Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies to revealed Religion, in the great Doctrine of the Soul's Immortality, a ſeparate State, and the Judgment to come.— This was a Teſtimony to all <hi>England,</hi> and more eſpecially to the Nobility and Gentry through the Kingdom, who all heard of it, and little heeded it.—No Doubt but the Fame of it went immediately to the King's Court.<note n="†" place="bottom">This Sir <hi>Fleetwood Shepard</hi> was afterward Gentleman-Uſher of the <hi>Black Rod,</hi> and well known by a Poem in <hi>Prior</hi> to him.</note>
               </p>
               <p>If Mr. <hi>Glanvill,</hi> Arch-Deacon of <hi>Bath</hi> in his Day,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:006434_0052_1028EB34E8F6F810"/>had been living he would hae triumph'd in this evident Teſtimony to an inviſible World at his own Door: For there is ſcarce the like open inconteſtible Account in his <hi>Sadduciſmus Triumphatus.</hi> But none have been ſo good and juſt to the Publick as to publiſh this to the World.</p>
               <p>While Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> was at <hi>Bath</hi> he preached for Mr. <hi>Cummins</hi> of <hi>Shepton-Mallet.</hi> He was a worthy Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter and a ſtrong, ſtout Man. Within a few Years after he met with a Robber on the High-Way that bid him deliver, with his Piſtol in his Hand. Mr. <hi>Cummins</hi> told him he muſt give him Leave to diſmount, which he did, the Robber being on his left Hand. In an Inſtant Mr. <hi>Cummins</hi> took the Wretch by the Foot, and canted him over his Horſe, and as he came to the Ground his heavy and ſtrong Foot was upon him, and lighting upon his Breaſt, ſtruck the Breath out of his Body. Mr. <hi>Cummins</hi> was amazed to find him dead, and ready to repent of what he had done. Inſtead of praiſing him for his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, or excuſing him from the Suddenneſs with which a Man acts at ſuch a Time, ſome were ready to cenſure him as a cruel Man, and that he had not the Pity which becomes a Miniſter for a poor Soul. Mr. <hi>Cummins</hi> was forced to paſs his Trial.</p>
               <p>One of the firſt Pleaſures Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> had at <hi>Bath</hi> was his coming into an Acquaintance with the lovely <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mela,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Elizabeth Singer</hi> of <hi>Agford</hi> near <hi>Frome.</hi> She had a Volume of Poems then in Print, being about her twenty-fourth Year. Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi> had made her an high Complement, in a Book he dedicated to the virtuous and good-humoured Ladies. Mr. <hi>Singer</hi> invited him to come and ſee his Daughter, that ſhe might thank him. Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> invited himſelf to go with him, having read her Poems. They found her comely in Body, lowly in Dreſs, with a Soul fair and bright as an Angel.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Singer</hi> led them out to ſee his Daughter's Walk or Lodge near his Houſe, where ſhe uſed to meditate and compoſe. It was a retired and ſhady Path; a Rivulet on one Side, and tall ſpreading Trees on the other. Mr.

Mr. <hi>Singer</hi> was highly pleas'd with Mr. <hi>Colman,</hi> and prayed him to enter into a Friendſhip and Correſpondence with his Daughter, and that he would often come and ſee them.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Singer</hi> called himſelf <hi>Argos,</hi> having an hundred Eyes upon his Daughter, but he ſeemed to ſhut them all in Mr. <hi>Colman</hi>'s favour. Both Father and Daughter treated him with utmoſt Freedom and Affection. Before Company eſpecially, Mrs. <hi>Singer</hi> behaved as though he had been her Brother. Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> loved her without the leaſt Intention of ever ſaying ſo to her. She ſaw it, and it pleaſed her greatly. They wrote to one another often: Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> made long Viſits, ſometimes for Days together: And they were always unwilling to part.</p>
               <p>Once he viſited her at my Lady <hi>Weymouth</hi>'s, who much eſteemed and honoured her. So did Biſhop <hi>Kenn</hi> who then reſided at that noble Houſe. Mr. <hi>Roberts</hi> of <hi>London</hi> was then with Mr. <hi>Colman.</hi> They carried a Note from her Father without which they could not have ſeen her. She let the Family ſee how much ſhe regarded him. The Biſhop gave him his Bleſſing. And at a Mile from the Seat they met Mr. <hi>Phillips</hi> of <hi>Frome,</hi> a very aged gracious Miniſter, and he bleſt Mr. <hi>Roberts.</hi> Upon which he turned and ſaid to Mr. <hi>Colman,</hi> Now, Sir, I am even with you.</p>
               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:006434_0054_1028EB3258F0FE98"/>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Singer</hi> told Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> that <hi>Philomela</hi>'s <hi>Mother</hi> was every way her Superiour, in Knowledge, Wiſdom and Grace. And that he had buried a younger Daughter, her equal in Knowledge, and Superior in Grace. <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mela</hi> her ſelf told him it was very true. The Diſcourſe of that Afternoon was upon this dead charming Siſter, the Father being gone out to his Work. She told him the following moſt entertaining Story.</p>
               <p>"My Siſter, ſaid ſhe, was a Year or two younger than I, and her Affection as well as Wit was quicker. I ſeemed however to my ſelf to think more thoroughly. She deſired ever to be with me, and I wanted to be more by my ſelf. We often retired by Conſent, each to her Chamber, to compoſe and then to compare what we wrote. She always exceeded me in the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Lines, but mine I think were more correct. She exceeded me much in the Fondneſs of Love, but never in the Truth and Strength of it. She was jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of me that my Love was not equal to her's, and invented an hundred Ways to try me; many of which I thought childiſh and weak, and therefore ſometimes rather reproved then complyed with. This gave her Grief, and I ſhould find her in Tears, which I could not put a ſtop to but by the tendereſt Words and Embraces.</p>
               <p>"We lived Years together as happy as Children could be in one another; We lived religiouſly together; took Care of one another's Souls, and had our conſtant Hours for Retirement and Devotion. We were daily ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to one another of the Things of God, his Being, Perfections, Works; the Wonders of Creation and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, the Myſteries of Redemption and Grace.— My Father in his Widowhood took great Delight in us, cheriſhed our Love to God and one another, but like good <hi>Jacob</hi> was fondeſt of the youngeſt, admiring all that ſhe ſaid or did. And in her Death he was to be tried.—</p>
               <p>"But it was I that was taken <hi>ſick,</hi> to a very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Degree. And when the Phyſicians were giving
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:006434_0055_1028EAC0670E13D0"/>me over, my dear Siſter came to me drowned in Tears; and earneſtly kiſſing me, beſought me to tell her whether I was (through Grace) prepared to die? Whether my Intereſt in Chriſt and Title to Heaven were comfortable and clear to me? For ſhe was afraid I would die; and ſhe could not part with me only to go to Chriſt, which was far the better.</p>
               <p>"I looked earneſtly upon her and ſaid, "Why Siſter, do you think me dangerous? I muſt confeſs to you my Diſtreſs would be great on the Account of my Soul, if I thought my dying Hour were now coming on: For I have not that full Aſſurance of my Intereſt in Chriſt, which I have not always begged of God I might have, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would call me hence.</p>
               <p>"No ſooner had ſhe heard me ſay this, but ſhe fell as in an Agony on her Knees by my Bed, and in a manner inexpreſſible for Fervour and Humility, ſhe begged of God, "That if her Father muſt have the Grief of burying one of his Children, it might be her: For through his free Grace, and to the Glory of it, ſhe could humbly profeſs before him her aſſured Hope of her Intereſt in his everlaſting Mercy through Jeſus Chriſt. Wherefore ſhe could gladly and joyfully ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render her ſelf to dye, if it might pleaſe God to grant her Siſter a further Space wherein to make her Calling and Election ſure.</p>
               <p>"Having prayed thus in a Tranſport which was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing and aſtoniſhing to me, ſhe kiſſed me and left the Room, without giving me Time or Power to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer her a Word. And, what is almoſt incredible to relate, from that Minute I grew better and recovered, but ſhe took her Bed and died within a few Days.<note n="*" place="bottom">She was about twenty Years old, as the Author of Mrs. <hi>Rowe</hi>'s Life reports.</note>
               </p>
               <p>"Conceive if you can Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> how I was aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed at this Event of Providence, and over-whelm'd with Sorrow; and my Father with me. Yet I reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered

My chief Work was to conſider the Mind of God, in this his Mercy to me, that I might make it evident to my ſelf, that indeed in Love to my Soul he delivered me from the Pit of Corruption. I ſet my ſelf to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort my Father, what I could, and that was his Care for me. We durſt not be inconſolable under a Bereavement ſo circumſtanced: Yet my mourning is always returning with the Remembrance of a Love ſtronger than Death, and bright like the Seraphims, thoſe Flames of Love and Devotion.</p>
               <p>How exalted a Converſation was this which Mr. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> had with Mrs. <hi>Singer.</hi> He told her upon it he was more in Love with the Dead than the Living: And that ſhe muſt yield her Siſter the Victory; and confeſs her Love to excell in Strength as well as Fervour.</p>
               <p>After many ſuch happy Converſations the Day arrived when he was obliged to pay a parting Viſit, being earneſtly invited to <hi>New-England</hi> and to a Settlement in <hi>Boſton,</hi> which he informed the Family of—when Mrs. <hi>Singer</hi> poured out a thouſand Wiſhes for his Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his Serviceableneſs in the Church of Chriſt on Earth, and his Happineſs with her in that above for ever.

                     <p>It is readily owned this Story has been confidently reported by ſome, particularly Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> who in his Life Time related it to many, and alſo left it (as it has been now given) in Writing among his Papers, and moreover it appears by Letters in his Study, that he ſent it over to <hi>England,</hi> ſoon after Mrs. <hi>Rowe</hi>'s Death.—Yet this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Gentleman is pleaſed to diſpute the Fact. But on what Ground? Becauſe he had inquired of Perſons (in his Apprehenſion) beſt able to inform him of the Circumſtances of this Matter, and it ſeems they were ignorant of them, and hence he aſſures the World, that it is entirely without Foundation.</p>
                     <p>The Gentleman himſelf is ſaid by the Editor of Mrs. <hi>Rowe</hi>'s Life to have had a long<note n="*" place="bottom">It is not ſaid how long—A few Years—Ten or Twelve is ſometimes called ſo.</note> Acquaintance with her," and yet had never heard her mention it on any Occaſion, which no Doubt ſerved to ſtrengthen his Diffidence.</p>
                     <p>But why ſhould it be thought incredible or even improbable after ſuch a Number of Years were paſt, "That Mrs. <hi>Rowe</hi> from whom Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> poſitively aſſerts he had it, ſhould omit to relate theſe Circumſtances to every new Acquaintance. However, this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Denial of a Fact on the Ground mentioned, is not ſufficient to invalidate the Teſtimony of any good Man and true, much leſs the poſitive Declaration of a Perſon of Mr. <hi>Colman</hi>'s Character.</p>
                     <p>I can't but obſerve how this ſame Gentleman in his eighteenth Page ſeems plunged, and at a Loſs about another Thing, viz. ſpeaking of Mrs. <hi>Rowe,</hi> The Occaſion (ſays he) of her Poetical Name <hi>Philomela,</hi> which from this Time ſhe was known by to the World, whether ſhe aſſumed it to her ſelf, or was complimented with it by her Friends I have not been able to learn.</p>
                     <p>Now if after enquiring of the Perſons beſt able to inform him, and by his long Acquaintance he did not arrive to any Certainty about this Fact (which by the Way, was about the ſame Time of her Life with the other) why need he to have been ſo confident of the Story's being entirely without Foundation?</p>
                     <p>I join with him in the Reflections he makes on the Story, which was the other End of his mentioning it, viz. They muſt be very weak Perſons indeed who make any Part of the Story an Argument againſt Mrs. <hi>Rowe</hi>'s early Piety. The Relation of it ought not, need not be conſtrued in the leaſt to her Diſadvantage. Many excellent Perſons have all their Life-Time been in Bondage through Fear of Death— We have known Doubts and Darkneſſes ſometimes ariſe in the Minds of Chriſtians of the higheſt Form among us in ſuch a trying Hour.</p>
                     <p>The Reaſons the Gentleman is pleaſed to add upon a Suppoſition of the Truth of the Story, are alſo paſſable and may ſerve to clear Mrs. <hi>Rowe</hi> from any Indecency of Expreſſion.</p>
                     <p>Upon the whole, I muſt be allowed to think that the Story in all its Circumſtances as related by Dr. <hi>Colman</hi> is truly wonderful and worthy to be publiſhed to the World.—</p>
                     <p>N. B. Since I wrote theſe Remarks I find a Letter of Dr. <hi>Colman</hi> to a Gentleman of Diſtinction after he had read Mr. <hi>Grove</hi>'s Account in which are the following Words:</p>
                     <p>"Her Picture is exactly true, and ſo is the Account of her excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Father, and he once told me, that his Daughter was in no wiſe to be compared with her Mother. What a glorious humble Family has it been! like that at <hi>Bethany</hi> which JESUS loved, and where he was wont to lodge! It is now extinct in Mrs. <hi>Rowe,</hi> who has carried it to the Height that human Nature has arrived to, ſince the Days of Inſpiration; and has left a <hi>Blaze</hi> on the Name of <hi>Singer,</hi> which ſhall never be extinguiſhed—Exalted and aſcended Spirits neither need nor value a Name cut in Marble over their Bones, (ſhe and her Father lie in an obſcure Village without a Stone by her Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der over them) but indeed ſuch a Monument as Mrs. <hi>Singer</hi> and her righteous Friends have here raiſed for the Inſtruction, Admiration and Aſpiration of Survivors, is a Name and Praiſe and Glory. <hi>Give her of the Fruit of her Hands, and let her own Works praiſe her in the Gate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But I am ſorry for the Diffidence and Lameneſs with which the Story I had from her own Mouth is here told, and am perſwaded there is an Error in the Date of the Siſter's Life.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V. Invitations to return to <hi>New-England</hi> — His Ordination at <hi>London</hi>— Arrival at <hi>Boſton</hi> and Settlement there— Letters ſent to him before his Embarkation and ſoon after.</head>
               <p>MR. <hi>Colman</hi> as I hinted in the foregoing Chapter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived kind Letters from a Number of Gentlemen in <hi>Boſton</hi> the Place of his Nativity, who had built an handſome Houſe there, informing, "That they had
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:006434_0059_1028EB30CD988B88"/>choſen him to be their Miniſter, and urging him to make what Haſte he could to them. Theſe Letters were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by Meſſirs. <hi>Thomas Brattle, Benjamin Davis, John Mico, Thomas Cooper,</hi> and <hi>John Colman</hi> in the Name of the reſt, and in them they only propoſe to him that the holy Scriptures might be publickly read every Sabbath in the Worſhip of GOD, which was not practiſed in other
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:006434_0060_1028EACB11425D90"/>Churches of <hi>New-England</hi> at that Time, and that they might lay aſide the Relation of Experiences which were impoſed in other Churches, in Order to the Admiſſion of Perſons to the Lord's-Table.</p>
               <p>This Invitation was very acceptable and pleaſing to him, for his Heart was always very much in his native Country, and to the Churches of Chriſt here, and the more acceptable it was by Reaſon of the kind and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging Letters which accompanied it from his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Friends the Honourable <hi>John Leverett,</hi> the Rev. Meſſirs. <hi>William Brattle, Ebenezer Pemberton,</hi> and others. A few Paſſages out of ſome of theſe are preſented unto the Reader.</p>

I believe your Return will be pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to all that know you, I am ſure it will be inexpreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſo to your unfeigned Friend and Servant, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>When he took leave of his Brethren at <hi>Bath,</hi> he told them he knew not how to do it better than by ſubſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them, to pay off the Debt of Fifty Pounds, which they yet owed for their Meeting-Houſe; which he did and ſo left them.</p>
                     <p>When he came to <hi>London</hi> (<hi>Auguſt</hi> 1. 1699) he found moſt of the City Miniſters, to whom he was beſt known out of Town, viz. the Rev. Meſſirs. <hi>How, Quick, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaniel Taylor,</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>He waited on the humble and heavenly Mr. <hi>Sylveſter,</hi> and found him mounting his Horſe: He told him "he ſhould have been proud to have laid his Hand on him at his Ordination;" which was a great deal for him to ſay who never ſaid any Thing but from his Heart in his Life.</p>
                     <p>His Letters from <hi>Boſton</hi> deſired him to aſk Ordination at <hi>London.</hi> He knew not then the Reaſon of his Friends Deſire, but it was agreeable enough to his Principles and Inclinations. Accordingly he immediately applied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Preſbytery there, and on the fourth Day of ſaid Month the Solemnity was attended, after a publick Lecture at the Meeting-Houſe of the Rev.

                        <hi>Stretton</hi> prayed, and Mr. <hi>Spademan</hi> made the Exhortation: And after the Solemnity was over, all the Rev.

                     <p>Mr. <hi>Stretton</hi> was an aged and eminent Paſtor in the City, much reverenced and honoured for his Learning, Gravity, Piety and Wiſdom.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Spademan</hi> was a very judicious and learned Man, and ſo was Mr. <hi>Taylor;</hi> Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> was going to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the one at <hi>Rotterdam</hi> (as before related) and was Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor to the other at <hi>Bath.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Fleming</hi> was Paſtor of a Scotch Church in <hi>London,</hi> and had been or was afterward choſen <hi>Principal</hi> of one of the Colleges in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Quick</hi> was highly diſpleaſed that he was not ſent for out of the Country, that he might have done him ſome more publick Honours at the Ordination.</p>
                     <p>Dr. <hi>Bates</hi> died a few Days before Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> left <hi>Bath.</hi> The Day before he took Coach he received a Letter from the Rev. Mr. <hi>John Shower</hi> informing him of the Deceaſe of that glorious Man.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> received ample Teſtimonials of his good Converſation while in <hi>England</hi> from many other Rev. Miniſters, viz. the Rev. Dr. <hi>Daniel Williams, John Quick, Matthew Sylveſter, John Shower, Timothy Rogers, Edmund Calamy, Thomas Cotton, Iſaac Mauditt,</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Parkhurſt</hi> and Wife who had been ſo good as to viſit him at <hi>Bath,</hi> did moſt heartily open their Doors to him again when he arrived at <hi>London.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Samuel Holden</hi> the Son and only Child of Madam <hi>Parkhurſt</hi> was then at <hi>Riga,</hi> ſo that he never had the Pleaſure of ſeeing his Face, but his Mother ſpake ſo much to him of Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> as gave him a laſting Intereſt in
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:006434_0063_1028EB2B5CFA2EB0"/>his good Opinion and generous Friendſhip, to the great Benefit of <hi>New-England,</hi> as will be ſeen before our Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative is finiſhed.</p>
                     <p>His dear Brother Mr. <hi>John Colman</hi> of <hi>Boſton,</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant was one of the Committee of the Proprietors of the new-built Church who invited his Return; and kindly ſent an Order upon Sir <hi>James Eaton</hi> for what Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys he wanted. Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> took up Twenty Pounds Sterl. and laid it out in Books. But when he came Home and the Gentlemen preſented him with fifty Pounds on his Arrival, his Brother would not be repaid a Farthing, but boarded him <hi>gratis,</hi> until he married. This he makes a grateful Record of, that his Poſterity may know his Obligations to his Brother.</p>
                     <p>About the 20th of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1699, he imbarked at <hi>Graveſend,</hi> and by the Favour of Heaven, after a Fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nights Delay in the <hi>Downes,</hi> and a long eight Weeks ſick Voyage, he arrived at <hi>Boſton</hi> the firſt Day of <hi>November,</hi> where he was received by his Relations, Acquaintance, and the Brethren who ſent for him, with a great deal of Love and Joy unfeigned, after an Abſence of four Years and three Months.</p>
                     <p>The next Day the Undertakers preſented him with Fifty Pounds.—Soon after they kept a Day of Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving in private to Almighty God, for his ſafe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival and the many Smiles of his gracious Providence on their Undertaking unto that Day. And he preached to them from 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> xxix. 13, 14 Verſes. <hi>Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, our God we thank thee, and praiſe thy glorious Name. But who am I and what is my People, that we ſhould be able to offer ſo willingly after this Sort? For all Things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>On Tueſday December the twelfth, At a private Meeting after ſolemn calling upon God, the Brethren declared their Conſent and Agreement to walk in all the Ordinances of our LORD JESUS CHRIST.</p>

               <p>About fifteen Years he miniſtred to them without a ſettled Aſſiſtant or Colleague,<note n="†" place="bottom">His People afforded him tranſient Help as he needed it; and for two Years and an half, viz. from the Year 1701, they employed the Rev.

<pb n="58" facs="unknown:006434_0075_1028EAF07AA703C0"/>them that I do not ſee my way clear to accept of the Choice made of me to be the Preſident of ſaid College.</p>

               <p>Although Dr. <hi>Colman</hi> excuſed himſelf from this high Honour and Truſt, yet no one ſhewed a greater Solicitude, nor took more Pains, to have the College well ſupplyed,— His moving Speech to the Old South Church in <hi>Boſton, September</hi> the 30th 1724 to part with their Reverend and Honoured Paſtor, Dr. <hi>Joſeph Sewall</hi> for that Service, which lies before me, is a Demonſtration of it.—With many other Eſſays afterwards for its Good.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Colman</hi> writes down at large his Opinion, What Preſident <hi>Harvard</hi>-College needed at that Day.—His Words are,</p>
               <q>

                  <p>A Man of Prayer, one who will be fervent in Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication for, and over our Children, Night and Day; as well as one apt to teach, and expound the Word of God to them, and to preach occaſionally and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to them.</p>

                  <p>A Preſident, who is like to be a faſt Friend to theſe Churches of our Lord Jeſus; in whom they may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways find (through Grace) a zealous Servant and a dutiful Son.—One who is like to be diligent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious in the Diſcharge of the Duties of his Station, and who will give himſelf wholly to them. But there is one Thing more which meeting with all the reſt of theſe Accompliſhments as much to be deſired,—viz. That he be one in the middle Age of Life, which as it may invite him into a Return to academical Studies ſo will give us an agreeable Proſpect of many Years <g ref="char:endq">”</g>Service from him, if it pleaſe God to prolong his Life.</p>

               <p>Dr. <hi>Colman</hi> greatly ſerved <hi>Yale</hi> College in the Colony of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> by procuring for it many valuable Books, whereby its Library has been enriched; and on many Occaſions ſhewed his Zeal for the Purity and Welfare of that Society.</p>

                     <p>The Fame of the Reverend Dean <hi>Berkley</hi>'s Generoſity to your College, has ſometime ſince ſurprized and pleaſed us. We could hardly believe the Report at firſt, the Thing being ſo rare and ſingular. But I hear the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour has actually received the Dean's Pacquet, and delivered it to Dr. <hi>C</hi>—to tranſmit to you. If the Gift comes to you, as the honoured Mr. <hi>Hollis</hi> his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations did to us (and as we hope it does) with a truly catholick Spirit, for the Support and Propagation of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion

Dean's, nor can we enough praiſe and admire it; and we ſhall be ready to join with you in our moſt hearty Thanks to God and his Servant, for ſo great and unexpected a Favour to you. But give me Leave to ſay to you on the other Hand, and I am very free to ſay it to all the World, and I doubt not, but it would honour me to the Dean himſelf, That if the Gift comes to you clogged with any Conditions that directly or indirectly tend to the Introduction of Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, and conſequently to the Subverſion of the true In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and Foundation of your College, then were it ten Times as much as it is, and your Poverty much more than it is, I truſt neither your ſelf, nor any of the Reverend Truſtees will be under the leaſt Temptation to accept the Benefaction on ſuch a Condition: Your Wiſdom, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity and Fidelity will forbid it, while Prudence, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity and true Chriſtianity will allow and direct you to make your Excuſes to the Reverend Donor with great Reſpect and juſt Acknowledgment.</p>

                     <p>As you are one of the Truſtees for <hi>Yale</hi>-College, and I know you have the Welfare of that Society much at Heart, as well as the Doctrines and Laws of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt as received in theſe Churches; ſo at the Deſire of ſome of your ſincere and eſteemed Friends here I take upon me to write to you at this Time, upon the Fame of the noble Gift to your College, from the rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end and learned Dean <hi>Berkley.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I hope it comes to you without the Clog of any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that is inconſiſtent with or ſubverſive of the known and true Intent of Honourable Founders of your Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege; and that the Reverend Truſtees will carefully ſee that it does ſo before they accept of that or any other Donation, from whatever Perſon of Honour and Diſtinction, or of whatſoever Value it may be.</p>
                     <p>If the Reverend Dean has from a Catholick Spirit, without any private and particular Views to the Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of Epiſcopacy into your College and the Churches of your Province, made the Gift of his Eſtate here to you, it is an Act worthy of our higheſt Eſteem, Emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Gratitude, and his Praiſe ought to be in our Churches. I ſhall long to hear it is ſo, and entreat you to let us know it as ſoon as may be, that we may join your Acknowledgments to him.</p>
                     <p>And yet if the Donation ſhould be ſo limited, as that it will not be ſafe nor juſt in you to accept of it, I ſhall however think honourably of the Dean's noble Offer to
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:006434_0079_1028EAFC7141DD00"/>you upon his known Principles in Favour of Epiſcopacy; and with all poſſible Reſpect to him you may let him know you cannot accept of it.</p>
                     <p>Forgive me, dear Sir, that I ſhould trouble you on ſo plain a Matter, which yet is of great Importance in Point of Prejudice to our Churches, and the profeſſed Intereſts of Religion in them, if a due C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ution be not uſed in it. The Danger is of acting ſuddenly, without a deliberate Conſideration of the Matter by the Reverend Truſtees; whoſe united Thanks are the leaſt, I think, that ſo great and frank a Donation calls for.</p>
                     <p>I have juſt wrote my Thoughts on this Head to the Rev. Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> the learned and faithful Rector of the College, to which I refer you when you ſee him: And to Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> of <hi>Pomfret.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Give me Leave to add one Word more concerning the Bruit of the Prevalence of <hi>Arminianiſm</hi> in the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege. I am told that you were your ſelf in ſuch Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions and Fears on that Head, that you enquired ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly of your Son concerning it; and that the deceaſed aged Mr. <hi>Woodbridge</hi> of <hi>Hartford</hi> a little before his Death was under great Concern on that Account. It would be acceptable to ſome ſuperior Friends here, if you would freely write upon that Head; more eſpecially if you can vindicate the College from the Aſperſion. We hope and believe the Reverend Truſtees and Rector have made a faithful Enquiry into that Matter.</p>
                     <p>I thought to have wrote but a Line or two, and yet have got to this Length. Forgive it, and accept of what is ſincerely meant for the publick and common Intereſt of Religion among us. May God be with you in all your private and publick Labours, in the Service of it.

I take you to be one of the Reverend Truſtees of <hi>Yale</hi> College, and a hearty Friend to the religious Principles and Intention of its Founders. The reverend and learned Dean <hi>Berkley,</hi> has (we hear) made a Gift of his Eſtate in <hi>New-England</hi> to your College; a great and noble Donation truly, and what challenges your and our moſt grateful Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if it be not attended with any Limitation or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions prejudicial to the original Deſign and Foundation of the College. I intreat, Sir, your faithful Enquiry into this Matter, and I do it in the Name of your Friends here, who have a great Dependance on your Fidelity in the Cauſe of Chriſt and theſe Churches. I hope the Dean's Gift comes clear and open to you, and not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce Epiſcopacy, notwithſtanding his known Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in Favour of it. I ſuppoſe the Truſtees muſt meet, and will deliberately conſider of the Gift, before an Anſwer be returned to the generous and learned Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor. If it can with Safety, Honour and Juſtice be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, I am ſure it ought with the utmoſt Readineſs and Acknowledgment, as a ſingular Inſtance in our Day of a large and catholick Spirit. But if the Meaning of the Gift be plainly the Propagation of Epiſcopacy inſtead of ſimple Chriſtianity, <hi>Heu! timeo!</hi> It is better to excuſe our ſelves from ſuch Gifts, and remain in our primitive Poverty and Simplicity. I ſhould not be unwilling the Dean himſelf ſhould know what and why I now write. The Caſe is plain and open, and yet I know I expoſe my ſelf to groſs Miſrepreſentations. I hope I ſhall ſtand right and juſtified in your ſober Thoughts; and if I do, you will doubtleſs think your ſelf concerned to act as you think God will approve in this Matter. That you may always have his Preſence and Guidance, is the hearty Prayer of</p>

               <p>We have obſerved with Thankfulneſs to God for it, that of late Years the Hearts of many good Men among us, have been much upon <hi>this great and good Work</hi> here propoſed, Namely, the <hi>Miſſion of the Goſpel</hi> into ſuch Places as have been hitherto <hi>negligent or averſe</hi> to the Settlement of it among them, and alſo the giving <hi>Bibles, Catechiſms,</hi> and other good Books among the <hi>Ignorant,</hi> the <hi>Prejudiced</hi> and the <hi>Profane,</hi> as well as unto <hi>poor and pious</hi> People.

               <p>A more <hi>compendious</hi> Way to do Good to Souls, and bring much Glory to God, can ſcarce be thought of. The <hi>Wiſdom which is from above, full of Mercy and of good Fruits,</hi>
                  <note n="‖" place="bottom">Jam. iii. 16.</note> we think, has ſcarce projected a more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive and effectual Piece of Charity and Beneficence than this is.— What can we think of more likely
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:006434_0093_1028EB20187A7EA8"/>to be owned, accepted, proſpered and rewarded by God.</p>
               <p>And as to the <hi>Method</hi> we propoſe for the raiſing theſe Funds, <hi>ſcil.</hi> by <hi>Collections</hi> in our Congregations every publick <hi>Faſt</hi> and <hi>Thankſgiving</hi> Day; what can be more agreeable to both thoſe <hi>Solemnities?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is very fit, if not indeed a <hi>Duty,</hi> that our <hi>Faſts</hi> both <hi>private</hi> and <hi>publick,</hi> ſhould be accompanied with pious Diſtributions and Communications in Ways of Charity and Mercy.

When thou ſeeſt the Naked that thou cover him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Then ſhall thy Light break forth as the Morning, and thine Health ſhall ſpring forth ſpeedily.</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Iſa. lviii. 6, 7, 8.</note> Now from God's Promiſes, on Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of theſe private Exerciſes of Bounty and Mercy to the <hi>Bodies</hi> of Men on our Days of ſolemn Faſting and Prayer, we may well argue that an <hi>Alms</hi> on ſuch Occaſions, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for the Salvation of their immortal Souls, cannot but be <hi>a Sacrifice with which God in well-pleaſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor do we at all mean by propoſing this <hi>Offering</hi> to the Souls of Men, to put by the other to their Bodies; God forbid: But as we would hereby intimate to our <hi>People,</hi> how neceſſary an Attendant of a religious Faſt <hi>Alms to the Poor is,</hi> and what ought to be <hi>preached</hi> to them and <hi>obſerved</hi> by them on ſuch an Occaſion; ſo we only propoſe to them the <hi>adding a Mite</hi> to be caſt into <hi>a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury of the Lord</hi> for the pious Uſes aboveſaid.</p>
               <p>And then as to our <hi>Days of publick Thankſgiving;</hi> as we cannot but praiſe (and bleſs God for) the excellent <hi>Uſage</hi> (which has obtained among us from the Days of our <hi>Fathers,</hi> and we pray God may never ceaſe among us) <hi>of making Gifts to the Poor, and ſending them Portions

               <p>That having had the Honour lately to approach the Throne with our moſt humble and dutiful Congratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:006434_0100_1028EB3D4B1A6C28"/>of your Majeſty's happy Acceſſion thereto, to implore your Majeſty's gracious Protection of us in our Religious Liberties; We do now in all Humility beg leave to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent to your ſacred Majeſty the Conſtitution of our Churches, their Riſe, Growth and preſent State.</p>
               <p>We are in Denomination, and ſo in Principle and Practice, Diſcipline and Worſhip, Congregational and Preſbyterian; of one Body with the Proteſtant Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from the Church of <hi>England</hi> as by Law eſtabliſhed in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> commonly known by the Name of United Brethren; and like them we have ſignalized our Zeal for and Adherence to the Proteſtant Succeſſion in your moſt ſerene and illuſtrious Houſe.</p>
               <p>Our Fathers were ſome of the Old Puritans, ſo called from their purer Church State, and Way of Worſhip and Manner of godly Diſcipline, which in their Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion they ſought and practiſed.—</p>
               <p>They were People of exemplary Devotion towards God, Loyalty to their Prince, and of conſpicuous Sobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, Virtue and true Goodneſs in the Sight of all Men.</p>
               <p>Uneaſy as they were made at Home, under the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of ſome Things which they eſteemed ſinful to comply with; the Spirit and Providence of God directed them to ſeek and find ſome quiet Seat for themſelves and their Poſterity in the Deſarts of <hi>America.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Religion was their Motive and their Support in the ſorrowful Leave they took of their pleaſant Native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, —they parted with high Expreſſions of Affection and Eſteem to the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They chearfully planted and ſubdued a vaſt Wilderneſs at their own Expence, and not without many Hardſhips and Hazards.</p>
               <p>They obtained Royal Charters to encourage their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings, and to remain the everlaſting Teſtimonials of their Allegiance to the Britiſh Crown, as well as Bonds thereto.</p>
               <p>They were animated with a Proſpect of enlarging the Empire of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> in Regions not known to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ages.</p>
               <pb n="84" facs="unknown:006434_0101_1028EB41A51604C0"/>
               <p>But to their immortal Honour it muſt be ever remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred and recorded, that Religion was their firſt and chief Care, and in order to that Learning.</p>
               <p>In this they have been ſingular and eminent among the Plantations, and we their Poſterity reap the Honour and happy Fruits thereof.</p>
               <p>At this Day through the Bleſſing of Heaven on us, we are become a great People, ſpreading upwards of three hundred Miles along the Sea-Coaſts, and from thirty to fifty Miles up into the inland Parts of the Country to the Number of—Towns, and many more Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping Congregations and Churches.</p>
               <p>At the ſame Time we have but one ſingle Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among us of the Worſhip of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> who are treated by us with all that chriſtian Reſpect, and brotherly Eſteem and Regard they can reaſonably expect and deſire.</p>
               <p>Beſides inferiour Schools of Literature by Law en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined in every Town, for Reading, Writing or Grammar, we have two Colleges for Academical Learning, where the Languages and literal Arts and Sciences are taught; and whereby our many Churches have been hitherto more than ſupplied with Paſtors, and the higheſt Chairs of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour have been laudably filled, to the Service of the Prince and the good of the Country.</p>
               <p>In theſe Academies for Liberal Education, nothing but Learning and good Morals are required to qualify any Perſon for the Privileges there to be attained, but they are equally diſpenſed unto Perſons of all Perſwa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ions.</p>
               <p>The Principles of Loyalty, as well as Religion in all other Inſtances of it, are inſtilled in our Colleges into our Youth, as well as taught in our Pulpits; where we never omit to pray alſo for the King in Supream, and for Governors as ſent by Him.</p>
               <p>Nor have we been without many Endeavours, laborious and expenſive for the Converſion of the Natives to Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity. The Bible has been tranſlated into their Language and twice printed; beſides other good Books of Piety
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:006434_0102_1028EB44C4959D50"/>and Religion. There are at this Day above thirty Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping Congregations of the Indians among us: who are partly taught by Engliſh Miniſters that have learned their Language, but more ſtatedly by Indian Preachers of their own. Some Schools alſo there are among them for the teaching of their Children to Read and Write.</p>
               <p>To add no more, our Churches are famous for their Zeal for the true Proteſtant Religion, according to the Doctrinal Articles and Homilies of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and have been excelled by none in the Joy of ſeeing theſe Divine Truths ſecured to us (as we truſt) in your Majeſty's Poſſeſſion of the Thrones of your Anceſtors.</p>
               <p>Moreover, we ought gratefully to acknowledge to God and the King,</p>
               <p>That we have been diſtinguiſhed among the Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by divers Acts of the Royal Favour and Grace to us; particularly in the Royal Charter granted to us by the late glorious Princes of immortal Memory, King WILLIAM and Queen MARY: In diverſe of which ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Rights and Privileges therein granted, the Vertue and Morals of our People are greatly conſulted and guarded; as alſo in many ſubſequent Laws which have received the Royal Sanction; and by which we enjoy many valuable religious Liberties as well as civil; Namely,</p>
               <p>The Settlement and Support of Schools in our Towns, and of Orthodox Miniſters in our Churches; the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's Right of electing their own Miniſters, the ſtrict Sanctification of the Sabbath, and the planting Religion in ſuch Places, where People profanely deſpiſe to ſeek it for themſelves.</p>
               <p>Our Prayer therefore is unto the King's moſt excellent Majeſty.</p>
               <p>That this our Country and theſe Churches may ever find Grace and Favour in your Royal Eyes, and in the Sight of his Royal Highneſs the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and of all your illuſtrious Race; whom God continue on the Throne of your Majeſty down to the lateſt Poſterity.</p>
               <p>That we may have both our religious Rights and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges,
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:006434_0103_1028EB4653F7D8D0"/>as well as civil now enjoyed by us, continued and ſecured to us and to our Poſterity.</p>
               <p>That his Majeſty would graciouſly pleaſe to believe concerning us, that he has no where any Subjects more true and faithful, dutiful and loyal, and who will more deſire to deſerve his Royal Favour than his <hi>New-Engliſh</hi> Churches.</p>
               <p>That is would pleaſe his Majeſty of his meer Grace, and as his Princely Wiſdom and Paternal Tenderneſs to us ſhall ever direct him, to vouchſafe to conſider the Conſtitution of our Churches in the Commiſſions from the Throne: And that from Time to Time we may have Men of Virtue and Juſtice, ſet over us in chief Command; and who may be of a Spirit of Moderation, and friendly to our Churches.</p>
               <p>And in an eſpecial Manner, we pray that our Colleges which God has made the ſingular Honour and Bleſſing of our Country, may ever have your Royal Favour and Protection."</p>

                     <p>We have a great deal of Reaſon to believe that you will be ready to ſerve the Churches of our Lord Jeſus here in <hi>New England:</hi> They have many Enemies who are continually ſtriking at our civil and religious Liberties. Very lately the Charter of our Province was threatned by a Bill in Parliament, and in great Danger of being taken away. This Attempt has made us ſenſible, that we need ſome ſtanding Friends in and about <hi>London,</hi> who will naturally care for us on like Emergencies, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly uſe their Intereſt on our Behalf.</p>
                     <p>Sir, the Character we have of yourſelf puts you among the Number of thoſe, in whom we may find Ability as well as Inclination to ſerve us. Wherefore we have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Leave to incloſe to you a true and faithful Account of the State of our Country, and do entreat together with your continual Prayers for us, that you will uſe your beſt Endeavours to ſerve us as there may be Occaſion.</p>
                     <p>We have by this Opportunity written to the Lord Chancellor <hi>Cooper,</hi> Sir <hi>Peter King,</hi> Sir <hi>William Aſhurſt,</hi> and <hi>John Barrington Shute,</hi> 
                        <abbr>Eſq</abbr> to intreat their Favour and Intereſt for us. In any of our Neceſſities, we hope our Friends may apply to thoſe Noblemen and Gentlemen with Succeſs in our Behalf.</p>
                     <p>Sir, We are your Brethren in the Miniſtry of the Lord Jeſus, a few of the Paſtors in and about <hi>Boſton.</hi> We ever remember you in our Prayers, ſympathize with you in all that is grievous and afflictive to you, and joy in all your Comforts. We deeply condole with you on the Death of the Rev. Dr. <hi>Williams,</hi> Mr. <hi>Henry,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Shower</hi> and laſt Year; but we cannot but rejoice to ſee the worthy Labours of ſo many in the riſing Miniſtry with you. Alſo we rejoice that in this Time of open Mutiny and Tumult, Treaſon and Rebellion, the Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Patience of the Diſſenters have been as exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:006434_0109_1028EB57555038F8"/>in the one Caſe, as their Loyalty and Zeal for the Proteſtant Succeſſion, has been illuſtrious on the other. We hope the Government will be inclined and able to acknowledge ſo conſpicuous Merit.</p>
                     <p>Sir, We pray God to proſper your Miniſtry, and ſpare you long to ſerve to his Glory, and are</p>

               </p>
               <p>It appears by many rough Copies of Letters left, and the Anſwers to them, how indefatigable and ſucceſsful an Inſtrument he was in the Hand of the great Lord of the Church in compromiſing Differences, healing Diviſions, and quenching Fires kindling and flaming among Parties, Paſtors and Brethren. For the Maintenance and Reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Peace with Truth and Holineſs, he wrote and ſent vaſt Numbers of Letters to <hi>New-York</hi> and the <hi>Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies,</hi> to <hi>Connecticut, Rhode-Iſland, Piſcataqua,</hi> and to many Churches and Paſtors in the <hi>Maſſachuſetts Bay,</hi> all truly Apoſtolick, pleading for and breathing forth Love and Charity.—A Collection of them ſhould be here publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to render his Character illuſtrious if it could be done without expoſing oppoſite Characters; and reviving the Memory of ſuch Strifes and Animoſities which had better be buried and forgotten, and are therefore omitted.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding his tender Conſtitution and often In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, he went abroad to <hi>Councils</hi> or <hi>Synods,</hi> to ſet Things in Order in the Churches: And in his latter Days (in ſome Reſpects) the Care of all the Churches came upon him as you will ſee anon.</p>
               <p>And as he early ſhewed a catholick and pacifick Spirit (as has been already noted) it increaſed in him as he grew in Years and Experience.—He ever expreſt an utter Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of that narrow Spirit of Bigotry, which he ſaw pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing in two many of the greateſt and beſt Men of all Sects and Perſwaſions in paſt Ages and the preſent.—He was for extending his Charity and holding Communion with all that held the Foundation. He loved and hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oured good Men of every Denomination how much ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they differed from him in ſome peculiar Sentiments, Circumſtantials and Modalities.</p>
               <p>His Moderation and Readineſs to ſacrifice every Thing but Truth and Duty for Peace, was manifeſted by many
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:006434_0113_1028EB636D7592C0"/>Inſtances, both in his younger and later Times.—Indeed he had ſuch an Averſion to Diſputing and Jangling that he declined engaging in Controverſy as much as poſſible.</p>
               <p>I have often heard that when a <hi>Seventh Day Baptiſt Preacher</hi> (a noiſy Creature) came from a neighbouring Colony to diſpute with him about the <hi>Sabbath;</hi> after Dr. <hi>Colman</hi> had heard all his Objections patiently, and anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them mildly, and the <hi>Blade</hi> would go on fiercely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting he told him he had no more to ſay to him, but if he was minded further to indulge his diſputacious Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, he would direct him to a Perſon in Town that would be a <hi>Match</hi> for him, which he accordingly did, and ſo diſmiſſed him.</p>
               <p>Here it may be remarked, "That Dr. <hi>Colman</hi>'s No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Church-Government and Diſcipline were larger than many of his Brethren's; neither had he any Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of an exacted Uniformity in religious Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.<note n="†" place="bottom">See the Preface to his Sermon at the Rev.

                  <hi>On Councils and their Efficacy.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Wrote in his younger Times:</note>
               </p>
               <p>The Efficacy of our Councils depends much on their having a due Conſtitution; if we complain of the Want of their Efficacy, we had beſt ſearch into their Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if that be weak and defective, how ſhould Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be built upon it?</p>
               <p>Councils, or ſomewhat equivalent to that Name, are neceſſary to the Preſervation of Peace, Order, and Purity in the Churches. Experience ſhows us, that the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of Men will be breaking out, and that it is a Thing of great Difficulty to heal the Wounds given to particular Churches by them. We have found alſo both the Confuſion and Impoſſibility of every particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation's governing all Things within it ſelf, indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently on other Churches. So that there muſt be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Nature of a Council of Churches for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Chriſtians, or particular Churches to refer themſelves to for Advice, or Appeal unto for their Judgment.</p>
               <p>It was ſoon ſeen in the Church, that ſuch Caſes and Occaſions were and would be, and we read in the xvth of <hi>Acts,</hi> That the Apoſtles and Elders came together to conſider of the Matter referred to them, and diſputed and determined it. This is a ſufficient Warrant for the
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:006434_0115_1028EB6CF830F6C8"/>Thing, that there ſhould be Councils convened upon Difficulties ariſing in Churches; but I cannot find any particular Direction here given, or deſigned to be here given by the Holy Ghoſt, juſt how Councils ſhould be conſtituted for ever after in all the Churches, and no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. For I do not exactly ſee how this was: Yet the Thing it ſelf is of Apoſtolical Practice; and as it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to our Reaſon, ſo ſurely it ſhould be looked upon as Scripture-Warrant and Direction to us in like Caſes.</p>
               <p>And now I ſhall write my poor Thoughts about the due Conſtitution of Councils, that they may have the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired Efficacy; and I freely confeſs I do not ſee what much ſhort of the Practice of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Scotch</hi> Churches will be ſufficient, nor what beyond them is neceſſary.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I think there ſhould in every particular Church be former and fixed, a Conſiſtory, as the <hi>French</hi> Churches had, or a <hi>Kirk</hi> Seſſion as the Churches of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to have the Government of it in all Things. This is to conſiſt of the Paſtor, the perpetual Preſident, <hi>ex Officio,</hi> and therefore not cenſurable here, and with him a ſelect Number of Elders, Men of the greateſt Piety, Gravity, Wiſdom, and Authority in the Congregation. We find ſomething equivalent to this neceſſary in our popular Form of Government, commonly having a kind of Church within a Church, leading Men whom we pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately conſult, before we offer any Thing to a publick Debate and Vote. Which ſhows it to be our common Senſe, that the whole Government would be better there.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Out of theſe Seſſions or Conſiſtories I think Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils ſhould be always gathered.</p>
               <p>The Reaſon is, Becauſe that the Government of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches is lodged here, which ſuppoſes them to be the moſt accompliſhed to adviſe or judge in any Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Caſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Paſtors are <hi>ex Officio</hi> of theſe Councils, and of the Seniors only one ſhould be delegated from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory to accompany the Paſtor: And if the Elders of
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:006434_0116_1028EB6E8BD4A7F0"/>the ſeveral Conſiſtories ſhould not attend, though their Neglect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>s cenſurable, yet then the Miniſters alone may warrantably proceed without them.</p>
               <p>The Reaſons why I am for only one Elder to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted with a Paſtor to the Council, are,
<list>
                     <item>(1) Or elſe the Miniſtry there have not an equal Vote, though Government is confeſſedly firſt lodged in them, and they may be modeſtly ſuppoſed to be their Superiors in Knowledge and Grace.</item>
                     <item>(2) A Multitude of Meſſengers may be uſed as Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures by a deſigning leading Perſon.</item>
                     <item>(3) One rich and large Church may elſe ſend a Majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to all the reſt, if the Number of Meſſengers be not limited.</item>
                     <item>(4) It was expreſly the very firſt Canon of the <hi>French</hi> Churches, reſpecting their fixed Councils, or Colloquies, "That Miniſters ſhould be accompanied each of them with an Elder from every Church. The <hi>Scotch</hi> alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire only the Attendance of one ruling Elder from each Congregation at their Preſbyteries.<note n="*" place="bottom">I heartily wiſh this Preſbyterian Article, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſo far as it reſpects the ſending of but one Meſſenger to Councils, with the Reaſons under it, might be duly conſidered and weighed by my Rev. Brethren, and the honoured Churches through the Land. Is it not high Time that our Congregational Scheme was mended in this Point: And that the Liberty given in the Letters Miſſive, and taken by the Churches call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to aſſiſt in Eccleſiaſtical Councils ſhould be ſomewhat bounded? I have obſerved for more than Twenty Years (and who has not?) the Confuſions and Miſchiefs ariſing from our preſent Practice: Some Churches ſend One, others Five, others Ten or more, to the ſame Council, and the Vote of every Member is of equal Weight.
<p>All I move for with any Zeal is—"That there be ſome Regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Matter—Let all be limited to the ſame Number—If the Brethren are jealous of their Paſtors, why may not two Brethren be thought enough to ſend with one Paſtor? It cannot be taken amiſs by any for the Paſtors to agree at their annual Convention to propoſe ſomething on this Head to their Churches. I humbly move it may be done.</p>

               <p>N. B. The two laſt Rules more <hi>proper and neceſſary in Conſistories</hi> than Councils or Synods.—</p>
               <p>Some of the Doctor's Thoughts on the <hi>Third</hi> Way of Communion, dated <hi>July</hi> 23. 1733.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) Although our Fathers in the Synod of—pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it, yet they did not ſee cauſe afterwards to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice upon it, not for want of Occaſion and Opportunity, or from Inconſideration of the Matter, and Unfaithfulneſs to the Churches but in point of Prudence. They were as wiſe and faithful as we are now, but they threw it by as not ſo proper a Method, or at leaſt fearing the Event of it, and it may be ſcrupling it from the Nature of the Thing.—By ſo long a Diſuſe, even from the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, like a Law or Rule made and never put in practice, it is grown Obſolete and become as a Thing dead and buried, and not to be revived and put in force at the Will of a private Perſon, nor on a particular Occaſion here and there: for as much as we are ſure in this Caſe the Parties concerned will cry out of it as an Hardſhip and Singularity, a Novelty and Impoſition, as the Rev. Mr. <hi>G</hi>—of <hi>W</hi>—did in the Day when he was ſurpriſed with the Rev. Mr. <hi>W</hi>—Viſitation, and almoſt all the Miniſters and Churches round about him joined in the Surprize and Reſentment which he ſhowed on that Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</p>
               <pb n="104" facs="unknown:006434_0121_1028EB7DE3A682B8"/>
               <p n="2">(2) Our Fathers fled from the Viſitation of private Perſons, Arch-deacons and Biſhops, and their authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Inquiſitions; and though I will not compare the Enquiry propos'd in the third Way of Communion, with theſe Epiſcopal Viſitations, which were imperious, trivial and cruel in that Day to an intollerable Degree: yet neither will I conſent to be ſubject as a Paſtor, and my Church with me, to the Viſitation of every Neighbour Paſtor and his Church, when they ſhall pleaſe to come and make Inquiſition how Things ſtand among us; upon the Complaint or at the Deſire of ſome uneaſy, or ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grieved Perſon or Perſons belonging to us: For I think it too much Authority for any private Neighbour Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter and Church to aſſume to themſelves; And though we are bid all of us to be ſubject one to another in a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Capacity, and all things are lawful for me, yet all things are not expedient, and I will not be brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Power of any, in ſuch a manner and to ſuch a Degree: <hi>ſcil,</hi> 'That it ſhall be accounted a Fault, and juſt Matter of Complaint to other Churches, that the Viſitation of one has not been ſubmitted to; ſo that other Churches upon the hearing thereof ſhall then join with the firſt Viſitors and come and challenge our Submiſſion, and if refuſed withdraw Communion from us, which is a very grievous Sentence, but a <hi>Brutum Fulmen</hi> if a Curſe cauſeleſs.</p>
               <p>No private Paſtor, in this State of Infirmity, wherein all Men are of like Paſſions, is fit to be truſted with this Power of Viſitation and Inquiſition, and much leſs all and every Paſtor through the Land; and if one is, all and every one muſt be ſo.—No ſingle Perſon is another's Peer to enquire and judge concerning his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; But the Right of Men (and the Claim of <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> eſpecially) is to be judged by their Peer's, and by a ſufficient Number of them; and theſe diſintereſted and unprejudiced; againſt others he has a Right to make Exception in all Caſes whatſoever.</p>
               <p>We Miniſters know our own and the Infirmities of
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:006434_0122_1028EB814F9D3910"/>others: How apt a Paſtor ſometimes is to be prepoſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Applications of a Brother to him, with a long formal Story of his Grievances: We know too of one another, how apt we may be to be partial in our Opinion of one Man and another, our Eſteem of one Man and not of another; our Affection and Diſaffection: This alone renders the Viſitation of this or that Paſtor, unfit in the Caſe of ſuch or ſuch an one; and ſo it does of his Delegates with him, who perhaps are of his own Nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and very much under his Influence.— And he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain upon his not being hearkned to, has the Nomination of other Churches to return with him, and to be ſure he will pick out ſuch Paſtors as will be like to be of his Mind, and act with or under him.— But let me have a free and choſen Jury, a competent Number of unexcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable Perſons, to make Enquiry and paſs Judgment in my Caſe; but let me not have any Viſitor or Inquiſitor ſet over me, who is no more or better than my ſelf; and leaſt of all let me have every Neighbour made that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitor to come upon me when he will, and call me to Account. This may poſſibly, be even a greater Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and more intollerable Yoke of Bondage, than that which our Fathers fled from.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) Is it expedient at this Day to go into this Method? Perhaps the Principles of many of the Paſtors through the Land are in Favour of a more Claſſical and Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Order in our Churches: To be ſure the Epiſcopal Gentlemen will be like to make Advantages of our going into this Method.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) Would it be prudent to ſet Paſtor upon Paſtor, as we lie mixed through the Land, of a different Opinion on this Head? Will one be like to ſubmit to the Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of another? Will you withdraw communion with all that will not? What ſay you? Will it not run us preſently into a kind of civil War? Will it not produce Jealouſies, and Envyings, and Strifes, and every evil Work? Can you bear down, and turn out thoſe that will oppoſe this Method? Or is their Character from Place
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:006434_0123_1028EB8452589C08"/>to Place, from County to County, ſuch as ſhall deſerve it? Can the Paſtors of theſe Churches, upon any rational Proſpect, remain united Brethren under this Conduct?</p>
               <p n="2">(2) What Advantage then ſhall we give to the Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Gentlemen by our Diviſions on this Head? Men will be ready to prefer the Power of Viſitation in a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle eminent Biſhop or Arch-Deacon, to that of every pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Paſtor that ſhall pleaſe to ſet up himſelf? And our own Paſtors may be tempted and driven to ſubmit to the Viſitation of two or three, rather than that of every one. And if one and another has a Mind to go over to the Church, or find themſelves forced to take Refuge there, they will do it with far the more Grace, and plauſible Shew of flying from an Impoſition or Inquiſition, leſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable (they will ſay) than that of Epiſcopacy.—At the ſame Time the Proteſtant Churches through the World, both the Epiſcopal, Preſbyterian, and Independent, will look upon the odd Repreſentation and Face that will be given of the Matter, as a new and ſtrange Sort of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in the other Extream of Diſcipline; "Every Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor veſted with the Right and Power of viſiting the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther! They may gaze at this Phenomenon, but will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wander after it.—They that go off from us will catch at it as a Pretence for doing ſo, and No-body but our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves will ſee into the Reaſon of this new Method, nor ſay a Word in Juſtification of it.</p>
               <p n="4">(4) That which gives me a particular Offence and ſcandalizes me againſt it, is the Pretence 'That this is the only Way wherein to admoniſh a faulty Paſtor or Church, or to withdraw from Communion with them.—So that if there be a Council of Ten Churches, that have met in the ſecond Way of Communion (as it is called) and having heard the Caſe, and find Things very much amiſs, and that the Paſtor and the Majority of a Church are very injurious to the Aggrieved, yet this large Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil may not preſume, and have no Call or Right to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe a Word of Admonition to them, or to certify to them, that if the Offence given be not removed, they
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:006434_0124_1028EB85E2F1CD00"/>muſt lay it before their reſpective Churches, and be in the Advice to them to withdraw Communion from them. Yet at the ſame Time, a ſingle Church in the third Way of Communion, taking with them one or two, or a few more ſhall have Authority to admoniſh and withdraw Communion.</p>
               <p>Now what Reaſon can there be for a Council of three or four Churches in one Way to have that Power which is denied to a Council of ten Churches in the other? If it be ſaid, this is our Conſtitution by Platform, it only ſhows the Imperfection and Unreaſonableneſs of the Platform, in denying to the Council in the ſecond Way, the Rights that belong to them as Chriſtian Men, Paſtors and Meſſengers met together to hear, judge, adviſe, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh as there may be Occaſion. As a private Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an I may lawfully reprove and admoniſh my Brother; but ten Churches met together in Council, may not do the like to an offending Church. Why, who can ſay? How come we to loſe the Rights of Men and Chriſtians by coming together into a Council? Is not the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Admonition, and Advice, the more reverend and weighty, by its coming from many, than from one or a few? If the bare human Conſtitution muſt debar one Council and authorize another, where both have equal Right in the Nature of Things, I deſire to be free from ſuch impoſing and abridging Canons of Men. I would never go to Council, with my Tongue and Hands tied, no more than with my Eyes and Ears ſtopped.</p>
               <p>That Dr. <hi>Colman</hi> retained like Sentiments on theſe Heads the following Extract from a Letter, wrote to one of his Brethren, <hi>Nov.</hi> 17. 1735, ſhews,</p>
               <p>"Rev. Sir,</p>
               <p>—In ſhort, the <hi>Conſociation of Churches,</hi> is the very Soul and Life of the Congregational Scheme, neceſſary to the very <hi>Eſſe</hi> as well as <hi>Bene</hi> of it; without which we muſt be <hi>Independent,</hi> and with which all the Good of <hi>Preſbyterianiſm</hi> is attainable.</p>
               <pb n="108" facs="unknown:006434_0125_1028EB8886730BF8"/>
               <p>But the conſociated Churches of every Neighbourhood muſt have their ſtated Meetings, the Paſtor with a Dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate from each Church, and whatever Caſe may occur in ſaid Churches, comes naturally and by Conſent firſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Cognizance and Counſel of this Aſſembly, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be by Way of <hi>Enquiry,</hi> or by <hi>Applications</hi> made to them.</p>
               <p>Our preſent Way of <hi>going on Enquiry,</hi> or <hi>ſending</hi> for Counſel <hi>whither we liſt,</hi> picking and chuſing, with open Partiality and manifeſt Selfiſhneſs, here and there, in Contempt of Neighbours, who beſt know and ſhould moſt care for us, is manifeſtly not of GOD and Order, nor for Righteouſneſs and Peace, or efficacious Influence.</p>
               <p>So neither is the <hi>Paſtor's</hi> going like a common Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without Character, or <hi>ex Officio;</hi> when the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture every where gives him a diſtinguiſhing Character (and ſo does the Platform too in many Places) and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders him always in his Office.</p>
               <p>Nor is it juſt or orderly for one Church to ſend a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Number of Delegates than another, and every Dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate with a Voice equal to his Paſtors, by which Means the Brotherhood becomes vaſtly ſuperior to the Elderſhip in our Councils. This is all Confuſion, without Reaſon, and contrary to the Current of Scripture, reſpecting the Elderſhip, in my Opinion.</p>
               <p>If the Churches come into ſuch an Act of Conſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion through the Land, it may make them ſtrong; but for <hi>any</hi> or <hi>every</hi> Church to take upon them to <hi>viſit</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when and as they pleaſe, and whom they pleaſe to forbear, making <hi>Enquiries</hi> into their State, Peace and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, muſt needs be a Source of <hi>endleſs Animoſity,</hi> and is a <hi>Yoke</hi> which neither our <hi>Fathers</hi> before us were able to bear, nor will any that ſhall come after us.</p>
               <p>By theſe Hints, Sir, you may ſee my Thoughts; for which End I ſuppoſe you put the Eſſay into my Hand, and I am your weak unworthy Brother and Servant,</p>
               <pb n="109" facs="unknown:006434_0126_1028EB8D03835678"/>

                  <hi>On the Right of chuſing a Miniſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was not for confining the Right of chuſing a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to the Communicants alone, but thought that every baptized adult Perſon, of ſober and good Converſation, who contributed to the Maintenance of one ſhould have a Vote in electing. It appeared to him that this Order was right and good, founded in Nature, and confirmed by Apoſtolick Practice, and through the firſt 300 Years of the Primitive Church. Accordingly when his People were about chuſing him a Colleague 1715—He uttered the following Words, in a Speech to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <g ref="char:startq">“</g>As to the Apoſtolical Times and Records there are but two Elections that occur to my Remembrance, and they were both made by the free Vote of all the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples <g ref="char:endq">”</g>together, in the Preſence of the Apoſtles.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt was the Nomination of two Perſons one of whom ſhould by Lot (and not by Vote of Election which of the two) ſucceed to the Apoſtleſhip from which <hi>Judas</hi> by Tranſgreſſion fell; of which you read <hi>Acts</hi> i. from 15th Ver. &amp;c. that <hi>Peter</hi> ſtood up in the Midſt of the Diſciples (now the Number of the Names toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were about an Hundred and twenty) and propoſed to them to chuſe two Perſons; and they (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty, the Apoſtles not aſſuming this Nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to themſelves, which was certainly by the ſpecial Direction of the Holy Ghoſt, as a Rule to Chriſtian So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties in future Elections) they, I ſay, the whole Hundred and twenty Brethren appointed two, and ſo referred the Lot to Providence; and it fell upon <hi>Matthias,</hi> and he was numbered with the eleven Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>The other Scripture Inſtance we have in the ſixth Chapter of <hi>Acts,</hi> where the Apoſtles found it neceſſary to have ſeven Men choſen, of honeſt Report, Sanctity and Wiſdom, to miniſter as Deacons in the Church; whereupon they called the Multitude of the Diſciples to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and ſaid— Brethren, look ye out among you ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Men whom we may appoint over this Buſineſs: and
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:006434_0127_1028EB8F9850D2B0"/>the Saying pleaſed the whole Multitude, and they choſe the ſeven Perſons, and ſet them before the Apoſtles, who ordained them by Prayer and Impoſition of Hands.</p>
               <p>There has been a great deal of Diſpute about the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to which theſe Seven were ordained, but whatever it was, more or leſs, you ſee that the whole Multitude of the Believers choſe them, and then the Apoſtles ordained them.</p>
               <p>And now Brethren, ſhall I go into the Hiſtory of the Primitive Church, and ſhew you that this was the Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the next Ages after the Apoſtles in the Election of their Biſhops and Paſtors: Their Pariſhes which were their Dioceſſes choſe them. And I am glad, Brethren, to ſee among you ſo many Perſons of liberal Education, while I lay before the whole Society, a brief Collection of Inſtances in the Chriſtian Church of the firſt 300 Years after our Saviour's Aſcenſion, to countenance and confirm us in our preſent Method.</p>
               <p>In the firſt Place I obſerve, That the Biſhop or Paſtor's Cure was in the primitive Times denominated by the Word <hi>Pariſh, paraike,</hi> which Word to this Day keeps the ſame Senſe among us which it did then: <hi>ſcil.</hi> the Bounds of a particular Church or Congregation of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers: For indeed the proper Senſe of the Word <hi>paraike,</hi> is — dwelling one by another, as Neighbours do.</p>
               <p>Accordingly the Epiſtle of <hi>Clemens Romanus,</hi> is to the Church of God pariſhing at <hi>Corinth: paraikoeſe korinthon</hi> And this Name had ſo obtained by long Uſe, before <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius</hi>'s Time, that through his Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, there is nothing more common than to read of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of the <hi>Pariſh</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> the Pariſh of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> the Pariſh of <hi>Corinth,</hi> the Pariſh of <hi>Athens,</hi> the Pariſh of <hi>Carthage,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Word Dioceſs is of modern Uſe, and not to be found in its preſent Senſe among the Ancients: Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan Epiſcopacy is of a later Inſtitution and human only; but the Paſtoral Care and Charge of a Pariſh or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Flock is from the Beginning.</p>
               <pb n="111" facs="unknown:006434_0128_1028EB91274EAAF8"/>
               <p>But that which concerns us at this Time, is only this, that when the Biſhop or Paſtor of a Church was dead, all the People of that Church met together in one Place to chuſe a new Biſhop.</p>
               <p>Agreeably <hi>Cyprian</hi> tells us that <hi>Sabinus</hi> was elected Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Emerita,</hi> by the Suffrage of all the Brotherhood: (<hi>Univerſae Fraternitatis ſuffragio</hi>) and that it was the Cuſtom through all <hi>Africa, Epiſcopus deligatur plebe preſente.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Euſebius</hi> tells us, that <hi>Fabianus</hi> was choſen Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> by all the Brethren met together for that End.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Cyprian</hi> tells us, that after the Death of <hi>Fabianus, Cornelius</hi> was choſen Biſhop (<hi>Cleri ac Plebis Suffragio</hi>) by the Suffrage of the Clergy and People.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Clement</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> ſays, that none were ordained but with the Approbation of the whole Church: <hi>ſunenotokeſaſes tes ekkleſias paſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And by <hi>Ignatius</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Philadelphians,</hi> it appears that when they were to ſend a Meſſenger to any foreign Church, the People met together to chuſe him.— And in his Epiſtle to <hi>Polycarp,</hi> there are two Things obſerved to our preſent Purpoſe.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>(1) That the Biſhop is there ſuppoſed to know his whole Flock perſonally by their Names: <hi>ek, onomatos pantas zetei.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>(2) That he adviſes <hi>Polycarp</hi> to convene his People to chuſe a faithful Man to ſend into <hi>Syria.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>In the Life of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> the Author tells us, that he was choſen Biſhop (<hi>Plebis Favore</hi>) by the Favour of the People; and <hi>Cyprian</hi> himſelf in one of his Epiſtles owns that he was choſen (<hi>Populi univerſi Suffragio</hi>) by the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage of all his People.</p>
               <p>Only it needs to be noted upon what has been ſaid; that theſe Elections were not made by the People without the Notice and Approbation of the neighbouring Biſhops or Paſtors; and it ſeems to me that they ſometimes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended the Perſon to the Flock to be choſen by them; and at other Times that they were preſent and choſe with
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:006434_0129_1028EB9446A01738"/>or for them: We find by <hi>Cyprian, Epiſcoporum Judicium</hi> (the Judgment of the neighbouring Biſhops) for juſt before it is ſaid (<hi>Epiſcopi ejuſdem Provinciae proximi qui<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> conveniant, plebe preſente,</hi> the neighbouring Biſhops of the Province being preſent) We find I ſay, the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Biſhops join'd with the <hi>Suffragium univerſae Fraternitatis:</hi> with the Vote and Election of the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood; which is agreeable to our own Practice, for we chuſe none but whom the neighbouring Paſtors conſent and agree in; to whom we preſent them for Ordination.</p>
               <p>Now, Brethren, by theſe and many more Examples which might be brought, as well as by the Rights of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it appears to me that we are upon a right Foot of Election, all the Brethren of the Congregation joining to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether therein.</p>
               <p>If you aſk me what makes a Brother and Member of a particular Church? I anſwer, Baptiſm into the Name of Chriſt, and a publick Profeſſion of the Faith of Chriſt together with a Chriſtian Converſation agreeable thereunto, and attending the Worſhip of God in this or that particular Congregation, ſubmitting to the Orders of Chriſt therein, and contributing to the Support of the Worſhip of God there.</p>
               <p>When I ſay this, I don't excuſe thoſe that neglect the Table of Chriſt, which the primitive Church knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of: No, it is a ſtrange and blameable Defect and Fault among us, which ſhould not be found among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians: But under this Defect, God forbid, that therefore theſe our ſober and vertuous Brethren, whom we ſhould be glad to ſee at the Lord's Table with us, ſhould be therefore denied their Right to act with us in the Choice of a Miniſter.</p>
               <p>I take it to be a Privilege equally purchaſed by Chriſt for all that profeſs his Name; whoſe Souls are equally precious, and who muſt judge every one for himſelf, and if any thing calls for a free and ſerious Choice for ones own Comfort and Benefit, that of our Miniſter doth ſo.</p>

               <p>THE wiſe and gracious Providence of God which orders all Things well, and for Ends that lie far out of his Creatures View, ſuffered Dr. <hi>Colman</hi> (as has been before largely related) to be ſtript naked in the Way to <hi>London,</hi> and there preſented him in his deſtitute Condition to the Charity and Generoſity of <hi>Madam Parkhurſt,</hi> where his Lodgings immediately brought him into the Knowledge of the <hi>London Miniſters,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards into a moſt happy Correſpondence with her worthy Son the <hi>honorable Samuel Holden</hi>

                     <p>You did me the Favour ſome Weeks ago, (from which Time I have not been able to write 'till 'now) to ſend me the Rev.

<pb n="119" facs="unknown:006434_0136_1028EBA85B77E410"/>I very much approve of, and the more ſo, becauſe it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to me, as if he had truly no private, or perſonal Intereſt in View; but only the Honour of his great Maſter, and the beſt Welfare of the poor Heathen, whom the FATHER gave him, for his Inheritance, and therefore I heartily wiſh it Succeſs, and hope the Difficulties in raiſing Money to carry on ſuch an Affair, may be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted.</p>
                     <p>I have been expecting every Day ſince you ſent it to me, to hear of ſome Subſcriptions going forward on that Account, but hear nothing of any ſuch Thing at preſent.</p>
                     <p>I would therefore humbly propoſe that a Sheet of Paper, or two, may be ſtitched up at the End of one, or more of thoſe printed Letters, and a generous Subſcription began, by a few well diſpoſed Gentlemen of <hi>Boſton,</hi> and handed about from one to another, to try what may be done that Way; and there every Subſcriber at one View may ſee the honeſt Deſign, and judge of its Neceſſity, and act accordingly.</p>
                     <p>I cannot help thinking the generous <hi>Benefactions</hi> of the Rev. Mr. <hi>Hollis,</hi> and his juſt Obſervation of the Inactivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a People of ſuch Name for Religion as we in <hi>New-England,</hi> in ſuch an Affair, will put many to the bluſh, and perhaps ſpur them on to a bountiful Liberality in this Scheme.</p>
                     <p>I am no ways qualified for a Leader my ſelf, but would willingly follow a few Gentlemen, who would be more likely to give it a Reputation and Currency, with my Subſcription of — <hi>Pounds,</hi> and would uſe my ſmall Ability to promote it, but it muſt be ſome how or other ſet a going, which when once well done, may be eaſily kept alive and in Motion: I have a great deal of Faith that ſomething of this Nature may be attended with Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, if put into ſuch Hands, as ſhall be ſpirited for it, and will not be weary in Well doing; but ſtir up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and others, with a well tempered Zeal, mixed with Prudence, ſo as to give no Offence to any that do not think exactly as they do; and by ſuch a Behaviour, ſome
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:006434_0137_1028EBA9E8AB1648"/>who may not be ſo well inclined at one Time, may be very well diſpoſed at another, to an handſom Subſcription.</p>
                     <p>But this Method notwithſtanding, I hope it will not be thought amiſs to have a Brief from Authority (if Need be) procured, and promoted in every Church in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, to collect what well diſpoſed People would be ready to give to encourage an Affair of this Importance; and if before the Collection, thoſe two Letters ſhould be read, I am humbly of Opinion, it would not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent.</p>
                     <p>If we really believe, the admirable Charms you men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at the Cloſe of you Letter, have any Reality in them, as I am apt to think they have, <hi>viz.</hi> "That a right liberal Heart and Hand, no Tongue can fully ſpeak it! or enough celebrate it!

                     <p>A more noble Charity never was projected than your ſending the <hi>Goſpel</hi> among the <hi>Heathen</hi> here, and into <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh</hi> Places, where the Settlements have been made void of the Form of Religion: The <hi>Harveſt</hi> of this Nature is too <hi>plenteous</hi> through <hi>Virginia, Maryland,</hi> the <hi>Jerſies,</hi> our <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Country alſo, and the <hi>Narraganſet,</hi> and ſome Places about <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> which have been too long <hi>neglected</hi> and ſuffered to run <hi>wild</hi> into <hi>Sectaries,</hi> and Prejudices againſt any Miniſtry of the Word at all.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>vaſt and waſte</hi> Space, deſolate and periſhing, cries aloud to you for your charitable Care; and verily the <hi>Fund</hi> which the Society has contributed and gathered is but too little yet by far for theſe neceſſitous Places; while at the ſame Time many of your Miſſions into our Parts are unto Places where the Goſpel is received and preached, and Churches gathered in very good Order and Manner.</p>
                     <p>I had my <hi>Birth</hi> in <hi>Boſton,</hi> my Education at our <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge;</hi> yet I have ſeen your <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and ſpent twelve Weeks together at the latter; near two Years alſo at <hi>London,</hi> and two more at <hi>Bath,</hi> ſent thither by the <hi>Preſbyterian</hi> Board at <hi>London.</hi> And I bleſs God that in this my <hi>Abſence</hi> from my own Country, I did but grow in the <hi>natural</hi> Inclination I had to, and in the <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous</hi> Principles of an enlarged <hi>catholick</hi> Spirit cheriſhed in me by my <hi>Tutor,</hi> Mr. <hi>Leverett;</hi> now Preſident of <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vard</hi>-College:— And if I am able to judge, no Place of Education can well boaſt a more <hi>free Air</hi> than our lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>College</hi> may.

                     <p>—Yet are there ſeveral ſuch notorious Inſtances in our <hi>New-Engliſh Provinces.</hi> One was lately in the Town of <hi>Braintree,</hi> within ten Miles of <hi>Boſton,</hi> which <hi>Application</hi> to you the Rev. Mr. <hi>Miles</hi> of <hi>Boſton</hi> refuſed to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; and was free to ſay, that were the Circumſtances of the Place known, my Lord of <hi>London</hi> and the <hi>Society</hi> would never approve of it: For it is a notorious Matter of Fact, that ſetting aſide <hi>two Families</hi> in that Party at <hi>Braintree,</hi> the Reſt neither <hi>know why</hi> they ſought the <hi>Church-Worſhip</hi> there, nor could be any <hi>Credit</hi> to it: Their Number was ſo very <hi>minute,</hi> and their Character ſo very <hi>mean,</hi> that when a Miniſter was ſent to them, he was <hi>aſhamed</hi> of his Errand, and <hi>diverted</hi> to ſome other Place of Service.</p>
                     <p>This laſt Year a Difference happened in the Town of <hi>Newbury</hi> about placing their <hi>Meeting-Houſe:</hi> The Matter
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:006434_0142_1028EBB9D06F32F8"/>was brought before our <hi>General Court,</hi> who determined it according to the free Vote and Act of the <hi>Precinct,</hi> whereby they had obliged themſelves to each other: Whereupon a Number of them declare themſelves for the <hi>Church of England;</hi> many of them I will ſuppoſe Perſons of Sobriety and Virtue, only in a <hi>Pett,</hi> and to ſave their <hi>Rate</hi> to their aged and worthy Miniſter Mr. <hi>Belcher;</hi> utterly <hi>ignorant</hi> of the Church they declare for, nor <hi>offended</hi> in the leaſt with the Form of Worſhip or Diſcipline which they turn from; and as wide herein from their <hi>Old Paſtor's</hi> Spirit and Principles, which are as <hi>catholick</hi> as can well be found among Miniſters of any Denomination; being till now among the moſt <hi>narrow</hi> and <hi>rigid</hi> Diſſenters, who would before this have diſown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>me</hi> in particular, for the Uſe of the <hi>Lord's-Prayer,</hi> reading the <hi>Scriptures</hi> and a <hi>freer</hi> Admiſſion to the <hi>Lord's Table,</hi> than has been generally practiſed in theſe Churches.</p>
                     <p>To name no more,— Your <hi>Miſſion</hi> to the Town of <hi>Jamaica</hi> upon <hi>Long-Iſland</hi> near <hi>New-York,</hi> was really a great Breach on the Law of Juſtice and Charity; if your Honourable <hi>Society</hi> could have ſeen into the Riſe and Spring of it. Mr. <hi>Hubbard</hi> and the People there were unrighteouſly diſpoſſeſſed of the Church and <hi>Miniſtry Houſe and Lands;</hi> which the <hi>Town</hi> had built and given for the Worſhip of God after the Way of the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> from the Church of <hi>England:</hi> When therefore the Rev. Mr. <hi>Gordon</hi> (the <hi>Glory</hi> of the <hi>Miſſion</hi> hitherto that we have ſeen) in 1702 came thither, he was greatly <hi>ſurprized</hi> inſtead of ſome Place to goſpelize, to find a worthy <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter</hi> on the Place ejected, and the greater Part of the <hi>grieved</hi> Inhabitants cleaving to him: Mr. <hi>Hubbard</hi> and he lived a few Months in perfect Harmony and Eſteem of each other, and then God called for the precious Life of Mr. <hi>Gordon,</hi> whom Mr. <hi>Hubbard</hi> viſited and <hi>prayed</hi> with <hi>dying,</hi> and <hi>mourned</hi> when dead, and did not long ſurvive him.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, Sir, there is one <hi>ſordid Motive</hi> which will find you <hi>Beggars</hi> enough for your Charity in our Country
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:006434_0143_1028EBC0159FF708"/>Towns! if you will <hi>free them</hi> from <hi>Rates</hi> to any Miniſtry and <hi>maintain</hi> it for them. But I am ſure your Honourable <hi>Society</hi> never meant to miniſter to ſuch a Diſpoſition in any.</p>
                     <p>— In this Confidence I have freely written to you, and intreat your Candour. I have been ever wiſhing for a <hi>Comprehenſion,</hi> and do but grow theſe laſt Years in my Opinion of <hi>Occaſional Conformity,</hi> the more it has been branded for <hi>Hypocriſy.</hi> I cannot think the Churches <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> lies in Uniformity in every Mode of Worſhip or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, but in hearty Charity and Eſteem, teſtified by Occaſional Communion, under a ſmall Diverſity of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration and Diſcipline.</p>
                     <p>—But I <hi>forget</hi> my ſelf,— I <hi>preach,</hi>— and, to <hi>Whom?</hi> Sir, improve not what I write to any <hi>Hurt,</hi> if it can ſerve to no Good. I have no Quarrel with any, nor am will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be brought into a Controverſy.—I accuſe not your Society, far be it from me; but mean only a private In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. You will beſt judge, Sir, if there be no <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence</hi> to the Church of God, in the <hi>Steps</hi> taken by too many, here and there. I perfectly believe you would not willingly ſin againſt us. Your <hi>Money, Time, Cares,</hi> Pains are a <hi>mighty Charity</hi> which God will reward. The Lord recompence it to you in his Grace, <hi>Mercy and Peace.</hi>

                     <p>We have no great Proſpect, I confeſs, of ſuch Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in our <hi>Old England,</hi> where the Spirit of Diſſention and Faction, nay, of the utmoſt Infatuation, has raged horribly, and is not yet caſt out. I think I ſaw long ſince, that the Beginnings of this Sorrow were the Seeds of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery</hi> ſcattered in the Minds of common People, with ſtrange Induſtry and Art, to ſmooth the Way for a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender. Noiſe and Nonſenſe were very prevailing, and at laſt the Word given out was, <hi>I had rather be a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt than a Preſbyterian;</hi> and under this delirious Cant, the poor Souls were prepared to cry out, <hi>The Church, the Church,</hi> as loud as if they had been in the Streets of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to idolize a ſeditious, not to ſay ignorant Doctor; as much as if he had been a Pope of this other World.</p>
                     <p>The People in this Ferment were diſpoſed to read and admire the daily Pamphlets, thrown about to reconcile them more and more to Popery, under Pretences of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and <hi>hereditary Rights, uninterrupted Succeſſion, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant State</hi> of the Church, the Expediency and even Neceſſity of <hi>private Confeſſion,</hi> the immediate Effects of <hi>ſacerdotal Abſolution,</hi> the <hi>Invalidity</hi> of Baptiſm out of Epiſcopal Communion, a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> an <hi>Altar,</hi> a <hi>real Sacrifice</hi> in the Lord's-Supper, a <hi>middle</hi> State of Souls, no Harm, at leaſt, in <hi>Prayers for the Dead,</hi> and many other Deviſes, approaching as near to <hi>Rome</hi> as preſent Shame and Safety would admit.</p>
                     <p>All theſe Conceits you well know, ſprung as Tares of the Enemy, long after our bleſſed Reformation, and I think never appeared 'till a little before the Beginning of the Civil Wars, under the Influence of a Court that had too much of the Popiſh Queen in it, and were now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived to ſerve no other Purpoſe but that of the Intereſt of a Popiſh Impoſtor. Only there was ſome Difference in the Times; for before thoſe Civil Wars, none ran into thoſe Notions but ſome of the warmer and ambitious <hi>Clergy;</hi> whereas now the <hi>common People</hi> and the very <hi>Women</hi> had their Heads full of them.</p>
                     <p>Under theſe Deluſions a Multitude have been given
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:006434_0149_1028EBCF98561A40"/>up to believe the <hi>Idol</hi> at <hi>Avignon</hi> to be ſomething, and worthy to be ſet up; <hi>given up,</hi> alas! to any Lies, and to the Practice of many Popiſh Superſtitions. Some would not go to their Seats in the Church 'till they had kneeled and prayed at the Rails of the Communion-Table; they would not be content to receive the Sacrament there kneeling, but with Proſtration and ſtriking of the Breaſt, and kiſſing of the Ground, as if there were an <hi>Hoſt</hi> to be adored; they began to think the Common-Prayer without a Sermon (at leaſt Afternoon) to be the beſt way of ſerving God; and Churches without Organs had the thinner Congregations; <hi>bidding</hi> of Prayer, was thought better than praying to God, and even Pictures about the Altar began to be the Books of the Vulgar; the <hi>Meeting-Houſes</hi> of Proteſtant Diſſenters were thought to be more defiled Places than Popiſh Chappels: In ſhort, the Herd of People were running towards <hi>Rome</hi> without any Foreſight, or Power of looking backward.</p>
                     <p>To this Madneſs of the People was the Rebellion owing; now one is quelled, the other will abate; and our greateſt Deliverance under King <hi>George,</hi> will be that <hi>of our being delivered from our ſelves,</hi> and being reſtored not only to our Religion and Liberties but to our Senſes —</p>

                     <p>—After having wrote largely of the <hi>Fooleries</hi> (as he ſtiles them) of the High-Church—He adds "And you have Senſe enough to let me tell you as a very charitable Friend that there is ſomewhat of a like wrong
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:006434_0150_1028EBD14DF2D0E8"/>Spirit among our <hi>Diſſenting Brethren</hi> or the Body of them. The good old Tenderneſs of Conſcience is viſibly abated, the ſtrict Regard to Sobriety and Temperance is very much altered; the keeping up Family Prayers and Fear of God in Children and Servants is wearing off apace, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles are leſs read, and Sabbaths leſs obſerved, &amp;c. In ſhort, they are very ſoon gone off from the <hi>good old Puritans</hi> who has certainly a more ſober Deportment, and a more ſerious Senſe of Religion and Devoutneſs in them.</p>
                     <p>And this Degeneracy at a Time when they have been in greateſt Danger and ought to have been moſt upon their Guard of Piety and Prudence. For whereas the <hi>good old Puritans</hi> were all along popular and well-belov'd upon the juſt Reputation of being a ſober godly Party, who ſpoke better and lived better than moſt of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours: It ſo happens on the contrary (God knoweth how) that our Diſſenters of late have had the common Cry againſt them: the Laws could hardly protect them, the Government almoſt afraid to defend them, and if the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Clergy whom they call the Low-Church, would have fell into that Stream of Prejudice againſt them they had been driven (as the Wind and Tide have long ſat) into a State of Perſecution and the utmoſt Deſertion; wherein the Body of the Clergy and People would have thought they had done God good Service.</p>
                     <p>And yet the Diſſenters (perhaps to a Man) have had one of the greateſt Merits, that of being true to their Coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>try, and to the Ballance of <hi>Europe,</hi> always well affected to the Proteſtant Succeſſion, and very faithful Subjects of <hi>King George,</hi> and firm Adherents to his <hi>Royal Family:</hi> An Advantage that one would think might before this Time have been improved to their Security and Honour: And ſo undoubtedly it would have been if they had fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Steps of the <hi>good old Puritans,</hi> and had once more the Eſteem of a peaceable and religious People; if they had been really ready to join with the moderate Biſhops and Clergy, and had complained only of Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions unknown to the firſt Reformers, requiring only ſome
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:006434_0151_1028EBD84C6D9078"/>few Conceſſions to be made to them, ſhewing themſelves truly tender of the Peace and Unity of the Church and State, and always more zealous for a good Life and good Works than for any other Matter of Contention.— Such a Spirit of God in a ſtill Voice will at ſome Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential Time or other heal all our Breaches, and fruſtrate the Hopes of the Common Enemy.</p>

                     <p>It is thought, he tells us, that our Clergy ſhould not meet in ſo publick <hi>authoritative</hi> a Manner without the King's Conſent as Head of the Church; and that it would be a bad Precedent for our Diſſenting Brethren at Home to aſk the ſame Privilege; which if granted, would be a ſort of vying with the Eſtabliſhed Church.

And although the oppreſſive Powers in the End of King <hi>Charles,</hi> and the <hi>firſt</hi> of King <hi>James the Second,</hi> had no Conſideration hereof, but vaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted our firſt <hi>Charter,</hi> yet we have to plead in the Second Place,</p>

But when I ſay that our Churches and Miniſters here are eſtabliſhed by the King's Laws, I would pray your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> not to underſtand me in Oppoſition to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> for ſo they are not; but if any Town will chuſe a Gentleman of the Church of <hi>England</hi> for their Paſtor or Rector they are at their Liberty, and he is their Miniſter by the Laws of our Province, as much as any Congregational Miniſter among us is ſo. So far is our Eſtabliſhment from excluding others from the common
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:006434_0156_1028EBE5669D3548"/>Rights of Men and Chriſtians, and I hope ever will remain ſo.</p>
                     <p>And then thirdly, our Churches here being founded and formed on the Congregational Scheme, our Synods whether greater or leſs do not pretend to Authority or Juriſdiction, but only to counſel and adviſe the Churches, who are at Liberty after all to judge for themſelves, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it is to be hoped they will always pay a rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ential Regard to the deliberate and ſolemn Advices of a venerable Aſſembly of their Paſtors and Elders.— Your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> will from hence eaſily judge how far ſuch a Synod can be in any ſort vying with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or a bad Precedent to other Diſſenters from it.</p>
                     <p>For as to our Brethren in <hi>Ireland,</hi> they meet in Synods when they pleaſe by the <hi>Act of Toleration,</hi> and our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in the Provinces of <hi>New-York</hi> and <hi>New-Jerſies</hi> have their ſtated annual Synods, Nobody forbidding them or taking Umbrage at their ſo doing.—But we in the Province of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts,</hi> really the Churches eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by Law, and having been uſed to aſk the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of our Rulers in our Meetings in a Provincial Synod, we now obſerved the ſame Rule and kept to our old Practice; expecting no more from them than the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick's bearing the Charge of the Convention, and if the Reſults of the Synod were approved by the Government, that they would recommend the fame to the reverent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards of our Churches.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>(my Lord)</hi> is the Foot that the Churches of <hi>New-England</hi> have hitherto ſtood on, increaſed and flouriſhed on; leading quiet and peaceable Lives in all Godlineſs and Honeſty, maintaining an exemplary Loyalty to the King, and Brotherly Love to their Neighbours; except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome Errors of a perſecuting Spirit toward the Baptiſt and Quakers for ſometime in their Beginning, which we have heartily repented of.</p>
                     <p>And whereas it is inſinuated that this Synod would have come to ſome Reſolutions to the Prejudice of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> it is only Surmiſe, and without any
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:006434_0157_1028EBE765093F38"/>Grounds, ſave what the Objectors may apprehend from the Principles of Non conformity which we openly profeſs, and from the late Diſputes which they have raiſed among us about Epiſcopacy.—The utmoſt that the Synod was like to have done, about Church-Order and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was their confirming or rather amending ſome Things in our Platform of Church-Diſcipline the Reſults of former Synods, which would have done nothing more againſt the Church of <hi>England</hi> than ſtands profeſſed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready among us, nor have ſet us at any more Diſtance from her. And if your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> will pleaſe to read the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial it ſelf, a Copy whereof I incloſe to you, you will ſee that the Reaſon and Cauſe of our deſiring a Synod at this Time was to enquire into the Cauſes of the preſent growing Corruption of Manners among us, and the Means of the Reformation of theſe; the ſame noble and pious Cauſe wherein your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> has borne ſo good and great a Part for many Years paſt.—This is not the Cauſe of a Sect or Party, but too many in every Sect among us have an Averſion to it, and no wonder if it be every-where ſpoken againſt.—Or if our reforming Synod could not eſcape the Suſpicion of ſome, that ſomething ungrateful to Epiſcopacy or Liturgies might be done there, yet I muſt ſeriouſly profeſs to your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> that in all the Debates among the Miniſters, whether this Year or in Years paſt, upon this Head of calling a Synod, I remember not a Word that has dropt among us to give Occaſion for ſuch a Suſpicion.—Or if it be that our Churches are now envied the Reputation of holding Synods as in Times paſt by Gentlemen lately come among us, and who have been treated by us with all due Reſpects, they are neither courteous nor juſt; for it ought in Righteouſneſs and Honour to content them that they receive all kind and brotherly Treatment from us, and enjoy their own Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <p>It is now thirty five Years ſince I left the City, where I was not unknown to the venerable Dr. <hi>Bray,</hi> that Man of God for Apoſtolic Love and Zeal, ſince which I have had the Honour of a long and moſt free Intercourſe of Letters with the late excellent Biſhop of <hi>Peterborough,</hi> Dr. <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,</hi> now with God.</p>

                     <p>I do the more willingly therefore join my Brethren, who live remote from <hi>Boſton,</hi> and hitherto quite out of the Way of the Miſſions whereof they write in their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to your <hi>Lordſhip;</hi> being fully perſwaded of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity and Uprightneſs of their Hearts in it, and that they aim at nothing but what is juſt and right in the Sight of God.</p>

                     <p>The Manner of my Addreſs to you, and the Matter of my humble Requeſt, from one at ſuch a Diſtance from you, and altogether a Stranger and unknown may well be not a little ſurprizing to you. I had need therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce my ſelf into ſome Knowledge with you, and if it might be Eſteem, which I know not how better to do if the incloſed Sermons will not in ſome Meaſure ſerve to this Eng.—You will ſee by them two Things, that is has pleaſed God to uſe me in miniſtring to my Country, in the great Bounties to Mr. <hi>Hollis</hi> to our College, and of Mr. <hi>Holden</hi> to the poor Members of Chriſt in our Churches; nor has <hi>their</hi> Almoner benefited himſelf in his temporal Eſtate at all hereby, nor deſired it.—You will alſo ſee, Sir, that my Country, I mean the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over it, know how to acknowledge with due Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and Honour their pious and generous Benefactors, and alſo their own Sons that miniſter to the publick In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of Learning and Piety.</p>
                     <p>And now, Sir, providentially hearing Yeſterday of Sir <hi>Richard Ellis</hi> Bart, formerly a Member of Parliament for <hi>Boſton</hi> in <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> that he has a noble Library which it is thought he will incline to leave to ſome learned Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries amongſt the Diſſenters; my Heart commands me to ſalute you on the Behalf of my dear Mother, <hi>"Harvard College</hi> in <hi>Cambridge New-England,</hi> where I had my Education, and whom I have been honoured by God to ſerve in obtaining for ſaid Academy the <hi>Holliſian Profeſſor</hi> of Divinity, and alſo of <hi>natural and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental Philoſophy,</hi> beſide ſundry annual Exhibitions for the Education of poor Scholars, with an Addition of many valuable Books to the Library of ſaid College.</p>
                     <pb n="148" facs="unknown:006434_0165_1028EBFF8EAD2420"/>
                     <p>And now, Honoured Sir, If I may be permitted by the divine Providence, which has hitherto ſmiled on ſaid Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary of Learning, to cloſe and crown my Life and Love to it (for I am now within three Years of Seventy) by obtaining your kind Regards to it whenever it pleaſes God to incline you to diſpoſe of any Part of your rich Library, is the whole generous End on my Part of this my humble and moſt reſpectful Addreſs to you; which I cover to my dear Countryman and once Fellow-Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in ſaid College <hi>Henry Newman</hi> 
                        <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Secretary to the Honourable Society for Propagating Chriſtian Knowledge, with whom I have had the Pleaſure of a free and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Friendſhip theſe forty-five Years paſt, entreating him to wait upon your Honour with it, of whom you may enquire concerning our College, as alſo of the Reverend <hi>Doctor</hi>'s, <hi>Watts</hi> and <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Neal</hi> of <hi>London;</hi> who will alſo wiſh us a Part in your good Will I perſwade my ſelf how much ſoever Dr. <hi>Williams</hi>'s Library may reaſonably ſtand fair in their Eye and your own: Nor would I ſay a Word to divert your Bounty from that Foundation.</p>
                     <p>If my Requeſt finds Favour with you, I hope Sir, you will in granting it ſerve the Intereſt of Chriſt among the Diſſenters for many Generations; for we are a very flouriſhing Province, and our Towns and Churches mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply, for which hitherto our College has been made a rich Supply, as to worthy Perſons raiſed up in Church and State; which that it may more and more be in Times to come when we are dead, is the ſole Aim of my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Writing; and that I alſo may reap with you in the Rewards of a better Life, attending ſuch pious Projec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Foundations.</p>
                     <p>Sir, my humble Prayer is that all the Bleſſings of Providence and Grace may attend you to your Grave in Peace; and may be multiplied to your Honourable Lady, for I hear God has denied you Children—But that God may pleaſe to raiſe up to you, among our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactors, Sons from our College, a ſpiritual Seed to ſerve
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:006434_0166_1028EC0169A1F968"/>Chriſt and Souls, while you reap in the Viſions of his Glory among the Spirits of the Juſt made perfect, is the Prayers of, &amp;c."</p>
                     <p>By his Acquaintance with the Rev. Dr. <hi>William Harris</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> he had the Diſtribution of Five Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Pounds Sterling to the worthy Family of the <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>'s in <hi>New-England</hi> to the equal Benefit and general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of all concerned—A Labour which demanded much Time.</p>
                     <p>From his long, endearing and intimate Friendſhip and Correſpondence with Dr. <hi>Iſaac Watts,</hi> our <hi>Country</hi> and <hi>Churches</hi> have reaped many Advantages.—I find him giving timely Notices, of riſing Dangers to our Civil and Eccleſiaſtical State; and pointing out happy Methods of Safety. He greatly enriched our Colleges and Schools by his generous Beſtowment of many valuable Books. Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> at one Time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from him Seventy Pounds Charity chiefly col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from his Friends (as the Letter ſays) for the School at <hi>Houſatonick.</hi> The numerous ingenious and uſeful Letters, that paſs between theſe two Divines for a long Courſe of Years would afford a moſt grateful Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to all benevolent and pious Readers. Souls alike formed to pleaſe and profit Mankind!</p>
                     <p>He alſo held and maintained an agreeable and uſeful Correſpondence with the Rev. Mr. <hi>John Shower,</hi> Dr. <hi>Edmund Calamy,</hi> Dr. <hi>John Evans,</hi> Dr. <hi>Jeremiah Hunt,</hi> Dr. <hi>Guiſe,</hi> Mr. <hi>Daniel Mayo,</hi> and many other Diſſenting Divines in <hi>London,</hi> &amp;c. by whom he had Informations to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of his Country and the Churches.</p>
                     <p>Dr. <hi>Henry Winder</hi> of <hi>Liverpool</hi> (Author of a learned critical and chronological Hiſtory) ſought his Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence and was highly delighted with it for ſeveral Years paſt.</p>
                     <p>Twenty two of the Rev. Mr. <hi>Daniel Neal</hi>'s Letters are found in Order (beſides many others) in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Country and <hi>Harvard</hi> College, and by the Contents of them it appears how precious our Civil and
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:006434_0167_1028EC074AAA3D68"/>religious Intereſt were to them; and how much they ſought the beſt Good of <hi>New England.</hi>—I alſo find Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> aſſiſting this Gentleman with ſome uſeful Materials for his Hiſtory of our Country.</p>
                     <p>Sir <hi>William Aſhurſt</hi>— and Lord Viſcount <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington Shute</hi> and other Gentlemen of Figure and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wrote frequently to him, and freely offered to do all the Services they could for us upon his Motions. They often aſſure him "that his Correſpondence is perfectly agreeable, and deſire him conſtantly to communicate his Sentiments to them of ſuch Matters as occur to his Obſervation."</p>
                     <p>I find Sir <hi>Richard Blackmore</hi> taking Notice of him, and his Writings, and making a Preſent of ſome of his Poems to him. I might mention his large Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with the Honourable Dr. <hi>Nicholas Trot,</hi> Chief Judge of <hi>South-Carolina,</hi> reſpecting a learned Work he was about, entitled <hi>Clavis Linguae Sanctae.</hi>

                     <p>To Governour <hi>Nicholſon</hi> and moſt of the Governours in the Plantations he wrote frequently.</p>
                     <p>Many Letters of greateſt Importance paſſed between him and the Honoured Dr. <hi>Avery</hi>

                     <p>He held a pleaſant and uſeful Correſpondence and Friendſhip with ſundry eminent Divines of the renowned <hi>Church of Scotland,</hi> particularly with Mr. <hi>R.

                     <p>Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> wrote unto and correſponded with divers Gentlemen Divines of the Eſtabliſhed Church in <hi>England</hi> (beſides thoſe already named)<note n="†" place="bottom">Wrote to the Reverend and learned Dr. <hi>Thomas Burnet,</hi> Author of many uſeful <hi>Works,</hi> with Obſervations on ſome of them.

                     <p>This Gentleman entered into a ſincere and moſt paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate Friendſhip with Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> ſoon after his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival at <hi>London,</hi> and no Changes in Opinion or Station could ever make the leaſt Breach upon it. Their Loves ſeem to equal thoſe of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Jonathan,</hi> if we may judge by their Expreſſions. They omitted no Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of Writing and ſending every curious Piece they could light of to one another. And as both of them had a good Taſte and Gift for Poetry, ſcarce a Letter paſſed without ſomething of that kind incloſed for Amuſement. A large and beautiful Pile is now before me full of fine Senſe, true Eloquence and manly Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.—They communicated the minuteſt as well as moſt important Circumſtances of their Families and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and made each others Griefs and Joys their own. In the reading them over, I have had great Pleaſure and Improvement. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Deſcription of Friendſhip often occurred to my Mind—viz. <hi>One Soul in two Bodies</hi>—This Gentleman I ſuppoſe to be ſtill living in an advanced

               <p>For a Cloſe of this Chapter I ſhall hint at, and remark upon Dr. <hi>Colman</hi>'s Character for Publick-Spiritedneſs, Fidelity, Liberality and Charity.</p>
               <p>By the foregoing Pages it appears that the <hi>Doctor</hi> had a large and generous Soul, and made his Life as ſignificant to the World, and to his won Nation and Country in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular as he poſſibly could. He might perhaps with as Apoſtle for his <hi>Motto,</hi> Rom. xiv. 7. <hi>None of us liveth to himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In every Stage of Life there are ſome notable Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of his acting agreeable to it—He could ſay with the <hi>Stoicks, Agenerous Action is a Reward to it ſelf.</hi> Thro' all his coſtly and painful (to him pleaſant and delightful) Correſpondence with Mr. <hi>Holden</hi> and Meſſirs. <hi>Hollis</hi>'s &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. he never aſked any Thing for himſelf. And when he was offered and preſſed to accept of a Set of valuable Books by Mr. <hi>Thomas Hollis,</hi> he refuſed taking them on any other Condition than their going to the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege at his Death, where he ordered them by his Will. Therefore in the Dedication of his Twenty Sacramental Sermons he could ſay, "I had no private Intereſt in View. Nor have I ever had any private or oblique Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to my <hi>ſelf</hi> in the long Courſe of <hi>Letters</hi> that have paſſed between us for more than ſever Years paſt.— I appeal to you, Sir, if I have not acted toward you

               <p>"He was ſingularly <hi>Faithful</hi> in the numerous Truſts repoſed in him. Although there was a large Liberty ſometimes given him to diſpoſe of many Hundred Pounds in Books and Monies (as he ſaw Cauſe) yet he endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the exacteſt Care and moſt diligent Study to find out the Mind of the Donor from his general Directions: And ever kept and ſent a particular Account of every Farthing diſtributed (to what Uſe, &amp;c.) to his Employers: He was anxiouſly fearful, leaſt any Monies in his keeping ſhould at his Death be thought his <hi>own,</hi> and therefore not only told his Friends from Time to Time what he had, but alſo wrote upon it, and gave ſpecial Orders about it in his Will.</p>
               <p>I ſhall add no more here— As the <hi>Doctor</hi> deviſed li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral Things, and warmly and prudently provoked others to Love and good Works; ſo according to his Ability and ſometimes beyond it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Reading, and cloſe Application of Mind to Study was early, and ever his Delight—He read much, and digeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed well the various Authors he peruſed; and often col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from them what was curious and uſeful, as appears by many Sheets left, and numerous Quotations in his Sermons.<note n="*" place="bottom">He had a good Library, not large, but wiſely collected of the beſt Authors ancient and modern.— He retained conſiderable of his School-Learning to the laſt— I find him to have read over <hi>Horace</hi> in his Old Age, by his Collections of ſome of the moſt beautiful Lines and Sentiments from it.</note>
               </p>
               <p>In his <hi>younger</hi> Times he was a Night-Student, by which his Health was greatly impaired, and he experienc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Truth of that Saying in <hi>Eraſmus, 'Nocturnae Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubrationes
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:006434_0183_1028EC39BA919760"/>longe periculoſiſſimae habentur.</hi> In his latter Years he plied his Studies chiefly in the Forenoon, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily ſpent the whole of it in them. And he has been heard to ſay on the Verge of <hi>Seventy,</hi> "That he found himſelf beſt in Health and Spirit, at his Table with a Book or Pen in his Hand.— All muſt be huſhed and ſtill when he was there employed either in Reading, writing Letters or compoſing Sermons— He wrote many Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Epiſtles in a Year— <hi>(Nulla Dies ſine Epiſtolis)</hi> to all Ranks of Perſons; on all Occaſions and Buſineſſes, and with greateſt Eaſe imaginable, to the vaſt Pleaſure and Profit of his Friends, the Benefit of his Country and the Churches in it; and the Good of Mankind.— His Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to his Correſpondents abroad being ſeen and admired, created him new Friends and were a happy Means of raiſing up new Benefactors to theſe Provinces (as appears from what has been already written)— I need not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here obſerve to my Readers, how good a Maſter he was of the Epiſtolary Stile — The Letters already inſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and others to be publiſhed in our Narrative ſhall ſpeak for themſelves.<note n="†" place="bottom">And yet as I obſerved in my Introduction, all or the moſt of them are printed off from the firſt rough Draught.</note>
               </p>
               <p>When he was about making a Sermon, after he had firſt looked up to Heaven for Aſſiſtance, he choſe a Text, and conſulted the beſt Expoſitors upon it (particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the Rev. Mr. <hi>Matthew Henry,</hi> for whoſe Writings he ſeems to have had the greateſt Value next to the ſacred Scriptures) and drew the Scheme of it on looſe Papers, and noted down not only general Heads and Subdiviſions, but alſo ſome of the leading Thoughts and bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Quotations from Authors (around him) with many Paſſages of Scripture for Proof and Illuſtration.— Thus prepared he proceeded to write his Sermon on a Sheet of Paper neatly folded and ſtitched, which he ſometimes fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with a Celerity and Exactneſs incredible. I have
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:006434_0184_1028EC3B4F74FC48"/>known him begin and compleat a Diſcourſe that would laſt an Hour at one Sitting in a Forenoon.<note n="*" place="bottom">One of his Twenty Sacramental Sermons in Print.</note> Few In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlines or Emendations were afterward inſerted or needed.<note n="†" place="bottom">And yet he ſaw Cauſe to deſtroy many of his Sermons. On one and another of them he has wrote—The firſt three or five Sermons on this Text, are burnt.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Many of the Sermons he wrote and delivered at <hi>Bath</hi> in <hi>England</hi> forty-eight Years ago, are yet to be ſeen in his Study (all fair and clean) ſome of them in a Volume in the Bulk and Form of a Preaching Bible, and others in diſtinct Sheets.

               <p>Some of the Diſcourſes he has favoured the World with were printed from the firſt rough draught<note n="#" place="bottom">His excellent Sermon preached at a Faſt before the Choice of Mr. <hi>William Cooper</hi> is one of them.</note> and not a few have been honoured with divers Impreſſions.<note n="**" place="bottom">Scil. His Diſcourſes on the Parable of the Ten Virgins— On the Incomprehenſibleneſs of God—With many ſingle Sermons.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And here although (as we hinted in the Introduction) I am every way unfit to give the <hi>Doctor</hi> and his <hi>Writings</hi> their juſt Praiſes yet I will venture to ſay a few Things more of him and them.</p>
               <p>As a <hi>Preacher</hi> he was emulous to excel, and ſecond to none among the bright Sons of <hi>New-England</hi> either living or deceaſed. He always brought Light and Heat into the Pulpit with him, to improve the Minds and affect the Hearts of his Hearers, and appeared to be in his proper Element there. His exact and exquiſite Judgment as well as his lively Fancy and Imagination were employed in every Diſcourſe.—The choiceſt
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:006434_0185_1028EC3EED656238"/>Matter preſented in elegant Language and flowing Eloquence.</p>
               <p>His Wiſdom and Ingenuity was ſeen in the Choice and Variety of the Subjects handled by him: He gave every Truth and Duty in the wide Circle of Divinity its proper Place and Inculcation. He was particularly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and commended for a nice and careful Obſervation of the Face of divine Providence, towards the World in general, and towards our Nation and Land, and for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving every Merciful, Afflictive and judicial Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, for the Benefit of his Hearers in his publick Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes as well as private Converſation—The ſpecial Caſes and Circumſtances of his own Flock and Friends were in a very ſingular Manner regarded as appears by many Sermons in print and Manuſcripts left by him<note n="‖" place="bottom">About Twenty-four Funeral Sermons were publiſhed by him. He never preached Politicks but when he ſaw his Country in Danger and Diſtreſs—as is ſaid of his Friend Bp. <hi>Kennet.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>But above all JESUS CHRIST and the Covenant of Salvation through him was his grand and favourite Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and moſt uſual Topick, as appears from his Notes and his repeated Declarations to the World.</p>
               <p>"He preached <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in his Perſon, Natures, Offices, Benefits; <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his eternal Godhead, in the Covenant of Redemption and Grace; in the Promiſes, Prophecies and Types of him; In his Birth, Life, Doctrines, Laws, Miracles, Sufferings and Death; In his Reſurrection, Aſcention to, and Seſſion at the Right Hand of God, his Interceſſion and ſecond coming to judge the World; In ſhort <hi>the Covenant of Salvation through him:</hi> And every Doctrine and Law of natural Religion with a direct Reference unto <hi>him</hi> as revealed and enjoined by him, as performed only by his Grace, and acceptable only for his Sake, <hi>who is the End of the Law for Righteouſneſs,</hi> and as inforced upon us by his Promiſes and Threatnings; that <hi>he</hi> in all may be glorified, and the Grace of God through him.—So it is noted in the
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:006434_0186_1028EC42092C4828"/>Life of Mr. <hi>Philip Henry,</hi> 
                  <q>that whenever he preached <g ref="char:startq">“</g>of moral Duties, he would always bring Chriſt into his Sermon, his <hi>Life</hi> as the Pattern of the Duty, his <hi>Love</hi> as the grand Motive to it, his <hi>Merits</hi> as the great <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement</hi> 
                     <g ref="char:endq">”</g>for our Defects in it.</q> This primitive and apoſtolic Preaching was the Manner of Dr. <hi>Colman</hi>'s preaching the Goſpel of the Grace of God.</p>
               <p>Accordingly he has declared once and again,<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>See his Sermon, entitled,</hi>— The Grace given us in the preached Goſpel.—</note>

               <p>It is recorded in the 42 Page of our Narrative that the <hi>Gentlemen</hi> who invited Dr. <hi>Colman</hi>'s Return to <hi>New-England</hi> propoſed to him in their Letter "That the

Yet People in ſome Places ſtill object againſt it as introducing ſomething new in the Worſhip of God. I knew a Miniſter who propoſed this Matter to the Conſideration of his Church ſome Years ago, and had ſo many Objections brought by them thereupon that he was obliged to ſpend two long Sermons in Order to obviate them, and after all could not prevail.—</note> Sabbath in the publick Worſhip of God among them, which was not practiſed in other Churches (in the Town) at that Day.— He readily concurred with their Propoſal, and practiſed accordingly to his Death.—For he ever looked upon this Publick Reading as but a due Reverence and Honour done to them, and a ſuitable Acknowledgment made to the glorious Author <hi>Jehovah,</hi> who in infinite Mercy has given his Word to us, and by which he will judge the World at the great Day.—His Cuſtom was to begin the Religious Exerciſes of God's Houſe with a ſhort Prayer for a Bleſſing on that Portion of the Word that was then to be read to the Congregation—And herein he humbly apprehended he followed the Foot-ſteps of the Flock.—He found both the Jewiſh and Chriſtian Churches in their beſt and pureſt Times paying ſuch a Regard to it,—The Reverend Aſſembly of Divines at <hi>Weſtminster</hi> adviſing to it—Our <hi>New-England</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith (in <hi>Chapter</hi> 22d <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. which treats of religious Worſhip and the Sabbath Day) according with them—the Words are <hi>ſcil:</hi> "The Reading of the Scripture, Preaching and Hearing the Word of God, ſinging of Pſalms, and alſo the Adminiſtration of Baptiſm, and the Lords-Supper are all Parts of the religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, to be performed in Obedience unto God with Underſtanding, Faith, Reverence, and godly Fear. But what weighed infinitely more with him than all ſuch
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:006434_0196_1028EC619A538080"/>Authorities was "That he plainly diſcerned ſufficient Grounds for the Practice in the ſacred Oracles.<note n="*" place="bottom">He doubtleſs conſidered ſuch Scripture-Paſſages as the following, and I wiſh the Reader would turn to them, ſee Deut. xxxi. 11.

               <p>And he had ſoon the Pleaſure of hearing the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and Thanks of many for the Benefit and Advantage they received by it.—And of ſome too who came at firſt with ſtrange Prejudices againſt it. He lived to ſee this laudable Cuſtom prevail in and ſpread through many Churches of the Land; and ſo the Reproaches we had long lain under for this Omiſſion in ſome Meaſure taken away.<note n="†" place="bottom">So long ago as in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Yet I would by no means be thought to repreſent the <hi>Doctor</hi> as cenſuring his Brethren that did not ſee with his Eyes, but were for having ſome Expoſition accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the Word publickly read; for he has been often heard to ſay "That if the Scripture were but read in our Aſſemblies, either with or without an Expoſition the Inſtitution and Ordinance of God was in a good Meaſure anſwered—And therefore although he vaſtly preferred the Method above mentioned; yet he readily complied with the Cuſtoms of Neighbour-Churches, when he occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally miniſtred unto them.— One Inſtance of his Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion, and becoming all Things to all Men for their ſpiritual Edification may be here told.— Upon the Old Meeting-Houſe (ſo called) in <hi>Boston,</hi> being conſumed by Fire in the Year 1711, about one half of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that uſed to meet in it attended his Miniſtry for many Months; in which Time after he had read his

               </p>
               <p>Another Thing which the Doctor and his People ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of was the Uſe of the Lord's-Prayer, i. e. all the Words of it together as it ſtands in the New-Teſtament, in the Cloſe of his firſt ſhort Prayer before reading the Scriptures—a Cuſtom which many took Offence at in the Beginning, although the Lawfulneſs of it was denied by none.</p>
               <p>As the <hi>Doctor</hi> was intirely of Mr. <hi>Philip Henry</hi>'s Mind about it, I can't repreſent his Sentiments, better than in thoſe Words in the 110th Page of the Life of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Man of God—Which were ſometimes quoted by him, <hi>viz.</hi> "He looked upon the Lord's-Prayer, to be <g ref="char:startq">“</g>not only a <hi>Directory</hi> or <hi>Pattern</hi> for Prayer, but (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Advice of the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> of Divines) proper to be uſed as a <hi>Form,</hi> and accordingly he often uſed it both in Publick and in his Family. And as he thought it was an Error on the one Hand, to lay ſo much Streſs upon it as ſome do, who think no ſolemn Prayer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, nor any ſolemn Ordinance or Adminiſtration of Worſhip compleat without it, and ſo repeat it five or ſix Times, and perhaps oftner at one Meeting; ſo he thought it an Error on the other Hand not to uſe it at all; ſince it is a <hi>Prayer,</hi> a compendious and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive Prayer, and may be of Uſe to us, at leaſt as other <hi>Scripture Prayers,</hi> but he thought it a much greater Error, to be <hi>angry at thoſe who do uſe it,</hi> to judge and cenſure them, and for no other Reaſon to conceive Prejudices againſt them and their Miniſtry.</p>
               <p>A great Strait (ſaith he) poor Miniſters are in, when ſome will not hear them, if they do not uſe the Lord's Prayer, and others will not hear them if they do; what is to be done in this Caſe? We muſt walk according to the Light we have, and approve our ſelves to God, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <p>He was conſtant (in his Turn) in catechiſing the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of his Congregation, and ſpeaking to them concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Souls from their early Days, putting them in Mind of their <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and the holy Bonds they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thereby to be the Lord's, and in this Way to bring them on to an <hi>early Recognition</hi> of theſe Bonds, if it might pleaſe God to impreſs their tender Hearts betimes. —At theſe Exerciſes he uſed his ſingular Gift of inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating and inculcating the Truths and Duties of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity by putting Queſtions and laying hold on the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren's Anſwers, and giving ſuch Advices and Warnings as he thought needful.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as they were grown up to Years of Diſcretion, he urged upon them the publick Renewal of their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmal Covenant— When any of them entred into the Marriage-State, he failed not to viſit and counſel them on this Head; and it has been thought by ſome that he exceeded in his Compulſions to fill the Houſe and Table of the Lord.</p>
               <p>It muſt be owned, the Doctor was for a freer Admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the Lord's-Supper than ſome of his Brethren, but far, very far from approving <hi>general Admiſſions,</hi> or even of thinking that all that is neceſſary thereunto, is a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency of Knowledge, and Orderlineſs of Converſation. I find ſome of his Thoughts on this Head, in a private Letter to a Friend, "I think more is neceſſary both in <hi>Foro Eccleſiae et Conſcientiae;</hi> before Man there ſhould be a credible Profeſſion of Repentance and Faith, with ſerious Purpoſes and Promiſes by the Grace of God of New Obedience: To all which the Perſon ſhould have the Anſwer of a good Conſcience, his Heart not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning him — So in the Beginning of the Goſpel they came confeſſing their Sins, ſorrowing for them, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing to forſake them— I very much queſtion whether there would be nigh ſo much Holineſs in our Churches,
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:006434_0199_1028EC69C2C6FBB8"/>were our Admiſſions to be general as there now is. The Table of the Lord ſhould, and does indeed lie open to all, the People are earneſtly invited to it, as well as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to prepare for it, no Inquiſition is or ſhould be ſet up over their Conſciences, though they are admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to look to their Sincerity before God, and the beſt Signs of that are laid before them, for their Aſſiſtance; only the Scandalous are reſtrained from coming: Others are encouraged, if they can but profeſs in private to their Paſtors a ſerious Thoughtfulneſs and Concern for their Souls, and a better Life, and a Reſolution by the Grace of God for a Life of Obedience to God in ſecret and in publick.—As to publick <hi>Relations</hi> in the Churches of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences it is an human Invention." Yet I would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, the <hi>Doctor</hi> was a great Friend to Confeſſions of Faith, and the Publication of them too on ſpecial Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, but then he would always have Men at Liberty to draught their own, and not be obliged to ſubſcribe the Words of others.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Doctor</hi> as became a vigilant Overſeer made fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Viſits to the ſeveral Families of his Charge, not only <hi>common</hi> and <hi>civil</hi> to cultivate Friendſhip and Good Will, but proper <hi>Paſtoral</hi> Ones to enquire into and know their State and Circumſtances in Order to treat them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greably, wiſely and faithfully, and that he might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter adapt his publick Exerciſes, and give to every one their Portion in due Seaſon.</p>
               <p>He made Conſcience of viſiting the Poor as well as the Rich (eſpecially in their Afflictions) inſtructing, adviſing, admoniſhing and comforting as he ſaw Occaſion: And this he did Night and Day as long as his Strength laſted, and oftentimes to the no ſmall Hazard of his Health and Life.</p>
               <p>And when he gave Viſits to any of his Congregation or received Viſits from them (or other his Friends) he ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally and generouſly beſtowed Books of Piety on them, either his own Sermons, or the Publications of others.— When he was called to miniſter to the Souls of the Poor
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:006434_0200_1028EC6CEF978478"/>at their own Dwellings, he ordinarily enquired of their bodily Wants, which were ſoon ſupplyed either by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or charitable Friends to whom he inſtantly applyed on their Behalf.</p>
               <p>His Prayers over ſick and dying Ones, were not only very affectionate and fervent, but alſo moſt inſtructive and edifying—By a Train of excellent Thoughts he led them into the Knowledge of Sin and Duty, of God and Chriſt, and from Earth to Heaven.<note n="†" place="bottom">Some of the Members (I might ſay Miniſters) of the Church of <hi>England</hi> have declared themſelves more raiſed and edified by them than by all the devout and pious Forms of their own Church.</note>
               </p>
               <p>When he could not conveniently viſit his People or other his Friends in diſtant Places, he ſent his Thoughts to them in Writing, ſuted to the various Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences he heard they were under—A few<note n="*" place="bottom">Alas, that ſo few are found; for he ſeldom kept Copies of his familiar Letters. A large and valuable Collection of them might be obtained if ſought for, equally entertaining with thoſe that follow.</note> of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies which are found, and which are found, and which exhibit the bright Image of his Mind, the Reader ſhall be entertained withal after I have juſt added a Word or two (for a Cloſe to this Chapter) on his gentlemanly Carriage and Behaviour, and other <hi>Homiletical</hi> Virtues which adorned him, and were ſo conſpicuous to all he converſed with.—He was a good Maſter of Addreſs, and carried all the Politeneſs of a Court about him.— And as he treated Mankind of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Degrees and Ranks with a Civility, Courteſy, Affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, Complaiſance and Candor ſcarce to be equalled. So all but the Baſe and Mean ſhowed him an high De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Reſpect and Reverence, Love and Affection.— Particularly Men of Figure and Parts of our own Nation and Foreigners, whom he failed not to viſit upon their coming among us, greatly valued and admired him.</p>
               <p>It has been ſaid (perhaps not without ſome ſeeming Grounds for it) that he ſometimes went too far in comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Strains both in Word and Writing—but if he did, I am perſwaded ſuch Flights took their Riſe rather from
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:006434_0201_1028EC6E8518C388"/>an Exuberance or Excreſcence (if the Phraſe be allowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) of the before-mentioned homiletical Virtues, and a too high Complacency in the appearing Excellencies of others, than from faulty Inſincerity and deſigned Flattery in the Time of it.—As he took a ſincere Pleaſure in the Gifts of others, and had a natural Proneneſs to think fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably of all Men, and conſtrued every Thing in the moſt candid Senſe, it is not much to be wondered at if he ſometimes exceeded in his Expreſſions.—And it is to be lamented that ſome have ſwollen with Pride, and made an ill Uſe of the Doctor's high Eſteem and good Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of them.</p>

                        <salute>Madam,</salute>

                     <p>Since I have not the Opportunity of ſeeing you in your great Sorrows, I take Leave this Way to expreſs my deep Sympathy with you in them.</p>
                     <p>It muſt needs be a very extraordinary Diſtreſs you have been under, and ſtill are, in the Death of an Huſband, who was one of the lovelieſt and beſt of Men; and the uncommon Circumſtances you have been under in his Sickneſs, and ſtill are in ſince his Deceaſe; denied the Preſence and Aſſiſtance of your Friends and Conveniences of your own Houſe, looks very deſolate to us, and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs feels ſo to you.</p>
                     <p>But I truſt you have the gracious Preſence of a good God with you, who is all-ſufficient and abundantly able to ſupport and comfort you. If you ſeek to him, and truſt in him, though you are deſolate you ſhall not be forſaken. I am not alone, ſaid our Saviour, when he bare our Sorrows and carried our Griefs, for the Father is with me.—If God be with you, and you keep with him, humbling your Soul before him, and crying to him for
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:006434_0203_1028EC76A38C4FB0"/>Grace to help you in this Time of Need; you will not need the poor Help your Friends might miniſter to you. O may he take you near to himſelf, into a happy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him, in this dark Hour, and give you Light in the comforting Senſe of his Peace and pardoning Mercy, and your Intereſt in his Love through Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>The Town is put into Mourning with you. No Man was more univerſally eſteemed and loved than Mr. <hi>G</hi>— was, and very deſervedly; and no one has died among us more lamented. If it might eaſe you to have many ſhare with you in your Bereavement, your Burden would be lightned.</p>
                     <p>The Will of God is done; and we are taught to ſay and pray, Father in Heaven, thy Will be done.— God made him all that he was to you and his Friends; and what he gave he has taken away; and we muſt fall down and worſhip him, and bleſs his Name.</p>
                     <p>It is rare to find a Man ſo knowing and humble, wiſe and modeſt, meek and good, grave and pleaſant, upright and faithful, pious and devout: But let us think of all thoſe Things that were lovely in him, every Virtue and every Praiſe, and deſire to live ſuch ourſelves, the few Days that remain unto us here on Earth, and to follow him to a better Life.</p>
                     <p>No Wonder he died in Peace and Calm, who ever lived in it, from the ruling Principles, not of Philoſophy only, but of pure Religion. His ſilent, even, ſteady Walk with God, is much to be emulated and imitated. I only wiſh your Soul may be formed more and more, by what you have ſeen of his, and ſo your Manner of Life; and that the like Peace of God, which ruled and kept his Heart, may keep your's through Jeſus Chriſt.— Let your Grief too be now moderated and governed by the Rules of Chriſtianity, as you may think he would mourn, were he in your Caſe; and may his Death quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken you ſo in living to God, and getting ready for your own; that you may have an happy Meeting again, and an endleſs Life of Love and Joy, in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:006434_0204_1028EC79D0072E10"/>of Chriſt, and in the Glory of his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>

O ſeek for your Soul, an Eſpouſal to Chriſt, as a chaſte Virgin; ſubmit to his Propoſals of Grace, his Tender of himſelf to you in an everlaſting Covenant: Seek the Spirit of Grace and Supplication, for your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and Support, the Spirit of Prayer and Communion with God therein, will make up abundantly for any world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Loſs; God knows how to turn theſe into our beſt Gains; our Afflictions ſanctified are in the End among our choiceſt Mercies.—God grant you therefore this Mercy, to be Matter of everlaſting Praiſe and Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving from you in the Concluſion.</p>

               <p>Sir, Will your E—y prolong your Grief forever? And at the End of Years call us ſtill to mourn on with you? And can you think any one but your <hi>J—n</hi> will keep Pace and Length with you?—How much do you honour ſome of us to think we can and will?

Your moſt reverend Father was the Man whom I have honoured and reverenced from my Youth above any one of our own Times, whomſoever. It was therefore a great Pleaſure to me, when I heard his Son was appointed by the King to be our Governor. The Fame of his Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Moderation raiſed our Expectations very high. But the unhappy Controverſy about the Twenty-third Inſtruction deprived us of the Happineſs we had promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our ſelves in him.—I heartily wiſh that the next Governor may not inſiſt on his Inſtructions, to the Length that Governor <hi>Burnet</hi> did. It hurt his generous Soul to live in ſuch a Wrangle and Oppoſition, and his great Heart felt what it would not own. O might he have condeſcended a little to have made himſelf and us eaſy in a Point or two! What might he not have had from us, and we found in him! He thought he could have bowed or broken us with his Reſolution, but found it not to be done. The ſame Men that once ran the Riſque of our Charter (to me invaluable) were ready as we ſee, to run it again. What the Court will do with us, the next Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Parliament, I know not. Might I hope to prevail with the late Governour's Friends, I would ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate them not to appear againſt our Charter. I have no Right, Sir, to aſk this Favour from you, neither know I your Intereſt or Reſentments, yet I cannot forbear lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before you my Prayers and Fears. It may look vain in me, it may be, to ſay, how much I honoured and loved your Brother, and wiſhed the beſt of Bleſſings on his Children; I wiſh the ſame to all the Poſterity of the admirable Man, your Father. The few that know me,
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:006434_0213_1028EC952C2E0F00"/>know it. The incloſed Account of your Brother's Death, done at the Requeſt of Mr. Secretary, will teſtify it. You will ſuffer me therefore to condole with you, and ſubſcribe my ſelf,</p>

                  <hi>Boſton,</hi> Sept. 8. 1729.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Town</hi> was exceedingly ſurprized this Morning, with the ſad News of the Death of his Excellency our <hi>Governor,</hi> WILLIAM BURNETT, <abbr>Eſq</abbr>
               </p>
               <p>He had been very ill all the Week paſt, but on <hi>Friday</hi> the Symptoms grew threatning; after which he very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle recovered any Uſe of his Underſtanding.</p>
               <p>He expired about eleven of the Clock, the Lord's Day Night; a teaching and monitory Inſtance to us of the Vanity of human Life and Greatneſs. For it is but a few Months ſince he was received here with all poſſible Demonſtrations of publick Joy; in the Meridian of Life, and in his full Strength; and now we are ſuddenly called to attend him with publick and ſolemn Mourning to his Grave.</p>
               <p>He was the eldeſt Son of the late right reverend and learned GILBERT BERNETT, Lord Biſhop of <hi>Sarum;</hi> among the Divines, States Men, and Patriots of the laſt Age, a moſt ſhining <hi>Character.</hi> In <hi>Body,</hi> he was very much the Image of his noble Father, and in <hi>Soul,</hi> he was Heir of his Learning, Juſtice and Moderation.</p>
               <p>He was born at the <hi>Hague</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> in <hi>March</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the Revolution 1688, and named <hi>William,</hi> after the illuſtrious PRINCE OF ORANGE, who condeſcended to ſtand his <hi>God Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The great Part which his <hi>Father</hi> had in the Acceſſion of that PRINCE to the <hi>Britiſh Throne,</hi> and afterward in the Succeſſion of the illuſtrious Houſe of <hi>Hanover,</hi> was rewarded to this worthy <hi>Son</hi> by King GEORGE the Firſt, who named him Governor of <hi>New York</hi> and <hi>Jerſies;</hi>
                  <pb n="197" facs="unknown:006434_0214_1028EC96DF522870"/>and by his preſent MAJESTY, who appointed him over the Provinces of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay</hi> and <hi>New Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was pleaſant to ſee a Gentleman in the Chair over us, who was allowed by all to be <hi>chief</hi> for Knowledge and Learning, for bright and quick Parts, for Diſcerning and Judgment, for true Eloquence, both in ſpeaking and writing, with the greateſt Facility; for a noble Genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity and Largeneſs of Heart, for hating Covetouſneſs and diſdaining a Bribe, for Temperance, and for Humanity, Courteſy and Affability.</p>
               <p>At the ſame Time his invincible Conſtancy and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, in what he judged due to the KING'S Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and his own Honour, ſurmounted all Regards to his own private Intereſt and Gain.</p>
               <p>He has left three <hi>Children,</hi> two Sons and a Daughter; for whom we can wiſh nothing better, than that they may all inherit the <hi>Powers</hi> of their Father, the <hi>Virtues</hi> of their Grandfather, and the high <hi>Favour</hi> of a gracious GOD and <hi>King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His <hi>Library,</hi> which was his chief Delight and Pride, is one of the nobleſt and richeſt <hi>Collections</hi> that <hi>America</hi> has ſeen.</p>
               <p>We are very happy in the Preſence of the Honourable WILLIAM DUMMER, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> our Lieut. Governor; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the Chair which he ſo lately reſigned to Governor BURNETT; in whoſe wiſe and juſt Adminiſtration we have been already happy, and from whom we are ſure of all the Good that is within the Compaſs of his Power."</p>

<pb n="198" facs="unknown:006434_0215_1028EC9C9C8210B0"/>and conſolatory <hi>Letter</hi> to her was juſt come to Hand, and ſo I became a Sharer in the Conſolation in my Mourning, which is not yet put off, and in the Pleaſure which every one muſt have that reads what you write. There is no <hi>School,</hi> I ſee like that of <hi>Affliction</hi> for the brightning as well as ſanctifying our Powers, and it is the Way of Heaven to ſublimate Souls by paſſing them of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten through the Fire. Leaving therefore the happy Buildings for Science and Religion on the <hi>Left</hi> of your humbler Roof, give me leave to come to <hi>you</hi> for true Learning and Inſtruction.</p>
                     <p>You have been taught of God in a courſe of long fiery Trial, which yet has been but his fatherly Chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and under the kind Conſtraint of his Love and Grace have willingly learnt of him how to endure and improve Afflictions. And why has God taught you, but that you ſhould teach others? or why has he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted you in all your Tribulations, but that you may comfort them that are in Trouble, by <hi>the Comfort where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with you are comforted of God?</hi>—You certainly do well not to neglect the <hi>Gift</hi> you have received by the Hand of God <hi>laid on you,</hi> which no other <hi>laying on of Hands</hi> could give. Are we not bound, if God has made us ſpiritually rich, to diſtribute of <hi>his Treaſures</hi> to the Souls of our dear Friends, and his Children in their Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities? Freely you have received, and you freely give. So God has enriched you to all Bountifulneſs, and given you an Heart and Hand, in a ſingular and eminent Way to diſperſe abroad;—and your Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs endureth for ever. God multiply your Seed ſown, and encreaſe theſe Fruits of your Righteouſneſs, which are abundant alſo by many Thankſgivings to God; and by their Prayers for you who love and honour you for the exceeding Grace of God in you.</p>
                     <p>"After ye were illuminated, ſays the <hi>Apostle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> ye endured <hi>a great Fight of Afflictions.</hi> O what a Mercy is it to have firſt a Principle of heavenly Grace and Wiſdom rooted in our Hearts, before we
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:006434_0216_1028EC9F78B50F30"/>are exerciſed with ſore Afflictions, and of long Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance! How is ſuch a Soul honoured of God and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led forth like another <hi>Job</hi> or <hi>Paul,</hi> in their Weakneſs and in the Infirmity of their Fleſh to diſplay the Power of the Grace of God, before the Eyes of admiring An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Saints, and to the Confuſion of the Enemy and Avenger! "Haſt thou conſidered by Servant <hi>Job</hi> that there is none like him in all the Earth? Go ſmite his Body as thou wilt, and ſee if it be not thus.— And why was the thorn ſtuck deep into St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Fleſh, but for the ſame Reaſon? And therefore it was not removed at his Prayer, but he received that Anſwer from the Lord "My Grace is ſufficient for you for my Strength is made perfect in Weakneſs. Well might he <hi>glory in his Infirmities,</hi> when the <hi>Power of Christ</hi> thus reſted on him, and that it might do ſo more and more; For when we are Weak then are we Strong, and even <hi>Women</hi> out of Weakneſs are made ſtronger than Men, when God pleaſes.</p>
                     <p>"If ye <hi>endure</hi> Chaſtning, God dealeth with you as with <hi>Sons.</hi> See <hi>Madam,</hi> the clear Evidence of your Adoption in Chriſt, in your Conformity to Him, the Captain of your Salvation, made perfect through Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; God helps you to endure his Chaſtnings with a <hi>filial</hi> Spirit: And it is a certain Proof of a <hi>Father's</hi> Heart in God toward you, that he has given you the Heart of a <hi>Child</hi> towards him.

                     <p>I am perſwaded, <hi>Madam,</hi> that as God has glorified his Grace in you in the paſt Hours of your great Pains, ſo he will again, and more and more help you to glorify him, unto the <hi>finiſhing your Courſe with Joy.</hi> "He is able to make <hi>all Grace</hi> to abound to you, and to give you an <hi>Alſufficiency in all Things;</hi> even to ſtrengthen you with Might, by his Spirit, in your inward Man, unto <hi>all Patience and Long-ſuffering with Joyfulneſs.</hi> O what a Promiſe is that! which who can take the Height or Length of! but he is faithful who has ſaid it, and able to perform it in you. You have found him both able and ready, when you have been preſſed out of Meaſure, above Strength. You do well to communicate to your dear afflicted Friends, your own bleſſed Experiences, for their Direction and Conſolation. You have more Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding than all your Teachers; for none teacheth like God, and there is no Learning like that by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And may your Conſolations abound with your Sufferings, while you are afflicted for the Conſolation and Salvation of others!</p>
                     <p>My dear Spouſe is often ſpeaking of you, and always with the higheſt Eſteem—Pray for us, who have lately had the Sorrow of burying a dear <hi>Child,</hi> that bore ſome Image and faint Ray of that ſhining Grace, and thoſe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior Gifts which irradiate <hi>You,</hi> and ſcatter all your Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.—May Grace, Mercy and Peace be multiplied to you, and to <hi>him</hi> who is your other own Soul, from God the Father, and from our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

                     <p>Your charming Letter of the 16th Inſtant, full of
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:006434_0218_1028DABBC97CB218"/>Grace and Gratitude, gave me ſuch Delight, and I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade my ſelf will give the pious Mr. <hi>H—n</hi> as much, that I have ventured without your Leave to ſend him the <hi>Original,</hi> taking a Copy for my ſelf.—What Return could be made him like this <hi>Firſt-fruit</hi> of his Bounty to us? and give me leave to add, from what End of the Earth could he have had the <hi>like?</hi> or where can either his Piety or good Senſe more have found its Match?—He is paid in his own Coin, <hi>Sterling.</hi> You have paid for me as well as for your ſelf, and if your ſuperior holy Lines rival me in his Heart, and give you the higheſt Seat in his Eſteem and Love, as they well may, I ſhall heartily rejoice in your Conqueſt.—You merit from the Lovers of Chriſt and Holineſs (though from him to you all is free and undeſerved Grace) the flow of their Affections and Benignity.</p>
                     <p>I am ſorry you ſeem ſo ſtruck with Wonder at the late, too late, Teſtimonies of a great Eſteem and Regard, on the account of your Worth and Wants. It is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am ſo late in my particular Knowledge of them, though a general Knowledge I might have before.</p>
                     <p>You know it was your Letter to my good Neighbour, on the Death of her Brother, that gave me my firſt and full Intelligence.—It is your own Humility, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer low thoughts of me, that muſt account for your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Surprize.—This Humility let us cheriſh in one another, and ceaſe our Compliments, however well meant.—Forgive therefore and guard againſt what I have already written, as I forgive thoſe in your laſt, and if we can any way miniſter to one another's Conſolation, let it ſuffice.—The <hi>Bluſh</hi> which naturally belongs to your Sex, muſt now belong to me, a <hi>Scholar</hi> and <hi>Minister,</hi> fifteen Years Older than you are, and yet not able to out-teach or out-write you! But I have not been kept in <hi>School</hi> like you, and under the <hi>Rod,</hi> and Truant like have loſt many a Day.—You <hi>have more Understanding than your Teachers,</hi> for <hi>God's Commandments are ever with you. Unleſs his Law had been your Delight you had periſhed in
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:006434_0219_1028ECA84EE71BF8"/>Your Affliction.</hi> This is your Comfort under them that <hi>his Word is quickning to you.</hi> You remember it Night and Day, therefore you have Hope.—And may you always abound more and more in all Joy and Peace in Believing, through the Power of the Holy Ghoſt.— <hi>Out of Weakneſs</hi> may you be made ſtronger and ſtronger through the Power of <hi>Faith,</hi> as the Holy <hi>Women</hi> have been who belonged to the noble Army of Martyrs.</p>
                     <p>It is indeed <hi>more Bleſſed</hi> to give than to receive, but not than to receive as you do, through Grace.—The Bleſſedneſs lies in the <hi>Manner</hi> of giving and receiving, not in the Thing. There are who receive in a <hi>more holy ſpiritual Manner</hi> than the Giver gives, and then the Bleſſedneſs belongs to the Receiver. Mr. <hi>H—n</hi> and <hi>you</hi> are one, I hope in the true Bleſſedneſs, give and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive with the ſame Spirit of Grace, which is calculated and given for a like <hi>amiable</hi> Exerciſe in a very different outward Condition. I ſpeak to encourage and animate you to <hi>go on</hi> in your Part of the holy Exerciſe. When he receives your's to me he will be animated too, to <hi>abound</hi> more and more.</p>
                     <p>I have given to Mr. <hi>H—n</hi> the Reaſons of my ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you over Sea. He will ſee one Reaſon in your own Inclinations to have wrote to him.—I have ſaved you from the Blame of Forwardneſs which you ſay re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained you, and I hope ſhall have diſpleaſed neither of you. I have parted with the Pleaſure of what I va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued under your own Hand. I have let him know the Days of your <hi>Youth,</hi> your honourable Deſcent, and your <hi>later</hi> Afflictions. I have told him that I mean alſo to honour my Country, and the <hi>Daughters</hi> of my Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to him, but at the ſame Time that he muſt not think theſe <hi>Nightingale</hi> Notes are <hi>common</hi> in our Woods. I have begged his Pardon for <hi>tranſcribing</hi> to you a Part of his gracious Letter, and pleaded it to be for your Conſolation and Edification; and that it became <hi>me</hi> thus to make <hi>him</hi> miniſter <hi>more</hi> to your <hi>Soul</hi> than his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity could to the Needs of the <hi>Body.</hi>—I have
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:006434_0220_1028ECAB3214DCA0"/>prayed him to forgive your <hi>Anti-Prayer,</hi> in wiſhing his Life prolonged 'till he be <hi>dim with Age:</hi> And I have <hi>dared</hi> to join with you in it, with a little <hi>Correction,</hi> from the uſeful Old Age of <hi>Moſes,</hi> whoſe Eyes <hi>were not dim,</hi> nor was he kept a Day too long out of Heaven.</p>
                     <p>But as you ſay of your ſelf, I tranſgreſs the <hi>Limits</hi> of a Letter. I muſt intreat you not to <hi>anſwer</hi> me, leſt I write as <hi>long</hi> again, and be hindred in my Sermons and other Letters.—</p>
                     <p>God give you <hi>Reſpite from Pain</hi> if he ſee it beſt, and ſtrengthen you <hi>with all Might</hi> unto all Patience if Pains <hi>return.</hi> "The God of all Grace, who has called you to his Eternal Glory by Jeſus Chriſt, after you have ſuffered a while, make you perfect; ſtabliſh, ſtrengthen, ſettle you! To him be Glory for ever.</p>

                     <p>I pray God, Sir, that the great Eſtate you are come into, may be ſo far from hindring you in your Way to Heaven, as our Lord has warned us to fear, that on the contrary, it may greatly help you on in your Way thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as he has told us how to make a Friend to our Souls of our earthly Riches, that when we alſo fail (as we certainly muſt within a very little Time, like our Friend before us) we may be received into everlaſting Habitations, and be recompenſed at the Reſurrection of the Juſt.</p>

               <p>The Doctor was married to her, <hi>May</hi> the 6th, 1732, and ſhe lived with him till <hi>April</hi> 24. 1744, when ſhe died after a long Languiſhment, and State of Infancy for moſt of the Year paſt, <hi>Aet.</hi> 72—On the Lord's-Day after her Funeral, he preached a Sermon from thoſe Words in 1 Theſſ. iv. 14. <hi>For if we believe that Jeſus died, and roſe again, even ſo them alſo which ſleep in Jeſus, will God bring with him.</hi>

The Doctor had Iſſue by the firſt of theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women only, viz. a <hi>Son</hi> born <hi>Sept.</hi> 1. 1704, who was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized on the 3d, and named <hi>Benjamin</hi> after his Father.— The Child died on the 18th.— He had two <hi>Daughters</hi> who lived to be married and have Children, viz. <hi>Jane</hi> named after her Mother, who was born <hi>Feb.</hi> 25. 1708. She was married to the Compiler of this Narrative <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt</hi> the 11th 1726, and died <hi>March</hi> 26. 1735— She had four Children, but only one of them ſurvived her, viz. a Son <hi>Samuel,</hi> who died in about a Year and half after her, ſcil. <hi>October</hi> 8. 1736.

               <p>§. His <hi>filial</hi> Piety, Affection and Duty was eminent and known to all his Acquaintance. As he obeyed the Law of his Mother, whom God took from his Head (as has been before noted) about three Years after his Admiſſion into the College; ſo he ever paid all Reſpect and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to his honoured Father, whoſe Life was continued down to the Year 1712. After the Decline of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's wordly Eſtate, he cheerfully afforded him all need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Aſſiſtance, and did every Thing that lay in his Power, to render his Age eaſy and agreeable. He expreſt this his filial Duty not only in kind Words, and tranſient good Deeds, but willingly bound himſelf, with his kind Brother in written Obligations for his comfortable Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port; praying a gracious God to prolong his Life in the Increaſe of his Graces and Conſolations to him. Thus he was the very Reverſe of thoſe <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> whom our Lord taxes and faults for ſaying, <hi>It is</hi> Corban.<note n="†" place="bottom">Mark 7.11.—<hi>Corban</hi> is a <hi>Syriac</hi> Word, and ſignifies <hi>a Gift gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to God.</hi> Expoſitors obſerve, "That although the <hi>Phariſees</hi> did not deny it in plain Terms <q>that Children ought to relieve their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, <g ref="char:startq">“</g> yet they made a vile Exception from it, which if Children <g ref="char:endq">”</g>pleaſed, might render it void.</q>—A good round Gift to the Temple anſwered all filial Obligations for ever—Hence covetous and graceleſs Children oftimes denied their aged and reduced Parents the Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances they needed.

<pb n="211" facs="unknown:006434_0228_1028ECC172D175E0"/>I dare not ſay, he did not exceed ſometimes in Point of Fondneſs and Solicitude for his Children. Their Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare and Happineſs lay on his Mind continually: But then his firſt and chief Study and Care was to form them to Virtue, and train them up in the Love and Fear of the great God: For this he prayed, wreſtled, and ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized, and uſed all ſutable Means that a glorious Chriſt might take an early Poſſeſſion of them.</p>
               <p>From meer Infants, he endeavoured to <hi>train them up in the Way they ſhould go:</hi>

               <p>And he lived (as he thought) to perceive the Grace of God in them both—in his eldeſt Daughter early and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently—and in his youngeſt <hi>many Months,</hi> if not Years, before ſhe died.

               <p>I find among other Particulars recorded by him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his youngeſt Daughter <hi>Abigail,</hi> the following, <hi>viz.</hi> "She gave her ſelf to <hi>Reading</hi> from her Childhood, and ſoon to <hi>Writing.</hi> She wanted not a Taſte for what was excellent in Books, more eſpecially of a Poetical Turn or Reliſh, which ſoon appeared to be her favourite Turn.

               <p>But a gracious God was pleaſed ſome Years after, to ſet this her Miſconduct in ſuch a <hi>glaring</hi> Light, as threw her at the Foot of ſovereign Grace and Mercy, for Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation and deep Repentance, Renovation and Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>

               <p>I was preſent, and prayed with her while dying, and well remember when her Father ſpake to her (a few Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments before ſhe breathed out her Soul) of the holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels being the Convoy of happy Spirits—She made an Effort to utter ſome Lines of one of Dr. <hi>Watts</hi>'s Hymns (moſt, if not all of them were long before treaſured in her Memory)

               <p>My Prayer for you is that a double Portion of that good Spirit which adorned and ſanctified your gracious Mother and has reſted on your—Father and his Father, may be your Inheritance.</p>

               <p>Upon his Removal from his Houſe in <hi>King-Street</hi> to his new-built Houſe in <hi>Brattle-Street,</hi> May 1715, he wrote this Meditation, "It was a very pleaſing and inſtructive Sight once to me in a far diſtant Land, where a Perſon of Honour and Riches was building a ſtately Houſe for himſelf and his Family, but at once he took off the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to build himſelf a Vault or Tomb to be buried in. It becomes us ever to keep in Mind, and lay to Heart, the Remove that we muſt ſoon make to our Grave.— A convenient Houſe, and eaſy Bed, and agreeable Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, are among the valuable Comforts of this Life. When we are building to our ſelves <hi>pleaſant</hi> Houſes to live in, we ſhould all the while be thinking of the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Houſe or Place, where our Bodies will ſhortly be laid: And when we enter into our <hi>new Habitations,</hi> or after we are <hi>ſettled</hi> in them, the ſame Thought muſt ſtill abide with us. We muſt not entertain a Thought of living long; and muſt be willing and ready to go, and to leave our new-built Houſes as ſoon as God calls us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. They are only to be uſed as <hi>Accommodations</hi> for us in the Way unto an <hi>everlasting Habitation</hi> and Houſe eternal.— We may not ſet too much by an Houſe on Earth, but ought to raiſe our Affections to Things above, &amp;c.—We ought to ſerve God in our Houſes—This was <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s holy Reſolution, <hi>As for me and my Houſe, we
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:006434_0236_1028ECDB22621BD8"/>will ſerve the Lord!</hi> And this was <hi>David</hi>'s, Pſal. 101. <hi>I will walk within my Houſe with a perfect Heart,</hi> &amp;c. Surely we ought, under the outward Smiles of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon us, to be renewing the Conſecration of our ſelves and all that we have to the Service of God; we ought like <hi>Abraham,</hi> to charge our Houſholds and our Children after us to keep the Way of the Lord. We ought to <hi>worſhip</hi> God in ſecret, in our Cloſets, and we ought every Day to pray to, and praiſe him in our Families: We ought to read his holy Word, and meditate on his Law, and teach it diligently to our Children, and talk of it when we ſet in our Houſe, when we lay down, &amp;c. Thus we muſt write as it were upon the Poſts of our Houſe, and our Gates, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.7, 9.—Our Houſes ſhould be <hi>Bethels,</hi> little Churches for the Practice of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, and the Exerciſes of Devotion therein, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle's <hi>Salutation</hi> may reach us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.5. <hi>Greet the Church in their Houſe.</hi> With theſe and ſuch like Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I can truly ſay, I have been building, and would now enter into my new and pleaſant Habitation: May they abide and dwell always in my Soul, that thus I may there dwell the few remaining Days of my frail Life."</p>
               <p>As he wrote and printed Sermons, Meditations and Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters on the great Earthquake in the Year 1727, ſo I find him making the following Record of that which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened on <hi>June</hi> 3d. 1744.</p>
               <p>"In the Midſt of Singing, in the Morning Exerciſe, being the Lord's-Day of our holy Communion, a great Shock of an Earthquake terrified the Congregation, and broke off the Worſhip; all roſe up, many ran out of the Houſe, Women and Children cried out, &amp;c.— But it pleaſed God to enable me to riſe up and take the Pulpit, and with great Compoſure and Sedateneſs, and an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Flow of ready Words to ſtill and quiet the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly; who all earneſtly liſtned to me, and I went on and finiſhed the Exerciſes, and adminiſtred the Sacrament of the Lord's-Supper with the greateſt Solemnity, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, Fulneſs and Brevity I had ever experienced. — <hi>Laus Deo.</hi>

               <p>On <hi>Dec.</hi> 31ſt 1743. He writes in his Almanack,</p>
               <p>"I thank God, I have been enabled to go through a World of Work ſince Mr. <hi>Cooper</hi>'s Death; and now am preparing for a ſorrowful New-Year's-Day; and if it be my dying, Year, I commit my Soul, and the Flock, to the great Shepherd—the everlaſting Father."</p>
               <p>Before I finiſh theſe Sections, I cannot but in Juſtice mention the high Regard, the <hi>Doctor</hi> paid to the <hi>Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Sabbath</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Sint Occuli, manuſque Veſtrae

               <p>Moſt Company gave him Uneaſineſs and Diſturbance on the Lord's Day.—He uſed to invite and admit Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons (for Conference in the Evening) when he firſt ſettled in <hi>Boſton,</hi> but found ſuch Inconveniences attending it, that he was obliged to deſire his Friends to viſit him at other Times.</p>
               <p>§. He paſſed through many fore Trials and Temptations in the ſeveral Stages of Life (ſome of which have been already recorded in this Narrative) I ſhall only curſorily
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:006434_0238_1028ECDE4DB62D78"/>mention a few more of them. He ſometimes ſuffered by the <hi>Tongues</hi> and <hi>Pens</hi> of angry and unreaſonable Men for his zealous Eſſays to ſerve the beſt Intereſts of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and the Churches of Chriſt.<note n="†" place="bottom">Many Libels (fraught with Scorn, Contempt, and Reproach of Lies) were thrown into his Yard and Garden from Time to Time.</note> Good Men alſo of narrow and contracted Spirits, ill treated him on Account of his Catholiciſm. Under ſuch petty Perſecutions he was an Example of Patience, and inſtead of revenging Injuries (when it was in his Power) he laid himſelf out to do all the Kindneſſes he could to his Adverſaries. This might be ſhown in numerous Inſtances.<note n="*" place="bottom">I mean not to inſinuate here, that the Doctor was not ſometimes ſudden and high in his Reſentments of real and apprehended Injuries— for his natural Temper was quick and haſty, and he had the Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as well as Sanctity of an <hi>Elijah.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>There have been Times wherein he has been in ſtrait Circumſtances, and met with moſt grievous Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in worldly Matters, and this too after his Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had been long riſing; and ſome peculiar Family-Afflictions lay heavy upon him, and bruiſed the <hi>Heel</hi> of his Life. But all that ſeems further needful to be added under this Head, is a Record of his Behaviour under God's Viſitations of him by Sickneſs, and calling for the precious Lives of ſuch as were dear to him.</p>
               <p>Since my Acquaintance with him, he was divers Times viſited with acute and threatning Maladies, and had the Sentence of Death within himſelf— But with what Conſtancy and Serenity, Tranquility and Peace, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Reſignations to the divine Will, and Humiliation under the Hand of God, and unſhaken Hope and Truſt in his great Saviour, were they all entertained?— He ſpake to his Friends that viſited him in the Language and Spirit of <hi>David, "I have ſeen an End of all Perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>§. His Graces were alſo tried in the often Sickneſſes and Deaths of his loved Wives, Children, Grand-Children, &amp;c.— of which the Reader has had ſome Notices al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. His Behaviour, and writing on theſe Occaſions follows.</p>
               <p>All may ſee and read his truly Chriſtian Deportment under the Death of his Daughter <hi>Turell</hi> in the Sermons, &amp;c. publiſhed to the World.</p>
               <p>On the Sickneſs and Death of a dear Grandſon, he writes,</p>
               <p>"The Lord prepare us for his holy Will, and the Child for his everlaſting Mercies. Help us by Faith to reſign and commit it, <hi>Amen;</hi> and yet ſpare it to us, if it may be for his Glory.</p>
               <p>I am your Father and Brother in Tribulation, and in the Kingdom and Patience of Jeſus Chriſt. Your Love and Affection, will I think, be my higheſt and only Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, under the paſt breaking Bereavements, after the Conſolations of the Grace and Spirit of Chriſt, which are internal and ſanctifying. I am going from you very ſoon. O might I no more be called to bury Children, but as God will, if it may be for his Glory. Pray for me, for I am weak! Lord, help me, for I am broken! So commending you to the Love, Grace and Conſolation of your Father in Heaven, I remain your ſecond unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy earthly Father &amp;c."</p>
               <p>Immediately after the Death of his Daughter <hi>Dennie,</hi> he wrote theſe Words.</p>
               <p>"Father thy Will be done! Thy Name be ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Glorify thy Grace in me, that I may glorify thee.— Who am I Lord, and what is my Father's Houſe, that thou haſt brought me hitherto.—My <hi>Turell</hi> died in Fear, who never offended any one, and if ſhe knew her own Heart, had a Thouſand Times given herſelf to God.

               <p>Scarce any Thing touched the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s Soul more nearly than the ſudden Death of his dear <hi>Colleague,</hi> the Rev. Mr. <hi>William Cooper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When he was lying under the deadly Symptoms of a <hi>Lethargy,</hi> the Doctor made and wrote his Supplications to Heaven for his precious Life, in the Cloſe of a Sermon preached<note n="*" place="bottom">From Acts 9.34. Eneas <hi>Jeſus Chriſt maketh thee whole.</hi>
                     <p>It has been obſerved to me, by ſome or the moſt intelligent of his Congregation "that under, and after the heavy and repeated Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities and Sorrows laid upon him in later Times, he appeared more animated, enlivened and brightned in his Publick Exerciſes.</p>

The Humours long reſting in my Feet, have taken a ſudden Turn up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to my Breaſt; and whether I ſhall be able on the Verge of <hi>Seventy-four,</hi> tender and aſthmatick from my Youth up, to ſerve the Flock to whom I have not failed yet in my weekly Miniſtrations; or to ſerve my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try again by my late failing Correſpondence with you and others, is with the God of my Life.</p>
               <p>The laſt Effort I have made for the Service of my Country and Nation, and the Churches here, and with you, and we are one in CHRIST; is in the incloſed Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Honourable Sir PETER WARREN, which I have lately forwarded to him, and if he have not receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, I leave it open for your Reading, and putting a Seal to it; and if you think it of Importance enough to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with him upon it, and ſtrengthen his Hand in God, by your generous chriſtian Manner of Addreſs, I hope it may be of publick Advantage to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Kingdom and Provinces, the Religion of JESUS which you have been ever and highly ſerving; and may you live on to ſerve by the Will of God.</p>
               <p>Salute from me our honoured Friend Mr. <hi>Palmer,</hi> to whom I even wiſh to have communicated every worthy Endeavour for publick Benefit to State or Church: And when you ſee Dr. <hi>Watts</hi> or Dr. <hi>Guiſe,</hi> ſalute them from me; to whom I have not failed to write, if the <hi>Enemy</hi> do not intercept, <hi>&amp;c. &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>I Had (with no ſmall Labour) prepared a large Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix to the foregoing Narrative, containing many cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and entertaining Pieces in <hi>Proſe</hi> and <hi>Verſe</hi> (which I laid by in my Searches and Reſearches, among the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's Papers) ſome of which I found would not ſtand well under either of the Ten Chapters—And others came too late to Hand to be inſerted in their proper Places. But—Theſe muſt not lie buried for Want of ſufficient Subſcriptions and Encouragement to the Undertakers; and by Reaſon the Book's already ſwelling to a Bulk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Expectation and DESIRE OF SOME of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers.</p>
            <p>I would add concerning the Narrative it ſelf "That upon a Review, I have diſcerned a few Miſtakes and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Inconſiſtences (and doubtleſs my Readers will ſee more) <hi>ſcil.</hi> In the Doctor's Character of Mrs. <hi>Rowe,</hi> P. 40. he ſays, <hi>"She had only her Mother Tongue,"</hi> I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to think, that even when the <hi>Doctor</hi> was acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with her, ſhe had Knowledge in the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> Languages, although he was ignorant of it to the Day of her Death,<note n="*" place="bottom">For in like Words he gives her Character in a publick Print of <hi>April</hi> 28. 1737, upon the News of her Deceaſe.</note> not only from what the worthy Author of her Life ſays, P. 20. but alſo from what we read in Dr. <hi>Watts</hi>'s Preface to his <hi>Horae Lyricae</hi> written 1709, wherein he mentions his Obligations to her for directing him to ſome <hi>foreign</hi> Authors.—And this (by the Way) ſhews that one may be intimately acquainted with a Perſon, and yet remain ignorant of <hi>ſome</hi> of their Accompliſhments and Circumſtances of Life, as I hint in my <hi>Marginal Note,</hi> Page ibid:—My ſhort Note on Mr. <hi>Henry Groves</hi>'s Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with Mrs. <hi>Rowe,</hi> might have been ſpared; for if it be the ſame Gentleman whoſe Poem ſtands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Dr. <hi>Watts</hi>'s <hi>Horae Lyricae,</hi> dated 1706, it is highly probable he might have had a long Acquaintance with the Lady; but be it ever ſo long my Remarks on his denying the Story <hi>ſtand good.</hi>
