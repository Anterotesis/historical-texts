            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>WHat? And ſo Early, ſuch Unhappy Men and Things <hi>Creep</hi> into the Churches of God! It ſeems Chriſtian Churches cannot Eaſily be too much cautioned againſt <hi>Sly-Adverſaries,</hi> and <hi>Swift-Apoſtaſies.</hi> OURS, I am ſure, are <hi>Old</hi> enough to be ſo; In Age gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond thoſe who were now immediately Written to. And it is to be done, as with a mighty Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from a flaming Mountain!</p>
            <p>I take the Writer of this Epiſtle, to be, not that <hi>Jude</hi> the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> who was in the Syriack Dialect called <hi>Thaddaeus,</hi> and from the Place to which he belong'd, <hi>Lebbaeus:</hi> but the <hi>Jude,</hi> who was one of the <hi>Four,</hi> that are called, <hi>The Brethren of our Lord:</hi> The <hi>Sons of His Mother,</hi> from whom He Suffered

the Grievous Humiliation of being treated as an <hi>Alien,</hi> till probably His <hi>Reſurrection</hi> from the Dead, brought them into the Number of <hi>Believers</hi> on Him. He now preſumes not on ſuch a Style, as that of, <hi>A Brother;</hi> but he takes one, than which the Higheſt Archangel in Heaven knows none more Glorious; <hi>A Servant of</hi> JESUS CHRIST. Behold him now doing a <hi>Service,</hi> very proper for, very worthy of, ſuch an One. Behold him Warning and Arming the People of God, againſt the <hi>Errors</hi> which began <hi>betimes</hi> to infeſt the Churches of the Lord.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Antinomians</hi> made a very Early Appearance, I ſee, among the Depravers and Subverters of the <hi>Faith once delivered unto the Saints.</hi> There are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed very few <hi>New Errors</hi> broached in our <hi>Later-Dayes;</hi> the moſt of them, which now diſturb the Churches of the Faithful, are only from I ſcarce know what <hi>Enchantments,</hi> raiſing the <hi>Ghoſts</hi> of ſuch as were Dead and Damn'd many Ages ago.</p>
            <p>The Impious, and Miſchievous Men, againſt whom the Inſpired Writer is now Engaged, have their Impiety here declared. Firſt, The <hi>Ungodly Men</hi> ſtand charged with <hi>Filthineſs.</hi> They were, that I may uſe the moſt agreeable Term, which the French Tranſlation Leads me to, A very <hi>Diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute</hi> Generation. I take notice by the way, that the Greek Term, here uſed for, <hi>Laſciviouſneſs,</hi> or <hi>Wantonneſs,</hi> is derived from the Name of the Town <hi>Selga;</hi> a Place infamous for ſuch <hi>Diſſolute</hi> Practices. It makes me wiſh, that no Town of ours, may in our Dayes, have any <hi>Vice</hi> abounding in it, ſo as with a laſting Infamy to derive a Name unto it. I am lothe here to Explain my ſelf too particularly<hi>!</hi> I go on with my Remarks, and

We cannot <hi>Limit the Holy One</hi> from doing ſuch a Thing. 'Tis a <hi>Poſſible Thing;</hi> And the Glorious Lord may leave us in the Story a <hi>Room</hi> for ſuch a Poſſibility, that the Sinful Children of Men overtaken by their <hi>Laſt Hour</hi> in their Sins, may not be abandoned unto a <hi>total Deſpair</hi> of Mercy.

It has been a Matter of juſt
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:001551_0028_0FB3A2F8590361A0"/>
Reſentment unto the Friends of Piety, that the <hi>Thief on the Croſs,</hi> going a Villian thither, and <hi>at the Laſt Hour</hi> finding <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> there, has been the <hi>Goliahs Sword,</hi> and a ſort of <hi>Enchanted Spear,</hi> by which the cauſe of <hi>Perſiſting Impenitency,</hi> has been maintained in the World. I am willing to Diſarm the Enemy of his boaſted Weapon.</p>
            <p>Unto me, it ſeems not at all <hi>Improbable,</hi> nay, there appears an high <hi>Probability</hi> for it; That the Malefactor now Repenting on the Croſs, <hi>brought thither</hi> the <hi>Saving Diſpoſitions of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> with him, and had before now <hi>begun</hi> upon him a Work of that <hi>Repentance, which is unto Salvation.</hi> For,</p>
            <p>Firſt, there is nothing in the Sacred Hiſtory, to brand this Poor Man with the Character of an <hi>Unrepenting Sinner,</hi> at the Time of his being brought forth to his Execution. Two of the Evangeliſts, <hi>Matthew,</hi> and his Follower and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridger <hi>Mark,</hi> indeed Speak in the Plural Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as if <hi>both</hi> of the <hi>Thieves</hi> at firſt joined in the Reproaches of our Saviour. And if it were ſo, it may remain a <hi>Quere,</hi> How far a <hi>true Penitent</hi> heartily bewayling of all his Wickedneſs, and believing in the Sacrifice of the Promiſed <hi>Meſſiah</hi> for the Pardon of it, might yet be ſo circumſtanced, as to be kept <hi>Invincibly Ignorant,</hi> that our Bleſſed JESUS, was this Meſſiah? But then I concur with thoſe more Judicious Writers, who do by no means allow, that the Thief whom we now have our Eye upon, did <hi>himſelf</hi> Reproach our Saviour. <hi>Druſius</hi> is diſpleaſed at them who make this objection of the <hi>Plural Number,</hi> and ſayes, <hi>Apagi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

They are ignorant of the <hi>Hebrew Style.</hi> [See Judg. XII. 7.] It is alſo obſerved as a peculiar, but perpetual way, taken by the Evangeliſt <hi>Matthew,</hi> in his Writing, That where <hi>Several</hi> Perſons are joined, and <hi>One</hi> Speaks, and it is either in the Name of the reſt, or the reſt are Silent at it, he refers the Speeches or Actions of that <hi>One,</hi> unto the <hi>whole Number</hi> preſent, [A Notable Example, ſee Matth. XX. 30 with Mar. X. 46. And another, Matth. XXVI 8. with Joh. XII. 4.] Thus, we read of Things <hi>Written in the Prophets,</hi> when only <hi>One</hi> of the Prophets wrote them. <hi>Glaſſius</hi> will further ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy you. Tis a frequent <hi>Synecdoche.</hi> This is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed an <hi>Ancient Obſervation:</hi> and it leaves us cauſe to Suſpect, as very Learned Expoſitors have conjectured, That the <hi>other Thief alone</hi> Reproached our Saviour, as <hi>Luke</hi> relates it, and this was wholly Silent at the Firſt, until the Violence of his Companions Language, and the conſideration of the aſtoniſhing Accidents than in his View, compelled him at once to rebuke his Companion, and Confeſs his Redeemer. I am far from thinking the <hi>Apoſtolical Conſtitutions,</hi> to be of that Antiquity and Authority which a famous Arian in our Dayes would aſſign un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. Yet ſome things in them, are of ſuch <hi>Antiquity,</hi> as to deſerve that Reverence and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception with us, which is due to the Opinion of the <hi>Ancients.</hi> And it is a little Confirmation of my Opinion in this caſe, that the <hi>Apostolical Conſtitutions</hi> do favour it. <hi>Jerom</hi> alſo and <hi>Austin</hi> are of the ſame Opinion. A <hi>Syllepſis</hi> here, ſayes <hi>Jerom;</hi> An <hi>Enallage,</hi> ſaith <hi>Auſtin.</hi>

Secondly; Without having Recourſe to the Judgment of the Great <hi>Voetius,</hi> That this Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor had the Beginning of a <hi>Regenerate State,</hi> before he was left unto his Capital Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; It is an Eaſy thing to Suppoſe, and there is little Reaſon to queſtion the Suppoſal; That this Thief had <hi>Opportunity,</hi> in the <hi>Priſon,</hi> for ſome while before his Execution, to come unto a Serious <hi>Repentance</hi> of his Ungodly Life. His Miſerable Condition, would naturally lead him to <hi>Conſider of his Wayes.</hi> There were alſo Some <hi>Godly Men</hi> in the Town, whoſe Charity might lead them to Viſit him with their Inſtructions. We ſtill have ſome Footſteps of the Care, which the Godly among the Jews took of, <hi>The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</hi> They would not <hi>Scourge,</hi> much leſs, would they <hi>Hang</hi> a Criminal, without Inſtructing him from the <hi>Sacred Scriptures.</hi> He might alſo be long before <hi>Inſtructed</hi> in thoſe Truths of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which the Spirit of God might here bring home unto his Mind, with a Sanctifying Efficacy. 'Tis very poſſible, and more than ſo, that this Man, might while in the <hi>Gaol,</hi> and many Weeks before his <hi>Death,</hi> be brought, bitterly to <hi>Lament,</hi> and ſincerely to <hi>Abhor,</hi> all his wicked Courſes, and heartily to <hi>Prefer</hi> a Life devoted unto the Service of God, and rely on the Offering of the <hi>Son of God</hi> then Expected, for his Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation to the Glorious One, in <hi>whoſe Favour is Life;</hi> and be truly deſirous to Know and to Do the whole <hi>Duty</hi> of a Repenting Sinner. Yea, there is nothing to hinder, but that he might have <hi>heard</hi> ſo much concerning the <hi>Fame</hi> of the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of God in our Bleſſed JESUS, <hi>with his Ears,</hi> that the <hi>Deſtruction</hi> and the <hi>Death</hi> to which

            <p>And;</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that which very much Countenances the Conjecture, that it might be ſo, is; The <hi>Wonderful Readineſs</hi> of the Thief, at all the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of this Repentance, <hi>as ſoon</hi> as you ſee him expoſed on the Croſs. Every thing looks as if he came thither <hi>Prepared</hi> with the <hi>Grace,</hi> which he ſo readily, and ſo notably Expreſſes there. We have not the leaſt Intimation of any <hi>Pains</hi> taken there to <hi>Enlighten</hi> him, and <hi>Admoniſh</hi> him; Nor do the <hi>Torments</hi> then upon him, and the <hi>Clamours</hi> of the People about him, ſeem to allow the <hi>Words of the Wiſe,</hi> then to do much, at reaching of him. And yet the <hi>Grace</hi> Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed by this Penitent, was of ſo Various and Marvellous an Application, that one may ſay, He does in a <hi>few Hours</hi> the work of <hi>ſome Years;</hi> and in a <hi>few Minutes</hi> runs thro' the <hi>whole Race</hi> of Chriſtianity!

deſtroy all the <hi>Aſſurance,</hi> which any Preſuming Sinner has, that this Man did <hi>not Repent</hi> until his <hi>Last Hour</hi> was arrived unto him.

They alſo tell you, That the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of this Penitent was at a <hi>Seaſon,</hi> the like to which will never again occur in the World; It was an <hi>Extraordinary Time.</hi> As Mr. <hi>Fenner</hi> notes, The Day of a <hi>Kings Coronation,</hi> ſets Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors at <hi>Liberty,</hi> which at another Time could not eſcape the <hi>Death</hi> which belongs unto them. The moſt aſtoniſhing <hi>Expreſſion</hi> of the <hi>Divine Mercy,</hi> that ever was given to the World, was now Exhibiting. It is Congruous enough, that there ſhould now in One Penitent be a moſt aſtoniſhing <hi>Monument</hi> of it. Our Penitent ſtood cloſe by the <hi>Great Sacrifice.</hi> If there ſhould be an <hi>Uncommon Experiment</hi> of the Vertue in the <hi>Balſom,</hi> juſt as it was Preparing, it is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome Congruity.

In fine; I ſhould be as much offended, as the Martyr <hi>Bilney,</hi> to hear any one diſcouraging an <hi>Old Penitent,</hi> from Hopes of Pardoning Mercy. But it is as great an offence, to hear the folly and madneſs, and Egregious Nonſenſe of a Sinner <hi>Delaying</hi> to become a <hi>Penitent,</hi> becauſe there was a <hi>Thief,</hi> that at <hi>the Last Hour</hi> found a Pardon. I break off with Saying. That if this <hi>Penitent</hi> might from the <hi>Paradiſe</hi> where our Saviour has Lodg'd him, now Preach unto us, we ſhould certainly hear him ſaying, <hi>I deſire, that among them who delay their Converſion to God, my Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may no more be for their Ungodly Purpoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on!</hi>—</p>
