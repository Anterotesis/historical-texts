            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>WHEN we take a survey of man's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, with the various workings of the human mind, we must be sensible that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, in many respects, has an undue influence upon our actions; to divest ourselves of this is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately necessary, in order to think with reason, believe with caution, and decide with equity.â€”The passions that exist in the human mind qualify us for the discharge of duty and equip us with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour for the variety of scenes before us. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we wish to spend our days on the public Theatre or to live recluse from all human in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection, we have a province within ourselves, wherein we ought ever to reign. To attend to
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:031638_0003_0FED67371C5AD1D0"/>
the dictates of nature, observe the springs of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and cultivate those virtues early implanted by a liberal hand, is not only a profitable but pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing work. As reason is the distinguishing charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of man, the due exercise of that reason must be a main share of human felicityâ€”the dictates of reason too are various and refer to innumerable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, but never lead us amiss so long as we attend to the simplicity of her language, and our souls submit to her unflattering addresses. Nature being attended to, shews us our dignity as well as our infirmity, and is never backward to remind us of the great duty we owe to God and ourselves, our Country and the world. The variety of order in created Being illustrate, not only the superior skill of the artist, but opens a way for the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensive usefulness as well as the more refined a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>musement. The powers of action and capability of enjoyment are ever wisely proportioned to the sphere in which the different species, are to roll. Instinct has her influence on every order and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver impels each one to fill the circle marked by Heaven. As reason is that which dignifies the nature of man above the brutal herd and feathered tribe, 'tis also a distinguishing trait in his character, that he is as far superior for sociability than they, as reason exceeds instinct. The powers of sympathy within us create the most pleasing as well as the most painful sensations. For us to be capable of
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:031638_0004_0FED6738CAB6FF08"/>
an happy enjoyment tis necessary that we should be capable of loving and being lovedâ€”certain pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of attraction are therefore all necessary, for the rational as well as material system, without which mankind would enjoy no more good from society than the beasts of the field, no more pleasure from the charms of Friendship than the fowls of heavenâ€”but the attracting influence of love, as it unites the heart it opens and fills the mind with the most cordial ideas. Any one insensible of those soft emotions, have so far degenerated as to possess an obduracy, nothing inferior to the impenetrable Adimant. The laws of self preservation that bear rule in the animal, work by the principles of self love, in the rational world.</p>
            <p>When we see the beasts of the field, in league against the enemies of their species, and the fowls of heaven at war in defence of their associates, it gives us a faint idea of the principle on which ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are founded, society ordained, order and gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment established in the world.</p>
            <p>But as love is a spark from an uncreated, undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minished blaze, in its exercise it must work agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the nature of its source, which is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to the emolument of one simple being, but the universal good.</p>
            <p>The same principle that impels us to seek our own, impels us to seek another's welfare; self love in its due exercise, flows forth to our kindred and
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:031638_0005_0FED67475BD44480"/>
friends, our country and the worldâ€”variety of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation makes way for a variety of exerciseâ€”and the more extensive the exercise of our love, the more extensive our happiness. By the practice of a true public benevolence, we secure to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the charms of a bright and lasting reputation, and are delivered from the terrors, of being hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down as criminals to posterity. By a real dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of the duties we owe to the world, and a reasonable conformity to the design of God mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, in the constitution of nature, we arrive to the summit of happiness. Human felicity is in a great measure in our handsâ€”Opportunity and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages are now before usâ€”even some of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est evils incident to human nature, become chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels of blissâ€”our greatest afflictions a prelude to our greatest mercies,â€”pain mitigated gives pleasureâ€”sorrows that are past become pleasing on reflectionâ€”enterprises executed with toil and hazard afford the most joyful solaceâ€”matters that have caused the greatest grief, we often call up to mind painted under a variety of beautiful co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loursâ€”in this way we take pleasure in viewing the turf that covers the remains of a well loved de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted friend, if the tear of sympathy shows itself upon the cheek, 'tis even pleasure to weep.</p>
            <p>To perpetuate to posterity, the memory of our adventures, not only the most pleasing but the most hazardous expeditions, is the desire of men,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:031638_0006_0FED674E75C71ED0"/>
and appears to be the practice of all nations,â€”While men were as yet unpolished by art, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilled in letters, for what were those rude heaps of dirt thrown up, but as monuments to perpetuate their various achievments.</p>
            <p>Let us cast our eye to the Mosaic page, and we find that Noah on his deliverance from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge, erects an altar to the Lord; Jacob on his way to Bethel sets up a stone in memory of his converse with God. Israel having gained a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest over their enemies, erect a pillar, by the name of Ebenezer.</p>
            <p>Let us look but a few centuries back, and we may behold their pillars, their statues, and their monuments of glory. Let us read the inscription, here stands painted to our view the field of battle, with the number of the wounded and slain; on this side stands the Victor's name, engraved on the venerable marble, time has not defaced nor posterity lost the memory of his departed shade.â€”The policy of Ulisses, the fatigue of AEneas, the prowess of Hector, the wiles of Greece, and the fall of Troy, stand enrolled on the pages of our ancestors, and are sung by their venerable bards. View the savage tribes, even at this day erect their war-like pile, hear them howl in war-like form at their rude festivals, their wars, their huntings and their various conquests. And shall we my fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low citizens, who live in the golden age of the world,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:031638_0007_0FED673BA7581138"/>
who are happy to be actors in the most celebrated century of time, who enjoy the fruits of the most glorious enterprize, and have seen the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the most illustrious aera that ever adorned the annals of historyâ€”Shall we hide it from gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations yet unborn? No! let it be held in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting remembrance.</p>
            <p>Need I call to your minds the day, the great important day on which AMERICA declared her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a FREE, SOVEREIGN and INDEPEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DENT Nation, and vowed to defend it, at the price of blood and property. Twenty full years are this day completed since that resolution took place, and such breath was breathed from Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican souls. From that hour, the prison doors were opened, the clanking, galling chains of slavery fell from the wearied limb, the brightest diamond dropped from the British crown, and the supercilious brow hung with disappointment and sad remorse. If I call up to the mind of any son or parent, friend or brother, a companion or lover who became victims in the field and day of battleâ€”If the expiring cry for quarter, the fainting groan from a quivering, dying lip, call from any of us the tear of sympathy; still 'tis a most pleasing animating thought, they fell in the field of honor, they died in the bed of gloryâ€”every drop of their blood was a ransom paid for our INDEPENDENCE, and the dews of the night were the richest tears of
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:031638_0008_0FED6742D3CC11C8"/>
heaven shed to bathe their unburied heads. Past sighs, past groans and tears, may cause the mind to faint that is unacquainted with toil, and ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated by uninterrupted effeminate felicity, but can never cramp the ardour of him, who swam to honor through crimsom gore, whose body is fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ured with the pointed steel.</p>
            <p>This day we happily enjoy the dear bought va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable prize. How busy was the guardian angel of our land to inspire each soul with heroic fire and a love for freedomâ€”decrepit age was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed to youth, the almost dry bones flushed with animated vigor; Infants thirsting for military glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in their country's cause, instantly grew up to men of valor; The feeling mother gave up her sonâ€”the spouse her lordâ€”the tender virgin from a warm embrace impelled her lover to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish himself in the field of battle.</p>
            <p>Heaven seemed to unite all Americans into one soul, except some fugitive Cains; all interest was one stock in our common cause; And who my fellow countrymen can regret, when they view the spoils of our victory? Was it better to haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard our all than tamely submit to the galling op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of that yoke which neither we nor our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were able to bear?</p>
            <p>Liberty purchased by blood, is infinitely better than slavery in chains of gold. Had we stupidly submitted to the insolence of other men's pride, we
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:031638_0009_0FED66F7E6E0C628"/>
at this day might have been dragging out a miserable, lingering dying life, whilst our houses and lands, our wives and little ones should be the use of other men, and exposed to the insult and cruelty of an <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ughty purchaser. As the heavens gathered blackness over our heads, and the muttering thunders began to roar from the distant pole, thank God! the cloud immediately burst, one perpetual blaze of light o'er-spread our world, discovering the fair lines written in the volume of the divine decree, as the voice issues from the four winds, AMERICA and her SONS shall not be SLAVES.</p>
            <p>Let us review the day of carnage, we now see the riches, the honors and reputation that have been its reward, every scar is preferable to a crown, the richest diamond compares not with the laurels of victory, the bread thrown on the water is returning four fold; the blood spilt, flows back in streams of milk and honey.</p>
            <p>The spreading blaze of freedom still continues to extend itself from pole to pole. All nations aspire after equal gloryâ€”human nature assumes her rightâ€”Despots stand leaning on their sceptres, crowns grow heavy and tremble on the head of kingsâ€”the hearts of tyrants failâ€”the joints of ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny are loosed, their aspiring prospects fall and crush togetherâ€”generations yet unborn shall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise and call us blessed. Kingdoms may cease, but freedom is a spark from heaven and cannot be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literated.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:031638_0010_0FED67249D2067D8"/>
The revolution, sovereignty, and independence of AMERICA, shall be enrolled in perpetual me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory. The days of our battles and triumphs be founded as a tribute of praise by future bards, while their authors and actors, lie slumbering be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the ground: and while the virtues of our heroes will be rehearsed the illustrious name of WASHINGTON, shall swell every note; his virtues stand inscribed in letters of gold. A character fair and unsullied like his must remain so long as the powers of nature are unshaken, and the pillars of marble are undissolved; and when time impairs and alters all the effects of art, his works shall follow him. While the stars shall fade away, the sun himself grow dim with age and dying nature sink in years, yet HE shall stand, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> in immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal youth and be a pillar in the temple of our God.</p>
            <p>Shall I mention the Caesars, Alexanders, and Scipios of the world. A Cicero and Demosthenes by the art of Rhetoric and eloquence may em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellish their characters and enroll them on the list of martial Deities. But we need not the force of rhetoric nor the inviting voice of eloquence to persuade the world that WASHINGTON, is the hero of the age, the friend to man, the guardian of our rights, and the boast of our land. Should I mention the warlike, venerable David, who fought and killed Goliah, who put to slight the armies of the Aliens, yet one behind me might whisper to
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:031638_0011_0FED671755CCF690"/>
your ear and say, his character is tainted with perfidy to his friend and Captain Uriah. You might tell he is charged by Nathan as being guilty of murder and adultery. Should I reach the wisdom, the council and policy of a Solomon, still the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, the council and political talents of WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON shine uneclipsed, his civil and military virtues soar above the powers of rheroric, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sound of his name breathes the best of eloquence.</p>
            <p>Should it be the case that the short term since the cessation of hostilities has suffered us to forget his assiduous care for his country, his prowess in the field and day of battle; yet his hand has not been withdrawn, nor his eye ceased to be watchful for our good. Could the pillow of his bed give evidence or the curtain around him utter lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, they would doubtless attest the constancy of his love.</p>
            <p>If any of us are guilty of so gross ingratitude as to have lost a remembrance of his past virtues, let us only call to mind the latest acts of his firmess and patriotism. When faction in a southern state had reared her head, by a personal appearance, he silences their complaints, and awes them in submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to rightful government. While the interest of particular men, and perhaps the influence of a foreign court, were endeavoring to blow up a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond breeze with the British crown, how inflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly just, how inviolably constitutional were his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:031638_0012_0FED6728DD556A28"/>
to prevent the ill, and secure to his land, the blessings of civil and commercial peace. The decisive die was ready to be cast, a TREATY of amity and commerce must be signed and effected with England, or the glory of AMERICA be eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, faith become violated, our navigation inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and a new scene of hostilities commence. Knowing how to answer the unconstitutional de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of those who made them, not regarding the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly reflections of Dissentients, nor the idea of popularity, he places his hand and fixes his seal to an instrument for our political salvation. By that act he triumphs over every idea of mercenary servitude, stops the breath of faction, gives law to our land and immortalizes his name; and still, even for this the breath of slander blows against him her noxious blast. But let the offspring of the hedge hog race, who have no other powers or defence, than to use a feeble dirty quill, scribble against a character like his, their attempts are vain, as if their feeble arm should essay with mud to deface the glories of the moon, while they rank them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves among the envenomed tribe, they live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, suffer unpitied, die unlamented, and rankle with dispair. Let us then my fellow citizens, while we call up to view past scenes, stand prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for events yet to come: Let us view our past and present circumstances, and learn how to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount any difficulties that are ahead instead of
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:031638_0013_0FED672BB823A0B8"/>
flying from them; to anticipate adversity in an unpleasing task, yet in many respects, 'tis pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and necessary. Let us then call up to view the day in which our beloved President must be called by an irrevocable decree, to retire from the feat of action, noise and bustle, and take his stand in the armies aboveâ€”Where shall a second WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON be found: who for us will fill that seat, so long dignified by his person and benefited by his services: As he retires let every eye attend him, drop a tear and wish his manes all the joys of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly rest. By an imprudent election, our tower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing edifice must fall, our gold become dim, and our glory turn to shame.</p>
            <p>Changes in government have ever been consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered some of the most weighty events of time. Tis a period in which men too often indulge a vicious avarice, and the low unmanly arts of chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane instead of laudable ambition or an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norary thirst for fame: A particular interest is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten more regarded than personal ability: How has it been the case, under a Turkish government, that a mean fellow has been taken from the oar of a galley and the next day by the caprice of a prince has been invested with all the powers of a Sultan or Mayor. For want of proper attention to elections, whole empires have been governed by ignorance, the prime minister has been the dupe of abandoned women, and led by babes.â€”
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:031638_0014_0FED672E90DCF0B8"/>
Some have crawled imperceptibly to power by succession: some have been invested with regal dignity in the cradle, while others have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed in the very last stages of the dotage of life.</p>
            <p>In absolute government all public service is due to the Prince, and he nominates all public servants; but in a free government like ours, a very principle service is due to the people. The right of government springs not from the cradle, but dotage destroys it.</p>
            <p>Every circumstance renders it incumbent on all to instruct themselves in those affairs wherein they may be actors or adequate judges of those who act. 'Tis the part of every good citizen to consult the nature and institutions of government, the rights and duties that belong to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and governed powers. Happy is the state of that land, when and where their leading Ministers are wise, firm, brave and prudent; but woe to that people whose leader is a child.</p>
            <p>The long continuance of our rights and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges depend on our use of them, and the spirit with which they are defended. As we enjoy lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty and peace, 'tis in our hands to secure them; and after we have tasted the joys and just begin to reap the fruits of a free and equal government, shall we by supineness, sloth and dissipation make
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:031638_0015_0FED66FAC0D9AE90"/>
suit to slavery, shall we alienate our rights and tame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly submit to ignominy and reproach; shall it be in vain for us that we have fought, bled and conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. In the name of heaven, who that has any soul within him can endure, that the fame of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MERICA, towering in the world, like Atlas, with her top above the clouds, should be blasted from the annals of history, and become a jest to every insulting foe. If our INDEPENDENCE was obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the price of blood and treasure, never let us esteem these too dear to defend it, we have peace, we have health, we have liberty on our side, and what is wanting to perpetuate these in a lasting duration, but a conformity of disposition among our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; united force is ever the most strong, and while this is the defence of our land, nations esteem our friendship and court an alliance. We have each of us therefore fellow-citizens, duties to discharge whether we are called to the cabinet, the field or the plough. Different stations call for the exercise of different abilities; every man ought ever to possess a mind of his own, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude sufficient to act his own mind in every sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and on all events; but he who is ever awed by popularity, who can be bought by interest or flattered by sycophants, is unworthy to hold a seat any where, but at his own fire. The very idea of popularity carries with it the right or liberty of private judgment, for this men ought not to be
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:031638_0016_0FED67006D3C1FB8"/>
censured or reviled. To clothe with calumny, the legislative body, or any part of them, for the use of their own judgment, is ignoble and ill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming an American: too many judge before they examine, and censure, before they understand; there may be views for steps in government not known by every honest minded citizen, nor is it necessary or attainable in all circumstances. When a legislative body are chosen and organized, 'tis expected they will act for the greatest general good consistent with the constitution, by which they are to govern themselves; but when matters of debate come before them, are they to act their own minds, or to leave their seats till they obtain the mind of their constituents, and so not act their own minds, but the minds of a confused multitude. This would be a very uncertain way of procedure indeed, and if practiced each in a community having a particular fancy to be gratified, a mob must be our supreme Law. But if it should be the case that a body-politic should miss in judgmentâ€”In a government like ours there are other ways to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the evil and redress a grievance than by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal slander, news-paper calumny, or open riot.</p>
            <p>A certain degree of faith is to be placed in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry member of the cabinet, without which society cannot exist; he who in reality forfeits this, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feits all at once; and if an honest man is the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest work of God, the perfidious clothe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:031638_0017_0FED671A2C1C53F0"/>
in the livery of fallen Angels, to be ever jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and suspicious is a striking symptom of badness of heart. How amiable the character of him whose noble soul consults not popular applause, but how to act the honest man and the hero; who will boldly risk a short lived eclat, rather than alienate the privileges of his countrymen, and violate his own conscience.</p>
            <p>Members who have been tried in an hour of hazard, who have been valiant and firm in junc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of dangers, whose councils have developed us from the labyrinth of perplexity, who have boldly risqued both life and property in our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, who hath led us by the hand when in infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to the paths of peace, should never be weaned from our affections, nor be thrown from our breasts by the sour fumes of ingratitude.</p>
            <p>Every member receives the benefit of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and as his life and property are under its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, 'tis but just and reasonable he should aid in its support.</p>
            <p>An honest and frugal industry shall strengthen his hand, and encourage his heart; his oil shall not fail in the cruise nor the meal in his barrel be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the fruit of his own tree shall rejoice his spirit, and the fat of his lands and flocks make his face to shine: under his own shade he may rest a wearied limb, and the song of liberty and peace be forever upon his tongue. The bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:031638_0018_0FED671BD9693020"/>
joys and pleasures of INDEPENDENCE are so great, we can never be too careful to secure them or scarcely risque too much in their defence.</p>
            <p>The example of the antient Romans should animate each soul with heroic fire. Liberty is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to be defended as well as obtained by force of arms: For this a Roman would out-brave death in its most haggard form. When superstition pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, and God was vainly thought to delight in flesh and gore; how freely did they offer human blood upon their altars for atonement, propitiation and purgation. But shall not reason make an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican as bold in defence of his privileges, as superstition could a Roman.</p>
            <p>We are not called at this enlightened age of the world, to offer ourselves as bound victims to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease a stern deity, or purchase our liberty from the hands of a foreign nation; no, thank God, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven smiles, and <hi>Liberty</hi> is already ours, and tis ours to defend it; if unhappily we should have the call to it, even at the mouth of the cannon, or point of the bayonetâ€”A life that dare not venture itself in the open field, in its country's cause, is not worth holding; whereas a character established through the fatigues of war, and honored with the scars of victory, ought ever to be set in letters of gold.â€”A military character is a most commanding character, every thing in the nature of the duty conspire to form the soul noble for achievements;
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:031638_0019_0FED675150CAD400"/>
while their form and air as far exceed the soft ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses of an effeminate macaroni, as the globe exceeds an egg-shell. A military life tends not to harden the heart, but to embellish the soul with every manly virtue which lead them to des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pise the low, small arts of disguise. To triumph over weakness is the part of a weak mind; but to protect the innocent and shew lenity to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, are the exercises of the great and noble. To insult the defenceless, to torment the misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, may be the triumphs of a villain, and the boast of a coward. Humanity shudders at needless suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and he who lays foundation for it, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joices in it degrades human nature. Great minds ever aspire after great objects, and leave the low mercenary scenes of intrigue, to miscreants of the earth.</p>
            <p>A rage for dissipation and unlawful pleasure, tends to settle the subject into luxury and false refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which as it enervates the mind, may suit a worshiper at the temple of Venus, but can by no means embellish the character of the son of Mars. As it destroys all feeling for deflowered beauty; they may for a time triumph over the vile conquests of their villany, but at the end find their reputation irretrievably lost, their constitutions ruined, their beauty departed as a fading flower, and every manly rational delight become a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to their guilty breast. But a sense of dignity
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:031638_0020_0FED671EB7818C88"/>
and honor, as it crops the folly of vice, it leads the soul to triumph over danger, and adorns the happy possessor with good manners, wholesome fashions and laudable customs.</p>
            <p>The day of peace is too often a day of dissipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among men; but shall deluding pleasure cramp the prospect of our rising nation. A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation from toil is a time to gather strength a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst fatigue; peace should ever brace our nerves against the hardships of war; and every leisure train up our troops for martial prowess.</p>
            <p>Let us then my fellow-citizens stand in defence of our INDEPENDENCE, by fighting against its e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies in our own breasts, and we shall easily over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come those that are without.</p>
            <p>Let us secure and transmit the valuable legacy to a nation yet unborn. Let each throw in their mite to maintain and defend our laws and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port our government unshaken.</p>
            <p>Conformity of disposition in the day of peace will strengthen our hands against the day of battle. The breath of faction is contagious and has ruined families, states and empires.</p>
            <p>Let us gird our loins and stand clad in the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of our defence, and our banner will be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying to every invading foe.</p>
            <p>This day America is at peace with the worldâ€”what love fired the Angelic choir, when a band was sent forth from the host of the Lord, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:031638_0021_0FED67A4FB489ED8"/>
peace, and sound salvation to the sons of men; hear them shout on their way, glory to God in the highest, on earth peace, good will toward men. May we not join this day, renew the song, and resound the joyful Jubileeâ€”How glorious the present AEra, let us hail the auspicious dayâ€”our seat of government is respected, our laws are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some and influential, our troops are not called to resist a foe in open field, nor to traverse with wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry step the unfrequented wood amidst a savage tribe.</p>
            <p>The minds of men expand, benevolence with her balmy influence extends herself: bigotry and fanatacism give way to candour and reason; may true philanthropy croud from the earth, all party names, and our land ever refuse to nourish the seeds of superstition and enthusiasm.</p>
            <p>The civil and religious horizon, begins to brigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to our view; the darkness of ignorance gives way to the glorious dawn that shall eventually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten all nations, and harmonize an universal world to be one people under one God, governed by one law. When that happy period shall arrive, peace shall be accented by every lip, the olive branch waved in every hand, Ephraim shall not envy Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, nor Judah vex Ephraim; swords shall be beaten into ploughshares, spears into pruning hooks, nation shall not lift up the sword against nation, nor learn war any more.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:031638_0022_0FED6722F0A22A30"/>
Let us this day anticipate the joys of a full and final accomplishment, by the foretastes now in our enjoymentâ€”Let the exercise of the social virtues fit us to quaff the social cup, not mixed with the gall of contention, or overflowing with the froth of sensuality, luxury and debauch; but may an invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olable regard to our rights, a strict adherence to truth, and a perpetual discharge of justice, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion to the distressed, the feeble and the stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, be the distinguishing badge of <hi>Americans,</hi> then shall we be honorable as we are <hi>Independent,</hi> and powerful as we are free.</p>
            <p>Arise then <hi>Fellow-Citizens,</hi> put on strength, and shew yourselves men; view the privileges now in our hands, contemplate the prospects that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, view the riches, the honors, and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our nation, the happiness of our wives and little ones, depending on our conduct; if we wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonly trifle these away, or stupidly receive the yoke of oppression, we must descend to the grave with the curses of millions on our guilty heads, and a rising generation shall tread upon our ashes with contempt; under such circumstauces it would be better for us this day to be among the dead than the living. Stand equipped for every event, a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for danger will never hasten it upon us, but if called to the use of arms, when their springs are dead with rust, our privileges, our lives, our all are at hazard: If the voice of peace should lull
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:031638_0023_0FED6752FAF0FD40"/>
our souls to sleep, what must be our surprise, when an enemy sword in hand shall enter our campâ€”by a watchful prudent diligence, we may still keep our hands on the neck of our enemies, may still live at peace with the world, and be honorable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the nations, but he who betrays his trust, he who flinches, in the hour of battle in his countrys cause, is a curse to society; he who refuses to aid and defend our rights, but stupidly bows his neck to the yoke of oppression and the tyrants lash, is unworthy of an immortal soul, possesses the spirit, and deserves the burial of an ASS.</p>
