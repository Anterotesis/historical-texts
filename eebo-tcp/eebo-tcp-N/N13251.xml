            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>YOU whom the Lord hath reached unto in this the Day of his Love, and hath made known the way of Truth and Righteouſneſs unto you, through the raiſing up of that Holy living Witneſs of himſelf, that long lay hid and buried in you, and hath brought you to a ſecret feeling of ſomething in you, that is worth the minding and regarding; and the Lord cauſing this to Appear in the Day of yourſeeking, as a Light, diſcovering Darkneſs, and its Power, by which ye were formerly holden, and given you by his Spirit a ſenſe and ſecret Hope, that in this Light, the way of Deliverance was to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained unto; this Hope made you not aſhamed of the Light which before you hated, but you came to know and embrace it, even while others ſtill hated it, and you for its ſake; yet your Hearts being affected with the Hope that did appear therein, could not but joyn unto it, as to make publick Profeſſion of
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:016754_0003_0F9DF207A3DC0DC0"/>
it for its own ſake; and for no other ends or deſigns, or intereſt at all, but with reſolution in that Light, to wait for the Salvation of God. Dear Friends, it is you aforemention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that both now, and for ſome Days and Weeks my Heart hath been deeply exerciſed concerning, even Night and Day; and the aboundings of the Father's Love doth often overcome me, and draws me forth now to ſay and write theſe things unto you for your Admonition and Eſtabliſhment; and indeed it is you who did thus rightly own the way of Truth, and knew your Believing to be the Gifts and Mercy of God to your Souls, that I do aim at; for thoſe that have taken up the Profeſſion of the Precious Truth upon by-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects and ſiniſter ends, and but for Reaſons propounded in their Carnal Minds; tho' I do pity them, yet I have not much at this time to ſay to them but this, <hi>The Day ſhall declare them, and their Garments ſhall not hide them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you, Oh my Friends! who had Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with us, in the deep Travels of our Beginnings, and did come to Truth the ſame way, and have known the Power and Virtue of it, many times overcoming you in your Inward man, which hath made you cry out, <hi>Lord, evermore give us of this Bread;</hi> and hath made you as a watered Garden: Oh Friends! how ſhall I expreſs or ſignify unto you thoſe
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:016754_0004_0F9DF207B29D9C70"/>
Longings, thoſe ardent Deſires and earneſt Breathings of my Soul, that you, even you, might abide to the end of all Trials and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations, Adverſities, and might inherit that Crown of Immortality that is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, and might not by any means be bereft thereof; this is ſingly my Travel in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Spirit, that you might be kept and preſerved out of all the ſubtil Snares of the wicked One, which haunts for the Soul, even of thoſe that have Believed; and therefore in dear and tender Love, I have a few things to write unto you for the clearing of my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and diſcharging my Duty in the ſight of the Lord; and the Lord give you all a tender and an underſtanding Heart, that both you and I may yet have cauſe Daily to Praiſe the Lord in the glorious Light of his Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which he hath manifeſted among us by the Revealing his Son Jeſus Chriſt, to whom belongs <hi>Dominion, Honour and Glory for Ever, Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And firſt, Dear Friends, it is in my Heart to put you in remembrance of that by which we were called and convinced, which as a Foundation Principle was laid in and among you, and it being unchangeable and unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in it ſelf, doth therefore admit of no alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or change in thoſe that are rightly kept to it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:016754_0005_0F9DF2087B83AFF0"/>It was a Light which aroſe in our Hearts, and ſhined forth from God, the Father of Lights, carrying in its Appearance the Nature and Property of God, both in its Condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Evil, which the Enemy had Sown or Planted in us; and owning, allowing, and juſtifying every thing that was good and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, juſt and equal; even thoſe Thoughts in our Hearts which were of turning towards the Lord, and ſeeking his Righteouſneſs; theſe Thoughts were juſtified and encouraged by the Light, and all the contrary diſcovered and judged, as they were brought to it to be tryed. Now this Light did our Souls Rejoyce in, as they had good cauſe. tho' it took away our former Rejoycings; our Pleaſures in Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities and Iniquity died, our Glory in this World withered, our Friendſhip with the Sons of Men decayed, and we ſtood in the Light and ſaw all theſe things, and were not ſorry at it, but waited daily to ſee theſe things more and more brought to paſs; neither was there a permitting our Thoughts to go out, how we might prevent thoſe Damages, or repair theſe Loſſes, but the Croſs of Chriſt was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed our Glorying or Rejoycing; and the Hope that was before us, did make us deſpiſe the Pleaſures, Treaſures and Honours, Friendſhip and Delights of this World; and in thoſe Days you grew into a feeling of the Heavenly
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:016754_0006_0F9DF2099B4D3260"/>
Joy, where the Hundred-fold was witneſſed in your Boſoms, and the Zeal of the Lord was kindled by his own Spirit in you, againſt whatſoever this Light of Jeſus in the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence did witneſs againſt; and the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held your Integrity, and Bleſſed you, and Multiplied you, and added to your Strength and Stature, and then did the Fruits of this Glorious Work abound among you, in three more general and ſpecial Effects; by which ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, or by their continuance among you, let all now come to ſearch and try themſelves, that ſo, Dear Friends, thoſe that have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Faithful in them all, may perſevere in like manner to the End: And thoſe, who upon true ſearch do find, that they have fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and fallen ſhort in all or any of them, may make haſte to Repent, and to turn to that which was the Root of them all, that they may not be found as Fruitleſs and Withered Branches in the Day that cometh, leſt they be cut off, and utterly Conſumed, and blotted out from among the Living Branches of the Vine; for a Day cometh that Truth will look into the Fig-Tree for Fruit, and Leaves will not defend it from the Curſe and Blaſting.</p>
            <p>The three eſpecial Fruits that did ſpring forth from this Bleſſed Root, and were and are to continue and increaſe in us and among us to the end, are theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:016754_0007_0F9DF20A14D0C028"/>1. <hi>Purity,</hi> manifeſted in a Godly Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Unity,</hi> manifeſted in dear and tender Love one towards another.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Faithfulneſs,</hi> manifeſted in bearing a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and faithful Teſtimony to the thing we had received and believed, though it were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to great Loſs and Sufferings.</p>
            <p>And againſt all theſe doth the wicked one Appear, to ſee if he can make you Barren concerning them, and that with divers Wiles and Subtilties, that he may prevail on you, and not be known to be the Enemy, but might ſo overcome you, as that you might both ſubmit to him, and then plead for him and his Snares and Wiles, as being Juſt, Right, Lawful, Prudent, Convenient, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But, Oh Dear Friends! let all be watchful and diligent to wait in the ſenſe and true feeling of that Seed that never fell nor was beguiled; and you will (even the leaſt of you) ſee and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend his Workings and Transformings, and be delivered from them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Purity</hi> and <hi>Holineſs</hi> was a Fruit in you, which doth yet flouriſh in many (bleſſed be the Lord) who are as watchful and careful to approve themſelves in obedience to the Light of Truth in their Inward Parts, as ever, and find as great a neceſſity both of trying and judging with its Judgment as ever; theſe hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

thus waited, have renewed their Strength unto this very Day, and do mount up as upon the wings of an Eagle; theſe are neither Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in Running, nor Faint they in their Walking; But alas! Friends, even theſe do know with how great and manifold Aſſaults they have been Aſſaulted, and know and ſee with Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of Heart, how the Aſſault hath prevailed upon ſome, by working into the Mind a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Liberty, and ſuppoſed Enlargedneſs, whereby a Careleſneſs hath entred ſome, and they have no Keeper, but the Meaſure of Light revealed in their Hearts and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, ſo ſoon as they came to be perſuaded to ſlight the Reproofs of that, they ſoon erred; and this ſuppoſed Liberty entred, <hi>That now, after ſo many Years Strictneſs and Circumſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they ſhould not need now to ſtand ſo ſtraitly to try Things and Words as at Firſt, becauſe now a Day of more Liberty was come;</hi> and this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty ſecretly prevailed againſt that pure fear that once was placed in their Hearts, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the very obedience of Truth, Inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the ſubjection of the Mind, and then it became manifeſt Outwardly; the Actions ſometimes Blame-worthy, the Words and Speech again Corrupted, and run into the old Channel of the World, like them again, and the Single Pure Language, learned in the Light, in the time of their Poverty and Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity,

almoſt loſt and forgotten, and ſo the work of God which he wrought, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner laid waſte; and then, when this Liberty is entered, and made uſe of, as aforeſaid, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes a ſecret ſubtilty ariſeth againſt the judgment of Truth, either from within, or from any outwardly, that are grieved with this looſe and careleſs kind of Speaking or Acting, which ſubtilty leads to contend for it againſt the Judgment, telling the Creature, <hi>Why theſe things are but ſmall things, and little things, and what, we muſt not ſtrain at a Gnat, and ſuch like.</hi> Oh my Friends! beware of theſe evil Suggeſtions of the wicked one: How came they to be ſmall and little things, ſeeing they were great things with us in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning? And how comes an offence in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be light now, ſeeing it was heavy in the beginning? Oh let not the greateſt Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of our God ſo fill us, as to make us flight or forget the leaſt obedience, but rather let the continuance of his Mercy the more quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en you up unto a Zeal for his Name and Truth in all things, to be found doing and ſpeaking according to the Rule of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which ye learned in the Light, in the Day of your being low and little, and then nothing will riſe up and be exalted in the Multitude of God's Mercies, but that Holy Birth which lives in Purity when it is at high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt;
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:016754_0010_0F9DF20DC582B888"/>
and ſo that Life of Righteouſneſs will ſhine forth more and more, which Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies God and ſeeks his Honour. Dear Friends, that ye might be kept ſo unto the end, is the Breathing and Travel of my Soul: And that where this Neglect hath entered, and this aforeſaid Corruption either in Speech or Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to be found, that ye would receive the Word of Exhortation in Meekneſs and Fear, in which it was written unto you, and may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem the time, for the Days are and ſhall be Evil, and none will hold the Myſtery of the Faith (that ſaves from falling in the Evil Day) but ſuch as do keep the Pure and Undefiled Conſcience, which none can do but by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting and continuing in the Daily Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit, and Belief and Obedience of the Truth.</p>
            <p>A ſecond Fruit that was brought forth from this good Root, was <hi>Unity</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> one towards another; which Bleſſed be the Lord, is preciouſly preſerved in and among many to this very Day; who are ſo ſenſible of the divers operations of Truth in them, to be all by one Spirit, that they are ſtill kept of one Heart and Mind, given up freely to ſerve the Lord in ſingleneſs of Heart in their Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and are in this good work as Strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and Encouragers of one another; but notwithſtanding the Enemy hath been exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

buſy to lay waſte and deſtroy this bleſſed effect alſo, and that under divers Pretences, which the Lord ſtill diſcovered by his own Light and Spirit in his People, who have ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly waited upon him; but many have been his Wiles, ſometimes fitting and preparing Veſſels to riſe up in the Fleſhly and Senſual Wiſdom, and to Traduce and bring in Corrupt and Evil Doctrines, to try who were not ſound in the Faith, that they may draw them aſide, into a Heat and Zeal for ſomething which had not its Root in the Truth, and which they that abode in the Truth could not own, but Judge and Condemn in the Name of the Lord; which when ſuch ſaw, they took thereat oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of ſtriving to Propagate and Promote that which they ſaw withſtood; ſo having loſt Subjection to the Spirit of Truth in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which would have kept them in Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Body; and having alſo loſt and laid by their ſubjection to them that were over them in the Lord, they then grew Stubborn and Wilful, and proceded in more Zeal for that which ſtood in Oppoſition to the Truth, than ever they did for the Truth it ſelf; and theſe ſometimes have prevailed to the Subvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whole Houſholds, and have turned ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral from the Faith and Simplicity that is in the Goſpel, who, as well as thoſe that Subvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, have loſt the Fellowſhip of the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:016754_0012_0F9DF20F358E3480"/>
Saints, and the Savour of Life, either in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or others, and then the Enemy perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, all are Dead to the Life but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and ſo they grow to have a tickling Joy in what they do and ſay, in obedience to that perverſe and ſingular private Spirit, and ſo grow up to ſpeak Evil of Dignities, and are unruly, and dare to ſpeak againſt Heaven, and them that Dwell and Inhabit in it, whom God makes to ſhine as Stars in the Firmament of his Power; but alas for them! my Soul Pities them, when I ſee how they ſport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with their own Deceivings; but the Day of the Lord is among his People, which hath and doth make them and their Spirit ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, and their Fruits alſo have made them manifeſt.</p>
            <p>Another Way that the Enemy ſeeks to break the Unity, and diſſolve the Bond of Amity, is, by Sowing a Seed of Jealouſy and Prejudice in the Hearts of ſuch in whom he can get an Entrance; that ſo they may ceaſe from the true and unfeigned Love, and that upon a pretended Reaſon, becauſe of this or that, which is ſuppoſed or imagined, in the Evil Parts in themſelves, againſt others; giving heed to Evil Thoughts or Surmiſes, which break forth many times in Whiſperings and Tale-bearing; which tho' the thing ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be Evil, were really ſo; yet this is
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:016754_0013_0F9DF2101132B5C0"/>
not to be allowed or given way to among you, but to uſe plainneſs one towards another, and ſingle-heartedneſs; and to ſhut out the Evil One in this his ſubtil Appearance alſo. Oh Dear Friends! Remember how the Lord hath dealt with you, and deal you ſo one by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; he hath not ſought Occaſions againſt you, but hath long born and ſuffered, and exerciſed much Patience and Tenderneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you; yet plainly Reproving the Evil in you, and not Treaſuring it up againſt you. On Friends! be like-minded one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the Enemy of your Peace and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord may be defeated, and you preſerved en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to one Head, even to Chriſt Jeſus; and ye may be one, and the Name of the Lord may be one among you; and that which tends to the making cold your Love, may be Judged in all; and ſo Brotherly Love will continue with you to the End.</p>
            <p>Another way which the Enemy works to ſcatter, and to bring from this Unity, is, by leading ſome, who have Believed, into ſome Sin and Iniquity, which the Body (that are in the Truth) are conſtrained to appear in Judgment againſt for the Truth's ſake; and yet notwithſtanding the Party ſo Sinning, being above the witneſs in themſelves, which would bring them to own the Judgment of the Spirit of Chriſt in his Church, they
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:016754_0014_0F9DF210AB97D210"/>
exalt themſelves above the Judgment and ſeek to gain to them ſuch whom they can enter by their Words and Complaints, to take part with them againſt the Judgment, and thoſe that paſſed it. Such were thoſe whoſe Words <hi>did Eat</hi> (the Apoſtle ſaid) <hi>as a Canker,</hi> of whom the Believers in thoſe Days were to be aware; for commonly ſuch as have gone from the Power, that ſhould have kept them Clean and Upright, they will alſo turn againſt the Power in thoſe that abide in it, eſpecially if they be drawn forth to Reprove and Rebuke them: But let all ſuch know, that's not the way to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed; and let all that take part with any that work Iniquity, know, that they do but defile their own Souls thereby, and do but rend themſelves from that Body which they cannot Proſper out of. And therefore, Dear Friends, beware of joyning with that, in your ſelves or in others, which the Power goeth againſt, let the Pretences be what they will; for that which doth Evil, will always be apteſt to ſow Evil Complainings of others; and ſuch as are in the unſatisfied Murmuring againſt Judgement paſſed upon them, are much to be feared; for they thereby render themſelves to be the more Guilty, and yet the further from Repentance. But, Dear Friends, watch unto that which gives you a
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:016754_0015_0F9DF211875F44A0"/>
living feeling of the living Body, which is the Church, that in all things you may demean your ſelves as true Members of it, ſerving one another in Love, and ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting your ſelves one unto another for the Lord's ſake: That in all Plainneſs and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleneſs, as becometh the Truth, you may ſeek to preſerve the Unity which the Enemy of Truth and Peace doth Envy; ſo ſhall ye continue to ſtrengthen one anothers hand in every good Work, and this ſhall tend to the weakening of the Hands of your Enemies, who ſeek to divide you, that they might Rule over you. Many other Deſigns doth the wicked one try, daily to break and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide, more than can now be named or here inſerted; but they are all out of the Light, and if you be in it, you will ſee them, and that will preſerve you; for it is one, and did make us one, and will keep us to be of one Heart and Mind to the End, if we abide in it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Third good Effect which Truth did work in the beginning, in them who did truly receive it, was <hi>Zeal</hi> and <hi>Faithfulneſs</hi> to God, in bearing the Teſtamony to what was manifeſt, tho' through great Sufferings; in which, as Friends abide in the Root, they do daily encreaſe in Power, to fulfil the ſame Teſtimony: for the Mercy of the Lord doth engage them, and his Anſwer of Peace in
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:016754_0016_0F9DF212304FF350"/>
the midſt of their Tryals, doth Arm them, and Encourage them, and they do hold out to the end; and for ſuch the Lord hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways made a way, better than they could have made for themſelves. Yet the Enemy hath in this matter alſo been very buſy, and hath prevailed with ſome under divers Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, or rather Conſultations, which he hath propounded unto them. But, Oh Friends, be ye all watchful, and take heed leſt any of the Teſtamonies of Truth be laid waſte; for that which leads to be weary of bearing Witneſs to the Truth, and to lay it waſte, the ſame will lay thee waſte, and bring thee into ſuch a State, as thou will want the Truth to bear witneſs for thee; and tho' it be hard for Fleſh and Blood (which hath no Kingdom but here) to fall into the hands of Unreaſonable Men, yet it is a more fearful thing to fall into the hands of the Living God; and therefore, let all Lukewarm ones, who are neither Hot nor Cold, be now awakened, and all that have gone Backwards be Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>return to their Firſt-Love, elſe the Lord will come againſt them, and the Day haſtens that will divide ſuch their Portion among Hypocrites, except they Repent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to touch at ſome of the Reaſons or Arguments, which he that abode not in the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:016754_0017_0F9DF212F5F51C40"/>
Truth himſelf, uſeth to draw others into this kind of Treacherous Backſliding</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> He Appears to ſome to Perſuade them, That their former Teſtimony was born more from an imitation of others, than from a work of the Power of God in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and that now, they not finding the Thing required of them, they may leave off their Teſtimonies, or may do ſuch things as they have denied formerly; this Snare doth the Enemy make uſe of in theſe Days. But mark who it is that he hath caught with it; none but ſuch who ſometimes were low in their Minds, and dare not grieve the Spirit of God in themſelves, nor others, but for the Truth's ſake could give up all things, rather than their Teſtimony; but in time growing Careleſs and Looſe in Waiting, loſt that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject State, and grew High and Exalted in their Minds above the Croſs that ſhould have Crucified the betraying Wiſdom; and ſo having loſt the true Exerciſe of the Power, and the feeling of the Excellency and Worth of the Truth, they knew not the Requirings of the Lord; and the Earthly Mind got up, that placed a greater Eſteem upon Earthly Things, than upon Things that are Eternal; and ſo Things that once thou offeredſt up to God, thou takeſt again into thine own Hand,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:016754_0018_0F9DF213AB7C56E8"/>
and ſo Robbeſt the Lord, and groweſt Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful about Outward Things, as other <hi>Gentiles</hi> are; and to cover thy Shame therein, the Enemy then Tempts thee to bely the Power that once wrought in thy Heart, and made thee afraid to Act againſt this Light, or to deny the Teſtimony of God in ſuch things as was manifeſt, and then ſay'ſt, thou didſt it by imitation; but thou ſhalt know thy Covering is too Narrow in the Day that haſteth upon thee.</p>
            <p>Another Temptation that the Enemy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth, is, That tho' thou art Convinced what to do, or what thou ſhouldeſt deny, yet the Tryals are ſo hard and ſo many, and Perſecutors wax worſe and worſe, ſo that thou ſhalt not hold out to the End; and where he can get Entrance with this Bait, he preſently cauſeth an Evil Heart of Unbelief and Doubting to ariſe, which takes away even the Strength which the Lord did give, and ſo Feebleneſs doth enter the Mind, and a Spirit of Bondageleads thee to Fear again; and then comes the Diſpute in thy Heart, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou ſhalt Stand with the Power of God, in the Obedience, or whether thou ſhalt Fall under that Power that ariſeth againſt God, and his Truth and People? And in this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate thou haſt a Subtil Enemy, uſing many
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:016754_0019_0F9DF21478EB3678"/>
Devices to Betray thee, and a part in thy ſelf, not yet Mortified, that is ready to ſay, <hi>Pitty thy Self, Pitty thy Wife, Pitty thy Children, and Pitty thy Relations;</hi> which it may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, are all as ſo many Inſtruments of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan to Seduce thee, and lead thee into Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that thou may'ſt not ſee ſo great neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in thy bearing up thy Teſtimony as indeed there is, nor ſo great a Danger in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary as indeed there is.</p>
            <p>Oh Friends! at ſuch a time as this, where is there any help but in the Lord? Where canſt thou find a Saviour, but in that Light which gives to diſtinguiſh of the ſeveral Voices? Now it is good for thee to Remember, that <hi>If thou walkeſt after the Fleſh, thou muſt and ſhalt ſurely Die and Wither.</hi> In ſuch a time Flee, Flee to the Lord, wait in his Dread to feel thy Strength but Renewed at the Preſent, and take no care for Strength next <hi>Month,</hi> next <hi>Year,</hi> or next <hi>Tryal,</hi> for <hi>God is God, and changeth not, and will be the ſame to thee in Seven-Tryals as in Six, if thou Believe and Wait on him-in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs;</hi> and therefore fear not Man, but truſt in the Lord, all ye that have known and felt his Power, and let not in the Enemy of your Souls by the Door of <hi>Carnal Reaſoning,</hi> but keep that ſhut; and rather
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:016754_0020_0F9DF21537C05E90"/>
conſider, how the Enemy makes thee as a rejoycing among his own Children, and Strengthens that Hope in them, of their over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comeing all others, as well as thee; which Hope is Curſt, and ſhall be Confounded: And conſider, that if thou letteſt Fall thy Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, which thou haſt once born for the Lord, thou makeſt the Heart of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſad, and makeſt their Travail through that Teſtimony the harder for them, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of thy Encouraging their Adverſaries by the Hope aforeſaid. And whatever thou doſt. <hi>They muſt go through to the End, who will Inherit the Crown of Immortality.</hi> And again conſider. It may be that thy Backſlid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or Cowardly drawing away the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, may prove a Diſcouragement to others, and they may Stumble in thy Stumbling, and Fall with thee, and never be able to Riſe, and ſo thou bring their Blood alſo upon thee. Oh! Remember alſo that Servant of the Lord, who could ſay, <hi>Pſalm</hi> cxix. 157. <hi>My Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors are encreaſed, but my Heart doth not De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline thy Teſtimonies.</hi> That was a noble Spirit becoming the Soldiers of Chriſt; yea, <hi>though Perſecuted by Princes,</hi> as he ſaith, <hi>Verſe</hi> 161.</p>
            <p>Dear Friends, Let your Minds be ſtirred up to be Zealous for the Lord, in this the great Day of Controverſy with Darkneſs and
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:016754_0021_0F9DF21909FE22D0"/>
its Power. Who hath God to bear Witneſs to his Name but you? Among whom hath he made it known as among you? Who have given up themſelves to the Lord as you have done? Well, <hi>Bleſſed are they that keep Covenant with the Lord, for they ſhall ſee his Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One more ſubtil Snare of the Enemy in this matter is in my Heart to mention, that is this, <hi>viz.</hi> To Perſuade thee for once, ſometimes to do that which the Light hath made Manifeſt, with a purpoſe afterwards to be more Faithful. Oh Friends! In the Name and Fear of the Lord, I Exhort and Warn you all to take heed of this, for this will prove but a falſe Confidence, thou wilt find this kind of going out of the Guidance of Truth, to be a dear Out-going to thee; for if ever thou doſt return, it will be very hardly, and with bitter Anguiſh of Soul. Oh! do not Tempt the Lord on this wiſe, <hi>leſt it do prove impoſſible upon thy Sinning wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly to Renew or Reſtore thee again by Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;</hi> thou wilt have thy <hi>Po<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="23" facs="unknown:016754_0022_0F9DF219D20C0A78"/>
State; Sin being entred, Death ſoon follows. Oh! Remember <hi>Sampſon,</hi> who when he had diſcloſed the token of a <hi>Nazarite,</hi> in which ſtate he ſtood in Covenant with God; yet thought to have ſhaken himſelf, and to have gone forth in his Srength, as at other times, but was miſtaken, <hi>Judges</hi> xvi. 20. <hi>For the Lord was departed from him, though he knew it not.</hi> And ſo, tho' thou haſt known the Lord's Preſence and Power in thy Veſſel, yet take heed of letting in that Treacherous Spirit, to lead thee to Unfaithfulneſs, and to betray the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eaſt of his Truſt and Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies committed to thee, tho' it be but for once; for thereby thou wilt render thy ſelf unworthy to be found a Witneſs of his Power another time; for the Lord will leave that Veſſel, and often doth, and chuſeth other Veſſels to manifeſt himſelf in, that will be more True and Faithful.</p>
            <p>So, Dear Friends, in true and tender Love I have laid theſe things before you, that ye might all be ſtirred up and provoked to Love, and to good Works, that ye might abound in the Grace committed to you; and none of you who have known the Truth, might be entangled with the Wiles of your ſubtil Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and that you that have begun well, might not loſe the things that ye have wrought,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:016754_0023_0F9DF21A82717148"/>
but might perſevere in Well-doing till ye have finiſhed your Courſe in Peace. And Friends, this is the Joy and Delight of thoſe that Labour among you in the Lord, and hereby is our Hand Strengthened, and our Hearts Refreſhed, when we do find ye ſuch as we deſire ye ſhould be, even ſtedfaſt in the Truth; and then alſo do you find us to you-ward, ſuch as ye deſire we ſhould be, even a Refreſhing in the Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Life unto you, and our God Comforts us together, in the mutual Joy and Comfort of his Holy Spirit, working in us, and you.</p>
            <p>And Friends, I am the more drawn forth at this time to viſit you with an Epiſtle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lord hath given me ſome ſight of his great and dreadful Day, and Workings in it, which is at hand, and greatly haſtens, of which I have ſomething to ſay unto you, that ye may be prepared to ſtand in his Day, and may behold his wondrous Working among his Enemies, and have Fellowſhip with his Power therein, and may not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed nor driven away in the Tempeſt, which will be great.</p>
            <p>And as concerning thoſe ſucceeding Times, the Spirit, of the Lord hath ſignified, that they will be Times of Horror and Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to all that have, and yet do reject his Counſel: For as the Days of his Forbearance,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:016754_0024_0F9DF21B395717A8"/>
Warning and Inviting, hath been long, ſo ſhall his Appearance amongſt thoſe that have withſtood him, be Fierce and Terrible; even ſo Terrible, as who ſhall abide his Coming? For the Lord will Work both Secretly and Openly, and his Arm ſhall be manifeſt to his Children in both.</p>
            <p>Secretly he ſhall raiſe up a continual Fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Anguiſh amongſt his Enemies, one againſt another, ſo that being Vexed and Tormented Inwardly, they ſhall ſeek to make each other Miſerable, and delight therein for a little Seaſon; and then the Prevailer muſt be Prevailed over, and the Digger of the Pit muſt Fall therein; and the Confidence that Men have had one in another ſhall Fail, and they will Beguile and Betray one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, both by Counſel and Strength; and as they have banded themſelves to break you, whom God hath Gathered, ſo ſhall they band themſelves one againſt another, to Break, to Spoil and Deſtroy one another; and through the Multitude of their Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, all Credit or Belief, upon the account of their ſolemn Engagement, ſhall Fail; ſo that few Men ſhall count themſelves, or what is their's, ſafe in the Hand of his Friend, who hath not choſen his Safety and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in the pure Light of the unchangeable

War; and the Hearts of Men ſhall be ſtirred in them, and the Nations ſhall be as Waters, into which a Tempeſt, a ſwift Whirl-wind is entred, and even as Waves ſwell up to the diſſolution one of another, and breaking one of another, ſo ſhall the ſwellings of People be: And becauſe of the Hardſhip and Sorrow of thoſe Days, many ſhall ſeek and deſire Death rather than Life.</p>
            <p>Ah! My Heart relents, and is moved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in me in the ſenſe of theſe things, and much more than I can Write or Declare, which the Lord will do in the Earth, and will alſo make haſte to accompliſh among the Sons of Men, that they may know and confeſs, <hi>That the Moſt High doth Rule in the Kingdoms of Men, and pulleth down and ſetteth up accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his own Will: And this ſhall Men do before ſeven times paſs over them, and ſhall be content to give their Glory unto him that ſits in Heaven.</hi>

            <p>But, Oh Friends! while all theſe things are working, and bringing to paſs, repoſe ye your ſelves in the Munition of that Rock that all theſe ſhakings ſhall not move, even in the knowledge and feeling of the Eternal Power of God, keeping you ſubjectly given up to his Heavenly Will, and feel it Daily to Kill and Mortifie that which remains in

any of you, which is of this World; for the Worldly part in any, is the changeable part, and that is up and down, full and empty, joyful and Sorrowful, as things go well or ill in the World: For as the Truth is but one, and many are made partakers of its Spirit; ſo the World is but one, and many are partakers of the Spirit of it; and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as do partake of it, ſo many will be ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and perplexed with it; but they who are ſingle to the Truth, waiting Daily to feel the Life and Virtue of it in their Hearts, theſe ſhall rejoyce in the midſt of Adverſity; theſe ſhall not have their Hearts moved with Fear, nor toſſed with Anguiſh becauſe of Evil Tidings, <hi>Pſalm</hi> cxii. 7, 8.

            <p>And when you ſee Diviſions, and Parties, and Rendings in the Bowels of Nations, and Rumours and Tempeſts in the Minds of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, then take heed of being moved to this Party or to that Party, or giving your Strength to this or that, or councelling this way or that way; but ſtand ſingle to the Truth of God, in which neither War, Rent nor Diviſion is; and take heed of that part in any of you, which truſts and relies upon any ſort of the Men of this World, in the Day of their Proſperity; for the ſame Party will bring you to ſuffer with them in the time of their Adverſity, which will not be long after; for ſtability in that Ground there will be none; But when they ſhall ſay, <hi>Come join with us in this or that,</hi> remember you are joyned to the Lord by his pure Spirit, to walk with him in Peace and in Righttouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and you feeling this, this gathers out of all Buſlings, and Noiſes, and Parties, and Tumults, and leads you to exalt the Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard of Truth and Righteouſneſs, in an Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Converſation, to ſee who will flow un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that; and this ſhall be a Refuge for many of the Weary, Toſſed and Afflicted ones in

            <p>So dearly Beloved Friends and Brethren, who have believed and known the bleſſed Appearance of the Truth, let not your Hearts be troubled at none of theſe things: Oh! let not the things that are at preſent, nor things that are yet to come, move you from Stedfaſtneſs, but rather Double your Diligence, Zeal and Faithfulneſs to the Cauſe of God: For they that know the Work wrought in themſelves, they ſhall Reſt in the Day, of Trouble, <hi>Yea, though the Fig-Tree fail,</hi>

            <opener>
               <salute>Dear Friends and Brethren,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have ſomething farther in my Heart to communicate unto you, in dear and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Love, and in deſire of your Preſervation out of the Snare of your Adverſary; and that is. To Exhort you all to dwell in the pure Judgment of the Truth, which is a Defence upon your Glory; and let none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reave you of this, under any pretence what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever; but as you come to a true feeling of the Life in your ſelves, to which alone the certain Judgment appertaineth, ſo let this Life have freedom, and ſtop it not from the Judging all that which is at Enmity with the Life, and tends to the hurting of the true Plant of God; for I have ſeen a Harm hath come to many who have parted with their Judgment, and ſo have become Unarmed, and the Enemy hath prevailed upon them, (under a pretended Tenderneſs) to permit or ſuffer ſuch things as were hurtful to themſelves and
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:016754_0032_0F9DF222AE279128"/>
others; and though the Lord hath given them Judgment and diſcerning in the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yet were bereaved of that Gift, and ſo by little and little became Beguiled.</p>
            <p>Oh dear Friends! Conſider theſe Days are Perilous Times, and it is needful for every one, to watch in that ſame Eternal Light to which you were firſt turned, that by his Righteous Judgment ye may be Perſerved from every thing in your ſelves that appears contrary to that precious Life of which you have taſted: And when you have ſo done, then to take heed, that the Enemy do not do that by an Inſtrument which (through your watchfulneſs in the Light) he could not do without; and all beware of that affected Tenderneſs that cries out, <hi>Be tender to all, and Pray for all, and mind the Good in all, and Love all, and Judge none, but leave Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to God,</hi> &amp;c. I ſay, Heed not the plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble words of that Spirit which being Guilty, to ſave its own Head from a Stroke, would bereave you of you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Judgment, which God hath given you; and is in <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> truly his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and is to be Adminiſtred in his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Power, for the cleanſing and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clean his Sanctuary; for ſuch as have no Judgment in their goings, are they that know not the true way of Peace, but make
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:016754_0033_0F9DF22372473F10"/>
them crooked Paths, <hi>He that goeth in them ſhall not know Peace,</hi> Iſai. lix. 8.</p>
            <p>But ſome may ſay, <hi>Was not Chriſt Meek and Lowly? and ought not all to be like unto him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis true, my Friends; but there is a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between the Seed's Suffering, and its Reigning, and there are times for them both: And when it doth pleaſe God to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Hour and Power of Darkneſs in the open Perſecutors, to exalt it ſelf againſt his Seed and People, by Perſecution and ſuch like; they are led by his Spirit to appear in Meekneſs and Quietneſs, as a Sheep before the Shearer. But what is this to ſuffering Bad and Perverſe Spirits, that appear under Pretence of the Truth, and yet are out of the Truth, and Enemies to its Proſperity, ſtriving to exalt and ſet up another thing inſtead of the Truth? Such as theſe the Lord doth not require you to uſe only Patience and Meekneſs towards; but if that will not Reclaim them, they muſt know the Judgment of the Truth, and you in it muſt ſtand over them; for in this caſe the Day of the Exaltation of Chriſt is come, and God is crowning Truth with Dominion over every Falſe Spirits and Corrupt Practice thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:016754_0034_0F9DF2246FA15048"/>And therefore, dear Friends, Eye the Lord in his goings forth, and as you feel his Life in you to witneſs againſt any Evil and Corrupt Thing or Practice, uſe Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and keep Sincerity, and turn not Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment backwards; for that which is unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be Judged, and cries out, <hi>Judge none, leave all to God,</hi> &amp;c. The ſame will take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it both to Judge and Rule, but not in the Wiſdom of God; and thoſe that cry out ſo much for Tenderneſs, and againſt Truth's Judgment, the ſame are moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to be drawn out from the Patient Suffering in the Spirit of Chriſt Jeſus, when they ought to appear in the moſt Meekneſs, and to appear Rough and Wrathful in the Striving and Fighting Nature, and are moſt apt to be tempted into a Spirit of Revenge, as hath been ſeen by ſad Experience, for they that loſe the Exerciſe of that by which all ſhould keep Dominion over Deceit, they loſe that Strength by which they ſhould be enabled to ſuffer all things for the ſake of Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p>So, Dear Friends, in that which keeps out the Deſiler and the Betrayer, all wait upon the Lord, that you may have your Armour on, and be Fortified with the Strength, with the Might, and with the Judgments of God,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:016754_0035_0F9DF224EBBBB590"/>
and keep that under in every place, which under Pretence of Tenderneſs and Forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance would make Void the Teſtimony of Truth, or make the Offence of the Croſs to ceaſe in any thing wherein you have been Inſtructed from the Beginning, that the Lord may behold and ſee Judgment Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and be Pleaſed, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> lix. <hi>The Lord took<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and there was no Judgmont, and it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed him;</hi> for thereby Deceit got up, with which it is to be kept down.</p>
            <p>So the Lord God of Power and Wiſdom preſerve you Faithful, and fitted for every good Word and Work; the Strong to watch over the Weak in Singleneſs; and the Weak to be ſubject to the Strong in the Lord, that ſo the pure Plant of Righteouſneſs and Truth may grow in and among you all, to his Praiſe that hath called you; To whom be Glory and Honour for ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>
