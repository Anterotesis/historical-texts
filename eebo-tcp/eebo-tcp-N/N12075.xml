            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE following impartial work was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by and at the request, of the General Convention of the district of the New-Hampshire Grants, and many matters of fact are here inserted, as a short state of the disingenuous cunning of the former government (now State) of New-York, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the inhabitants of said district. Which are humbly dedicated to the candid reader, by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, for the good of mankind</p>

            <head>SOME MISCELLANEOUS REMARKS, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>OUR Author informs us in Page 7th and 8th, viz.
<q>It is unquestionable, that the jurisdiction of this State over the territory which now comprehends the County of Cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, is co-eval with its first formation as a colony under the crown of Great-Britain.</q>
            </p>
            <p>IT is a fact notoriously known, by those that are acquainted with the history of the former government of New-York, that that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment did not extend so far north as the city of Albany, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the accession of King William and Queen Mary to the throne; then we find a commission from their Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>esties, to Henry Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to be materially different from those of the respective Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of New-York before. King William and Queen Mary by their commisions dated the fourth day of January in the first year of their reign, appointed Henry Slaughter to be Governor of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he province of New-York, and the territories depending thereon, in America.</p>
            <p>BEFORE the accession of King William and Queen Mary to the throne, plantations were extended northwardly, either on patents pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured

            <p>THE enlargement in the Commission to Henry Slaughter was in these words, viz.
"And the territories depending thereon in America."
These territories are that extension of jurisdiction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>rst circumscribed limits, terminating south of Albany, called the province of New-York. This territorial extension of jurisdiction was altogether in the arbitration of the crown to cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail or extend; this being the case, the respective Governors can no otherway be judges of the extent of jurisdiction, but by directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Before this, it wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> impossible for the subjects to know it; if they could have known it without his Majesty's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation certifying the same such proclamation would have been needless and impertinent: The truth of the matter is, his Majes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This objection, at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

I readily agree that it would be matter of lamentation, that when we are jointly engaged in a bloody contest, merely to oppose arbitrary power, without us, that we should have occasion to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend against the same within ourselves, especially by those who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess to be friends to liberty. I imagine this objection arises for want of due consideration; we are much mistaken in our views, if we are not proposing that and that only, which will prevent contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and divisions taking place amongst us, and that which will have the most happy effect to unite us in indissoluble bonds of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Certainly if the observations I have made are just, the objection must cease in the mind of every reasonable person; for if we consider that oppression was the cause of this unnatural war, and the oppressions this district has received from the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of New-York are similar (which I think may plainly appear) are we not pursuing the same general cause? The only difference is, that we are contending against the same enemy within, that is also without, and certainly, if arbitrary power without us ought to be punished with vengeance, that within ought to have seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold; therefore we are persuaded, that every one who is a true friend to the liberties of mankind, and has any sense of his own or posterity's good will think the case well deserves a serious consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and ought to be referred to the Honourable the Grand Council of the United State of America, f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>IT has been before observed, that the design of forming govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, was meant for the mutual benefit, peace and happiness of the present and future ages, therefore, since the dissolution of the British power in America, all power, as it was in the beginning, naturally revolves back on the people; it therefore now stands every individual in hand to see what way and mode of government they adopt, as also the boundaries of each State, together with the natural genius, habit and temper of the people which are to make and constitute one body politic.</p>
            <p>AND now, as I view it, we are probationers to act, not only for ourselves, but for posterity, even, in some degree, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

deprived his successors of those liberties and mansions God had given him. Each man is accountable to his creator for the part he now takes, for on the conduct of the present age depends the liberties of millions yet unborn.</p>
            <p>SINCE this vast continent has made this noble stand, have and still continue to weild the sword of liberty, to preserve inviolate the freedom of the present and future ages, and are about to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish new and free States under the authority of the people, it behoves us, as inhabitants of the New-Hampshire Grants, to view with candour our own situation.</p>
            <p>WE principally emigrated from the New-England States, the former laws, rules and regulations of which, were nearly ali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e; in consequence of which, the inhabitants of said Grants, have been taught in one way; their genius and customs have been so near correspondent, that there is the highest probability, that they would unanimously agree on a mode to govern the internal policy of a State, with the greatest unanimity, which is one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est blessings ever bestowed on a free people.</p>
            <p>ON the other hand, the former laws, rules and regulations of the government, now State, of New-York, have been so m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>IT is to be here noted, that those Grants that derived from New-Hampshire pay one shilling proclamation money, and those from New-York, half a crown sterling on each hundred acres, when in the antient part of the province of New-York, Living<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston's Manor, a tract of land about twenty miles square, pays but one beaver's-skin annually, as quit rent; and Bateman's Patent, a valuable tract of about ninety thousand acres, pays only a quit rent of three pounds ten shillings; in fine, all the old settled part of the province pays no more than a trifling acknowledgment.</p>
            <p>THUS it appears by the above resolves, and by a small pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet, dated in Convention, the second of October 1776, and sent from the Honourable the Provincial Congress of the State of New-York to the county of Cumberland, that the said present Honourable Congress, have passed some unreasonable and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressive resolves: A very extraordinary way indeed to collect a sum of money to defray public expence, after the former govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of New-York had by cunning, fraud, threats and deceit, terrified and seduced the inhabitants of some townships to take re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grants of them, at the extortionate price of even 2300 dollars for a township and on said subsequent patents, was added more than <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> three fold quit-rent.</p>
            <p>THIS act of the former government carries the colour of tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in its very visage, and is plain to be seen by the weakest capacity.</p>
            <p>I cannot see why there is not as much tyranny in taking this three-fold quit-rent, since the dissolution of the British power in America, as there was in giving the subsequent patent, for it is still holding up in existence, one of those cruel acts, which indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:015234_0011_0F982CED83D1A940"/>
us to take arms and join our brethren in the several United States, to defend the liberties of the whole.</p>
            <p>BY this the candid reader will easily see the almost infinite disproportion of collecting money for public expence.</p>
            <p>TO understand political power right, and derive it from its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, we must consider what state all men are naturally in, and that is a state of perfect freedom, to order their actions and dispose of their possessions and persons as they shall think fit, within the bounds of the law of nature, without asking leave or depending upon the wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l of any other man. <hi>(Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>k.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A STATE also of equality wherein all power of legislation is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal, no one having more than another, there being nothing more evident than that creatures of the same species and rank, promiscuously born to all the same advantages of nature and the use of the same faculties, should be equal one amongst another, without subordination or subjection, only what is absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to keep up good laws, rules and regulations amongst mankind.</p>
            <p>THE natural and just rights of a free people is first, the making and, secondly, executing their own laws: On these two branches depends the liberties of a free people, and are guarded by having the controul of those branches in their own hands. And now the inhabitants of the district of the New-Hampshire Grants, being invested with such powers as the God of nature has blessed them with; although Delegates from the counties of Cumberland and Gloucester have been admitted to sit in the Honourable Provincial Congress of New-York, yet the following will plainly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, that they were not legally chosen by the inhabitants of said counties at large; for it would be unreasonable, even to suppose, that the inhabitants of said district of the New <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

               </gap>rnestly contending, without any hopes of redress.</p>
            <p>THAT in consequence of circular letters from said Congress of New-York, dated May 31, 1776, requesting the counties of Cumberland and Gloucester, to send delega<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es to sit in Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and assist them in making and establishing a code of laws for said State, the following method was made use of in choosing the three Delegates for the county of Cumberland, viz. The three first in nomination for w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>om the greatest number of votes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, were declared accepted without allowing a negative voice, when at the same time it was generally conceeded to by the said County Convention, that it was contrary to the free voice of three-fourths of the inhabitants of said county, to elect delegates to represent them in Convention aforesaid, or to be otherwise connected with them; so that by this method of choosing, if one man has ten votes, another five, and another three, they would be severally chosen by the people at large, to assist in the establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a code of laws, by which the whole are to be governed. True this mode of choosing is a sure and quick method of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a choice the first attempt, and where a community are agreed in the mode, is justifiable, but this mode would be very wrongly applied to these counties, considering the aged conflict which has subsisted so long, and with such impetuousity, as to spill the blood of several of its inhabitants. It ever was and still is disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable for the inhabitants of those counties, to be and remain within the jurisdiction of New-York, therefore, according to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural liberty, a vote should have been first obtained for choosing delegates, and secondly (if that were compleated) the mode of choosing; that is, the inhabitants of each town, in their public town meeting, appointed for that purpose, to deliver to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator or clerk, their votes severally, in writing, which votes to be carefully sealed up in the presence of such meeting and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly conveyed to some meet person, duly appointed to receive and deliver the same to the chairman of the county committee, who, with a quorum, is to compleat what is further <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

thereon; but not in the clandestine way of designing men's going to the habitations of private individuals to collect votes.</p>
            <p>IN the County of Cumberland there is upwards of two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand voters, out of which there was but three hundred and sixty-eight in favour of electing delegates, to sit in the Honourable Convention of New-York, viz. For Colonel Joseph Marsh 358, For Captain John Sessions 172, and for Simon Stevens, <abbr>Esq</abbr> 166. Six or seven towns in said county did at the same time enter their protest against election, and even the county committee, who gave the Delegates their credentials, did restrict them to particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, reserving to themselves, in behalf of the county, a right of absenting from the State of New-York, whenever a suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able opportunity would admit thereof; yet, Messrs Sessions and Stevens, two of the delegates of Cumberland county (if I may so call them) declared in Congress, that they were chosen by the people at large, that the committee who gave them their instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and sent the said letter to the Convention, were elected long before their own election as deputies for said county; that their credentials from the county gave them full and unrestrained power in forming a government; that they conceive themselves no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bound by their instruction, than they shall appear to be right and beneficial; but, that when, even on debate, it should appear, that those instructions might work an injury to the State, or if on any question they should be out voted, they should not consider themselves bound by their instructions; and further, that as Representatives of said county, they fully acknowledged the jurisdiction of this State over the said county and its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants.</p>
            <p>THIS representation seems to be big with great mischief; for surely if there was any validity in their credentials, there was equally the same in their instructions, for they both derived from one committee, and were both joined on one paper, and all done in one day, and if their credentials gave them a seat in that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable house, they must consequently follow their instruction or
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:015234_0014_0F982CEFC3A194A8"/>

            <p>THUS it appears that out of above two thousand voters, in the county of Cumberland, but three hundred and sixty-eight could be persuaded to vote for delegates, and by no means a majority in the county of Gloucester, and not one on the west side of the range of Green Mountains, in the latter of which is full half of the inhabitants in said district.</p>
            <p>BY this the candid reader will see, that there has but a very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable part of the inhabitants in said district, ever attempted to delegate power of legislation to any body politic, and those un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der particular restrictions: Therefore the inhabitants of said Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trict, have the sole exclusive and inherent right, to govern their internal police; in consequence of which, it now behoves every one to be critical in establishing a plan of Government, for it will be like a seed sown, which will spring up, with boughs either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to secure the liberties of Millions yet unborn, or else to skreen the wicked designs of crafty usurpers.</p>
            <p>BUT let us take a retrospect view of the former government of New-York and their conduct towards us, and then candidly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider whether the said State would not be as well off, without the district of the New-Hampshire Grants, as with, and then see if it would not be to the benefit, peace and happiness of the inhabitants of both, for the district of the New Hampshire Grants, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in a new State.</p>
            <p>LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR COLDEN represented to his Majesty and Privy Council, that it would be greatly to the advantage of the inhabitants of the district of lands to the westward of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut River, which had been before granted by the government of New-Hampshire, to be under the jurisdiction of the province of New-York, and that Connecticut River was a good and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

boundary line to divide the two respective provinces, and further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, that Hudson's River was navigable a great way into the country, and the situation of the New-Hampshire Grants, was such, as would naturally constitute that river the center of trade and commerce, for the inhabitants of those Grants, by the naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which, they could easily send exports to the city of New-York, and receive and return such articles as they would; and that it would therefore be much more convenient and happy for them to be under the jurisdiction of New-York, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>THIS Representation of Lieutenant Governor Colden was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy, and would appear so to be, to any gentleman that knew the situation of the New-Hampshire Grants: as to a few towns, in the south-west corner of the district of lands aforesaid, I grant that Hudson's River will naturally constitute that the center of trade to the inhabitants thereof, and a small part of the south-east cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the said district, from their remote situation from Hudson's River, Lake Champlain, &amp;c. and their contiguousness to Connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticut River, will naturally constitute that the center of trade for its inhabitants; but far the greater part of the district of lands aforesaid, from their remote situation from Hudson's River, navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation in Connecticut River and the eastern sea-ports, from the contiguousness thereof to Lake Champlain, Chamblee, Montreal on the river St. Lawrence, &amp;c. will naturally constitute them the center of trade for the inhabitants thereof.</p>
            <p>THIS being the situation of the district of the New-Hampshire Grants as to trade, and had it not been for self-interest, that is, by the handle of jurisdiction, to over-reach and seduce the people by cunning, fraud, violence and oppression, so as to make the landed interest of the New-Hampshire Grants their own, will plainly appear by their conduct towards us.

which, on trial, produced writs of possession; then the posse commitatus, consisting of about 700 men were raised to enforce possession, then the spirited inhabitants assembled with arms, to repel force by force; from this the inhabitants of said district may date the beginning of the war for our rights and liberties, which we have now joined the United States of America in; I have been a personal actor in both scenes, but can see no odds in the nature of the dispute, however much they may differ in their degree.</p>

               </gap>h of March 1775, in which several persons were actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally murdered—Oh horrid scene!</p>
            <p>SOME of those officers, thus appointed, were very officious in advising the inhabitants to take re-grants of their lands, they were also terrified by threats from said province, that if the people did not comply with their terms they should lose all their possessions, by which means they seduced the inhabitants of some towns so as to take subsequent patents.</p>
            <p>THE Governor and Council of New-York have been aiding, assisting and consenting to a mandamus being laid on the antient town of Hinsdale, which was first appropriated by a purchase from the Indians, secondly by a gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t from the Massachusetts-Bay, thirdly by the government of New-Hampshire, and fourthly, by an uninterrupted possession and occupancy about seventy years.</p>
            <p>THE Assembly of New York in their state of the rights of the colony of New-York, &amp;c. in order to rid their government of the blame justly due, say, that said mandamus proceeded from the crown, and was an act decisive in itself.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:015234_0021_0F982CF5033EE6F0"/>A very extraordinary representation, the right of election is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stricted entirely to crown lands, whereon no christian subject to the crown is settled by possession or otherwise. Common sense may teach, that a manda<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>us, or any other crown grant, cannot subvert the property which the subject holds under the crown, by virtue of prior grants; that would overturn all grants and make the King absolute.</p>
            <p>THUS it plainly appears, that self-interest was the moving cause of the government aforesaid making such a representation to the court of Great-Britain; had it not been for sake of profit to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, it is not likely they would ever have troubled his Majesty on this subject, and if they had done it in the simplicity of their hearts, to accommodate the inhabitants in general as to trade, &amp;c. they would have solicited his Majesty to annex said district to the province of Quebec, as said grants are bound about 100 miles on the eastern shores of Lake Champlain and from the north end of said lake to Chamblee is twelve miles land carriage, and to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treal eighteen, near the latter, in the river St. Lawrence, seventy-gun ships have sailed.</p>
            <p>I cannot see that it would be any way incompatible, provided the inhabitants of said district should trade to New-York, Connecticut river, Lake Champlain, &amp;c. and be in a new State; it never was supposed, that jurisdictional lines were so drawn, that each govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would have sea ports in them, so as to best accommodate every part; but in free states, every part of the country trades to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ighest and best sea-ports, without any regard to jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal lines, witness the western part of the Massachusetts-Bay and Connecticut, they have made their main trade to the city of New-York ever since the origin of their settlements.</p>
            <p>I have heard some people raise this objection, viz. That it was inconvenient for the district of the New-Hampshire Grants to be a State, for the sole reason of there not being a seaport in said district. I freely grant we have none, and if we were annexed to
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:015234_0022_0F982CF5C38590C8"/>
any other State that would not bring a seaport any nearer to us; those things are immovable, yet I think we are as well off as ever any inland State was, in consequence of our bordering so far on Lake Champlain, &amp;c. by which means the State may be supplied with all kinds of goods at a reasonable rate, and make a good market for all such species as are to be spared in exchange. In some parts of the world there is inland kingdoms, and why not inland States; we have our advantages and disadvantages in this as well as in all oth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:015234_0026_0F982CF8C38B1EA8"/>WHEN civil laws should again take place, doubtless there would be many actions appealed up to the supreme court at New-York, and as the state would be so large, doubtless they would be full of business, for that and many other reasons, it is likely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions would be continued from one session to another, no doubt some very disputable cases, that would need numbers of evidences personally to speak: What an amazing expence it must be, for a man to go 450 miles to attend a court in this situation, yet his action may be put along through several courts. In this way of expence would go many thousand pounds out of this district.</p>
            <p>THE great distance of road betwixt this district and New York, is alone a convincing argument, that the God of nature never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed said district should be under the jurisdiction of said State.</p>
            <p>I Now appeal to the impartial reader, which of these two ways would be best, wisest and cheapest, both for the district of the New-Hampshire Grants and the State of New-York.</p>
            <l>— Brave countrymen,</l>
            <l>We 're here assembled for the toughest fight</l>
            <l>That ever strain'd the force of American arms,</l>
            <l>See you wide field with glit'ring numbers gay,</l>
            <l>Vain of their strength, they challenge us for slaves,</l>
            <l>And bid us yield their pris'ners at discretion!</l>
            <l>If there's an American among you all</l>
            <l>Whose soul can basely truckle to such bondage,</l>
            <l>Let him depart! For me, I swear by Heaven,</l>
            <l>By my great father's soul and by my fame,</l>
            <l>My country ne'er shall pay a ransom for me;</l>
            <l>Nor will I stoop to drag out life in bondage,</l>
            <l>And take my pittance from a Briton's hands.</l>
            <l>This I resolve, and hope, brave countrymen,</l>
            <l>Ye all resolve the same.</l>
