            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE deſire thou intimatedſt to me, to ſee ſomething written by one of the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of friends, in favor of the exemption from military ſervice, which we, from religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous motives, feel it our duty to adhere to, and upon principles of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> right, to expect will not be denied us, in the United-States of America; and the ſatisfaction I derive from conferring with thee on ſubjects of ſerious import, prompt me to addreſs thee at this time.</p>
            <p>To do juſtice to the ſubject, is what I do not pretend; nor ſhall I enter into a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the ſoundneſs or fallacy of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which dictate to us, the obſervance of this conduct—Theological controverſy, or an attempt to confute the religious tenets of any ſect, is, in my opinion, improper. Let
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:028967_0004_0FDDC65D49B1A8B0"/>
every one have free acceſs to every ſource of human information in religious concerns, of which mankind is poſſeſſed; and practiſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out controul, thoſe precepts, which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves it is his duty to obſerve. If this be conceded, it neceſſarily follows, that it would be equally improper for me, to inſiſt upon the orthodoxy of a practice, which thy ſenſe of religious obligation does not enjoin thee to, in order to convince thee of the expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of leaving me to the exerciſe of it.</p>
            <p>It is not, therefore, upon the ground of our ſcrupulouſneſs, in this reſpect, being well founded, that we require to be exempted, (though it be the real one for our refuſing to do military ſervice,) but, upon the ground of unreſtrained FREEDOM of OPINIONS, which is the BIRTH-RIGHT—the CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STITUTIONAL RIGHT of EVERY CITIZEN of THESE STATES, whether in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious or other concerns: to enjoy which, was the leading object of the grant for the territory of Pennſylvania being obtained from Charles the ſecond, by William Penn, under whoſe auſpices, our anceſtors migrated thither, and firſt began to feel the bleſſings which their inoffenſiveneſs, and mortal and religious ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits were ſuited to afford them, under the benign influence of religious liberty—bleſſings, in the enjoyment of which we were (though a Britiſh colony) up to the late revolution in America.—And will the citizens of this new born nation, place us in a worſe ſituation than we were before, and debar us from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:028967_0005_0FDDC663B7C71D20"/>
to enjoy them? Would it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the ſpirit which actuated them to undertake, and in accompliſhing that revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution? Every one who has learnt the politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal creed of 1774, knows that it would not.—The conſtitution of the union, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſecure to the citizens, as well qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, as others, thoſe bleſſings, which they acquired by the revolution, declares that it is not: "Congreſs ſhall make no law reſpecting an eſtabliſhment of religion, or PROHIBIT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING THE FREE EXERCISE THEREOF."</p>
            <p>I am aware, that it has been tauntingly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by ſome, that it is from the impulſe of fear and cowardice, and not from a ſenſe of religious duty, that we deſert the ſcenes of human bloodſhed, and renounce the laurels which adorn the hero. This obſervation, however, I am perſuaded, obtains belief with few, if any, who have had an opportunity of aſſociating with many of the ſociety of friends; and thoſe who have never had ſuch an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, are incompetent judges of the truth of the obſervation:—The ardor of youth, ambition, and other powerful ſprings, which exiſt in the human breaſt, it may be reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably ſuppoſed, are common to the members of our, as well as to thoſe of every other ſociety; but it is the early and aſſiduous care, which is beſtowed upon the formation of our minds, and the direction of our ideas, which firſt initiates us into the habit of reſtraining our ambition, and other paſſions; and finally deters us from engaging in the field of battle:
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:028967_0006_0FDDC6675A1D2670"/>
and permit me to add, that true bravery as aſſuredly exiſts, where fortitude and human<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity reſide, as that, the man who can reſtrain the force of his paſſions, is poſſeſſed of no ſmall ſhare of thoſe qualities.</p>
            <p>The effects of conſcientious ſcrupulouſneſs upon a religious mind, can not be better ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplified, than they were in William Penn:—the ſacrifices, which were made by him, in the ſpring of his life, can not be accounted for, upon any other ground, than that of a religious ſenſe of duty; unleſs they be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to an eccentricity of mind, or a dere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liction of his ſenſes: cauſes, to which the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of his ſubſequent conduct, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency and ſucceſs which diſtinguiſhed his arduous and philanthoropic enterpriſes and writings, and (if I may be allowed to add) the patronage of his ſovereign, unite to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid is from aſcribing the great and deſerved reſpect and fame, which wait upon, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuate his memory.</p>
            <p>And yet ſome of thoſe very precepts of this great and worthy chriſtian, have been occaſionally the ſport of many, and the cauſe of much ſuffering and diſtreſs to individuals of the ſociety, impoſed on them too, by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary authority; until they have ſunk their profeſſors below the level of public ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, or private ſcorn; and again have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to them, the reſpect and eſteem of moſt, and been adopted by many.</p>
            <p>The ſcruples of friends are ſeveral, and it may ſerve to evince the materiality in which
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:028967_0007_0FDDC668A34E5098"/>
we hold an obſervance of them, to enquire whether we relaxed or grew leſs tenacious in adhering to them, either from the ſufferings to which they ſubjected us, or from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſive elapſe of time.</p>
            <p>One of them reſpects the conforming to the taking an oath. Friends hold the truth obligatory on them always, and that the true intention of a corporal or external ceremony, preparatory to ſpeaking it on occaſions of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; is to make the perſon, by ſolemnly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking to adhere to it, in any particular, liable to incur the legal penalties, which await a violation of it, in that particular: but we refuſe to impart ſolemnity to a ceremony of that kind, as frequently practiſed, by making an appeal to, and uſe of the name of the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: from a conviction, that to do ſo, is profane, and repugnant to the text, which enjoins to "ſwear not at all;" though we object not to an innocent form of ſubmiſſion to be puniſhed, if we violate the truth. This form I need not tell thee, is by oral affirmation; for which we were perſecuted under the ſtatute of 13 &amp; 14 C. II. Ch. 1. and by the magiſtracy of that time, in a manner which is equally diſgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the government of England, and officers under it. Although branded with infamy, for refuſing the oaths of allegiance, ſupremacy and abjuration, and ſubjected to lingering con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finements, loathſome priſons, without neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary ſubſiſtence, or the communion of friends or relatives, under pretext that our refuſal proceeded from diſaffection to the royal family,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:028967_0008_0FDDC66A053BB8C0"/>
to the renunciation of papal authority, and to the government of Great Britain, yet the ſteady and inflexible perſeverance of the ſociety, in not complying, ſurmounted and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived parliamentary oppoſition, and magiſterial tyranny.</p>
            <p>After the ſociety were expoſed to and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced theſe evils during many years, for ſuppoſed criminality, reſulting from the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, perhaps intentional, on the part of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, of attributing the conſcientious ſcrupulouſneſs of the quaker, to the diſloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty of the ſubject, they were mitigated by the act of 8 G. I. Ch. 6: the effects of which however were but little felt in the courts of juſtice in England, until the 22. G. II. Ch. 46 § 36. To this day, in that country, a quaker is not admitted to affirm in criminal caſes, to ſerve on juries, or bear any office of profit under government.</p>
            <p>Friends ſcrupled alſo to pay tithes, rates, or other payments, for the ſtipend or main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of hireling miniſters or curates; on which account, in England, the ſociety have laboured under much impoſition, from the mode in which they are diſtrained for, and collected. The annual amounts of theſe are ſet forth, in the epiſtles from the yearly-meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of friends, and amount to a far greater tax than they would do, were they paid vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily; notwithſtanding which, the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them is refuſed to this day.</p>
            <p>Thus, the government of England im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon the quakers, penalties for diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:028967_0009_0FDDC66D2191F6B0"/>
from the regulations and doctrines of its church, as ſoon as the ſociety made its appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, which was about the reſtoration; at the ſame time, that the ſame government were exerciſing the like diſcretion or privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, in denying the dogmas of the church of Rome, and reſiſting the papal authority, which they had, for between eight and nine centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, before acknowledged and ſubmitted to.</p>
            <p>In America, our ſociety is relieved from the grievances to which it is ſubjected in Great Britain, in theſe reſpects—nor do I ſee why re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious liberty ſhould be limitted to theſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges only—it is to be hoped, and reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to be expected, that we ſhall not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to ſuffer ſo much in America, before we attain to the enjoyment of the ſame ſhare of diſcretion in carrying arms, as we ſuffered in England on account of our ſcrupulouſneſs to ſwear, and to contribute to the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenace of the miniſters of other religious ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; that arbitrary acts of congreſs will not be paſſed in imitation of the ſtatute of Charles II. to take away the freedom of the mind in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious concerns, whilſt the liberty of politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal opinions, which are more apt to affect the harmony of ſocial compacts, be preſerved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violate and unlimited.</p>
            <p>The duſt of time, would never hide the ſtain which ſuch a meaſure would throw upon the national character of this country—it has tarniſhed, and will tarniſh for ever the luſtre with which Great Britain once excelled eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry contending rival; though it may be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:028967_0010_0FDDC66E951195D0"/>
that the ſtatute of Charles originated whilſt, and where witchcraft and ſorcery, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment and conjuration, were ſeriouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, and ſeverely puniſhed, by legiſlative interference—but, as the minds of men are more enlarged and enlightened by the progreſs of ſcience, experience and civilization, the opinions, and tenets, and, it is to be hoped, the ſcruples of each other become more and more generally reſpected, though more vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant and divers; as the clouds of ſuperſtition paſs from over the heads of the majority of the people, theſe phantoms of ignorance va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh from their minds, and the rigor of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties, inflicted upon difference in opinions, is moderated and done away—the illiberal and prejudiced ſtate, in which minds ſo bewil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered muſt have been, is the beſt excuſe that can be made, for the perſecuting ſpirit with which they purſued the few who dared to diſſent from the generally received opinions of the nation, an excuſe, however, which could never be offered for the imitation of ſuch an example in this country.</p>
            <p>That the infliction of fines, or other pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, would be as ineffectual in reccon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling quakers in America, to carry arms, as they proved in prevailing upon them in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland to make oath; there is no reaſon to doubt.</p>
            <p>It is therefore, with much uneaſineſs, that I learn from the 17th clauſe of the militia bill, which is poſtponed until the next ſeſſion of congreſs, that ſuch citizens as are conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiouſly

ſcrupulous of bearing arms, are to be exempted from doing ſo, upon paying a fine—to pay a fine, in lieu of bearing arms, would be as repugnant to the principles of friends, as the performance of the ſervice, from which it were to exempt them; and for reaſons ſynonymous to thoſe, which deter them from contributing to the ſupport and maintenance of hireling miniſters—to collect theſe fines, therefore, the ſubordinate magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracy of the country muſt interpoſe their authority, which will put it in their power (and their inclination to exerciſe it in general can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied) to impoſe upon and diſtreſs the unfortunate victims of their rapacity, to a-degree far beyond every benefit, which the country could derive from ſuch a ſource of revenue. The moleſtation and diſturbance of that claſs of the citizens, denominated qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, which conſtitutes too, in ſome places, the more conſiderable part, would, as well as be unjuſt and unconſtitutional in itſelf, ſerve to interrupt the harmony, and to deſtroy the wholeſome effect, which the decorous and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious diſcipline and regulations of that ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, are calculated to produce to every claſs of a community; and which candor cannot but acknowledge, are diſtinguiſhed excellencies in the pacific department of municipal ſcience. The advantages which the community derive from theſe, would be felt no more: and the amount of the fines, after being extorted, would not compenſate the loſs of them. It is a maxim, that the law ought not to require
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:028967_0012_0FDDC6718A4EDAE0"/>
impoſſibilities; and it is the language of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and religion, that a man ſhould not be forced to wrong his own conſcience: and a quaker muſt either do the latter, or be inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of complying with the requiſites of this clauſe of the bill—it would be tantamount to the taxing the opinions of one claſs of the citizens, in excluſion of every other. To tax a man for not doing a particular ſervice, which his <hi>conſcience</hi> forbids <hi>him</hi> to do, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to make up for that omiſſion, is as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, as it would be to extra-tax the members of a community, who poſſeſs one kind of property, to make their contribution equivalent to that, which the public coffers receive from thoſe who poſſeſs another kind of property.</p>
            <p>Why then ſhould friends be prohibited the exemption from military ſervice which they claim? Let us proceed to enquire into ſome of the reaſons which are aſſigned againſt it.</p>
            <p>One of them, and which is ſaid to diſplay the abſurdity of the claim, is, that if ſuch a ſcruple were to prevail in the breaſts of a large majority of a nation, ſelf defence muſt be diſpenſed with, and the nation ſubmit to the injuſtice and will of their invaders.</p>
            <p>I might ſafely admit the reaſon, ſo far as it is applicable to this ſubject, without receiving any injury from its force—for, though a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority of the people view a religious tenet as ridiculous or abſurd, yet the voice of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority cannot, conſiſtent with the federal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, forbid the exerciſe of it: otherwiſe,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:028967_0013_0FDD5F75313559E0"/>
a majority would eſtabliſh a national religion. But I think no ſuch abſurdity is apparent, and without ſoliciting thy acquieſcence in my reaſons for thinking ſo, I will barely ſtate them.</p>
            <p>Let me firſt take the objection, upon the largeſt poſſible ſcale; and ſuppoſe the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of friends in this reſpect, to be obſerved by every nation in the world—in this point of view, the objection vaniſhes. The energy of the principle, itſelf, becomes the bulwark of ſelf-defence—no violence would be offered to the rights of each other, to require oppoſition; but this mode of reaſoning, however juſt, were mankind as they ought to be, regardful of the rights of one another, is objectionable on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the inapplicability of it, to the actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſtate in which mankind are—then, the queſtion reſults to this: viewing the ſtates of human ſocieties, as they really exiſt, might the invaſions of the rights of nations or ſtates, which take place, be prevented or adjuſted without having recourſe to arms? For and againſt this queſtion, much metaphyſical and theoretic reaſoning might be adduced—but as thy own ingenuity may ſuggeſt, and thy own judgment decide upon it, perhaps as well without, as with many comments of mine, I ſhall do little more than recur to the teſt of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience for the ſolution of the query.</p>
            <p>Experience teaches, that man can effect more by the powers of his mind, than he can by thoſe of his body. The latter, form the firſt and chief dependence of man, in a ſtate of nature, as well to ſupport, as to protect and defend
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:028967_0014_0FDDC677DEA48B20"/>
himſelf. But, they barely enable the ſavage to obtain a ſcanty nouriſhment for his body, whilſt the citizen, by the former, is put into the full enjoyment, of not only the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, but all the elegancies and luxuries of life. However, to protect and defend ourſelves, in the enjoyment of theſe advantages, we ſeem to remain in a natural ſtate, reſorting to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and oppreſſion againſt the invader; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to the ſame ſyſtem, which man, in a barbarous and rude ſtate, is impelled to obſerve, for the purpoſes of abſtract ſelf-preſervation. Little doubt exiſts with me, but that an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternative may always be found out, if as much ingenuity were expended for the purpoſe, as there uſually is to excel in arts of cruelty; and which might be as ſuperior to the uſe of arms, as the civilized purſuits of agriculture, commerce, and navigation, are to the robuſt toils of the chace, for the acquirement of the neceſſaries and comforts of life.</p>
            <p>It is inconſiſtent with chriſtianity to reſort to arms—one crime will not juſtify another. The <hi>lex talionis</hi> is not a part of the chriſtian religion, and the uſing of arms, to reſiſt an attack, is returning violence for violence, and oppoſing force with force; involving our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the like criminality; and making ourſelves as deſerving of chaſtiſement as they are on whom we inflict it, for imitating the evil example which incurs our diſpleaſure. Even, if in this inſtance, the rules of religion were inconſiſtent with the exigency of the occaſion, the latter ought to ſubmit to the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:028967_0015_0FDDC6790F5D0B60"/>
former; but ſuch an exigency cannot exiſt, for it were to create a dilemma in the mind of a chriſtian, to render it <hi>neceſſary</hi> for him to <hi>do</hi> that, which it is his <hi>duty not</hi> to do—in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, I think, this has teen fairly tried and evinced, in the ſettlement of Pennſylvania.</p>
            <p>That country was inhabited by, and in the poſſeſſion of the aborigines, at the time that William Penn landed there. They regarded the ſoil as their own. They were in a ſavage ſtate, diſpoſed to be inimical to whoever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to ſettle upon their lands, and to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the encroachments of European emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grants. But the meaſures of William Penn were not thoſe of force, not the uſe of arms, not the exertion of power, he ſought not to entwine his temples with the trophies of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, or to reader himſelf terrible—he ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his brow with the olive, and diſtributed its branches among the belligerent tribes—his meaſures were at once adequate to the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of every object that he had in view, and were calculated to eſtabliſh and preſerve har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony with, to acquire the friendſhip of, and to do juſtice to thoſe, who were the prior oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupants of the ſoil. No bloodſhed, no ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem, no outrage took place, but the ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the colony, reſted upon the confidence of the Indians, and was preſerved by a due adherence to juſtice and humanity.</p>
            <p>Contraſt the progreſs and occurrences on this occaſion, with thoſe of the colonization of New-Spain, and ſay, what benefit was there which was derived by the Spaniſh ſettlers,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:028967_0016_0FDDC67CDB7FC3B0"/>
which was not enjoyed by the companions of William Penn? And yet, the former conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by maſſacre, whilſt the latter ſubdued the ſavage, by contributing to the alleviation of his neceſſities. The former triumphed by the arts of war, the latter, by thoſe of peace. Hence, I think, it may be inferred, that the impracticability of effecting by pacific mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, all that violent ones are capable of, is at leaſt very problematical, if not improbable.</p>
            <p>The ſame ſpirit which dictated the policy of ſtates and nations to decide differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them by arms, it may be reaſonably be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, ſuggeſted thoſe ſanguinary codes of criminal juriſprudence, which prevail, in moſt, for the preſervation of tranquillity and order among the individuals of each, and for the puniſhment of ſuch as tranſgreſs, the munici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal regulations of them.</p>
            <p>The injuſtice and cruelty of theſe codes, have, of late years, been greatly deprecated, and owe their continuance in a great meaſure, to a belief, that more moderate ones would be found leſs adequate to the prevention of crimes. But this opinion grows weaker and weaker every day; and the ſtate of Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania, has ſet an example, in trying the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment of a reform in this reſpect, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies, and ſucceſs of which, render it worthy of imitation in every civilized coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
            <p>Another objection, which is made to the exemption of friends from military ſervice, is the unfairneſs and unreaſonableneſs of a part
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:028967_0017_0FDDC67E48FBC248"/>
only of the citizens, being compellable to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it. But, if this be a natural, a conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutional right, reſerved to the citizens of that deſcription, with which however all diſpenſe, who come not within the already cited clauſe of the conſtitution, no unfairneſs, or unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs exiſts, becauſe it is the free and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary act of thoſe, who do not claim the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption, which impoſes upon them the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of ſuch ſervice: or, if this were not the caſe, ought not the degree in which friends contribute to the preſervation of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity and order, in a ſtate, and the rarity of its laws, being violated by members of the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, to entitle them to ſome indulgence of their conſcientious ſcrupulouſneſs to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to military ſervice?</p>
            <p>That ſuch an exemption would not afford an opportunity to others, who might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of eluding military ſervice; to avoid the performance of it, will appear manifeſt to every one, who makes enquiry into the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid diſcipline of the ſociety, in identifying thoſe, who are entitled to memberſhip in it, and of particularly diſclaiming the pretenſions of ſuch as are not. But as thou art, though not one of the ſociety, ſufficiently informed on this point, it is unneceſſary for me, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into a detail of the regulations and rules of the ſociety, to diſplay the impoſſibility of ſuch an evaſion becoming practicable.</p>

               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:028967_0018_0FDDC68047574D90"/>
I therefore diſmiſs the ſubject here, nor ſhall I detain thy attention longer, with aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of perſonal regard, perſuaded as I am, that it is unneceſſary for me to expreſs, with how much eſteem and ſincerity, I continue thy friend, and well-wiſher,</p>
