            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE Excellency of the Goſpel Diſpenſation is evidenced by nothing more, than thoſe Sanctions of Rewards and Puniſhments, which it offers to the Choice of all its Profeſſors, in order to invite or compel them to be obedient to its Precepts. — For it promiſes no leſs than Eternal Happineſs to the Good, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces no ſlighter a Puniſhment than Everlaſting Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery againſt the Wicked. On the one Hand, <hi>it is a Savour of Life unto Life,</hi> on the other, <hi>a Savour of Death unto Death.</hi> And tho' <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> would imagine the bare mentioning of the former would be ſufficient to draw Men to their Duty, yet Miniſters in all Ages have found it neceſſary frequently to remind their Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the latter, and to ſet before them the Tenors of the LORD, as ſo many powerful Diſſuaſives from Sin.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:040229_0003_1015D51142C048E0"/>But whence is it that Men are ſo diſingenuous? —Why, the Reaſon ſeems to be this.— The Promiſe of Eternal Happineſs on our Well-doing, is ſo agreeable to the Inclinations and Wiſhes of Mankind, that all that call themſelves Chriſtians, univerſally and willingly ſubſcribe to the Belief of it. But then there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo ſhocking in the Conſideration of Eternal <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and ſeemingly ſuch an infinite Diſproportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween an endleſs Duration of Pain, and a ſhort Life ſpent in Pleaſure, that Men (ſome at leaſt of them) can ſcarcely be brought to confeſs it as an Article of their Faith, that an Eternity of Miſery awaits the Wicked in a future State.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore at this Time beg Leave, to inſiſt on the proof of this Part of one of the Articles of our Creed; and endeavour <hi>to make good</hi> what our bleſſed LORD has here threatned in the Words of the Text, that <hi>Theſe,</hi> that is, the <hi>Wicked, ſhall go away into Everlaſting Puniſhment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Accordingly, without conſidering the Words as they ſtand in Relation to the Context, I ſhall reſolve all I have to ſay into this one general Propoſition,—
<q>That the Torments reſerved for the Wicked here after are Eternal.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But before I proceed to make good this, I muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you that I take it for granted,</p>
            <p>All here preſent ſtedfaſtly believe,
<q>They have ſomething within them, which we call a Soul, and which is capable of ſurviving the Diſſolution of the Body, and of being miſerable or happy to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I take it for granted farther,
<q>That you believe a Divine Revelation; that thoſe Books, emphatically
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:040229_0004_1015D508C9E802C0"/>
called <hi>the Scriptures,</hi> were written by the Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of GOD, and that the Things therein contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are founded upon Eternal Truth.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I take it for granted laſtly,
<q>That you believe, that the Son of GOD came down to die for Sinners; that there is but one Mediator between GOD and Man, even the Man CHRIST JESUS.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Things being granted (and they were neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be premiſed) proceed we now <hi>to make good</hi> the one general Propoſition mentioned before, and aſſerted in the Text, that
<q>The Torments reſerved for the Wicked hereafter are Eternal.</q>
— <hi>Theſe,</hi> ſays our bleſſed LORD, <hi>ſhall go away into Everlaſting Puniſhment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt Argument I ſhall advance to prove that the Torments reſerved for the Wicked hereafter are eternal (for I have taken it for granted, that you believe thoſe Books, emphatically called <hi>the Scriptures,</hi> were written by the Inſpiration of GOD, and that the Things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained therein are founded upon Eternal Truth) is, That the Word of GOD himſelf, aſſures us, Line upon Line, that it will be ſo.</p>
            <p>To quote all the Texts that might be produced in Proof of this, would be endleſs.—Let it ſuffice to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance only in a few.—In the <hi>Old-Teſtament,</hi> in the Book of <hi>Daniel,</hi> Chap. xii. ver. 2. we are told, that <hi>Some ſhall awake to Everlaſting Life, and others to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Contempt.</hi>—In the Book of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> it is ſaid, that <hi>The Worm of thoſe that have tranſgreſſed GOD's Law, ſhall not die, nor their Fire be quenched.</hi>—And in another Place, the Holy Prophet, ſtruck, no doubt, with Aſtoniſhment and Horror at the Proſpect of the Continuance of the Torments of the Damned, breaks out into this moving Expoſtulation, <hi>Who can dwell with Everlaſting Burnings?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:040229_0005_1015D51396D9DE68"/>The <hi>New-Teſtament</hi> is ſtill fuller as to this Point, it being a Revelation which brought this and ſuch-like Particulars to a clear Light.—The Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> tells us of the profane Deſpiſers of Dignities in his Days, that <hi>for them was reſerved the Blackneſs of Darkneſs for ever.</hi>—And in the Book of the <hi>Revelations</hi> it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that <hi>The Smoke of the Torments of the Wicked aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendeth for ever and ever.</hi>—And if we believe the Witneſs of Men inſpired, the Witneſs of the Son of GOD, who had the Spirit given him, as he was a Mediator, without Meaſure, is ſtill far greater.—And he, in St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s Goſpel, repeats this ſolemn Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration three ſeveral Times. <hi>It is better for Thee to enter into Life maimed</hi>; that is, it is better to forego the Gratification of thy Luſt, or incur the Diſpleaſure of a Friend, which may be as dear to thee as a Hand, or as uſeful as a Foot, <hi>than having two Hands and Feet,</hi> that is, for indulging the one, or diſobeying GOD to oblige the other, <hi>to be caſt into Hell, where the Worm dieth not, and the Fire is not quenched.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here again, in the Words of the Text, <hi>Theſe,</hi> that is, the Wicked, ſays he, <hi>ſhall go away into everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Puniſhment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know it has been objected by ſome who have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the Eternity of Hell Torments,
<q>That the Words <hi>Everlaſting</hi> and <hi>Ever and Ever,</hi> are often uſed in the Holy Scriptures, (eſpecially in the <hi>Old-Teſtament</hi>) when they ſignify not an endleſs Dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but a limited Term of Time.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And this we readily grant. But then we reply,
<q>That when the Words are uſed with this Limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they either manifeſtly appear to be uſed ſo from the Context</q>
—or are put in Oppoſition to ſome
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:040229_0006_1015D50A74D38770"/>
occaſional Types which GOD gave his People on ſome ſpecial Occaſions, as when it is ſaid, <hi>it ſhall be a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual or everlaſting Statute,</hi> or <hi>a Statute for ever,</hi> that is, a ſtanding Type, and not merely tranſient or occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, as was the <hi>Pillar of Cloud,</hi> the <hi>Manna,</hi> or ſuch like.—Or laſtly, they have a Relation, to that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant GOD made with his ſpiritual <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which, if underſtood in a ſpiritual Senſe, will be everlaſting, tho' the Ceremonial Diſpenſation be aboliſhed.</p>
            <p>Beſides, it ought to be obſerved, that, ſome of the Paſſages juſt now referred to, have neither of theſe Words ſo much as mentioned in them, and cannot poſſibly be interpreted ſo as to denote only a limited Term of Years.</p>
            <p>But let that be as it will, it is evident even to a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, that the Words of the Text however, will not admit of ſuch a reſtrained Signification, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from their being directly oppoſed to the Words immediately following, <hi>viz. That the Righteous ſhall go into Life eternal.</hi> From which Words, all are ready to grant, that the Life promiſed to the Righteous will be Eternal; and why the Puniſhment threatned to the Wicked ſhould not be underſtood to be Eternal like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, when the very ſame Word in the Original, is uſed to expreſs the Duration of each, no Shadow of a Reaſon can be given.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Secondly,</hi> There cannot be one Argument ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, why GOD ſhould reward his Saints with everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Happineſs, which will not equally puniſh Sinners with Eternal Miſery.</p>
            <p>For, ſince we know nothing (at leaſt for a Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) how he will deal with either, but by a Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation; and ſince, as was proved by the foregoing
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:040229_0007_1015D51668C6DF90"/>
Argument, he hath as poſitively threatned eternally to puniſh the Wicked, as to reward the Good; it follows that his Truth will be as much impeached and called in Queſtion, did he not inflict his Puniſhments, as it would be, if he did not confer his Rewards.</p>
            <p>To this alſo it has been objected,
<q>That though GOD is obliged by his Promiſe to give his Rewards, yet his Veracity could not be called in Queſtion, ſuppoſing he ſhould not execute his Threatnings, as he actually did not in the Caſe of <hi>Nineveh,</hi> which GOD expreſly declared by his Prophet <hi>Jonah, ſhould be deſtroyed in Forty Days</hi>; notwithſtanding the Sequel of the Story informs us, that <hi>Nineveh</hi> was ſpared.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But in anſwer to this Objection we affirm,
<q>That GOD's Threatnings, as well as Promiſes, are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Repentance.</q>
—And for this Reaſon, becauſe they are both founded on the eternal Laws of right Reaſon.—Accordingly we always find, that where the Conditions were not performed, on the Non-perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of which the Threatnings were denounced, GOD always executed the Puniſhment threatned.— The driving <hi>Adam</hi> out of <hi>Eden,</hi>—The Deſtruction of the old World by a Deluge of Water, and the Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> are, and will be always ſo many ſtanding Monuments of GOD's executing his Threatnings when denounced, though, to our weak Apprehenſions, the Puniſhment may ſeem far to exceed the Crime.</p>
            <p>It is true, GOD did ſpare <hi>Nineveh,</hi> and that becauſe the Inhabitants did actually repent, and therefore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the Conditions upon which it was ſuppoſed by the Prophet's being ſent to warn them, the threatned Puniſhment ſhould be with-held.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:040229_0008_1015D50C0CCE9C38"/>And ſo likewiſe in reſpect to Goſpel Threatnings. If Men will ſo far conſult their own Welfare as to live up to the Goſpel Terms, GOD certainly will not puniſh them, but on the contrary, confer upon them his Rewards,—But to affirm that HE will not puniſh, and that eternally too, impenitent, obſtinate Sinners, according as he hath threatned, if they do not perform the Terms of the Goſpel, what is it, in Effect, but to make GOD like a Man, that he ſhould lie, or the Son of Man that he ſhould repent?</p>
            <p>But the abſurdity of ſuch an Opinion will appear ſtill more evident from</p>
            <p>The next and <hi>Third</hi> Argument I ſhall offer to prove, <hi>that the Torments reſerved for the Wicked hereafter are eternal, viz.</hi> From the Nature of the Chriſtian Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
            <p>And here I muſt again obſerve, that it was taken for granted at the Beginning of this Diſcourſe, that,
<q>That you believe the Son of GOD came down to ſave Sinners; that there is but one Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween GOD &amp; Man, even the Man CHRIST JESUS.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And here I take it for granted farther (unleſs you believe the abſurd and unwarrantable Doctrine of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory) that you are fully perſuaded, that this Life is the only Time allotted by Almighty GOD for work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out our Salvation, and after a few Years are paſſed over, there will be no more Sacrifice for Sin.</p>
            <p>And if this be granted (and who dares deny it) it follows that if a wicked Man dieth in his Wickedneſs, and under the Wrath of GOD, he muſt continue in that State to all Eternity. — For, ſince there is no Poſſibility of his being delivered out of ſuch a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but by and thro' CHRIST; and ſince at the Hour

of Death, the Time of CHRIST'S Mediation and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion for him is irrecoverably gone; the ſame Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that may be given, why GOD ſhould puniſh a Sinner that dieth under the Guilt of his Sins for a ſingle Day, will equally hold good, why he ſhould continue to puniſh him for a Year, an Age, nay, to all Eternity.</p>
            <p>But I haſten to the <hi>Fourth</hi> and laſt Argument, to prove, <hi>That the Torments reſerved for the Wicked here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after are eternal,</hi> viz. <hi>Becauſe the Devil's Puniſhment is to be ſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That there is ſuch a Being whom we call the <hi>Devil,</hi> that he was once an Angel of Light, but for his Pride and Rebellion againſt GOD, was caſt down from Heaven, and is now permitted with the reſt of his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Wickedneſſes, to walk to and fro, ſeeking whom they may devour. — That there is a Place of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment reſerved for them, or, to uſe the Apoſtle's Words, <hi>that they are reſerved in everlaſting Chains under Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto the Judgment of the Great Day,</hi> are Truths all here preſent were ſuppoſed to be convinced of, when it was taken for granted under the ſecond Propoſition at the Beginning of this Diſcourſe, that you believed the <hi>holy Scriptures</hi> to be written by the Inſpiration of GOD, wherein theſe Truths are delivered.</p>
            <p>But then if we allow all this, and think it no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice in GOD to puniſh thoſe glorious Spirits for their Rebellion, how can we think it unjuſt in him, to puniſh wicked Men for their Impenitency to all Eternity?</p>
            <p>You will ſay perhaps, that they have ſinned againſt greater Light, and therefore deſerve a greater Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And ſo we grant that the Puniſhment of the fallen Angels may be greater as to Degree, than that of wicked Men. But then we affirm, it will be equal as
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:040229_0010_1015D519A87698C8"/>
to the Eternal Duration of it. For in that Day, as the lively Oracles of GOD inform us, ſhall the Son of Man ſay to them on his left Hand, <hi>Depart from me ye Curſed into Everlaſting Fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi> — Where we find that impenitent Sinners are to be caſt into the ſame <hi>Everlaſting Fire,</hi> with the <hi>Devil</hi> and his Angels, — and that too very juſtly. — For though they may have ſinned againſt greater Light, yet Chriſtians ſin againſt greater Mercy. Since CHRIST took not hold of, did not die for the fallen Angels, but of the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> for Men and for our Salvation. So that if GOD ſpared not thoſe excellent Beings, aſſure thy ſelf, O obſtinate Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, whoever thou art, he will by no means ſpare thee.</p>
            <p>From what then has been ſaid it plainly appears, that verily the <hi>Torments reſerved for the Wicked hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter are Eternal.</hi> — And if ſo, Brethren, how holy ought we to be in all Manner of Converſation and Godlineſs, that we may be accounted worthy to eſcape this Wrath to come!</p>
            <p>But before I proceed to a practical Exhortation, permit me to draw an Inference or two from what has been ſaid.</p>
            <p>And firſt, <hi>If the Torments reſerved for the Wicked hereafter are Eternal,</hi> what ſhall we ſay to thoſe who make an open Profeſſion in their Creed to believe a Life everlaſting, <hi>i. e.</hi> a Life of Happineſs as well as Miſery, and yet dare to live in the actual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of thoſe Sins which will unavoidably, without Repentance, bring them into the Place of Torment? Thou believeſt the Puniſhment of the impenitently Wicked in another Life, are Eternal: Thou doeſt well, <hi>The Devils alſo believe and tremble.</hi> But know,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:040229_0011_1015D5250180E728"/>
O vain Man, unleſs this Belief doth Influence thy Practice, and makes thee bid Adieu to thy Sins, every Time thou repeateſt thy Creed, thou doſt in Effect ſay, I believe I ſhall be undone for ever.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Secondly,</hi> If the Torments reſerved for the Wicked hereafter are Eternal, then let this ſerve as a Caution to ſuch Perſons (and it is to be fear'd there are ſome ſuch) who go about to diſſuade others from the Belief of ſuch an important Truth. There being no ſurer Way, in all Probability, to encourage &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Infidelity and Prophaneneſs, than the broaching or maintaining ſuch an unwarrantable Doctrine. — For if the poſitive Threats of GOD concerning the Eternity of Hell-Torments are already found inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to deter Men from Sin, what a higher Pitch of Wickedneſs may we imagine they will quickly arrive at, when they are taught to entertain any Hopes of a future Recovery out of them, or, what is ſtill worſe, that their Souls are hereafter to be annihilated, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come like the Beaſts that periſh? — But Woe unto ſuch blind Leaders of the Blind. No Wonder if they both fall into the Ditch. — And let ſuch Corrupters of GOD's Word know, that I teſtify unto every Man that heareth me this Day, that if any one ſhall add unto, or take away from the Words that are written in the Book of GOD, GOD ſhall take his Part out of the Book of Life, and ſhall add unto him all the Plagues that are in that Book.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly</hi> and <hi>Laſtly,</hi> If the Torments reſerved for the Wicked hereafter are eternal, then this may ſerve as a Reproof for thoſe who quarrel with GOD, and ſay it is inconſiſtent with his Juſtice, to puniſh a Perſon to all Eternity, only for enjoying the Pleaſures of Sin for a
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:040229_0012_1015BDA4FA9A2AB0"/>
Seaſon. But ſuch Perſons muſt be told, that it is not their thinking or calling GOD unjuſt, will make him ſo, no more than a condemned Priſoner's ſaying the Law or Judge is unjuſt, will render either duly charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with ſuch an Imputation. — But knoweſt thou, O Worm, what Blaſphemy thou art guilty of, in char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging GOD with Injuſtice? — <hi>Shall the Thing formed ſay to him that formed it, Why haſt thou made me thus?</hi> And wilt thou preſume to arraign the Almighty at the Bar of thy ſhallow Reaſoning? And call him unjuſt, for puniſhing thee Eternally, only becauſe thou wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt it may not ſo? But hath GOD ſaid it; and ſhall he not do it? He hath ſaid it: And let GOD be true, tho' every Man be a Liar.—<hi>Shall not the Judge of all the Earth do right?</hi> Aſſuredly he will. And if Sinners will not own his Juſtice in his Threatnings here, they will be compell'd e'er long to own and feel them when tormented by him hereafter.</p>
            <p>But to come to a more practical Application of what has been deliver'd.</p>
            <p>You have heard, Brethren, the Eternity of Hell-Torments plainly proved, from the expreſs Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Holy Scriptures, and Conſequences naturally drawn from them.—And now there ſeems to need no great Art of Rhetorick to perſuade any underſtanding Perſon to avoid and abhor thoſe Sins, which without Repentance, will certainly plunge him into this Eternal Gulph.—The Diſproportion between the Pleaſure and the Pain (if there be any Pleaſure in Sin) is ſo infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely great, that ſuppoſing it was only poſſible tho' not certain, that the Wicked would be everlaſtingly puniſhed, no one that has the Reaſon of a Man, for the Enjoying a little momentary Pleaſure, would,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:040229_0013_1015D52819CB9F58"/>
one would imagine, run the Hazard of enduring Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Pain.—But ſince the Torments of the Damned are not only poſſible, but certain, (ſince GOD him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who cannot lie, has told us ſo) for Men, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding to perſiſt in their Diſobedience, and then flatter themſelves that GOD will not make good his Threatnings, is a moſt egregious Inſtance of Folly and Preſumption.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dives</hi> himſelf ſuppoſed, that if one roſe from the Dead, his Brethren would amend their Lives; but Chriſtians, it ſeems, will not repent though the SON OF GOD has died and roſe again, and told them what they muſt expect, if they ſtill continue obſtinate in Evil Doing.</p>
            <p>Would we now and then draw off our Thoughts from ſenſible Objects, and by Faith, meditate a while on the Miſeries of the Damned, I doubt not but we ſhould, as it were, hear many an unhappy Soul vent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his fruitleſs Sorrows in ſome ſuch piteous Moans as theſe.</p>
            <p>
               <q>O Wretched Man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this Body of Death! O fooliſh Mortal that I was, thus to bring myſelf into theſe never-ceaſing Tortures, for the transitory Enjoyment of a few ſhortlived Pleaſures, which ſcarcely afforded me any Satisfaction, even when I moſt indulged myſelf in them.—Alas! are theſe the Wages, theſe the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Sin? — Are all the Grand Deceiver's invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Promiſes come to this?—O Damned Apoſtate! Firſt to delude me with pretended Promiſes of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and after ſeveral Years Drudgery in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, thus to involve me in Eternal Woe.—Oh that I had never hearkened to his beguiling Inſinuations!
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:040229_0014_1015D521EB050BD8"/>
Oh that I had rejected his very firſt Suggeſtions with the utmoſt Deteſtation and Abhorrence! Oh that I had taken up my Croſs and followed CHRIST! Oh that I had never ridiculed ſerious Godlineſs; and out of a falſe Politeneſs, condemned the truly Pious, as too Severe, Enthuſiaſtick, or Superſtitious! For I then had been happy indeed, happy beyond Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, happy to all Eternity, yonder in thoſe bleſſed Regions where they ſit, cloathed with unſpeakable Glory, and chanting forth their Seraphick Hallelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jahs to the Lamb that ſitteth upon the Throne, for ever.—But, alas! theſe Reflections come now too late: Theſe Wiſhes now are vain and fruitleſs. I have not ſuffered, and therefore muſt not reign with them. — I have in Effect denied the LORD that bought me, and therefore juſtly am I now denied by him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>But muſt I live for ever tormented in theſe Flames?—Muſt this Body of mine which not long ſince lay in State, was cloathed in Purple and fine Linnen, and fared ſumptuouſly every Day, muſt this be here eternally confin'd, and made the Mockery <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

                  <hi>cannot, will not,</hi> yet I muſt be miſerable for ever.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Come then, all ye ſelf-deluding, ſelf-deluded Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and imagine yourſelves for once in the Place of that truly wretched Man I have been here deſcribing. — Think, I beſeech you by the Mercies of GOD in CHRIST JESUS, think with yourſelves, how racking, how unſupportable the never dying Worm of a ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condemning Conſcience will hereafter be to you. Think how impoſſible it will be for you <hi>to dwell with everlaſting Burnings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:040229_0015_1015D529A1A9D028"/>Come, all ye <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of a Lukewarm <hi>Laodicean</hi> Spirit, ye <hi>Gallie</hi>'s in Religion, who care a little, but not enough for the Things of GOD, O think, think with yourſelves how deplorable it will be to loſe the Enjoyment of Heaven, and run into endleſs Torments, merely becauſe you will be content to be <hi>almoſt,</hi> and will not ſtrive to be <hi>altogether Chriſtians.</hi>— Conſider, I beſeech you, conſider, how you will rave, and curſe that fatal Stupidity, that made you believe any Thing leſs than a Life of ſtrict Piety, Self-Denial, and Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, can keep you from thoſe Torments, the Eternity of which I have been endeavouring to prove.</p>
            <p>But I can no more — Theſe Thoughts are too melancholly for me to dwell on, as well as for you to hear, and GOD knows, as Puniſhing is his ſtrange Work, ſo denouncing his Threatnings is mine. But if the bare mentioning the Torments of the Damned is ſo ſhocking, Good GOD! how terrible muſt the enduring of them be!</p>
