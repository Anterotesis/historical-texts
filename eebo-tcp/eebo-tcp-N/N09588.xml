            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>Mr. PRESIDENT, GENTLEMEN of the SOCIETY, GENTLEMEN, and FELLOW STUDENTS,</head>
            <p>I SHOULD be ungrateful indeed, did I not with Pleaſure, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace this Opportunity to commemorate the Munificence of our Royal Benefactor. For, as far as I can trace back the Scenes of Life, or recal the fleeting Ideas of my Childhood, theſe Walls, reared by the pious Hands of William, have ſheltered me in my infant Studies. I am well aware, that I ſhall ſink in the Attempt, but I depend on your Benignity to ſupport me: I am conſcious alſo, that it requires an Apelles to pourtray an Alexander; but ſhould I be fortunate enough, to drop, during this Eſſay of Youth, any Thing, worthy your Attention, I ſhould exclaim, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, with more than Aegyptian Joy, as having found my Reward in the Approbation of the Learned.</p>
            <p>"Heaven," ſays Pope, "firſt taught Letters for ſome Wretch's Aid, ſome baniſh'd Lover, or ſome captive Maid:" But ſurely then only are they equal to their Dignity, when they "raiſe the Genius and mend the Heart." The Tears of the Macedonian, as he ſtood by the Tomb of Sigeum, flowed from a Senſe of his unhappy Fate, in wanting a Homer to celebrate his Actions: But how had he wept, how miſerable had he been, if he had thought, that the boldeſt Flights of Genius, like the Leaves of the Sybil, muſt have been given to be diſperſed by the Winds? How had the Glory of Antiquity periſhed in hopeleſs Oblivion, had not Letters interpoſed to perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate its Exiſtence? Without their Aid, in vain had the Poet ſung the Anger of Pelides, or Paſſion of Agamemnon: In vain painted the Horror of Impiety in Diomede, wounding a Divinity, or cautioned againſt the deluſive Witchery of Fortune, by preſenting Hector, now exulting over Patroclus vanquiſhed, now dragged in Triumph round the Trojan Wall. Without their Aid, we never had beheld Aeneas, bending under the Weight of filial Duty, Pharſalia had never riſen to our View, to diſplay the Havock of Ambition, nor had the diſſolute Aſſyrian been prepared for Death by the written Herald of his approaching Ruin. Through them the Wiſdom of

Greece, of Rome, of the whole World, paſſes before us in one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Mirrour, Ages, long elapſed, reflect a ſearching Light upon thoſe which are to come, and the Divine Indulgence commiſſions us to be happy, by thus revealing the Myſteries of Learning. Conſider! Man comes into the World, a naked, helpleſs Animal, free from Biaſſes of every Kind: Conſider! He cannot remain in a State of Neutrality. He may indeed, while Vice inſinuates on this, and Virtue awes on that, Side, in the Intervals of Heſitation put on the Smile of Revelry to one, and ſickly over his divided Looks with Melancholy to the other, but muſt ſhortly, like Herculus, determine on the Path, as each ſuſpects the Influence of its Rival. Vice is daily reinforced with Millions: Even Cuſtom herſelf has enliſted under its Banner. Let it but wave the Crimſon Standard, Fancy, with all her Train, comes fluttering around: Let it but give the Blaſt for the nocturnal Orgy, Intemperance, Debauch, and Luſt gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol in the Van, while Diſeaſe and Miſery follow in the Rear. Amid ſuch Tumult and Diſorder, where ſhall Virtue find a Friend? Should ſhe ſtrive to mix with the Croud, by them ſhe is puſhed back with Contempt: Should ſhe retire from factious Strife, ſhe is proclaimed the chimerical Exiſtence of a diſtempered Brain. Becauſe ſhe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lures them not to the Shores of Ruin, by the Songs of Guile, the Young are too apt to conſider her Habitation, as the Excluſion of all Joy. But let them recur to Learning, their Prejudices will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, they will know how to prize that which is eſtimable. Whether we be verſed in metaphyſical Speculations, or contemplate the Wonders of the material World, we ſhall reap theſe Advantages. If we reſign ourſelves to the former, they will teach us "to abſtract, extend, and ſpiritualize our Ideas," will render us ſuperior to the enſnaring Nets of Sophiſtry, will qualify us to unveil Falſhood in Diſguiſe, to trace Scepticiſm in its Labyrinth of Subterfuges, and oppoſe Truth to the laboured Diſquiſitions of falſe Refinement.</p>
            <p>But while the Hand of Science detects to our Eye, the connecting Fibres as it were, and vital Principles of Nature, while we explore the ſeveral Properties of Matter in all its primary Forms, and artificial Combinations, we are capacitated for inhancing the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:012210_0005_0F8A1B46473100E0"/>
and Means of Life. Then, then indeed! we turn our Eyes up to the Heaven of Heavens, haſte to diſtant Planets, and deſcry other Syſtems. In the Laws which govern their Revolutions, we admire unbounded Goodneſs, in the Forces, which retain them in their Orbits, Almighty Power. Mere Senſe circumſcribes the Views of none but the ignorant, the Terms of Space we here can never know; for to us new Firmaments now ariſe, new Suns now kindle up to our Imagination, in infinite Succeſſion, "in regular Confuſion, and we hail thee, O GOD,
<q>
                  <l>"Father of all, in ev'ry Age,</l>
                  <l>"In ev'ry Clime ador'd,</l>
                  <l>"By Saint, by Savage or by Sage,</l>
                  <l>"Jehovah, Jove, or Lord."</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Yet Virtue diſdains no Heart which is open to her Reception. She may be found under the Cottages of Ignorance, as well as amid the buzzing Schools of Letters. Nay, I will add, that ſhe may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt independent of Learning, that the thoughtleſs Clown oftimes poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes more Probity than the ſkilful Critic. But, when the Statuary's Chizzel has hewn off the formleſs Maſs, that encumbered the latent Figure, when it has given Strength of Features, Elegance of Shape, and Expreſſions of Life, how far does this poliſhed Marble diſclaim all Connection with the Rudeneſs of its kindred Quarry?</p>
            <p>It is you, fair Science, who touched Confuſion into Order, and ſpurred into Action "the lethargic Powers of the human Breaſt." Before the Days of Literature, though the Secretions of Matter had exhibited the Form of a World, the Savageneſs of Mankind ſeemed to continue, the Anarchy of Chaos. Uncertain of his Den, "the ſad Barbarian" roved from Field to Field, "fought the fierce, tuſky Boar for his Acorn Meal, and where the deſcending Night overtook his wearied Steps, there he laid him down, to refreſh himſelf for the Morrow's Conteſt. While the "mixed Tempeſts" of the Winter, forbad the Chace, while the leafleſs Tree denied her Fruit, and the general Pulſe of Nature ſeemed benumbed, whither could he betake himſelf for Amuſement, whither fly for Suſtenance, how reſcue his

active Limbs from motionleſs Torpidity? A Friend he knew not: The "tender Ties of Relationſhip" could not bind the boiſterous Soul of Licentiouſneſs, untutored by the Precepts of Learning. He was "deſolate in Crouds," and how could Solitude afford him the Companion of the Scholar. Worſe than the Beaſts of Prey, he cared not for Futurity, and muſt have ſtarved in emaciating Penury, had he not rifled the Stores of the Brutes. But it was Diſcipline, which taught him to melt at another's Woe, to ſympathize with another's Joy, and forgive the ungenerous Robbery of his Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right. It was ſhe, who called out from amid the Woods, and Wilds of Nature, the uncivilized Herd of Men, changed their "blood-polluted Furr into the woolly Veſtment," and united them by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Intereſts, and ſocial Laws.</p>
            <p>But if the Sluggard ſtill clings to his downy Bed, if Intractibility, cannot now be ſoothed to Application, and Folly ſtill rebels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt its Happineſs, behold! the Hand of Majeſty extending the Laurel to reward, and the Trumpet to proclaim. Whither have the Monuments of Roman Glory vaniſhed, like fantaſtic Viſions? Whither the Child of Juſtice?—Numa is gone to "hide his diminiſhed Head." Whither the willing Victims to their Country's Safety? Decius, Paulus, and Curius fall a ready Prey to Oblivion. Whither the Patron of Learning?—Haſt thou fled, Auguſtus? Indeed: And "bluſhing drops his Wreath" at the more illuſtrious Name of Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam. The fortuitous Title of Inheritance often ſerves as a Ladder, upon which Demerit may climb up to Honours, and the Crown, though thrice refuſed, is but a doubtful Evidence of Sincerity. Yet William challenged not the Preference under the Sanction of the Naſſau Race, but under the Protection of the Naſſau Virtues. Nor did he buy the Devoirs of a Paraſite to make a Parade of his Integrity, but under the Shield of Innocence defied the Shafts of Calumny. What is it to us, that no Footſteps of victorious Rage were left in his Camp, no Tincture of Monarchal Pride ſtained his Royal Purple, and, when with eager Haſte he thunderedon the Foe, with eager Haſte he lent the Hand of Mercy to raiſe him up? The

Horror of Bellona ſhocks the Solemnity of this Day, and the milder Influence of Minerva demands the Character of William, as free from the Buſtle of martial Life.—It ſhines with the Eclat of more than Roman Virtue, unclouded by Roman Vice. Nature ſeems to have reanimated him with all the Glory of his Anceſtry. The Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages of Superſtition began to loſe their Force and Fury, when this Prince embarked in the Cauſe of Religion. Numerous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies were projected, numerous Snares laid againſt his Life: But the Favour of Heaven put forth a Star to lead him into the Path of Security, gave him Power to tread upon the young Lion, and the Adder, and look! Whatſoever he hath done, it hath proſpered.</p>
            <p>The Flowers, which, without his Care, had bluſhed unſeen, he tranſplanted into this his own fair Garden: The latent Gem, which ſoon had mouldered into Duſt, is here prepared to glitter on the Crown: Nay, the Fount is here ſtruck out, where the Muſes chooſe to inhabit. Cadmus inſtructed Greece in Letters, and Greece was grateful: Triptolemus firſt opened to the aſtoniſhed World the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the teeming Field, and the aſtoniſhed World demonſtrated their Gratitude by following his Example: But can we, the Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of his Care, mention the Name of William, and not be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raptured with his Praiſe? Dare we not, with heart-felt Joy, admire his Virtues, his amazing Virtues? Methinks I read in the Looks of this infant Throng a Deſire to ſpeak, methinks, they all unite their Voices, and dictate to me, what they feel. "How happy," ſay they, "are we under the Shadow of the Royal Wing? It matters not to us, though "the World be made for Caeſar," provided we can find a Refuge in the Royal Favour. To him it is perhaps owing, that the ſavage Indian is not now defiling this holy Spot, exulting in barbarous Triumph over his captive Fellow Creature, pinioned at the Stake of Slaughter, and panting with an impious Thirſt after the unhappy Victim's Blood. Even the Britiſh Lions felt the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Charge: William and Mary, the unalienable Object of his Love, were entruſted to their Care. No Medean Charm could ſtupify their Vigilance: The golden Fleece of Heaven reſted in impregnable

Security. The Art of Raphael might picture the unſunned Snow, as an Emblem of Chaſtity, or paint the ſpeaking, correſpondent, Glances of the Eye, as Symbols of true Affection; but Invention itſelf would be baffled in its Attempts, to rival her Innocence, or the tender Regard of their united Hearts, by Fable or Alluſion."</p>
            <p>But alas! how frail, how fickle is the State of ſublunary Things! how like the tranſient Colours of the fleeting Bow! And yet we fooliſhly imagine, that Summer Scenes can bloom amid the Storms of Winter, give ourſelves Credit for the Morrow, and with the Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con ſoar in the empty Space of Hope, till the Object of our Prey eludes us. "Fair laughed the Morn:" Wrapt in pleaſing Fancy, we fondly thought, as Heaven had reſtored to us a William in a Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne, ſome Guardian Angel would have warded off the fatal Blow. This ſweet Deception played before our Eyes in all its fairy Mazes, led us from Scene to Scene, pictured Joy behind, Joy in endleſs Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective, till at laſt the Enchantment ceaſed, when we heard the Knell of our Friend, our Pattern, our Botetourt. We beheld him pale, as afflicted Patience on a Monument. We touched the Hand, which once ſmoothed the rugged Pillow of Diſeaſe: 'Twas cold. We cloſed the Eye, that once ſhed the pitying Tear: 'Twas quenched. The Voice which once infuſed Balm into the wounded Spirit, now ſpoke no more. Man! fooliſh Man! does thy Heart exult, ſhould Fame herald the abroad, the Hero of thee Age, ſhould animated Buſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeak a pompous Parentage, or gilded Roofs receive thee, as their Lord! For a Moment ſtop thy Career, approach, where Berkley lies, approach where Berkley is intombed, and ſee the Vanity of human Expectations. This great Man—great let me call him—was placed on the Pinnacle of Admiration. He had Wealth, ſufficient to glut even Avarice itſelf, and Titles to lull aſleep the moſt reſtleſs Ambition. But he coveted Riches, merely to conſecrate them by a proper Uſe, he deſired Authority, only to enforce his Example, and what he wiſhed for he received, as the golden Cenſer receives its Frankincenſe, to "ſpread a ſacred Gale of Bleſſings around on all." He kept his Eyes, ſteadfaſt on the End, and Aim, of his Being:

from his Piety, his Preſence, our ſacred Chapel derived a daily Luſtre, and, though his Attention to the Commands of his Maker could not diſarm Death of his Power, yet at leaſt did it diſarm him of his Terrors. He thought himſelf, as yet, but an Embryo in Exiſtence, and that he then only was entering on the Theatre of Life, when Fate drew up the Curtain of Futurity. "The Almighty ſpoke." The Scene is paſt, and weeping Science, abſorbed in Woe, pays the laſt Tribute of her Gratitude, a Tear. She ſtretches forth the Laurel, but the Laurel droops: The baleful Cypreſs with its fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereal Gloom ſaddens the ſilent Vault. There we ſaw him interred, there committed to the Duſt, and, while Deſpondence ſat on every Face, in the pealing Anthem, the penſive Look, the broken Sigh, you read, you heard, that Berkley was no more. But in vain do we weep for him, ſince

            <p>But, my Fellow Students, how can we better ſolace ourſelves for the Loſs of our Friend, than by endeavouring not to need him?— What avail the hidden Treaſures of the Mine, if fettered Indolence diſſuade you from the Queſtion? What avails the yellow Harveſt, if the Huſbandman denies his Sickle? "Beaſt, Bird, Air, Fire, the Heavens, the rolling Worlds, all Nature lives by Action." Nothing lies at Reſt, but Death, and Ruin, nothing can purchaſe Eaſe, and Quiet, but Induſtry, and Perſeverance. "Who would ſuffer the Slings, and Arrows of outrageous Fortune, who would bear the Whips, and Scorns of Time, the Oppreſſor's Wrong, the proud Man's Contumely, or groan, and ſweat under a weary Life, but that the Hopes of an undiſturbed Aſylum for impotent Old-Age, cheered his drooping Spirits in the round of Miſery?"—"The Heart-Ache, and the thouſand natural Shocks, which Fleſh is Heir to," daily prove the Inſufficiency of earthly Bliſs, and Reaſon bids us crop its Pleaſures, as we paſs through this Vale of Tears. But before we can enjoy them, we muſt labour to know, where they bloom, how

to unmaſk the Deceit of Ruin, which briſtles with its Bed of Thorns, diſguiſed by the falſe Appearance of the Roſe. Conſult your Breaſts, and tell me, if Pleaſure lies in the Smiles of Beauty: Tell if the precious Moments of Mortality were intended to be ſacrificed at the Shrine of Luſt, or if Duty injoins us to tread in the Footſteps of the Brutes. This cannot be your Creed, theſe cannot be your Wiſhes. You are reaſonable Beings, and can therefore ſteel yourſelves againſt the envenomed Dart. Envenomed indeed; for, like the deadly Preſent of Neſſus, it burns, and burns, and will for ever burn. Whither then ſhall we ſeek for Pleaſure? In the brimming Goblet? —In the brimming Goblet ſeek for Deſtruction: In the brimming Goblet lay down the Diſtinction of Humanity, and in the midnight Revel call forth the Beaſts to aſſociate with their new Relation. For, can the bluſhing Cup afford one cordial Drop to Remorſe, give an Opiate to Pain, and "ſteep the Senſes in Forgetfulneſs?" It may cheat us of our Remorſe, it may cheat us of our Pain, as we quaff the luſcious Potion; yet in the End it does but diſſolve a Pearl which the combined Wealth of the World cannot repurchaſe, it does but open new Sources of Miſery, ruſhing with redoubled Force. Let us not put it to the Trial: Let not the Examples of thoſe, who have miſcarried, ſpeak with as little Credit as the Propheſies of Caſſandra, and thus will Youth arrive at true Philoſophy, real Pleaſure, and ſolid Happineſs. Ariſe, renounce the Errors of your Age, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove yourſelves worthy of Royal Patronage. If paſt Hours have eſcaped, unimproved, quit not the preſent Opportunity, but, like the holy Patriarch, claſp the parting Angel to thy Boſom, until he bleſs thee. Let future Stateſmen, future Lawyers, future Divines here ſpring up, but ſuch Stateſmen, ſuch Lawyers, ſuch Divines, as ſhall ſtrive to do Honour to their Family, their Country, and this, their <hi>Alma Mater.</hi>
