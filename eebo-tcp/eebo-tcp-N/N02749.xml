            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Hiſtory, Succeſs and, Benefits of the Method of receiving the Small Pox by Inciſions or Inoculation, as it is called, ſo far as it has come to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.

I ſhall not be too free with Names of Perſons, only where the vouching of Facts may ſeem to require it. There have been too early and ſtrong Prejudices, both for and againſt this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod; People have been partially Credulous or Incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous of Facts, as they make for or againſt their reſpective Opinions, <hi>viz,</hi> In ſome it ſavoured much of Credulity, Levity, and Novelty, to be bigotly Zealous for it; in others it ſhow'd too much of ſtrong Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, Paſſions or Obſtinate Humour, to be furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly againſt it: they ſeem to have acted the faireſt part, who exclaiming only againſt raſh and irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar procedure, were willing to wait patiently until time and a cautious experience ſhould direct their judgments.</p>

How mean or raſh ſoever the beginning of the Practice of Inoculating the Small Pox may have been; if many Years practiſed by Old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men only, and neglected by the Sons of Art in Turky; if in another part of the World a Perſon of no Literature and of habitual Raſhneſs, from a third hand hearſay of an ever Credulous perſon, firſt attempted it indifferently on all who would pay for it, without regard to Age, Sex, Conſtitution, other Circumſtances, and Caution's which tryals of ſuch Conſequence may require; as it is one of the inconveniences of Humane Life, that all the World over, Ignorance, Aſſurance and Raſhneſs puſhes on ſome to attempt without fear or diſcretion what would make the moſt exquiſite Artiſt tremble to touch; nevertheleſs if in the Event by repeated ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments it prove uſeful, it ought to be embraced.</p>
            <p>WE find by ſome Years Experience, that the Small Pox abſtractedly conſidered, received by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oculation is not ſo Fatal and the Symptoms frequently more mild, than in the accidental Contagion; yet it is not of that certain ſafety, to exempt it from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reckoned precarious, and therefore requires Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion in applying it to proper Subjects, and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in managing the Diſtemper ſo receiv'd.</p>

            <p>WHEN this <hi>Practice</hi> was firſt attempted, ſome Phyſicians in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>New-England</hi> parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly Dr. <hi>Friend,</hi> from the experience of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders ariſing in the <hi>Animal Oeconomy</hi> by ſome foreign liquids being directly admitted into the current of <hi>Blood,</hi> by anology were afraid of the like in caſe of <hi>Inoculation</hi>; but repeated tryals ſoon convinced them of the ſafety of this method. In ſome of the firſt tryals the produced <hi>Puſtules</hi> were either dry without <hi>Pus,</hi> or like a <hi>Spurious Pox</hi> called the <hi>Chicken</hi> or <hi>Swine</hi> Pox, containing no thick digeſted <hi>Pus</hi> but a thin <hi>Sanies</hi>; hence they alledged that <hi>Inoculation</hi> produced only an <hi>Eruptive Fever</hi> but no <hi>genuine</hi> Small-Pox: but in
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:003274_0010_0FF0301576D7FE48"/>
after tryals, ſeeing in many the <hi>Puſtules</hi> riſe with inflamed edges, white &amp; afterwards yellow heads, plump and mellow, and go off about the uſual time in yellow Scabs, as alſo finding them <hi>infectious</hi>; they quickly gave up the point, and <hi>declared</hi> them <hi>genuine.</hi> The <hi>Odium</hi> of ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infection continues a diſadvantage; The ingrafting of foreign <hi>conſtitutional ails</hi> is a ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling block to the nice and cautious.</p>
            <p>THE firſt <hi>Promoters of Inoculation,</hi> on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand, were much more extravagant in their <hi>deviations</hi>; from <hi>hearſay</hi> and a few <hi>ſcanty</hi> experiments with much <hi>credulity</hi> and <hi>raſhneſs,</hi> they poſitively and without reſerve, publiſhed as follows; and in ſome inſtances contradict one the other and themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>TIMONIUS A.</hi> 1713. ſays, Theſe laſt years ſome thouſands have been <hi>Inoculated</hi> and none died, while at the ſame time half the affected died in the common way at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi>; and what is valued by the <hi>Fair,</hi> never leaves Scars nor Pits. Infants have no <hi>Convulſions</hi> with it. He knew but of one Boy who did not receive the Small-Pox by <hi>Inoculation,</hi> his inciſions did not ſwell. The <hi>Puſtules</hi> never contain a lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Pus,</hi> but a thin watery <hi>Sanies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>PYLARINUS</hi> the <hi>Venetian</hi> Conſul, the moſt modeſt of all its Promoters, ſays, I was not an <hi>Eye-witneſs</hi> to all that I now relate, I had a great part of it by <hi>hearſay.</hi> The <hi>Operatrix</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the <hi>Winter</hi> ſeaſon. The <hi>Eruption</hi> gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally begins the 7th day; there are inſtances tho' but few, where the <hi>Eruptions</hi> have appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the firſt day. <hi>Inoculation</hi> ſometimes does
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:003274_0011_0FF03019E40C1E70"/>
not take place. In ſome, tho' very ſeldom, in the <hi>glandulous</hi> parts &amp; <hi>Emunctories, Abceſſes</hi> do ariſe after ſome time.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Le Duc</hi> a Native of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and who was himſelf inoculated, aſſured Dr. <hi>Jurin,</hi> that out of many thouſands that in the ſpace of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 40 years paſt, had been inoculated in and about <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> by one Greek woman, not ſo much as one perſon has miſcarried.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Maitlands account.</hi> Dying is a caſe which never happened in <hi>Ingrafting.</hi> The giving the Small-Pox by <hi>Inoculation,</hi> never yet failed, nor never can. No Headakes, Thirſt, Inquietudes, and other Fever Symptoms, not one in a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand. Dr. <hi>Nettleton</hi> who inoculated great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, ſays from his own experience: <hi>The Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms are as in the natural way, a quick pulſe, great heat and thirſt, pain in the Head and Back, and about the region of the Stomach, Vomiting, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs, Startings, and ſometimes Convulſions.</hi> Mr. <hi>Maitland</hi> further ſays, The <hi>Puſtules</hi> never leaves any <hi>Pits</hi> behind them: And in his <hi>Vindication,</hi> printed in Autumn, 1722. ſays, that out of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 500 <hi>Inoculated,</hi> by that time only 3 had died: Dr. <hi>Jurin</hi> who made it his buſineſs, as being R. S. Sec. to be well informed, <hi>exeunte, A.</hi> 1722 ſays that only 182 were <hi>Inoculated</hi> by that time. This impoſition on Mankind is too groſs: what follows is ſtill more groſs. In a looſe Poetical rapture Mr. <hi>Maitland</hi> ſays, that ſuppoſing 200 or 300 Sick in the <hi>natural</hi> way, and as many in the <hi>Inoculated</hi> way, all under the cure of unskilful and unexperienced people, as few would <hi>Survive</hi> in the Natural way, as would <hi>Die</hi> by the Inoculated way.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:003274_0012_0FF0301CD6C5B258"/>Dr. <hi>Brady of Portſmouth.</hi> Not ſo much as one ever <hi>died</hi> of Inoculation rightly performed, it always is favourable. What wretched work (ſays Dr. <hi>Brady</hi>) the <hi>Gentleman</hi> (Dr. <hi>C. M.</hi>) who writes the Letter to Mr. <hi>Dummer</hi> from <hi>New-England</hi> makes of his accounts.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Harris</hi> ſays <hi>Inoculation</hi> is a certain reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy againſt the <hi>confluent</hi> kind.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Colmans Obſervations in New-England.</hi> A <hi>Negro</hi> Slave in diſcourſe told him, That <hi>Ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation</hi> was practiſed in their <hi>Country,</hi> but of how long ſtanding he could not tell; that <hi>God</hi> told it to poor <hi>Negroes</hi> to ſave their lives, for they had not knowledge and skill as we; when the <hi>Small-Pox</hi> gets into a few Families in a <hi>Town,</hi> The whole Town is inoculated in one week, &amp; are well the next, <hi>none die, no blains nor bails follow the Practice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Boylſton</hi>'s <hi>firſt account.</hi> There is no truth in the reports of peoples <hi>dying under Inoculation. Timonius</hi> well <hi>known to ſome in Boſton, who alſo actually knew the truth of his matters of fact</hi>; this ſort of Quackery is only fit for a Stage in a Country Market Town. In his ſecond account, publiſhed, <hi>A.</hi> 1726. He complains much <hi>that he had heard but of few who have had the benefit of Inoculation in England.</hi> N. B. We are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that buſineſs running low with him here, he went for <hi>London,</hi> and with the character of an experienced Inoculator, expected a profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble encouragement there, but was entirely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed, <hi>not having Inoculated one perſon there,</hi> ſo far as I can learn; <hi>Inoculation</hi> in <hi>London</hi> had not as yet got into the hands of Quacks. He
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:003274_0013_0FF0301FD5ADBE60"/>
tells us he had ſuch <hi>Faith</hi> in the accounts that Dr. <hi>Mather</hi> gave him of Inoculation, that he could have ventured the firſt tryal upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; in a few lines following (forgetting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf) he tells us of his great <hi>fright</hi> (as he calls it) on account of his <hi>Sons Illneſs, not having any directions from</hi> Timonius <hi>and</hi> Pylarinus <hi>concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Practice</hi>: theſe are his own words, by which he unthinkingly expoſes his own <hi>Raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Inadvertency.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The beſt of Men have ſome <hi>Foible</hi>: that of Dr. <hi>Mathers</hi> was <hi>Credulity</hi>; it was upon his Authority that our <hi>New-England Inoculation</hi> was carried on. I ſhall mention a few Inſtances of this <hi>weakneſs</hi> from his own <hi>Letters</hi> concerning Inoculation publiſhed in <hi>London</hi>: in one Letter Dated <hi>March</hi> 1722 He tells the world, That <hi>A.</hi> 1721. in <hi>Boſton,</hi> ſome <hi>Cats</hi> had a regular Small-Pox and died of it; that during the Small Pox, the Pigeons and Dunghill Fowls did not lay nor hatch, <hi>that he never knew Bliſtering miſs of ſaving life in the Small-Pox, &amp;c.</hi> In his Letter communicated to the R. S. by Mr. <hi>Newman</hi> in favour of Inoculation he ſays, <hi>the Patient is more healthy after Inoculation, it is uſefull to Women in Child-bed, it dries up tedious running Ulcers, makes the crazy conſumptive people hearty, and rids people of their former maladies.</hi> Thus he makes a <hi>Panacea</hi> of it. To allow of ſuch groſs &amp; bold aſſertions without diſproving of them, would be leading Mankind into a <hi>Snare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ALTHO' <hi>Levity</hi> &amp; <hi>Credulity</hi> brought people in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it at firſt, without waiting the effects of a reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able number of <hi>Experiments,</hi> moſt of the <hi>Anti-Inoculators</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:003274_0014_0FF030215D8626B8"/>
from repeated tryals do now acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that <hi>Inoculation</hi> generally ſpeaking is a more eaſy way of undergoing the <hi>Small-Pox</hi> Illneſs, then where the Infection is received by <hi>accidental contagion</hi>; but its Salutarineſs falls much ſhort of the <hi>extravagant recommendations</hi> given of it by its <hi>Patrons</hi>; which were very unfair, becauſe it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears at that time they knew but little of the <hi>Practice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS <hi>Method,</hi> to ſpeak impartially, is a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable improvement in <hi>Phyſick</hi>; but we can not ſay that it <hi>Prevents a bad ſort,</hi> as ſure as a <hi>Pleureſy is cured by V. S, an Intermitting Fever by the Peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian Bark, a chloroſis by Chalybeats, Venereal Ails by Mercury,</hi> &amp;c. In ſhort, it is no infallible Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of <hi>alleviating</hi> the Diſtemper, but in many Inſtances has proved <hi>precarious. Some receive the Diſtemper not at all, ſome only Eruptive Fevers, others to ſo ſmall a degree as to admit of doubt, others the worſt ſort, ſome have Dyed of it, Impoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humetions and other Subſequent Ails rather more than in the natural way,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I ſhall endeavour to vouch all theſe particulars chiefly from Hiſtories of the firſt <hi>Centenary</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oculated in <hi>England,</hi> and in the very words of the Inoculators (ſome of them were too credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in their firſt recommendations of it, but they all ſeem to be very candid in their <hi>Hiſtories of Fact</hi>) which I am ready to produce well vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. To proceed further down would be too tedious and nothing to the <hi>advantage of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,</hi> becauſe the proportion of thoſe who <hi>Died</hi> in the ſubſequent Years, is greater than it was
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:003274_0015_0FF030256B751F40"/>
in the beginning: and to ſpeak ingenuouſly, I kept a correſpondence with reſpect to the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of Inoculation in <hi>England</hi> from <hi>unqueſtionable Facts,</hi> only for the firſt two or three Years of its Practice there; but have ſince, by a ſort of indolence been remiſs, I know no more of it for thoſe laſt Years, than any other Perſon may from the Publick Prints. I can but ſeldom have recourſe to Mr. <hi>Boylſtone</hi>'s Accounts, becauſe of their being ſo jejune, lame, ſuſpected, and only in the nature of a <hi>Quack Bill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>SOME receive the Diſtemper not at all. Pylarinus</hi> ſays, Inoculation does not always take place. In Dr. <hi>Nettleton</hi>'s firſt parcel it did not take place in two inſtances. Mr. <hi>Maitland</hi>'s 20<hi>th,</hi> 28<hi>th,</hi> 29<hi>th,</hi> 30<hi>th,</hi> 32<hi>d,</hi> 42<hi>d,</hi> &amp;c. it did not Infect. Mr. <hi>A—ds</hi> 4<hi>th,</hi> 10<hi>th,</hi> and 11<hi>th,</hi> did not take Effect. In ſhort, from the ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Dr. <hi>Jurins</hi> account of Inoculation in <hi>Great Britain, A.</hi> 1721, 1722, and 1723, out of 477 by that time Inoculated, 29 <hi>had no Small Pox</hi>; which is 1 in 16.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>SOME have only Eruptive Fevers.</hi> Mr. <hi>Maitland</hi>'s 32<hi>d,</hi> Patient.

Mr. <hi>A—d's</hi> 11<hi>th</hi> Patient. My L. M— a Son to the D. of <hi>D—t.</hi> aged 11 years, had a gentle Eruptive Fever but no Small-Pox.</p>

               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:003274_0016_0FF030281170D030"/>3. <hi>OTHERS to ſo ſmall a degree, as to admit of doubt.</hi> Dr. <hi>Nettleton</hi> in his Letter 16th <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> 1722. ſays, we are ready to own, that the Operation may ſometimes fail: in 3 of my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, tho' the wounds did inflame and ſwell, &amp; diſcharge conſiderably, yet the Eruptions were ſo imperfect, as to leave me a little in doubt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>OTHERS the worſt ſort. Pylarinus</hi> modeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſays, they are moſt frequently (not always) of the diſtinct ſort; the eldeſt (<hi>aet.</hi> 18,) of the 4 Sons of a noble <hi>Greek,</hi> his firſt Patients, after a courſe of moſt violent and dangerous Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms <hi>narrowly eſcaped</hi> the 14th day. <hi>Timonius,</hi> who has been found in every thing partial in recommendation of Inoculation, ſays, that of about 50 who had the Inoculation about the ſame time, 4 came near the <hi>Confluent</hi> ſort, in whom the Eruptions were too ſudden, and Symptoms worſe. To make ſome eſtimate of the <hi>Confluent and Bad ſorts,</hi> I ſhall confine my ſelf to the firſt <hi>Centenary</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and in the words of the Inoculators. Dr. <hi>Nettleton</hi>'s 8th Patient, Mr. <hi>Sympſons</hi> Child dyed the 7th day from Inoculation with <hi>Purple Spots</hi> (the Brother ſome time before dy'd in the natural way the 4th of Illneſs full of purple and lived ſpots.) His 28 <hi>Patient aet.</hi> 5. the elder of two Brothers inoculated about the ſame time, the younger got thro' the Diſtemper with a great deal of eaſe; but the other fared quite otherways, and there appeared ſome ſigns of <hi>malignity,</hi> but without danger, he afterwards had a hard Swelling on his Shoulder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (a former Child of this Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:003274_0017_0FF0302A72345350"/>
dyed of a very malignant ſort of Small-Pox.) Mr. <hi>Maitlands</hi> 10th patient <hi>Joſeph Heath aet</hi> 7. was very ill before the Eruption, had a great load of the <hi>continued kind,</hi> but at laſt recovered. His 25th Patient Mr. <hi>R—ds aet.</hi> 41, had a great many, ſome of the <hi>coherent ſort,</hi> with pretty ſharp invading Symptoms, in ſome time after he had two boils. His 31ſt Patient Mr. <hi>Spencer</hi> at 2 &amp; half Son to the E. of <hi>Sunderland</hi> had a mixed ſort part <hi>confluent,</hi> he dyed the 11th day <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſed,</hi> having had a violent <hi>Second Fever.</hi> His 42 Patient Mr. <hi>R—gs</hi> Second Child had a great many, got over the Small-Pox under the care of two <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> but in ſome ſhort time after dies of a <hi>Pthiſis.</hi> His 47th Patient a Child of my L. <hi>T—ds</hi> had a pretty many of the <hi>Coherent ſort.</hi> Mr. <hi>A —ds</hi> 12th Patient My L. <hi>Barthurſts</hi> Servant <hi>aet</hi> 19 the Eruption happened in the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual time with a vaſt quantity of the <hi>confluent kind,</hi> dies the 13th day, having been under the care of Drs. <hi>Arburthnot</hi> and <hi>Mead.</hi> In <hi>June</hi> Mr. <hi>Waller</hi> Apothecary in <hi>Goſport,</hi> inoculated his 3 Children, one of them had <hi>very ſevere ſymptoms</hi> preceeding the Eruption, had a great many with 3 or 4 patches of the <hi>Fluxed kind.</hi> Thus we find in fair accounts <hi>that</hi> 9 <hi>in</hi> 100 <hi>have had bad kinds</hi>; ſome Inoculators except againſt Mr. <hi>Sympſons</hi> Child, becauſe the ſeizure was early.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Nettleton</hi> ingenuouſly writes, That both in the natural and ingrafted ſort there are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt <hi>infinite degrees of the Small-Pox.</hi> In Mr. <hi>Boylſton</hi>'s account with a good aſſurance he tells us, we had no reſemblance of bad ſymptoms in any, where it was not evident that they were
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:003274_0018_0FF0302D04AC6558"/>
infected in the natural way before. In all his 247 Patients he met with but 5 or 6, and they had received the infection before; whereof 3 were <hi>Confluent</hi> and 3 <hi>handſome ſprinkling</hi> as he terms it. How <hi>diſingenuous</hi> is it to ſuppreſs the Hiſtories of thoſe who had the ſevere degrees of it; that there were more is certain. The Rd. Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> in his Book of Obſervations, <hi>p.</hi> 4. writes: that ſome 10 or 12 of this number (the firſt 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>0) appeared to have taken the infection in the common way, and accordingly had a <hi>confluent kind or of a fulneſs</hi> of the diſtinct ſort not known among the Inoculated in the <hi>Levant.</hi> Conſidering that the other 147 were all in the ſevereſt ſeaſon, and many of them not ſo well provided for in the adjacent Country Towns, the proportion of <hi>bad kinds</hi> muſt increaſe; ſo in the loweſt eſtimate <hi>there muſt have been</hi> 25 <hi>or</hi> 30 <hi>with bad ſorts.</hi>

               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:003274_0024_0FF0303B6D7EBA80"/>IT is beyond all diſpute, <hi>that ſome of the Ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated, may have received the Infection before, and that the Small-Pox was from thence</hi>: but if an Inoculated Perſon dies, or has had a hard time of it, to impute it always to a former accidental contagion, is moſt partial and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable; more eſpecially they ſeem to be ſecure in this <hi>Subterfuge,</hi> if the Eruptions happen ſooner than the uſual time. <hi>Timonius</hi> ſays the Eruption ſometimes is too ſudden and of the fluxy kind. <hi>Pylarinus</hi> ſays the Eruptions ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally appear the ſeventh day, there are ſome rare inſtances where it appeared the firſt day. The Learned Dr. <hi>Huxham</hi> of <hi>Plymouth</hi> writes, <hi>A.</hi> 1724, &amp; 1725 there was in the Town a ſort of <hi>Anomalous Small-Pox,</hi> that appeared in <hi>leſs than</hi> 24 <hi>hours</hi> from the Seizure, and were always of the fluxed kind. Dr. <hi>Jurin</hi> gives a very ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar inſtance of the Small Pox <hi>appearing in</hi> 2 <hi>or</hi> 3 <hi>days,</hi> in the forehead of a Nurſe, ſqueezed by a Gentleman in his <hi>delirium</hi> againſt his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked breaſt full of the coherent kind in the ſtate of maturation; they obſerved the regular pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods of the diſtinct kind, and did inflame ſo as to cloſe up her Eyes by ſwelling, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards did ſoon ſubſide by a bliſter to her neck: therefore a <hi>fortiori,</hi> where the variolous matter is applied immediately to the blood and circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting juices as by Inoculation, why may not the Eruptions in ſome conſtitutions, be <hi>premature.</hi> According to the Inoculators themſelves the Eruption may be ſo <hi>Serotine</hi> as eleven weeks, and why may it not ſometimes be too <hi>precoce</hi> by ſome days.</p>

As in ſome conſtitutions of years the infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not ſo apt to ſpread as in others, <hi>to force the ſpreading of it</hi> by this Artificial method no man (excepting one who has leſs regard for the lives and good of mankind, than the ready Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney) will juſtifie. I am told that about 45 years ago the Small Pox got into ſeveral Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies in <hi>Boſton,</hi> and ſoon went off without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeminating it ſelf. The <hi>Plague</hi> which is recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned more infectious than the Small Pox was in <hi>London,</hi> from 1602, to 1632, every year there died a few of it, but it did not ſpread excepting in 1603 there dyed of it 30. 561, and in 1625 dyed 35. 417. The <hi>Small Pox</hi> in <hi>London</hi> ſome years is far more univerſal and malignant than in other years, for inſtance, from the <hi>Bills of Mortality, A.</hi> 1702 dyed of the Small Pox only 311, in the year 1706 dyed 1721, in the year 1719 dies 3229. Laſt Small Pox left <hi>N. England</hi> very abruptly, while the Promoters of Inoculation were endeavouring to force it into the Country Towns; but the <hi>Roxbury</hi> deaths bafled their recommendations. To force the ſpreading of infection by an <hi>unbounded Inocula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is a hardſhip upon Mankind, to oblige them to quit their buſineſs with their habitations; means uſed to ſave my own life, ought not to endanger my Neighbours. Perhaps it is <hi>more infecting</hi> than in the common way, becauſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

the Small Pox confinement is over the Ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated walk about, and carry with them a ſort of <hi>ambulatory Infection,</hi> their Inciſions continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to run a ſort of <hi>variolous</hi> matter. In ſome meaſure to obviate this clamour, they at firſt gave out, that the infection from the Inoculated conveyed a better ſort: but this point they ſoon gave up. Mr. <hi>Maitland</hi>'s 9th Patient Mrs. <hi>Batts</hi> Daughter at Temple near <hi>Hartford,</hi> gave the infection to 6 Servants in the Houſe, all of them had them very bad and one dy'd, ſays Mr. <hi>Maitland,</hi> contrary to my expectation. In <hi>Boſton</hi> Mrs. <hi>Eſther Webb</hi> 13th Patient of Mr. <hi>Boylſtons</hi> was Inoculated, narrowly eſcaped in the worſt ſort of confluent kind, the <hi>Salvo</hi> was that ſhe had received it from her Inoculated Father and Mother, and if this be allowed, then it makes our ſurmiſe good.</p>
            <p n="9">9. <hi>THE Communication of Conſtitutional Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers, is a difficulty which will require ſome ſeries of Years to obviate.</hi> This ſome may call a <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical</hi> or conjectural fear; but as all conſtitution Diſtempers have ſome <hi>Idea</hi> or <hi>Seminium</hi> in every drop of our juices, the <hi>acute Diſtemper</hi> according to its nature ſoon ſhows itſelf, the <hi>Chronical ails</hi> act ſlowly &amp; imperceptibly on our Bodies. A <hi>Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butick</hi> taint may lay latent until ſome diſpoſing cauſe happens, the <hi>Arthitick</hi> from its nature will not exert it ſelf till old age, it is very uncertain in what ſtage of life an hereditary <hi>Venereal Pox</hi> may appear, the <hi>Nephritick, Strumous, Epileptick, Maniack,</hi> &amp;c ſome times intermit one gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and appear <hi>again</hi> in the next: thus any

ſubſequent Chronical ail may occaſion inquietude in the minds of the Inoculated, and render them uncapable of the greateſt happineſs in this World, <hi>Mens ſana in corpore ſano.</hi>

            <p>As fear, anxiety and deſpondency or dejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Spirits are of bad conſequence in all Diſeaſes, and more eſpecially in the Small Pox illneſs; I cannot avoid taking notice of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advertency or <hi>Inhumanity</hi> of ſome Inoculation Promoters particularly in this Town, who with <hi>falſe colourings</hi> expoſe the Mortality of the Small Pox in the natural way. They harangue thus, <hi>The Small Pox always fatal to</hi> New-England. Mr. <hi>Boylſtone</hi> in his firſt account ſays, The Small Pox was an <hi>awful</hi> Diſtemper, whereof ſo many died as gave an awful Proſpect. In his <hi>aſſuming Dedication</hi> to the <hi>Princes of Wales,</hi> he ſays the reaſon of his undertaking Inoculation was, becauſe the Small Pox raged in <hi>New-England</hi> with the utmoſt Violence: let us recollect and we may find that 22d <hi>July</hi> 1721 the <hi>Select-Men</hi> declare that only 17 by that time had died of it, the Small Pox had then been in Town about three Months, and this was near a Month after Inoculation began, at that time ſo far as we could inveſtigate about 1 in 10 died of it; how few Popular Fevers have been ſo favourable, witneſs that <hi>Febris mali moris</hi> Epidemical here in the Fall. Dr. <hi>Mather</hi> in his Letters publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>London,</hi> gives the reaſon why they uſed no precaution: becauſe in the natural way it raged with the <hi>utmoſt fury,</hi> and to make his aſſertion good, ſays that of ſomething more than 5000,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:003274_0028_0FF03046167E9350"/>
decumbents near 900 died, which is 1 in 5. 5 or 18 <hi>per ct.</hi> by the fallacy of uſeing the remoteſt round numbers in each eſtimate, he <hi>miſrepreſents</hi> the caſe very much: the true numbers, as I had them from Mr. <hi>Salter</hi> were out of 5989, died 844 (or in the neareſt round numbers <hi>out of</hi> 6000, <hi>dy'd</hi> 850,) which is Something leſs than 1 in 7 or 14 <hi>per ct.</hi> Mr. <hi>Boylſtone</hi> with his uſual candor, in his eſtimates makes uſe of round numbers to a pitch much exceeding this; In his account reckoning up the <hi>diſmall Symptoms</hi> which attend the natural Small Pox, he endeavours to make the world believe, <hi>That in Boſton, A.</hi> 1721. <hi>near one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred perſons had loſt one Eye,</hi> I have made dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent enquiry among the Practioners and others, but cannot muſter up near a ſcore; and ſome of thoſe not from the violence of the Diſtemper, as in two Daughters of Capt. <hi>R—</hi> Patients to Mr. <hi>Pemberton,</hi> who had a kind diſtinct ſort, with an accidental Small Pox <hi>Puſtule upon the Pupil of the Eye.</hi> How <hi>inhumane</hi> is it in affairs of life and death thus to trifle with Mankind, to indulge a humour, or to ſerve a baſe end, and <hi>how ſuſpected muſt all accounts be that come from ſuch hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As <hi>chearfulneſs of mind</hi> is the beſt <hi>preparative</hi> for, and <hi>reſtorative</hi> in the Small Pox; for the comfort of thoſe who have not had the Small Pox, I ſhall make an eſtimate of the <hi>net Small Pox deaths</hi> in <hi>Boſton, A.</hi> 1721. There died that year of all diſtempers 1102. whereof 844 were Small Pox, is only 258 of other diſeaſes; but at a <hi>medium</hi> of 6 years preceeding, <hi>A.</hi> 1721.
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:003274_0029_0FF030485CCE5808"/>
there dyed <hi>per. an.</hi> 359, and at a <hi>medium</hi> of 6 years following, <hi>A.</hi> 1722. (I do not include <hi>A.</hi> 1722. becauſe the <hi>premature deaths</hi> of 1721. had much leſſened the burials for that year) there dyed 411: the mean is 385. from which deduct the above 258, remains 127 deaths of <hi>Valetudina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> who (if we may ſo expreſs it) muſt have dyed that year of other ails: or if we compute thus <hi>A.</hi> 1722. dyed only 273, therefore the former year had <hi>anticipated</hi> this 118 of its due Burials; the <hi>medium</hi> of both computations is 122, which deducted from 5989 and from 844 leaves 722 deaths in 5867 is ſomething more than 1 in 8. To reduce the Small Pox <hi>morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> further let us conſider, 1. The diſadvantage of its <hi>prevailing in the Autumn</hi> or Fall, the moſt Sickly time of the year. 2. The Small Pox had been abſent 20 years, and conſequently a great proportion of <hi>Adults</hi> to have it, in whom <hi>Chronical ails</hi> might be formed; where it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently comes, <hi>Children</hi> are generally its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and on that account not ſo mortal. 3. By <hi>Inoculation</hi> the numbers of the infected were in all parts of the Town ſo increaſed, that they could <hi>not be well attended</hi>; perhaps the numbers rendred the <hi>contagion more intenſe</hi> for near 90 dyed of <hi>Purple Spots and other cruen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

afflicted the Town only ſix times; <hi>A.</hi> 1649, 1666, 1678, 1690, 1702, &amp; 1721. I cannot ſee any reaſon to magnifie the chance, and riſque which a <hi>Boſton</hi> man has of dying by the Small Pox. Dr. <hi>Nettleton of Hallifax,</hi> Dr. <hi>Whitaker of Chicheſter, and Dr. Williams of Heverford-weſt.</hi> For the year 1721. make the Small Pox deaths in their Neighbourhood 1 in 5, it certainly muſt have been with them <hi>a malignant conſtitution</hi> that year. Accidental Years or Times are not to be induced in forming <hi>general eſtimates</hi>; as for inſtance, <hi>A.</hi> 1721. In <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> (a Neighbouring Plantation) out of 30 who had the Small Pox and were ſent to <hi>Harbour-Iſland,</hi> only one perſon dy'd, without any other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice than the care of a Nurſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THE advantages of Inoculation.</hi> 1 The Small Pox received by <hi>Inciſions</hi> from the experience of Some years, <hi>abſtractedly</hi> conſidered, is found not ſo Mortal and the Symtoms generally more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable than when it is received by accidental contagition. 2 One may take the advantage of <hi>benign</hi> Small-Pox conſtitution, and <hi>a favourable Seaſon</hi> of the year to receive it. 3 The Body may be <hi>prepared</hi> and ſo ſecure our ſelves from being taken at a diſadvantage and ſurpriſe, it is an advantage to know that we are to have a diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per 7 or 8 days before it ſeizes us. 4. It removes that dread and anxiety which is a great uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſome who have not had the Small-Pox.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Royal Family</hi> by their Example, have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viated the Suſpicion, which made the Practitioners
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:003274_0031_0FF0304C61E4F0E0"/>
here decline it formerly, I mean of its being Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal. I find <hi>the Practitioners in Town do generally reſolve to perform the Opperation when required,</hi> but without perſwading or diſwading; ſo that thoſe who are ſo inclined will have a better chance and choice without being oblidged to expoſe themſelves to a <hi>Raſh Operator</hi>; however ſafe this method may be, diſcretion and care are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, out of Mr. <hi>Boylſtons</hi> 72 or 73 <hi>Roxbury Inoculated Patients</hi> (Mr. <hi>White</hi> included) <hi>dyed</hi> 5: <hi>out of Mr. Thompſons</hi> 28 <hi>Inoculations in the ſame Towns and ſeaſon there dyed not one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Operation of Inoculation is always ſafe even in the rudeſt hand; Blood letting is attended with the riſque of pricking an Artery, tendon or membrane of the muſcle; in this the Skin being elevated nothing lays in the way. The Symptoms in the Inoculated Small-Pox are the ſame as in the natural, and require the ſame management.</p>
            <p>ALTHO' by Inoculation there is a <hi>better chance</hi> than by accidental contagion, nevertheleſs it is not exempted from being <hi>precarious,</hi> as we have at length exemplified; but as there is no <hi>abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute certainty</hi> in humane affairs, mankind go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern themſelves by the greateſt <hi>probabilities.</hi> If it is found a better chance for preſerving Life in this Illneſs, it will not be eaſy for <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſts</hi> and ſuch like <hi>divines</hi> to make the world believe it a Sin; thus ſome <hi>Turks</hi> and many of our Neighbours, altho' rigorous <hi>predeſtinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> at the cry of Small Pox <hi>malignity,</hi> do fly to it as a refuge.

In theſe ſome accident in the Operation is to blame, not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture prematurely ſet at work to acquire an acute diſtemper by a ſafe Operation; A preventive Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, Purge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> affects only my ſelf not my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
            <p>Seeing at preſent the moſt zealous Inoculator does not pretend that there is any <hi>abſolute cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi> in this affair, a <hi>Country retreat</hi> in my Judgement, may be adviſable to the following <hi>conditions</hi> of perſons. 1. To thoſe who are <hi>much advanced in years,</hi> who in the common courſe of nature may <hi>not ſurvive</hi> the next return of this contagion; the <hi>infirmities</hi> of old age is a diſadvantage likewiſe to be conſidered. 2. <hi>Preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant women</hi>; and in general all of the <hi>Fair Sex</hi> whoſe buiſineſs can allow of a Country retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for ſome months once in 12 or 20 years, and whoſe <hi>faces</hi> are ſome part of their care and concern, ſome faces having ſuffered laſt Inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation time. 3. The conſumptive and <hi>bad ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits,</hi> whoſe <hi>crazy fabricks</hi> cannot without a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable riſque, ſtand the ſhock of an acute diſtemper. 4. <hi>Infants,</hi> whoſe green and tender

age with the incidents of <hi>crudities, Tormina</hi>'s, <hi>Teething, &amp;c.</hi> is of it ſelf precarious, without the accumulation of a Small Pox illneſs. 5. <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> few of them are obſerved to ſurvive the Small-Pox in the natural way, &amp; therefore are not without conſiderable hazard in the other way. 6. <hi>Some particular Families of Whites,</hi> who have ſomething peculiar in their conſtitution that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear this infection (fire is not always as the flame from whence it is derived, but as the fewel to which it is applied) we have had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this, Mr. <hi>White</hi> and his Siſter both di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Inoculation, the Family of <hi>W—bs</hi> ſuffered much, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By ſome ſingularity of temperament, ſome are proof againſt the Pocky contagion, to others it is always mortal. 7. <hi>The exceedingly Timorous</hi> need not to be mentioned, it is to be ſuppoſed that fear will give them Wings.</p>
            <p>THESE who are in <hi>good Health,</hi> and not in any of theſe circumſtances, are <hi>fit ſubjects for Inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> more eſpecially whoſe buſineſs requires them to be in foreign parts where the Small Pox always more or leſs prevails. Since the practice is not Criminal, they who from a publick Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit undergo the experiment, may be reckoned to eſſay the <hi>benefit of Mankind</hi> for generations to come.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The beſt preparation for the Small Pox to</hi> be received either by accident or by inciſions is to keep the mind as chearful, &amp; the body as health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as we can. <hi>The ſymptoms of health</hi> are a good Stomach, eaſie digeſtion, regular pulſe, quiet and undiſturbed Sleep.</p>
