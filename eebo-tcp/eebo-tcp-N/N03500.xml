            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Honorable Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Flatter my ſelf, that You will not think it any Diſhonor to You to be own'd <hi>as a Friend of</hi> New-England, eſpecially in its beſt, its religious, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts: And for this Reaſon I venture to dedicate the following Performance to You; deſiring You to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it as an Acknowledgment of Your many good and kind Offices towards us.</p>
            <p>It may not be amiſs to inform You, that many Eminent Perſons, beſides Your ſelf, in our Mother-Kingdom have thought favourably concerning us and ſhew'd their Readineſs to ſerve us. The catholic and excellent Dr. TILLOTSON, from his good Opinion of us, frequently concern'd himſelf for the Welfare of <hi>New-England,</hi> and intreated His Majeſty King WIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIAM to ſhew the marks of his peculiar Favour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his faithful Subjects here, and once particularly was ſo free as to declare in the Audience of his Majeſty, that <hi>it would by no Means do well for Him to take away
<pb facs="unknown:004275_0003_10043186701BB450"/>from the People of</hi> New-England <hi>any of their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege.</hi> And the meritorious Biſhop of <hi>Saliſbury,</hi> Dr. BURNET, beſides many other weighty Expreſſions of his Kindneſs to <hi>New-England,</hi> was once ſo good as to profeſs before Dr. MATHER my honored Grandfather, that <hi>he would on the firſt Opportunity declare openly in</hi> the Houſe of Lords, <hi>that there was a greater Sacredneſs in the Charter of</hi> New-England <hi>than in thoſe of the Corporations in</hi> England; <hi>becauſe thoſe were only</hi> Acts of Grace; <hi>whereas the Charter of</hi> New-England <hi>was a</hi> Contract <hi>between the King and the firſt Patentees:</hi> They <hi>promiſed the King to enlarge his Dominions on their own Charges, provided that they and their Poſterity might enjoy ſuch and ſuch Privileges: And</hi> They <hi>had perform'd their Part: Now for</hi> the King <hi>to deprive their Poſterity of the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges therein granted to them, it would carry the Face of Injuſtice in it.</hi> And the good old Lord WHAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON, the laſt ſurviving Member of the famous Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of Divines that met at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> whoſe Name ſhould be very dear to every true <hi>New-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Man, upon preſenting a Petition for <hi>New-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> by my honored Grandfather, who was then in the Agency for this Province, was pleas'd to ſay with great Zeal and Earneſtneſs to the King, that, <hi>if he were ſure to die the next Day, he would, as he now did, appear in behalf of this Country and ſollicit his Favour for it.</hi> And, when one, from whom I have the Honour of immediately deſcending, wrote an Account concerning the Affairs of <hi>New-England</hi> to the late great and good my Lord Chancellor KING, he was pleas'd to write a Letter in Anſwer, wherein are theſe remarkable Paſſages; <hi>The Account of your Country was very acceptable to me: And, wherein I can ſerve either it or you, I ſhall always he ready; It is Matter of Joy, that the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Learning do make ſuch conſiderable Advances in thoſe Parts of the World. And indeed, wherever
<pb facs="unknown:004275_0004_1004318A570A6C18"/>the Chriſtian Religion is propoſed in its native Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Simplicity, it is moſt likely to ſucceed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence You ſee, Honorable Sir, that You are not ſingular in Your Regards towards us and in Your Inclinations and Endeavours to ſerve us, but have ſuch good Company as may be an Encouragement unto You in them.</p>
            <p>I need not mention to You the Claim, which theſe Churches have to their Religious Privileges <hi>as Men, as Chriſtians, and as Proteſtants:</hi> But I would obſerve to You, that theſe Privileges are confirm'd unto them by the <hi>Charter,</hi> which was granted to this Province by King WILLIAM and Queen MARY of glorious and immortal Memory.</p>
            <p>And I would further acquaint You, that, ſince the Grant of our valuable <hi>Charter,</hi> the <hi>ſame</hi> was ratified and confirmed by his moſt excellent Majeſty King GEORGE the <hi>Firſt;</hi> and there has a Law paſs'd in this Province in the <hi>fourth and fifth</hi> of WILLIAM and MARY, wherin it is expreſly provided, that <hi>the reſpective Churches in this Province ſhall enjoy all their Privileges and Freedoms reſpecting Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, Church Order and Diſcipline, and ſhall be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged in the peaceable and regular Profeſſion and Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice thereof:</hi> Which Law has bin as it were touch'd by the Royal Sceptre: For it has bin approved by his Majeſty of <hi>Great Britain:</hi> So that, Honorable Sir, the Liberties of theſe Churches muſt be deem'd to be <hi>as Sacred Things as the Eccleſiaſtical Liberties of the National Churches of</hi> England and Scotland.</p>
            <p>Beſides, Sir, I can truely affirm, not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Church of which I am the unworthy Servant, but alſo <hi>in behalf of all the Churches of our bleſſed SAVIOUR in</hi> New-England <hi>walking in the
<pb facs="unknown:004275_0005_1004318E855599C0"/>ſame Faith and Order with our ſelves,</hi> that they <hi>main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an inviolable Allegiance to his preſent Majeſty</hi> of Great Brittain, as they did to his Godlike Father before Him, and that <hi>they firmly adhere to the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the Imperial Crown of</hi> Great Britain in the preſent Royal Family: Nor, I am well aſſured, is there ſo much as <hi>one Perſon in the Communion of any of our Churches,</hi> but who has a <hi>cordial Regard and Affection for the Perſon and Family</hi> of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent moſt gracious Sovereign and <hi>yields a delightful Subjection to his auſpicious Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now conſidering theſe Things; and conſidering withal, what an <hi>honorable,</hi> as well as vaſtly beneficial, <hi>Addition we have made to the wide and extended Empire of the King of</hi> Great Britain: I ſaid, <hi>Honorable Addition:</hi> For, while the other <hi>Britiſh</hi> Provinces and Colonies have for the moſt Part bin ſettled by more indifferent Perſons, and for their Nouriſhment and Support have bin obliged to the Royal Bounties; This Province was founded by worthy Perſons, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable for their Families, Educations and Fortunes, as well as their ſuperior Probity, Religion and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, who with vaſt Hazard and Expence paſt the wide <hi>Atlantic,</hi> and conſum'd their Treaſures and loſt their Lives in theſe, then barbarous and inclement, Regions, that ſo their Poſterity might ſerve their GOD and their King in the peaceable Poſſeſſion and Exerciſe of thoſe Civil and Religious Privileges, which they had purchaſed and earned for them: Nor did the Crown advance any Sums of Money for aſſiſting and encouraging them in their expenſive and hazardous, but noble, Undertaking: Certainly, upon theſe Conſiderations, if we do not <hi>challenge and claim as our Due,</hi> we may well promiſe our ſelves however, <hi>the Royal Favour and Protection in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſturb'd Enjoyment of the Liberties of our Churches and Schools.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:004275_0006_100406328FF7EFB8"/>
I have rehearſed theſe Things to You, Honorable Sir, that ſo, as You have Occaſion for it, You may improve them to our Advantage and Comfort: In doing which, as You will <hi>encreaſe our Obligations,</hi> which already are very great unto You; ſo, I doubt not, You will <hi>add to Your own Conſolation and Joy:</hi> For, as the wiſe Governour of the World has hitherto <hi>blaſted the Deſigns and Attempts of the Enemies to</hi> New-England, ſo He has <hi>liberally rewarded and bleſſed its Friends:</hi> And it is our Prayer and Hope, that He would graciouſly continue to do ſo, and, in particular, that He would <hi>remunerate and proſper the honored Mr.</hi> HOLDEN <hi>according to all the Good which he has done to the Churches and Country of</hi> New-England.</p>
            <p>The Taſk which is undertaken in the following Sheets, cannot by any Means be accounted ſingular; inaſmuch as it is a common Thing in the <hi>Republic of Letters</hi> for the Learned to <hi>apologize for thoſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplinary,</hi> as well as <hi>Doctrinal, Principles, for which they have a peculiar and, as they imagine, juſt Eſteem and Veneration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, as to the Freedom of this Dedication, altho' it may be a great and probably unbecoming one; yet You are well acquainted with the Occaſion of it; and, I believe, my Country will judge, that You were highly deſerving of this public Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Reſpect and Honor for You.</p>
            <p>I cannot but hope, from what I have heard and learnt concerning Mr. HOLDEN'S generous Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that the following Attempt will be accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto You. But, however this may be, give me Leave to beg the further Continuance of Your
<pb facs="unknown:004275_0007_1004320214C60610"/>Regards and Kindneſſes to my Country, and pleaſe to think well of him, who deſires to be numbred,</p>

            <p>As many of our Proteſtant Brethren <hi>abroad,</hi> ſo moſt of our People at Home, muſt certainly have <hi>ſome Knowlege of the Privileges</hi> claim'd by theſe Churches <hi>and the Reaſons of their Attachment unto them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, inaſmuch as They may be deſirous of a <hi>further Acquaintance</hi> with our Religious Privileges and <hi>what we have to offer in Defence of them;</hi> I have therefore thought it proper for their Sakes to prepare and publiſh the following Apology, wherein I have endeavour'd to <hi>illuſtrate and confirm the more diſtinguiſhing Privileges of theſe Churches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That ſo this Attempt might be more fully and effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually anſwer'd, I have <hi>conſulted the publiſh'd Works and many of the Manuſcripts of the Fathers of</hi> New-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, I have <hi>ſearch'd the Records of the Primitive Church,</hi> I have <hi>read a conſiderable Number of later Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> and, in fine, I have <hi>examin'd the Writings of the Inſpired Apoſtles</hi> with Induſtry and Care: And hence I have bin enabled to prepare the enſuing <hi>Apology,</hi> and
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:004275_0009_100431FDB74A57B8"/>offer it to the Conſideration of my Countrymen and all our Proteſtant Brethren.</p>
            <p>By this Apology They will ſoon ſee, that we do not think <hi>Churches are ſuch Machines,</hi> as many on the other Side of the <hi>Atlantic</hi> take them to be, <hi>contriv'd and to be improv'd for the outward Advantage of ſome ſort of Perſons;</hi> but that they are <hi>Means for the Edification and ſpiritual Advantage of the Faithful,</hi> which they are oblig'd to reſpect and obſerve in Obedience to JESUS CHRIST our Saviour and ſupreme LORD: For, to uſe the Words of the learned Abbot FLEURY con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> which may properly be applied to our <hi>Apology</hi> and uſed concerning it, <hi>In</hi> This <hi>we have a Sort of Politicks, which are Spiritual and all Divine; a Government that is founded on Charity, the Public Good being the ſole End of it: For the Intereſt of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours is no Way concerned in it <note n="(b)" place="bottom">See <hi>Fleury</hi>'s Diſcourſe on Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory.</note>.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides a <hi>particular Defence of the diſtinguiſhing Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of theſe Churches</hi> in the following Attempt; there follows after this Preface <hi>a General Diſcourſe Prelimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary concerning the Nature, Grounds and Reaſons, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and Advantages of</hi> Congregational Churches; which, I believe, will be judg'd by the Impartial and Diſintereſted a ſufficient Vindication of them.</p>
            <p>In the Cloſe, and as an Appendix to the Book, I have taken Care to publiſh ſome Things that were never printed before among us, as well as ſome other Things that have already bin given to the Public, but are now ſcarcely to be found, <hi>concerning the Liberties of the</hi> New-Engliſh <hi>Churches, their catholic and comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Principles, their declared Regard eſpecially to the Life and Power of true Religion and their Duty and Intereſt to continue in their reſpectful and affectionate Attachment to theſe Things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some perhaps may judge, that, in attempting to write an Apology for the Liberties of our Churches, I
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:004275_0010_100431953057FA00"/>have undertaken a Taſk, to which I am unequal: And probably it may be ſo in Reality and Truth: But yet I am inclin'd to expreſs my ſelf concerning my Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, as TULLY concerning his <hi>Orator, The Work may be great and arduous; but to him, that is inflamed with Love to it, there is not found any ſufficient Difficulty in the Way to diſcourage him from it <note n="(c)" place="bottom">Magnum Opus conamur &amp; arduum; Sed nihil difficile Amanti puto. Cicer. <hi>ad</hi> Brut. <hi>Orator.</hi>
                  </note>.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, if the Remarks and Arguments made and collected in the following Pages ſhould be accounted ſlender and unſatisfactory; yet, if by Means of them ſome abler Perſon here or elſewhere ſhall be excited to <hi>ſet the Liberties of our Chriſtian Brethren in a fairer Light and to ſhew more Strength and Vigor in defending them,</hi> I ſhall be ſo far from <hi>repenting</hi> of my Care and Trouble in preparing and publiſhing the following Eſſay, that I ſhall <hi>heartily rejoice in the good Succeſs of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, notwithſtanding This, I muſt be ſo free as to declare, that in the enſuing Pages <hi>I have endeavour'd faithfully to repreſent the Senſe and Meaning of the firſt Planters of theſe Churches:</hi> So that, with reference to what follows, I may write in the Style of VEGETIUS, <hi>I am far from aſſuming any Thing of Authority to my ſelf in the following Sheets: If I have collected the Senſe of others right and well epitomiz'd their Thoughts <note n="(d)" place="bottom">Nihil mibi Authoritatis aſſumo: Sed gua ab aliis diſperſa velut in Ordimem epitomata conſcribo, Veget, <hi>l. 1. c. 8.</hi>
                  </note> which are variouſly diſpers'd and reduced them to a clear and natural Order, I ſhall think it ſufficient.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is one Thing for which I expect to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what blamed: And this is, that, in illuſtrating and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming the Liberties of our Churches, I generally write in the Plural Number; whence ſome may conjecture, that it was <hi>at the Direction or by the Deſire of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches here,</hi> that I write this Apology for them: But,
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:004275_0011_100431983B1532C8"/>wherever I uſe ſuch a Way of expreſſing my ſelf, I deſire always to be conſider'd as <hi>repreſenting what I take to have bin the Thoughts of the Planters of theſe Churches, and ſo of the Churches themſelves:</hi> Nor would I by any means be underſtood as directed or adviſed by the Churches to enter upon this Performance: For, if it were ſo, I ſhould <hi>loſe the Comfort and Satisfaction,</hi> it not <hi>the Credit and Honour, of making my Free-Will Offering to their Service and Advantage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is it at all improbable, that ſome may find Fault with my <hi>frequent Quotations</hi> from learned Authors and References to them: But, if the Province undertaken by me did not unavoidably lead me to make thoſe Citations and References, I am very much miſtaken: And, if it did, it is, I think, a ſufficient Excuſe for me.</p>
            <p>As to the Paſſages ſelected from the <hi>ancient Fathers,</hi> I have only this to ſay, that they are generally taken from thoſe, which are accounted the <hi>beſt Editions:</hi> And I believe my References to them are exact and punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual; tho' it is poſſible, that, in tranſcribing them into my <hi>Common-Place Book</hi> and this ſecond Tranſcription of them, ſome accidental Miſtake may have occur'd, which any good-natured Man can overlook and forgive.</p>
            <p>I have one Favour to aſk of thoſe, that ſhall read this Book, which, I think, cannot in Reaſon be denied me: And this is, that, if any of them ſhall think fit to animadvert upon any Part or the whole of it, they would be ſo kind as to put their Names to what they publiſh: For otherwiſe they may not expect to have any Notice taken of them; nor may they expect any, if they do, unleſs they write in ſuch a Manner as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a ſuitable Anſwer from me.</p>
            <p>I ſhall be very much diſappointed, if, by the Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this ſmall Volume, I do not gain the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure and Anger, if not <hi>mortal Enmity,</hi> of many: But however I ſhall not be ſorry for it, if I ſecure to my ſelf, as I hope that I ſhall, <hi>the perpetual Regard

            <p>Since my writing this Book, there has a Pamphlet come to my Hands, which it is ſaid was written by a Gentleman of the Law in <hi>England,</hi> the Title of which is, <hi>An Examination of the Scheme of Church-Power, as laid down in the</hi> Codex Juris Eccleſiaſtici Angli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

In Pag. 120th, 121ſt, 122d, 123d, he writes as follows, 'If the Gentlemen of Synodical Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will permit us to carry our Enquiry on this Head ſo far back as to the Apoſtolick Age, we ſhall find that the Laiety at that Time bore a Part in the moſt ſolemn Deliberations which concern'd the Intereſt or Government of the Church.

But the Apoſtles did not exclude the Brethren, the Body of the People, from their Counſels; nor dictated magiſterially to them. They reaſon'd as with Men and Chriſtians; and made no other Uſe of their ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Gifts and perſonal Knowledge of Facts, than to convince and perſuade. And their Arguments, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with the moſt evident Tokens <hi>in themſelves</hi> of a diſintereſted Zeal for the Honour of God, and the Good of the Church, had a ſuitable Effect on their Hearers.</p>

In Conformity to the Practice of the Apoſtolick Age, the Laiety continued to have a Share in the Government of the Church, <hi>as Members of a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Society, and intereſted in its Concerns;</hi> till the Converſion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors made Way for very conſiderable Changes in the Eccleſiaſtical Polity.

At theſe Meetings, Matters of Order and Diſcipline were tranſacted: And if any new Rules appear'd to be neceſſary for the Ends of Government, they were here agreed upon. <hi>This was the Eccleſiaſtical Legiſlature of the primitive Church <note n="(l)" place="bottom">Conſtitution and Diſcipline of the Primitive Church.

For tho' the Name and Shadow of the Senatorial and Tribunitial Powers remain'd, theſe Powers had been long extinguiſh'd: And the whole Legiſlative Power of the Empire was <hi>really</hi> veſted in the Emperor. And by this Legiſlature were Eccleſiaſtical, as well as Civil Laws, <hi>ordinarily</hi> made; as every one ſees, who hath but look'd into the Titles of the <hi>Juſtinian</hi> and <hi>Theodoſian</hi> Codes. The Emperors did indeed, upon extraordinary Occaſions, call Eccleſiaſtical Councils; ſometimes of the Clergy <hi>and Laiety,</hi> as particularly at the firſt Council of <hi>Nice:</hi> but more frequently, I believe, of the Clergy alone <note n="(m)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Socrates,</hi> Lib. I. c. 9.</note>. At theſe Councils the Emperors, in Perſon, or by

The Preſence and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of the Emperor to the Acts of the Council, gave them their binding Force, and incorporated them into the Laws of the Empire. For the whole Legiſlative Power being, as I obſerv'd, in the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, nothing could become Part of the Law, without his Authority. This Principle of <hi>the Neceſſity of an Imperial Sanction to Synodical Decrees,</hi> ſeems to be ſo well underſtood in <hi>Juſtinian</hi>'s Time, that he expreſly ordain'd, that the Acts of the Councils of <hi>Nice, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople, Epheſus</hi> and <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> ſhould have the Force of Laws within the Empire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And, after this, the Author proceeds and ſhews, from the 124th Page to the 137th Page of his Book, how, after the univerſal Monarchy fell to Pieces about the Beginning of the <hi>fifth</hi> Century, the <hi>Northern People,</hi> who erected independent Kingdoms on the Ruin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>But what can be ſaid, if, notwithſtanding ſuch fair Accounts from diſintereſted and honeſt Men, the infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated humane Race will <hi>not believe the Truth, but take Pleaſure in Unrighteouſneſs and Oppreſſion?</hi> Truely it muſt be accounted a melancholy Thing, and be <hi>for a Lamentation</hi> among all the ſincere Lovers of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
            <p>For my Part I can ſay with the learned Dr. HENRY MORE, at the Cloſe of his uſeful <hi>Expoſition of the Seven Churches, I am abundantly taught by Experience, that both the Finding out and the Receiving of Divine Truths found out by others is a ſpecial Gift of GOD.</hi> And therefore I conclude this Preface with the Prayer, which the learned Abbot FLEURY makes at the End

<pb n="3" facs="unknown:004275_0020_100431ADBA07ED30"/>Dean, <hi>he that will take in the Writings of the Primitive Church as a Supplement to Scripture in theſe Points, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be at a Loſs to know what are the Powers of Church Governours or what the Obedience due unto them <note n="(x)" place="bottom">P. 29 of ſaid Sermon.</note>.</hi> But, as For us, we are not ſenſible of the Want, nor are we deſirous, of any <hi>Supplements to the Scriptures</hi> in theſe Matters: Nor yet dare we indulge a Tho't of being <hi>wiſe above what is written</hi> in ſuch Points as Theſe: For we find ſufficient Reaſon for falling into the Sentiments of the learned Mr. Abbot FLEURY, which are thus expreſſed in his <hi>Diſcourſes on Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory,—There was nothing wanting at that Time</hi> [h. e. the Time of Primitive Chriſtianity] <hi>for the due Government of the Church: No! When the Apoſtles founded it, there was without Doubt nothing omitted in laying down Practical Rules as much for the Conduct of the whole Body, as the Manners of particular Perſons: And theſe Rules were neither imperfect nor impracticable, but ſuch as were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary to bring Them to a Goſpel Perfection, more or leſs, according to the different Meaſures of GOD'S Grace. Theſe Rules were not imperfect; ſince, as the Chriſtian Religion was the Work of GOD, it had all Perfection at firſt. It is not like the Inventions of Men, which have their Riſe, Progreſs and Fall. GOD acquires neither Knowledge nor Power by Degrees.</hi> All Things, <hi>ſays our SAVIOUR,</hi> that I have heard of my Father, I have made known unto you: <hi>And, ſpeaking of the HOLY GHOST,</hi> He will lead you into all Truth: <hi>And, to ſhew that this does not only relate to the Tenets of Religion, He ſays further,</hi> Go, teach all Nations, teaching them to obſerve all Things whatſoever I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded you. <hi>Every Thing then was equally eſtabliſhed at firſt, which could be of Uſe to Them in Practice, as well as in Faith.</hi> — And therefore we cannot approve of any <hi>Humane Supplements to the perfect Rule of Worſhip
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:004275_0021_100431B088F78070"/>and Order,</hi> with which we are favored in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>We think indeed, that there are <hi>ſome Circumſtances relating to the Worſhip of GOD and the Government in theſe Churches,</hi> which, agreeable to what is practiſed in other Societies, <hi>may be regulated by Natural Light and Chriſtian Prudence according to the general Rules of GOD'S Word,</hi> which ought for ever to have a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Regard paid unto them.</p>
            <p>But at the ſame Time our Churches judge, that they are <hi>not left at any Uncertainty about the Eſſentials of that Polity,</hi> which our Lord JESUS CHRIST hath ſettled and would have to be obſerved: For it appears to them, that there is <hi>a Divine Inſtitution</hi> for the following Things; to wit, that there ſhould be <hi>public Aſſemblies</hi> for the Worſhip of GOD and the Improvement of His People in Knowledge and Vertue, and that none ſhould officiate in them but <hi>ſuch Officers as CHRIST has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed;</hi> that Chriſtians ſhould be <hi>ſtated Members of one particular Church,</hi> and that <hi>particular Churches ſhould have proper ſettled Paſtors</hi> in them who ſhould live among them and inſtruct them by their Preaching and Example; that <hi>Paſtors and People by mutual Conſent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come related to one another,</hi> and that, by <hi>vertue of theſe Relations</hi> which are of Divine Appointment as well as by their own Choice and Conſent, they are <hi>formed and conſtituted a Spiritual Society of CHRIST'S Inſtitution;</hi> that <hi>none</hi> ſhould be <hi>admitted</hi> into the Communion of ſuch a Society but <hi>ſuch as profeſs the true Religion and appear in a Judgment of Charity to be holy Perſons;</hi> that all ſuch as are allow'd the Privilege of Communion in ſuch a Society ſhould <hi>relieve, comfort and aſſiſt one another in outward Reſpects,</hi> but that they ſhould <hi>eſpecially be help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to one another in their beſt Intereſts;</hi> and that, if any <hi>break in upon the Laws of CHRIST and the Society</hi> to which they are related, they are <hi>accountable to the Society and cenſurable by it;</hi> and, in fine, that <hi>all ſuch particular Societies ſhould live at Peace within themſelves, and hold a
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:004275_0022_100431B20DD26420"/>friendly Correſpondence and Chriſtian Communion with other Churches</hi> for their mutual Support, Edification and Comfort.</p>
            <p>This is the Polity which theſe Churches own; and this is <hi>all the Form of Church Government</hi> which they can find in the Scriptures to be <hi>inſtituted</hi> by their great Lawgiver and King: Nor can they imagine, that any can with Reaſon deny that ſuch Churches as theſe are <hi>true Churches of JESUS CHRIST.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, if thoſe are <hi>true Churches of CHRIST</hi> in which <hi>the pure Doctrines and Precepts of the Goſpel are taught and inculcated,</hi> and <hi>the Sacraments of the now Covenant are duely adminiſtred</hi> according to the Inſtitution of our great SAVIOUR, and <hi>a ſacred Regard is always bad to whatſoever our LORD has commanded;</hi> theſe Churches may then eſteem themſelves to be <hi>true Churches</hi> of CHRIST and even account themſelves <hi>the trueſt Churches</hi> according to our SAVIOUR'S Inſtitution: For, in their conforming to that Inſtitution with inviolable Fidelity, they ſhine with ſuperior Glory to others.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Principles,</hi> upon which theſe Churches are founded, are ſuch, that they need not be afraid or aſham'd of owning them before the whole World: For, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Account of the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> concerning our Congregational Brethren abroad, theſe Churches believe, that <hi>every Chriſtian ought to follow the Light of his own Mind,</hi> the Conviction of his own Conſcience, <hi>nor is obliged to ſubmit his Judgment to the Authority of any Perſon or any Eccleſiaſtical Aſſembly.</hi> 'Tis true they are for <hi>paying a moſt profound Deference to the Word of God; nor</hi> do they <hi>refuſe to embrace the Deciſions of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils and Synods,</hi> if upon a due and impartial Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they appear to be reaſonable and Scriptural: But the Thing, which theſe Churches utterly diſclaim and refuſe to do, is to <hi>ſubmit their Judgment to that of any Aſſembly</hi> however conſiderable: For they are perſuaded, that <hi>the moſt conſiderable Societies of Men are liable to Miſtakes and Errors;</hi> and therefore they <hi>ſubmit to the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004275_0023_100431B4C526FC28"/>Word of GOD only,</hi> the Authority of which is undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perted and infallible with them.</p>
            <p>And, as theſe Churches aſſert and claim <hi>the Right of private Judgment</hi> as Men, as Chriſtians, and as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants; they alſo <hi>declare for and maintain the Rights of particular Churches:</hi> For they conceive, that <hi>every Chriſtian Society or Church ought not to have any Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance in Eccleſiaſtical Matters,</hi> nor are obliged to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Authority of Councils or Synods for their Direction and Government, but ought to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned within itſelf and by its own Laws. They ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge indeed, that they ought to exerciſe their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Juriſdiction and Government within themſelves <hi>with Dependance upon our bleſſed SAVIOUR,</hi> together with His Holy SPIRIT and unerring Oracles: But they think themſelves by Divine Right excuſed from Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to any other Church, tho' it be a Mother one, and that they may <hi>exerciſe an independent Juriſdiction within themſelves.</hi> And the Reaſon why theſe Churches give into ſuch Sentiments is ſufficient: For we cannot ſuppoſe, that <hi>Churches are to be propagated as worldly Dominions;</hi> as tho' <hi>Original Churches,</hi> which ſend forth their <hi>Colonies,</hi> muſt maintain Dominion and perpetual Power over ſuch as came from them: For, after this Rate, the Churches of <hi>Geneva, Heidelberg and the united Provinces</hi> muſt claim a Dominion and Juriſdiction over the other Proteſtant Churches: But we conceive of our Churches, <hi>as of adult Sons,</hi> who are not at the Diſpoſal of their Anceſtors, but <hi>have a Right to govern</hi> themſelves and <hi>exerciſe their Power with reſpect to their own Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi> or as of <hi>Branches</hi> taken from true <hi>Olive Trees,</hi> which, being planted and watered, grow and encreaſe, without any Manner of Dependance upon the Trees from which they were taken, for Preſervation, Support and Fructifying Vertue <note n="(d)" place="bottom">Ex <hi>Voet.</hi> Deſperat. Cauſ. Papatus. L. III. Sec. III. Cap IV.</note>.</p>
            <p>Theſe Principles are the firm and unmoveable Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:004275_0024_100431B8A3500A00"/>of theſe and all Congregational Churches: And, wherever theſe Principles prevail, as methinks they ſhould prevail every where among rational and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Chriſtians; there the <hi>Congregational Form of Church-Government</hi> muſt be acknowledged and preferred before any other.</p>
            <p>But, while theſe Churches eſteem this their Form of Government, inaſmuch as it is eſtabliſhed upon ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaken Principles; they cannot but entertain an indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, not to ſay a mean, Opinion of <hi>National Churches</hi> in various Kingdoms and Countries, <hi>with an Uniformity of Doctrine and of Diſcipline,</hi> which are a diſtinct Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Civil, their Offices and their Juriſdiction being different: For they apprehend, that <hi>ſuch Churches have introduced Eccleſiaſtical Tyranny and Antichriſt into the World;</hi> and they are almoſt ready to declare with Dr. DU MOULIN, that <note n="(e)" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Lewis Du Moulin</hi> concerning the Government of the Independents. p. 23.</note> 
               <hi>a National Church has bin, is and will be the Cauſe, that there will never be a Church in the World in its true Purity, unleſs Almighty God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves ſome among the Congregational Churches:</hi> For in ſuch an Eſtabliſhment it is <hi>not Truth nor Goodneſs</hi> that influences and governs; but it is the <hi>greateſt Number</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with <hi>worldly Power and Intereſt,</hi> that rules and bears down all before it: So that it is not from a blind, partial and unreaſonable Regard for the <hi>Congregational Way,</hi> that theſe Churches do not approve of National Eſtabliſhments; but from a clear Apprehenſion of the <hi>Miſchiefs ariſing from ſuch National Eſtabliſhments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay ſuch is the Value which theſe Churches have for the <hi>Congregational Way,</hi> that they even prefer it to all other Eſtabliſhments, whether <hi>Popiſh or Reformed,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Epiſcopal or Preſbyterian,</hi> as having much the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of them: For thoſe Eſtabliſhments cannot ſubſiſt, only <hi>by the Subordination of one Judicatory to another:</hi> And how can this ſubſiſt, unleſs the <hi>Civil Magiſtrate ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004275_0025_100431F5F4A708D0"/>or tolerate it?</hi> But now the <hi>Congregational Way</hi> needs not the Aid of the ſecular Powers, but ſtands good without it; flouriſhing in perſecuting Kingdoms, and under the moſt tyrannical, arbitrary and cruel of Princes.</p>
            <p>Bleſſed be GOD this Government have ſufficiently declared their Approbation of the <hi>Congregational Way:</hi> But if GOD our SAVIOUR, as a juſt Puniſhment for our Unfruitfulneſs and Ingratitude, ſhould frown upon us by ſending us ſuch Rulers as are <hi>Enemies to the Conſtitution of theſe Churches;</hi> we may reaſonably hope, that they will not <hi>deprive us of the due,</hi> the confeſſedly due, <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Mankind,</hi> to wit, the Liberty of chuſing our Religion and of joining with one Church rather than another.</p>
            <p>And, while we have ſuch Sentiments concerning <hi>the Congregational Way,</hi> we cannot but grow confirmed in theſe Sentiments upon finding that ſeveral learned Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, who are not attached unto it, are even compel'd by the Force of Truth to declare in Favour of it.

            <p>But there is no Neceſſity of labouring in Defence of <hi>Congregational Churches,</hi> which are ſo firmly eſtabliſhed from <hi>the Scripture and moſt early Antiquity,</hi> that it would argue a ſtrong Prejudice in favour of ſome particular new and unſcriptural Eſtabliſhment to be againſt them.</p>
            <p>As for theſe Churches, they are ſatisfied with <hi>the Congregational Way,</hi> and judge <hi>the Proofs</hi> of Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Churches <hi>from Scripture and the pureſt Antiquity</hi> to be ſtrong and unanſwerable. But however, if we ſhould be willing out of Complaiſance to the Diſciples of ERASTUS to allow, that <hi>neither our SAVIOUR has inſtituted nor Primitive Antiquity favoured</hi> any particular Form of Church-Government, but that <hi>every State and Kingdom may regulate the Affairs of Churches and form a Polity</hi> for them, juſt as ſhall appear to them to be fit and convenient; ſtill we cannot but think it entirely reaſonable, notwithſtanding ſuch a large Conceſſion, that there ſhould be <hi>Congregational Churches,</hi> and that theſe Churches ſhould in a good Meaſure have the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of themſelves: For <hi>it is ſuitable to the Nature of Things, the Authority of the Civil Magiſtrate and the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations of the Paſtoral Care, that every Church ſhould act within herſelf as an entire and independent Body <note n="(z)" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi>'s Expoſition of the Thirty nine Articles. <hi>p. 374.</hi>
                  </note>.</hi> And indeed, as <hi>particular or Congregational Churches</hi> ſupport and protect the whole Concerns of Religion, they have an undoubted natural Right to be conſulted and act within themſelves; nor ought they to be <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by the Civil Magiſtrate or Lordly Biſhops or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſterial Synods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are, we are ſenſible, various plauſible Pleas and Arguments <hi>againſt the Right of particular Churches
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:004275_0031_100431C648C623B8"/>to act within and govern themſelves.</hi> Some inſiſt upon it, that <hi>the Apoſtles bad Power over particular Churches</hi> and that <hi>their Succeſſors therefore ſhould have Power over them</hi> alſo. Others plead, that <hi>particular Churches ſhould be abſolutely ſubject to their own Elders or to other Churches.</hi> And many others argue, that <hi>particular Churches ſhould be dependant on Councils and other Judicatories,</hi> and that <hi>they ought to be determined</hi> by them, as the <hi>Jewiſh Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues were by the Sanhedrim at JERUSALEM.—</hi> Theſe are the chief Arguments that are brought againſt <hi>the Right of particular Churches to act within themſelves and govern themſelves:</hi> And theſe ſhall be diſtinctly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, examined and refuted.</p>
            <p>As to the Argument, which is bro't by many againſt the <hi>Congregational Form of Government, from the Power of the Apoſtles over particular Churches,</hi> by which it is concluded that <hi>their Succeſſors ſhould have Power over them</hi> alſo; This Argument will eaſily be enervated by <hi>conſidering the Extent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and Limits of the Apoſtolical Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now it muſt be acknowleged, that <hi>the Apoſtolical Power reached to every Church as much as to any one:</hi> For, as they were empowered to <hi>diſciple all Nations and baptize</hi> through the whole World, they were alſo direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>to feed the Sheep and Lambs</hi> of CHRIST'S Fold, let it be ſaid, every where; and I am ready to grant, that this <hi>Feeding</hi> them implies in it <hi>all the Acts of Paſtoral Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, if all this be allowed; yet this will be no good Reaſon why any <hi>pretended Succeſſors</hi> to the Apoſtles ſhould have ſuch an extenſive Power. How indeed ſhould they come by it? For it does not yet appear that our SAVIOUR gave, and His Apoſtles tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it unto them: It follows therefore, that, altho' the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> might have <hi>ſuch a wide Power</hi> and extenſive Influence, <hi>their Power and Influence ended with them,</hi> and <hi>no others may claim it to themſelves and act in vertu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:004275_0032_100431C921985F50"/>
And beſides I am ready to acknowledge <hi>the Power of the Apoſtles to be extended not only to all Churches, but alſo to the Performance of the various particular Offices in the ſeveral Churches:</hi> So that, as <hi>Paſtors,</hi> as <hi>Teachers,</hi> as <hi>Rulers</hi> and as <hi>Deacons,</hi> they might <hi>teach and exhort, govern, receive and diſtribute the Offerings of the Church:</hi> Nay I am willing to grant for the preſent, that <hi>any one Apoſtle or Evangeliſt might baptize or cenſure</hi> any Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, juſt as if the whole Church were preſent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd in thoſe Actions.</p>
            <p>But what then? Will it follow, becauſe PHILIP baptized <hi>the Ethiopian Eunuch</hi> without any Church, and the Apoſtle PAUL excommunicated ALEXANDER without any, that therefore this was their conſtant Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice? No ſurely: For, when the Apoſtle PAUL could <hi>obtain the Conſent of the Church and Preſbytery</hi> in the Exerciſe of any Act or Eccleſiaſtical Power, he readily took it, as <hi>in the Ordination of</hi> Timothy <hi>and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication of the Inceſtuous</hi> Corinthian.</p>
            <p>It may therefore be fairly concluded, that <hi>the Apoſtles,</hi> when they were <hi>diſtant from all Churches, put forth their Power in the Adminiſtration of any Church-Acts,</hi> and the Power which they had received of CHRIST was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to countenance and juſtify them in ſo doing; but that in Churches, which were regularly form'd and organical, they did not exert any <hi>ſuch Power as was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the Privileges of the People.</hi> Nay they were ſo far from it, that we have Reaſon to think, that they did not <hi>baptize or ordain or excommunicate without the Conſent of the People. Were not all Things belonging to the Churches,</hi> whether PAUL or APOLLOS or CEPHAS? Did not theſe <hi>derive their Power of acting in them from Them under CHRIST?</hi> And <hi>were not the Apoſtles given to the Churches?</hi> Truely the Scriptures affirm ſo, nor ever ſay that <hi>the Churches were given to the Apoſtles or any other Rulers.</hi> And, as for the Inſtances which have bin produced, from which <hi>the Plenitude of the Apoſtolical Power</hi> is ſometimes argued; it muſt firſt of
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:004275_0033_100431CFBAED76E8"/>all he proved, that <hi>there were Churches formed and gathered in the Places where they adminiſtred the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of CHRIST and the Diſcipline of His Appointment,</hi> before there can be any Thing argued from thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances: For, if there were <hi>no formed Churches,</hi> and <hi>it has not yet bin proved that there were in thoſe Places;</hi> it is not at all to be wondred at, if <hi>the Apoſtles did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the Churches, but acted alone:</hi> They could do no otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>But, even allowing that the Apoſtles in the Fulneſs of their Apoſtolical Power did theſe and ſuch like Acts when and where they pleaſed, without any Regard to the People; ſtill what is all this to ſuch as <hi>pretend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be Succeſſors of the Apoſtles?</hi> For have they any <hi>ſuch Power and Authority?</hi> Or, <hi>ought they to have</hi> any ſuch? Or, if any ſuch Pretenders are in Poſſeſſion of it, <hi>how came they by it? —</hi> Surely theſe are the Men, that <hi>enter not by the Door into the Sheepfold, but they climb up ſome other Way:</hi> They are therefore to be conſidered by Mankind as <hi>daring Thieves and Robbers</hi> of them in their beſt Intereſts.</p>
            <p>There are others who argue, that <hi>particular Churches ſhould be abſolutely ſubject to their own Elders or to other Churches.</hi> But to this the Anſwer is eaſy, to wit, that <hi>particular Churches have an undoubted Liberty to act within themſelves.</hi> Now will you ſay, that they <hi>derived this Liberty either from their own Elders or from Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Chriſtian Societies?</hi> How can you ſay from the <hi>former,</hi> when it was <hi>in the Power of the Churches to chuſe</hi> their Elders and they exerciſed their Liberty in the Choice of them? So that <hi>the Churches</hi> could not derive their Power and Liberty from their <hi>Elders;</hi> becauſe, before they had their <hi>Elders,</hi> they were <hi>in the rightful Poſſeſſion of this Power and Liberty, and ſaw meet to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And how can it be ſaid, that <hi>other particular Churches conferred on them this Power and Liberty?</hi> For <hi>all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches have equal Power and Liberty</hi> within
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:004275_0034_100431D2887F4718"/>themſelves. There was a Church at <hi>Cenchrea,</hi> which was but a little Village, a ſmall Port to <hi>Corinth;</hi> and yet that ſmall Church was <hi>not ſubject</hi> to the Church of <hi>Corinth.</hi> Nor indeed ought any <hi>one particular Church</hi> to be ſubject or ſubordinate to another, however nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, great and eminent: For there is <hi>not a Tittle</hi> in the Scripture <hi>to juſtify ſuch a Subordination of Churches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor yet is This the declared Opinion of ſuch only as profeſs and practiſe the <hi>Congregational Way;</hi> but I find, that others, who conform to a different Way, have received and expreſſed the very ſame Opinion: Thus, for Inſtance, the vaſtly learned GILBERT VOET, in Anſwer to this Queſtion, <hi>Whether Miniſters alone, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered by themſelves or as in a Body, that is, as a meeting of a Synod of Miniſters; and whether conſtant Claſſes of the Delegates of Churches whether of Miniſters alone or other Elders along with them are the firſt Subject of Eccleſiaſtical Power, ſo that from them this Power is derived to particular Churches and their Conſiſtories?</hi> He writes in this Manner, <hi>No! I am ſo far from thinking, that Churches owe their Riſe to ſuch Aſſemblies as their firſt conſtituent Principles,</hi> that <hi>all the Power of the Churches is communicated from them and muſt finally be reſolved into them, and that therefore as to their Riſe and continuing to act, they are dependant on ſuch Aſſemblies:</hi> I am ſo far from thinking this, that <hi>I chuſe rather to determine the contrary. — For this I offer no other Reaſon but the following, that every particular Church is by itſelf, and may be called, a Church, and conſequently is the firſt and proper Subject of Eccleſiaſtical Power: As much as every Man is the Subject of the Faculty of Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Tantum abeſt ut Eccleſias ab illis Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

            </p>
            <p>But then, what ſhall we ſay to our <hi>Preſbyterian Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> who argue that <hi>particular Churches ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant on Councils and other Judicatories and ought to be determined by them, juſt as the Jewiſh Synagogues by the greater Sanhedrim at</hi> Jeruſalem?</p>
            <p>We may ſay and ſtand to it, that <hi>particular Churches are not beholden to Councils, Synods or any other Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories</hi> for their Liberty. 'Tis true the Church of AN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIOCH <hi>borrowed Light</hi> from the Synod at JERUSALEM,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:004275_0036_100431D557F266D0"/>and by the Decrees of that Synod were <hi>eſtabliſhed in Truth and Peace:</hi> But it cannot be made to appear, that <hi>they derived any Liberty at all</hi> from them. No! They had undoubtedly <hi>the Power and Liberty of acting within themſelves.</hi> They might indeed in an emergent Caſe ſend to JERUSALEM for <hi>Advice and Aſſiſtance:</hi> But <hi>this ſending</hi> there will neither prove <hi>any Juriſdiction</hi> in the JERUSALEM Churches over the Church of AN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIOCH, nor any <hi>Want of Juriſdiction</hi> in the Church of ANTIOCH. Any Number of Men or any Council or Synod of Churches may <hi>doctrinally</hi> propoſe Rules as neceſſary to be obſerved; but yet they may not claim any Authority <hi>in a Diſciplinary Way to puniſh</hi> thoſe that will not conform to thoſe Rules: And therefore, altho' <hi>a Power of explaining and confirming Doctrines</hi> according to the <hi>Scriptures</hi> might be allowed to be in a Council or Synod, this will not prove that they have <hi>any further Authority in a Diſciplinary Way</hi> to enforce their Decrees on particular Churches: Nor indeed has the Word of GOD granted to any Councils or Synods or other Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatories any ſuch Juriſdiction over particular Churches.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Preſbyterian</hi> Brethren will probably ſay here, <hi>What! Shall particular Churches be dependant upon no Judicatories? Why may they not depend on Councils and Synods and other Judicatories? The Jewiſh</hi> Synagogues <hi>depended on the</hi> Sanhedrim <hi>at</hi> Jeruſalem: <hi>And why ſhould not</hi> Chriſtian Synagogues <hi>acknowledge the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of neighbouring Preſbyteries,</hi> of provincial Synods, of national Conventions and General Aſſemblies?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, that, ſuppoſing the <hi>Synagogues</hi> or particular Congregations in <hi>Iſrael</hi> did depend upon a <hi>ſuperior Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory,</hi> it will not therefore follow that <hi>particular Chriſtian Congregations ſhould do ſo too:</hi> And the Reaſon is very plain and obvious, nor is it eaſy to enervate it, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe <hi>particular Synagogues or Congregations</hi> then <hi>were not complete Churches, as Chriſtian particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> now <hi>are:</hi> For the People <hi>could not have the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and continual Worſhip and Ordinances of GOD</hi> in
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:004275_0037_100431D80E0E1948"/>them; but they were obliged to go up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that ſo they might attend and enjoy them: Nay they were ſtrictly commanded <hi>not to keep the Paſſover nor to bring any Sacrifices and Offerings onely at</hi> Jeruſalem, the Place which GOD had choſen for the ſpecial Seat of His Preſence: But now where is our <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> We know of none but <hi>that which is above,</hi> the Mother of us all.</p>
            <p>And, as for <hi>Chriſtian Churches,</hi> They are entirely dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Things from the <hi>Jewiſh Synagogues:</hi> For all the ordinary Worſhip and all the ſpecial Ordinances of GOD our SAVIOUR may now be enjoyed in <hi>particular Churches:</hi> And this ſhews them to be <hi>perfect and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire</hi> within themſelves: And in Truth there is nothing to be found in all the New Teſtament of <hi>any greater Church inſtitued upon which leſſer Churches ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend:</hi> Nor are any Ordinances or Methods of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip preſcribed in it, but what may be obſerved in every <hi>particular Congregation.</hi>

            <p>Beſides; It is to be conſidered, that at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> there was a <hi>ſupreme Judicatory,</hi> which had an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troleable Power and from the Determinations of which there was no Appeal: So that this was the <hi>dernier Reſort</hi> upon Earth: Let it be ſo: But in the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> we read of no ſuch <hi>ſupreme Judicatory:</hi> And therefore, if we once depart from a <hi>particular Church</hi> for <hi>Juriſdiction,</hi> we ſhall be <hi>wiſe beyond what is written</hi> and run wild in our Imaginations. All <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould be confined to <hi>particular Churches,</hi> in whoſe Hands our SAVIOUR hath left it: Nor may any <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches</hi> by any Act of their own or thro' their own Negligence deprive themſelves of this Power: For, as by ſo doing they would betray a <hi>great Truſt</hi> committted to them, ſo they would <hi>renounce their Duty</hi> alſo by it: For, unleſs they <hi>have and keep this Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi> within themſelves, they <hi>cannot faithfully diſcharge various Duties,</hi> which are required of them by CHRIST JESUS their Lawgiver.</p>

Theſe Churches indeed acknowledge a <hi>Conſociation of Churches</hi> for mutual Light and Aſſiſtance; and, as they conceive, that ſuch Churches as will not act in Conjunction with others, but confine their Duty within the narrow Limits of their own Aſſemblies, <hi>cut them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves off from the external Commution of the Catholic Church;</hi> they judge alſo that it will not be ſafe or pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent for any Chriſtian to commit his Soul to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and Conduct of <hi>ſuch an independent Church.</hi> But, while theſe Churches acknoledge a <hi>Conſociation</hi> among them, they cannot think that this Conſociation forms and conſtitutes a <hi>new Sort of Church,</hi> or <hi>a Church of Churches</hi> as the famous Mr. COTTON once ſpoke, tho' he afterwards ſpake and thought otherwiſe: Nor do our Churches allow, that <hi>ſuch a Conſociation may take away or leſſen the Power and Liberty of particular Churches:</hi> For they think, that, <hi>without any ſuch Conſociation or Correſpondence of Churches, every particular Church is eſſentially and integrally a true Church <note n="(c)" place="bottom">

This was the Opinion of the Fathers of <hi>New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and indeed of <hi>all the ancient Non-Confromiſts</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in <hi>England:</hi> So one of them in the Name of the Reſt has obſerved; and Dr. DOWNHAM, in a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> page 5th. ſays, <hi>They,</hi> that is, the Non-Conformiſts, <hi>ſay, that every Pariſh hath ſufficient Authority within it ſelf immediately derived from CHRIST for the Government of itſelf in all Cauſe Eccleſiaſtical.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſome ſanguine People cannot be content with ſuch a Conſociation as has bin mentioned: No! They want ſomthing further: They muſt have their <hi>Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catories,</hi> they will have their <hi>deciſive Synods or Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> or elſe they will preſently be for condemning <hi>the Goſpel as more defective than the Law:</hi> Nay it is well, if they do not plead for <hi>external Force</hi> and for Officers and Powers derived from humane Laws, concerning which the Scripture is utterly ſilent.</p>
            <p>If ſuch Perſon as theſs could but be perſwaded for a Moment to look off from their beloved ſecular Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, and to hear what we have to ſay upon this Head, probably they might emerge into better Sentiments. Come then, all ſuch of you as have hitherto pleaded for <hi>Weapons which are not chriſtian and ſpiritual, but carnal</hi> and worldly, <hi>tho' mighty thro'</hi> Satan <hi>for the pulling down</hi> of all ſuch as conſcientiouſly diſlike and oppoſe your vain unſcriptural Imaginations; Come, I ſay, and let us reaſon a little with Calmneſs upon the Head be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us. You ſay then, that you would have a <hi>ſupreme Judicatory for the final Iſſuing of Cauſe,</hi> with a deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ungainſayable Power for that Purpoſe: Very well. To this it may be anſwered, <hi>why may not a particular Church be this Judicatory?</hi> For indeed the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment has not appointed any other. Whereas, according to your Opinion, we ſhall be at a Loſs forever <hi>where to find the Judicatory,</hi> which you want and for which you ſo zealouſly plead: For, from a <hi>Congregation and Claſſis,</hi> you muſt go to a <hi>Provincial Synod:</hi> And where next? Then to a <hi>National Synod:</hi> And what will you
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:004275_0040_100431E173E1D470"/>do then? Afterwards you muſt go to a <hi>general acu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menical Council;</hi> by which Means your Cauſe will be unreaſonably protracted, nor in all Probability ever come to a final Deciſion.</p>
            <p>You will perhaps think it enow to reply, that, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs there be ſtated Judicatories for the bearing of Cauſes,</hi> we ſhall be continually at Uncertainties and never know in our Difficulties what ſhall be done: But it is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Anſwer to this to ſay, that <hi>particular Churches are ſuch ſtanding Judicatories,</hi> not of humane Appointrment but of Divine, which always are or ſhould be ready to hear and to give Judgment in Caſes that properly come before them: Whereas <hi>Synods and other Judicatories,</hi> if they had the <hi>Supreme Power</hi> lodged in their Hands, would <hi>not always be ready</hi> to conſider nor yet to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, but would be both <hi>long in meeting and tedious in determining the Affairs</hi> which come before them.</p>
            <p>And, in fine, I would add, in Anſwer to any other Objection thay may remain or may poſſibly be raiſed or drawn <hi>from the Advantage of ſuch a Supreme Judicatory as is ſuppoſed to have ſat at</hi> Jeruſalem: Firſt of all, That it is very probable, that ſuch a <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> as the Friends of it ſuppoſe to be derived down from Mosas in an uninterrupted Succeſſion to the Fourth Century after JESUS CHRIST, tho' ſome ſay not ſo late, <hi>is a mere Rabbinical Chimera that never had any real Exiſtence</hi> For the Scriptures never any where expreſsly mention it: Nor yet does JOSEPHUS or PHILO or any other well acquainted with the Jewiſh Government ever ſpeak of it in ſuch a Manner as is uſual on theſe Occaſions There are indeed ſome Paſſages in the Goſpels, which give us Reaſon to think that there was a <hi>Sambedrim</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>latter End of the Jewiſh State:</hi> But the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Silence of the <hi>Times foregoing</hi> is a ſtrong Argument for not admitting any ſuch Thing before <hi>the Babyloniſh Captivity:</hi> So that <hi>the Proofs</hi> of ſuch a Supreme Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory to be Divinely inſtituted and as ſuch ſub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>iſſively regarded may well be queſtioned by us; and therefore
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:004275_0041_100406436ED43860"/>the Argument, drawn from the ſame, may as to us be conſidered as inconcluſive and frivolous.</p>
            <p>But, if it ſhould be granted you, that there was ſuch a <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in every Reſpect according to your Imagination; yet we may ſafely affirm, that, in thoſe <hi>particular Churches inſtituted by our SAVIOUR and conforming to His Directions, we have much the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the</hi> Jews in that Judicatory: For now, praiſed be GOD our SAVIOUR, <hi>Churches, wherein the Supreme Power upon Earth is lodged, are many:</hi> So that Chriſtians may have the Advantage of <hi>that</hi> Power with <hi>conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Eaſe and Convenience:</hi> It would therefore be very ſtrange, if they were not duely <hi>apprehenſive</hi> of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Privilege enjoyed by them, and <hi>thankful</hi> to GOD their SAVIOUR for the Enjoyment of it.</p>
            <p>Thus I have in a general Way pleaded for the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of theſe Churches and ſhewed that they are not ſubject to any Judicatories nor ought to be ſubject to any: And, upon the whole, I am free to declare, that, ſuppoſing ever ſo many <hi>Convocations or Synods or even General Councils were called,</hi> they would <hi>have no Juiriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction at all over theſe</hi> or any other particular or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational <hi>Churches:</hi> For the <hi>great Head of the Church never gave them any ſuch Juriſdiction,</hi> nor is it in their Power to prove that they have derived any ſuch Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction from HIM: Even that worthy Preſbyterian Mr. RUTHERFURD himſelf profeſſes, the he <q>

               <hi>Rhemiſts,</hi> Chap. III. p. 381. <hi>The Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, whatever they are, are given to the whole Church, as all the ancient Doctors agreable to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do confeſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>particular Churches</hi> we judge to be the firſt proper <hi>Subject of all Eccleſiaſtical Offices, Gifts and Powers</hi> according to CHRIST'S Inſtitution and the Primitive Pattern: For, when the Apoſtles had <hi>founded many Churches in ſmall Provinces and appointed ordinary Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers</hi> in them to adminiſter CHRIST'S Ordinances to all the Church; we find, that theſe Churches reſpectively <hi>met together</hi> in the ſame Place to <hi>impart the various Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Gifts</hi> with which they were furniſhed and to <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the Duties required</hi> of them: Nor can any Thing be more plain than this, that the various <hi>Gifts</hi> imparted to one particular Church and another by the HOLY SPIRIT, and the various <hi>Offices</hi> ſuſtained in them were to <hi>profit withal,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, or <hi>for the Good of the Hive,</hi> as his Greek ſignifies: And it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, for it is as clear as the Light, that <hi>the ſeveral Duties enjoyned upon particular Churches</hi> in the Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Writings are ſuch both in their Nature and the Manner of complying with them that they cannot be faithfully attended and obſerved but <hi>in particular Chriſtian Societies or Churches:</hi> So that we may well form this Concluſion, that it is <hi>the common Privilege of all other particular Churches</hi> to have various <hi>Gifts im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted,</hi> to have theſe <hi>Gifts exerciſed,</hi> to have <hi>Offices</hi> diſpoſed of, and <hi>Chriſtian Duties performed</hi> for them.</p>
            <p>But, having thus ſaid, that according to CHRIST'S Inſtitution and the Primitive Pattern we judge <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches to be the firſt Proper Subject of all Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aftical Offices, Gifts and Powers;</hi> I cannot but think it proper to introduce a Paſſage of the eminent Mr. CLAUDE, who thought it the beſt Way of maintaining the Reformation, in his <hi>Defence of it,</hi> to eſpouſe theſe Sentiments and expreſs them, as follows;</p>

               <q>AUSTIN proved to the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> that their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple was falſe; and it is worth the while to obſerve the Method which he took to convince them of the Falſity of their. Opinions.—He had Recourſe to <hi>the Body of the Church,</hi> and ſaid, that the Sacraments were <hi>not the Sacraments of the Biſhops</hi> or Paſtors; that <hi>the Power of the Keys did not belong to them,</hi> nor the Power of Binding and Looſing, nor the other Acts of the Miniſtry or Epiſcopal Office; but that <hi>all theſe Things did belong to the Church:</hi> So that it is <hi>the Church</hi> that baptizeth, when the Biſhops or Paſtors baptize; it is the Church that bindeth, when the Paſtors bind, it is She that looſeth, when the Paſtors looſe: And JESUS CHRIST gave all theſe Things to the Church. But what did AUSTIN un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand by <hi>the Church?</hi> Even <hi>the faithful People</hi> wherever they are, <hi>the Wheat of GOD, the good Grain, the good Fiſhes,</hi> as He calls them, in one Word, <hi>the Saints, true Believers:</hi> It was from this Source that He derived <hi>the Validity of the Sacraments</hi> and other Functions of the Epiſcopacy, and <hi>not from the Paſtors.</hi> And I ſay the ſame Thing. Whatever the Biſhops or Paſtors do, They do it in the Name of the Church, and conſequently in the Name of JESUS CHRIST; <hi>for the Name of CHRIST is in the Church.</hi> It is <hi>the Church that preaches</hi> by them, the Church adminiſters the Sacraments by them, governs by them, cenſures, ſuſpends, abſolves or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicates by them: The Biſhops or Paſtors are her Miniſters and the Diſpenſators of her Rights.</q>

            </p>
            <p>It is to be hoped, that, under the Light and vital Heat of theſe glorious Luminaries, <hi>the Churches,</hi> that have hitherto bin as it were under thoſe <hi>Clods of the Valley,</hi> their heavy and earthly Priefts, will e'er long <hi>ariſe out of the Earth</hi> and <hi>bloſſom</hi> in a fair Profeſſion of Chriſtianity and <hi>abound in all the Fruits of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> under a Rational and Scriptural Order.</p>
            <p>But, if other Churches love to continue in a dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate and corrupt State and <hi>hate to be reformed;</hi> GOD forbid, that <hi>the Churches of NEW-ENGLAND</hi> ſhould ever return to their miſerable Condition: Theſe Churches have <hi>come out from among</hi> them; but it is to be wiſhed and prayed, that they may never <hi>forget the Goodneſs of GOD in bringing them out, nor fail to anſwer the gracious Intentions of our ſtrong REDEEMER in ſo doing.</hi>

            <p>Let theſe Churches then be careful, leſt <hi>Ignorance, Negligence, Sloth and Wickedneſs ſhould prove their Ruin,</hi> as they have bin the Ruin of other Churches: Let them never blindly <hi>reſign themſelves to the Direction of their Miniſters;</hi> but conſider themſelves, as <hi>Men,</hi> as <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> as <hi>Proteſtants, obliged to judge and act for themſelves in all the weighty Concernments of Religion:</hi> Bleſſed be GOD, that our Churches have hitherto ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted themſelves worthy of this Privilege: And may they ſtill continue ſo!

            </p>
            <p>Several things have bin publiſhed by our eminent Predeceſſors, <hi>of whom the World was not worthy,</hi> in order to ſhew theſe Churches their Liberties and fire their Souls with a becoming Affection and Zeal for them: But moſt of thoſe Compoſures are not known among us: Inaſmuch therefore as I have the ſame ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Regard for the beſt Intereſts of theſe Churches; I could not but think it my Duty to <hi>produce my Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> concerning the Privileges of theſe Churches, which I know to be conformable to thoſe of my ever honoured Predeceſſors and Fathers in many of their <hi>printed Treatiſes and Manuſcripts,</hi> and ſo <hi>publiſh</hi> them for the Benefit of theſe Churches, that ſo they might <hi>know themſelves and learn to pity and pray for their Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> who are groaning under National Eſtabliſhments and long to be reſtored to our Liberties: And, that ſo our Churches may by the Divine Bleſſing be <hi>reſtored to their former Glory,</hi> I have thought it proper to uſe my beſt <hi>Endeavours for hte reforming of particular Churches by ſetting their diſtinguiſhing Liberties before them and ſoberly apologizing for</hi> them.</p>

               <head>Chapter I. The Right of theſe Churches to <hi>chuſe their own Miniſters and other Officers</hi> aſſerted and vindicated.</head>
               <p>PRopoſing thus to apologize for the diſtinguiſhing Privileges of theſe Churches; I begin with <hi>the Power and Liberty of chuſing their own Officers:</hi> A Power and Liberty, of which they have bin long poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, and to the Enjoyment of which they have a ſatisfactory and valid Title.</p>
               <p>In order to know what Methods and Rules our bleſſed LORD and SAVIOUR would have to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by His Churches; we muſt <hi>obſerve the Conduct and conſult the Writings of His Apoſtles,</hi> the Prime Miniſters of His Spiritual Kingdom, who were perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquainted with His Mind, who ſteadily conformed unto it, and in their Writings have clearly revealed it: For it is <hi>thro' their Word that we are to believe</hi> and judge and act in Eccleſiaſtical Affairs.</p>
               <p>If therefore <hi>in their Days,</hi> without their <hi>diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanceng</hi> ſuch a Practice, the <hi>Churches elected their own Officers; the Churches have the ſame Power and Right ſtill and ought to exerciſe the ſame:</hi> But this Matter of Fact ſhall be rendred manifeſt and inconteſtible, that <hi>the Churches in the Days of the Apoſtles choſe their own Officers:</hi> And, when this is made out, methinks there can be no Difficulty in <hi>allowing the Concluſion</hi> which is drawn from it.</p>
               <p>Now any one, that <hi>has Eyes and will ſee,</hi> may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold in the firſt Chapter of the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles that <hi>the Church were not excluded even in the Choice of
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:004275_0054_10043219C335EA28"/>an Apoſtle,</hi> who was to <hi>ſupply the Place from which</hi> JUDAS <hi>by Tranſgreſſion fell:</hi> For, altho' an Apoſtle was an <hi>extraordinary Officer,</hi> ſo that if <hi>the People had not bin concerned in the Election</hi> of ſuch an Officer, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably they would have bin ſatisfied; yet it is very clear, that <hi>the Church appointed two,</hi> out of which <hi>one</hi> was to be choſen to ſupply the Place of JUDAS; and it is equally clear, that, when <hi>the Lot fell upon</hi> MAT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THIAS, he was <hi>by the Suffrage of the Church choſen into the Number of the Apoſtles:</hi> For, altho' to ſerve a baſe Deſign it was on Purpoſe tranſlated in our Verſion, at Verſe the <hi>Twenty ſixth</hi> of that Chapter, <hi>he was num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred with the Apoſtles;</hi> nevertheleſs all, that underſtand any Thing of the <hi>Greek,</hi> muſt needs know the Truth of what the beſt Criticks inform us, namely, that MAT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THIAS was <hi>choſen by all the Votes into the Number of the Apoſtles <note n="(a)" place="bottom">

               </p>
               <p>And what can our modern boaſted Succeſſors from the Apoſtles ſay to this? Here was an <hi>Officer,</hi> an <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Officer,</hi> who received his Calling and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Authority from JESUS CHRIST HIMSELF immediately; and yet <hi>the Church,</hi> in the Preſence of the Apoſtles, <hi>firſt appointed two Perſons,</hi> and then <hi>by their common Conſent and Suffrage approved the Perſon whoſe Lot it was to be choſen by them!</hi> Truely they might as well reſiſt the Light of EUCLID'S Elements as the Light which appears in this Matter; and, if it were <hi>as much for their Intereſts,</hi> it is very probable that they would do ſo.</p>
               <p>But ſurely, from this celebrated Inſtance, <hi>Chriſtians have now ſufficient Inſtruction and Authority to chuſe their own Officers:</hi> For, if the <hi>People</hi> had a conſiderable Hand in the <hi>Choice of an Apoſtle,</hi> certainly <hi>their Right to chuſe ordinary Officers</hi> cannot well be diſputed; and, if <hi>in the Preſence of the Apoſtles,</hi> the <hi>People</hi> elected one into their Number, nor were excluded from this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:004275_0055_1004321C72B1DFF0"/>nor yet abridged in it by the preſent Apoſtles, it would now be a bold Attempt in any to <hi>deprive them of their Liberty to chuſe their ordinary Officers:</hi> I ſay, a bold Attempt; becauſe all ſuch as would <hi>deprive the People of GOD of their Liberty</hi> to chuſe their own Officers, and by the Excluſion or them would <hi>take this Power into their own Hands,</hi> are very aſſuming and arrogate to themſelves more than the Apoſtles of CHRIST, whoſe Power over the Church was doubtleſs extraordinary.</p>
               <p>This, it muſt be confeſſed, was a remarkable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and Proof of it, that <hi>the Apoſtles were true and hearty Friends to the Liberties of their Chriſtian Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren:</hi> But this is not the only Inſtance, wherein we find them to have bin ſo: For, when <hi>Deacons</hi> were to be appointed, they were far from taking that Affair into their own Hands; but, as we read in Act. VI. and 2, they <hi>called the whole Multitude</hi> unto them and adviſed them to <hi>look out ſeven Men who might be fit for that Buſineſs:</hi> And upon this it follows, that <hi>the Saying pleaſed the whole Multitude,</hi> and accordingly <hi>they choſe ſeven</hi> Perſons, whoſe Names are afterwards mentioned: And, having proceeded thus far, they then <hi>ſet the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons</hi> elected <hi>before the Apoſtles,</hi> who, <hi>when they had prayed, laid their Hands upon them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, that the Apoſtles continued to be Favourers of <hi>the People's Right to chuſe their Officers,</hi> may further be argued from Act. XIV. 23, where we read of the Apoſtles PAUL and BARNABAS <hi>ordaining Elders in every Church:</hi> For, whereas our Verſion to ſerve a Favourite Turn renders it only <hi>ordained,</hi> it is certain that the Word ſignifies <hi>an Election or a liſting up of Hands <note n="(c)" place="bottom">

<pb n="39" facs="unknown:004275_0056_1004321DF6C4EB78"/>namely, <hi>that, after the Death of thoſe who had bin or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by the Apoſtles, the People elected <note n="(o)" place="bottom">

               <p>We ſee then, that theſe Churches have <hi>the Authority of the Apoſtles</hi> to countenance them in the Choice of their Officers: If therefore the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> themſelves would not <hi>nominate and conſtitute Officers</hi> in the Churches, but it was <hi>their Right</hi> according to CHRIST'S Will to chuſe their own Officers; it muſt ſtill be <hi>the Right and Liberty, of the Churches to elect their Officers:</hi> Well therefore may we ſay with CHRYSOSTOM <note n="(p)" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Chryſoſtom.</hi> in Act. VI 5.</note>, <hi>So it was then,</hi> h. e. in the Days of the Apoſtles, <hi>and ſo it ought to be now.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, altho' theſe Scriptural Teſtimonies are enow to convince us, that, as we are <hi>in the rightful Poſſeſſion of this Liberty,</hi> we ought by all Means to keep it, nor to let it go upon any Account or Pretence whatſoever; there are however <hi>various Reaſons</hi> beſides, which will ſerve to betray the Folly and Stupidity of thoſe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that can tamely bear to be kept out of this Liberty, and at the ſame Time to <hi>confirm theſe Churches in their Reſolutions not to part with it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For it is certainly much more juſt and honeſt, much more fit and ſafe, that the <hi>Officers of the Church ſhould be choſen by the People,</hi> than it can be to have them <hi>nominated and appointed by any one Biſhop;</hi> becauſe a <hi>Biſhop</hi> may with much more Eaſe be deceived and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted than an whole Church, and may be very apt to abuſe his arrogated Power: And it is entirely rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, that the Church ſhould chuſe thoſe that are to be <hi>ſet over them in the LORD,</hi> leſt otherwiſe <hi>ignorant, droniſh, wicked and contemptible Officers ſhould be thruſt and impoſed upon</hi> them: And it is furthermor meet; becauſe there is <hi>no Likelibood</hi> of it, that <hi>the People will
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:004275_0057_1004321FBACC2F60"/>love and revere, hear with ſpiritual Profit and ſubmit with Delight to ſuch Perſons as are thruſt upon them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Inclinations:</hi> And, moreover, there is all the Reaſon in the World, that <hi>Men ſhould have the ſame Liberty in Religious Reſpects as they have in Civil:</hi> Men can chuſe their <hi>Friends,</hi> their <hi>Lawyers,</hi> their <hi>Phyſicians:</hi> And can there be any good Reaſon aſſigned, why they ſhould be <hi>hindred from the Exerciſe of the like Liberty in Spiritual Regards?</hi> Truely no!

               <p>Now what is there of Weight to be produced againſt ſuch Conſiderations as theſe?

               </p>
               <p>If then any ſhould argue <hi>for others,</hi> that they ſhould <hi>nominate and appoint Officers</hi> over the Churches, and not the Churches themſelves: This is what we perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily deny: For we cannot find, that <hi>GOD our SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR has given ſuch Power to any Men,</hi> who are not of a particular Church, <hi>to appoint Officers</hi> in and over it. Nor can we by any Means allow, that <hi>a Number of Men of any particular Church,</hi> in Excluſion of the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of their Brethren, <hi>ſhould conſtitute Officers</hi> in that particular Church: For we apprehend, that, in Things

               </p>
               <p>There are ſome, who are almoſt ready to concede to theſe Things; but yet they are for <hi>excluding the People</hi> from the Election of Eccleſiaſtical Officers, <hi>on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their Incapacity and unfitneſs</hi> to form a right Judgment concerning Perſons and to chuſe wiſely: I remember SIXTUS SENENSIS was of this Mind; for, altho' he acknowledges, that <hi>both in the Times of the Apoſtles and of Pope LEO the People choſe their Biſhops;</hi> yet, he adds <note n="(i)" place="bottom">

But it is a ſufficient Anſwer to all that can be ſaid to this Effect, that <hi>the People</hi> by our great Lawgiver and His Apoſtles <hi>are entruſted with this Privilege,</hi> and therefore, for any to ſay that they are <hi>not meet for this Privilege nor capable of diſcharging ſuch a Truſt,</hi> it muſt <hi>reflect upon the holy Apoſtles,</hi> and even upon <hi>the Wiſdom of our great SAVIOUR.</hi> And, if it ſhould be granted, that the People may grow <hi>factious</hi> and troubleſome in their Elections, and <hi>Confuſions</hi> ſhould ariſe by Means of them; what then? All, that this proves, is, that <hi>Churches may degenerate;</hi> and who denies that? But <hi>ſuch Degeneracy</hi> in them <hi>is to be lamented and reformed;</hi> and <hi>the People ſhould ſtill poſſeſs and enjoy their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of chuſing their Officers.</hi> Even BZOVIUS the Jeſuite was of this Mind, and he gives three Reaſons why it ſhould be ſo; namely, that ſo <hi>no Paſtor may be ſet over ſuch as are unwilling to have him over them, that ſo the Paſtor may be loved by his Sheep, and that ſo there may be as it were a Spiritual Marriage contracted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them by the Conſent of both.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Sum of what has bin ſaid is, that, both <hi>from Scriptural Authority and Examples and from the Reaſons of the Thing, Churches ſhould chuſe their own Officers,</hi> and that <hi>the Objections againſt their Enjoyment of this Liberty are of no Force and Validity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, if we ſearch the <hi>Archives of Antiquity,</hi> we ſhall find, that the <hi>Primitive Churches</hi> were in Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Liberty, which thro' the Divine Goodneſs theſe Churches enjoy.</p>

               <p>Now it is very evident from theſe Teſtimonies, that <hi>in the Primitive Times the Right of the Churches to chuſe their own Officers</hi> was acknowleged, maintained and exerciſed; and that this was <hi>one of the laſt Things which the Enemy of the beſt Intereſts of Mankind wickedly ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed from them.</hi>

               <head>Chapter II. The Right of theſe Churches <hi>to ordain their Miniſters</hi> ſtated and argued.</head>
               <p>THE Deſign of this Chapter is not to deny, that, in churches which are furniſhed with Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, <hi>thoſe Preſbyteries may uſe Impoſition of Hands and ordain:</hi> For this is what is readily acknowledged by theſe Churches.</p>
               <p>Nothing can be more plain, than that the Church is before its ordinary Officers: I ſay its <hi>ordinary Officers,</hi> For our bleſſed LORD might, as He actually did, <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain Apoſtles,</hi> when there was yet no Evangelical Church, to <hi>diſciple the Nations and baptize</hi> them and <hi>gather Churches</hi> out of ſuch diſcipled and baptized Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: But it does not appear, that the Apoſtles either did or could <hi>ordain any ſtated Officers,</hi> until there were <hi>Churches formed</hi> for the Reception of them: So that we judge it an abſurd and extravagant Thing, and the Whim of only ſome Eccleſiaſtical <hi>Don Quixots,</hi> to aſcribe the Continuance of the Church to the <hi>ſucceſſive uninterrupted Ordination of Officers:</hi> For, if there were any ſuch Thing as a <hi>ſucceſſive uninterrupted Ordination of Officers,</hi> which there is hardly one found Proteſtant that can believe there is; ſtill <hi>this ſucceſſive Ordination of Officers</hi> wholly and entirely depends upon the <hi>Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of the Church,</hi> and muſt be an <hi>Act of the Church;</hi> and therefore it can <hi>never be a Means of communicating Eccleſiaſtical Power to others,</hi> without which there would be an End of all Eccleſiaſtical Power, as ſome fondly imagine or would make us believe that they imagine, — And beſides; It muſt be not only a vain and idle, but
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:004275_0069_10043243E17A4C18"/>an impious Attempt, <hi>to derive a Succeſſion,</hi> upon which the Being of a Church ſhall depend, <hi>thro' the Preſence of CHRIST with the Biſhops of</hi> Rome, <hi>who for an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years together,</hi> namely from the Year 900 to the Year 1000, <hi>were Monſters for Ignorance, Luſt, Pride and Luxury,</hi> as BARONIUS himſelf acknowledges, A. D. 912.5.8.</p>
               <p>And yet there are here and there ſome defective Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, who are fond of their <hi>uninterrupted Line of Succeſſion.</hi> But we may fitly enquire of them, Why there is ſuch a Thing as a <hi>Degradation,</hi> and for what Purpoſe it is practiſed at any Time among them? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly you will all allow, that they, who <hi>by Schiſm are cut off from the Church, muſt</hi> alſo be cut off from that Part of Apoſtolical Power to which they made their Pretenſions; and ſo it cannot be indelibly fixed on them. And ſurely, where <hi>no Part of the Apoſtolical Power</hi> can be claimed, there can be <hi>no Succeſſion</hi> to it. Now, in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> it has bin proved by ONUPHRIUS an Hiſtorian of their own, that there have bin at leaſt <hi>Thirty Schiſms,</hi> by ſeveral, ſometimes no leſs than <hi>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap> or ſix</hi> at once, pretending to the Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: And one of the Schiſms laſted more than <hi>Fifty Years,</hi> when one Pope ſat at <hi>Rome,</hi> another at <hi>Avignon:</hi> Nay BELLARMINE is obliged to acknowlege, that, for above <hi>Eighty Years</hi> together, the Church for want of a <hi>lawful Pope</hi> had no other Head than what was in Heaven. And, if <hi>Schiſm deſtroys the Succeſſion</hi> of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical Power, certainly <hi>damnable Hereſy, Deviliſm and Atheiſm will alſo do it.</hi> Now what can be ſaid to the Complaints of BARONIUS about the End of the Ninth Century, <hi>How deformed,</hi> ſays he, <hi>was the Romiſh Church, when Whores no leſs powerful than vile bore the chief Sway at Rome, and at their Pleaſure changed Sees and appointed Biſhops, and which is horrible to mention, did thruſt their own Gallants into the See of Saint</hi> Peter. There cannot therefore be any Thing more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent than that <hi>the Succeſſion has failed,</hi> tho' indeed, if
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:004275_0070_10043248F85AB648"/>it were not ſo, the <hi>uninterrupted Succeſſion can never be proved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But there are ſome, who, tho' they could never find in their Hearts to believe the mad Whim of <hi>Papal Succeſſion</hi> and a <hi>ſucceſſive Ordination,</hi> yet, in order to eſtabliſh an Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction or Government, are for <hi>giving the Power of Ordination into the Hands of the Biſhop or of a Synod:</hi> But it is to be hoped, that theſe Churches will know better than to <hi>give ſuch an ineſtimable Branch of Eccleſiaſtical Power out of their own Hands</hi> into the Hands of others, who ought not to have it, and who in the Poſſeſſion of it have always made the worſt Uſe of it.</p>
               <p>Theſe Churches are far from diſowning, that, <hi>when a particular Church has Elders of its own, theſe Elders by the Impoſition of Hands may ordain ſuch other Officers,</hi> as that Church may ſee Cauſe to elect: But our <hi>Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal and Preſbyterian Brethren</hi> ſtill inſiſt upon it, that <hi>Ordination is a Part of Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction, to be diſpenſed, by the Biſhop,</hi> ſay the former, <hi>by the Elderſhip and that conſociated,</hi> ſay the latter.</p>
               <p>It is evident, nor has any one yet bin able to prove to the contrary, that TIMOTHY was <hi>ordained by the Preſbytery,</hi> not by any particular <hi>Biſhop</hi> alone: And, for ought that yet appears, <hi>the Preſbytery</hi> which laid Hands upon that Evangeliſt, might be <hi>the Preſbytery of a particular Church,</hi> and not of a Synod or inferior Claſſis: Ney it is very probable, that <hi>it was the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery of a particular Church:</hi> For, altho' PAUL and BARNABAS were <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> yet they were not ordained [that is to ſay, <hi>if they were ordained</hi>] <hi>by any Claſſis or Preſbyterial Synod,</hi> nor yet by one <hi>ſingle Perſon;</hi> but <hi>by the Preſbytery of one particular Church,</hi> namely the Church at <hi>Antioch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But you will enquire, it is very likely, how it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that the <hi>Elderſhip,</hi> in Act. XIII, which ordained PAUL and BARNABAS, was but <hi>the Preſbytery of one particular Congregation?</hi> And I anſer, that this is
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:004275_0071_1004324A82758FF8"/>plain from Act. XIV. 27, which clearly repreſents to us, that the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> was not ſo great but that it could <hi>aſſemble in one Place;</hi> and, that <hi>the whole Multitude at the Return of</hi> PAUL and BARNABAS <hi>from the Synod at</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>met together to hear the Epiſtle which that Synod had ſent them,</hi> this is very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt from Act. XV. 30 and 31. Now therefore the Concluſion muſt be this, that, the Church at <hi>Antioch</hi> being but <hi>one particular Church, the Preſbutery,</hi> by which PAUL and BARNABAS were ordained, could not be a <hi>Synodical Preſbytery,</hi> but <hi>the Preſbytery of a particular Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is, I confeſs, a conſiderable Noiſe made both by our <hi>Preſbyterian and Epiſcopal Brethren</hi> about the Epiſtles to TIMOTHY and TITUS: For, while the <hi>former</hi> are endeavouring to <hi>ſupport and eſtabliſh their beloved Claſſes and Synods from</hi> TIMOTHY'S <hi>Ordination;</hi> the <hi>latter</hi> continue to inſiſt upon it, that <hi>theſe Epiſtles are purely Epiſcopal:</hi> But the beſt Conſtruction, which can be made of thoſe Epiſtles is plainly this; to wit, that they were <hi>not deſigned for thoſe Evangeliſts alone, nor any Miniſters alone, but for a State that was mixed,</hi> wherein <hi>the ſaid Evangeliſts,</hi> having ſome <hi>aſſiſting Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters</hi> or other Officers, <hi>adminiſtred and executed the Affairs of the Agreement of the People:</hi> For, altho' the Epiſtles be written <hi>by Name,</hi> and ſay <hi>eſpecially,</hi> to TIMOTHY and TITUS; ſtill there can be no Queſtion but that they were <hi>really intended for general Uſe and Advantage:</hi> And this is what we may fairly conclude from the Apoſtle's Wiſh, <hi>Grace be with you, Grace be with you</hi> all, which cloſes one Epiſtle and another: For it cannot be well imagined, that theſe Wiſhes are only belogning to the <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> to whom the Epiſtles are directed. Why then ſhould it be conceeded to our Brethren of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that the Apoſtle writes his three Epiſtles to two Arch-Biſhops or <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trapolitans;</hi> eſpecially when, as the famous CALDER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WOOD
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:004275_0072_1004324D4364A700"/>obſerves, <hi>there is not ſo much as one Thing inſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in them that can properly ſerve the Arch-Biſhop or Metropolitan?</hi> For, adds he, here are <hi>no Apoſtolical Monitions about convoking Synods of Biſhops, concerning Conſecrations of Biſhops, concerning the Correction of the Defects and Exceſſes of Prelates, and receiving Appeals from Epiſcopal Conſiſtories; altho' theſe,</hi> according to your Hierarchical Gentlemen, <hi>are the chief Offices of Arch-Biſhops <note n="(x)" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Didoclav.</hi> Altar. Damaſcen, p. 37.</note>.</hi>—And why ſhould we allow thoſe Things to be found in theſe Epiſtles, which our <hi>Preſbyterian</hi> Brethren fondly value, when no ſuch Things are in theſe Epiſtles? If it were actually declared in them, that in <hi>Crete</hi> and at <hi>Epheſus</hi> there were <hi>Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertes;</hi> yet where do we read of the <hi>Powers to be claimed by theſe</hi> Preſbyteries or the <hi>Subjection of theſe Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries</hi> to other and ſuperior Judicatories?</p>
               <p>As to thoſe, who confidently report, that <hi>Ordination cannot be validly and lawfully performed</hi> but by a Biſhop; we think it a ſufficient Anſwer to ſay, that we find the firſt Mention of a <hi>Biſhop</hi> diſtinct from <hi>Preſbyters</hi> to have bin about <hi>Three Hundred Years after our</hi> SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR: And this is no more than what many of the more ſober and conſiderate of the <hi>Epiſcopalian Writers</hi> are free to acknowlege: And we conceive, that even <hi>then,</hi> for ought that the Friends of Dioceſan Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy have bin able to prove to the contrary, there was <hi>no Biſhop who had any Juriſdiction or Authority over other Miniſters, but who in common with other Miniſters ruled and governed the Churches</hi> according to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and Agreement.</p>
               <p>But, if for Argument's ſake it ſhould be allowed, that the <hi>Biſhop was a diſtinct Order from the Preſbyter;</hi> ſtill this will be no Demonſtration, that <hi>the Biſhop alone has the Power of ordaining:</hi> How then ſhall we be made ſenſible of it, that the <hi>Biſhop alone ſhould have this Power?</hi> Alas! <hi>Confident Aſſertions</hi> of a Thing
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:004275_0073_100432539BCB3FE8"/>will never convince us concerning the Truth of it, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of ſuch a Thing as this which can never be proved: For <hi>in the whole New Teſtament there is not ſo much as one Inſtance of an Ordination that was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by a ſingle Perſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us therefore turn to our <hi>Preſbyterian</hi> Friends and attend to what they have ot offer: Now they are ready to object and ſay, <hi>But,</hi> dear Brethren, <hi>where do you read of any Ordinations but by</hi> Preſbyters? For Anſwer to theſe our entirely beloved Brethren, there is no need of referring them to the Direction, in Numb. VIII. 10, <hi>Thou ſhalt bring the</hi> Levites <hi>before the LORD, and the</hi> Children of Iſrael <hi>ſhall put their Hands upon the</hi> Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites; from which Direction ſome have argued, that when <hi>a Church is deſtitute of Elders and Elders cannot conveniently be had from another Church,</hi> then <hi>Impoſition of Hands</hi> may be performed by ſome of the <hi>conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Men of the Congregation,</hi> altho' they ſhould not be <hi>Elders;</hi> and that therefore, what was performed in the Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> may in the like Caſe be at preſent performed.</p>
               <p>But, waving this Argument, I ſhall now remark and ſhew, that the Caſe may be ſuch as that, <hi>if Ordination be really requiſite, by the Impoſition of Hands, then it way be performed by ſuch as are not Officers at all in the Church:</hi> Now this is very clear; for <hi>the State of Things may be ſuch, that there cannot be any Ordination at all by the Impoſition of the Hands of Elders:</hi> And in ſuch a State as this, as there are <hi>no Elders or Biſhops.</hi> either there muſt be <hi>no Ordination</hi> by the Impoſition of Hands at all, or elſe <hi>the Ordination muſt be performed by ſuch as are no Officers:</hi> And, that this may be the Caſe of a Church, that <hi>Ordination cannot be performed by Officers</hi> in it, this ſhall preſently be made evident.</p>
               <p>To ſuch therefore as are of the Opinion, that <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation by Officers</hi> is ſo neceſſary that there is <hi>no perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it without them,</hi> we may calmly addreſs ourſelves and expoſtulate; <hi>Dear Sirs, How will you prove the
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:004275_0074_100432569423AF78"/>Neceſſity of Ordination</hi> for Elders or Biſhops? And, if you will have it neceſſary, I pray, <hi>what ſhall be done where there are no Eccleſiaſtical Officers to be had?</hi> For this may be <hi>the Caſe of a Society of Chriſtians</hi> by Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wreck thrown upon a Place where there are <hi>no Elders;</hi> ſay, upon the Iſland of <hi>Bermuda,</hi> which erects its ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Head in the <hi>Atlantic</hi> at a Diſtance from other Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: Suppoſe in this Caſe Mr. PAUL ſhould providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially come among them, who had never bin ſeparated to the Evangelical Miniſtry; might he not teach and inſtruct them in the Principles of Chriſtianity? And, if <hi>Ordination were neceſſary</hi> in order to his Diſpenſation of the Word and Ordinances, might not the <hi>poor Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wreck'd Chriſtians properly ordain him and ſeparate him by the Impoſition of Hands to the Work of the Miniſtry?</hi> or, which to me is the ſame Thing, <hi>by the laying on of their Hands, commend him to the Grace of GOD in that Work to which they have called him?</hi> Truely it is very plain to me that they might. This is certain, that, at the Beginning of the Reformation in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the old Manner of <hi>electing and ordaining Miniſters was perform'd without Impoſition of Hands,</hi> as may be ſeen in KNOX'S Forms prefix'd to the old <hi>Pſalms:</hi> And the ingenious STEUART, in the Fourteenth Page of his <hi>Collections,</hi> affirms this Ordination was <hi>lawful and valid.</hi> If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſhould be thought <hi>too much</hi> for Brethren choſen to it <hi>to impoſe Hands</hi> on elected Officers; certainly we may <hi>claim the electing and ordaining Power</hi> for the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren without it. And this is what all Men would ſoon diſcover, if it were not for <hi>the Intereſt of ſome worldly minded Perſons</hi> to entangle the Sentiments of Mankind and lead them aſide.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Antiquity</hi> is no Stranger to ſuch an Opinion as ours: For FRUMENTIUS, who was <hi>not in holy Orders,</hi> went and preach'd to the <hi>Indians,</hi> and afterwards was made a Prieſt and Biſhop by ATHANASIUS: But no one that I know of ever faulted his Conduct: Nor has the King of the <hi>Iberians</hi> bin condemned, altho' <hi>before be was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:004275_0075_10043258185F97F0"/>by Elders or even baptized,</hi> he converted his Subjects, and, according to the ancient Hiſtorian, <hi>before he was initiated himſelf was the Apoſtle of his Countrey.</hi> And it is probable, that many even in the Times of the Apoſtles <hi>preach'd and receiv'd Orders</hi> from the Churches to which they came: For SANCTIUS <note n="(a)" place="bottom">

                  <hi>for ordaining them at home,</hi> whom they choſe for their Miniſters.</p>
               <p>And this leads me to demand, <hi>how we ſhall do, if we cannot improve the Officers, which we may obtain, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer holy Orders?</hi> For it ſometimes happens, that, <hi>where
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:004275_0076_10043295F3E28438"/>Officers may be had</hi> to perform this Service, <hi>thoſe Officers,</hi> as well as the <hi>Churches</hi> to which they belong, may be ſo very corrupt or wicked that it would be <hi>better not to improve</hi> them: And therefore we need not be afraid or aſhamed to declare, that, if our Churches here can have no Miniſters but what muſt be <hi>ordained by Popiſh Biſhops,</hi> the Caſe appears to us as ſorrowful, as if the poor <hi>Sheep</hi> in the Wilderneſs could have none but <hi>Wolves</hi> to appoint <hi>Shepherds</hi> over them: Bleſſed be GOD, this is not the Caſe with theſe Churches.— But let the Caſe be imagined, that there may be a general <hi>Combination of degenerate Paſtors</hi> in a Countrey, who will be for <hi>diſpenſing Ordination to none but ſuch as will partake with them in their Degeneracy or ſubmit unto ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Terms;</hi> where a <hi>particular Church</hi> is deſirous to have all Things <hi>according to the Pattern in the Mount:</hi> Now in this Caſe would not <hi>the making the Impoſition of Hands</hi> from ſuch Miniſters as have bin themſelves ordained, <hi>to be eſſential to the Call</hi> of a Miniſter, be <hi>a Piece of fooliſh Bigotry,</hi> to which no ſound Proteſtant can ſafely and prudently ſubſcribe? Truely it ſeems to be ſo. And we are ſure, that BEZA, in the famous Conference at <hi>Poiſſy,</hi> clearly and fully renounced ſuch an <hi>enſnaring Opinion,</hi> and maintain'd, that <q>
                     <hi>unto a legitimate Call Impoſition of Hands was not neceſſary;</hi> but that the <hi>chief and ſubſtantial Tokens</hi> thereof <hi>were a good Life, ſound Doctrine and Election</hi> [from the People:] Nor was it to be wondred at, if the <hi>Reformed</hi> had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Impoſition of Hands from them, whoſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Life, Superſtition and falſe Doctrine they were to reprove? Or how could it be expected, they <hi>ſhould ever be allwed</hi> of by them, who were Enemies to the Truth which they defended?</q>
               </p>
               <p>And, in fine, I would enquire of the Patrons of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination by Officers, <hi>whether even good and meet Officers,</hi> belonging to other Churches, <hi>may claim the Power of ordaining Elders over Churches to which they are not related?</hi> Tho' there may be very <hi>deſirable Officers</hi> and
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:004275_0077_100432920B66A7C8"/>in every Reſpect well qualified near at Hand; never, theleſs it does not appear, that even theſe <hi>have Authority or may aſſume to themſelves the Power of ordaining Elders to other Churches, of which they are neither Members nor Officers;</hi> unleſs <hi>thoſe particular Churches,</hi> in which the Elders are to be ordained, <hi>requeſt their Preſence and Aſſiſtance:</hi> For <hi>ordinary Officers</hi> are not like the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, who might <hi>feed all the Flock</hi> of our SAVIOUR; but there is <hi>one particular Flock, of which,</hi> and of which alone, <hi>they are to take the Overſight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If indeed it were acknowleged that we read in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Places of <hi>Ordination performed by Elders,</hi> tho' the Proof of this is difficult; and that <hi>we never read in the New Teſtament about the Performance of it by any others:</hi> This however is nothing at all againſt what has bin offered: For, altho' we ſhould allow, that, in ſuch Churches as are furniſhed with <hi>Elders, Ordination ſhould be performed by thoſe</hi> Elders; we may nevertheleſs with Safety maintain, that, where there are not <hi>Elders as at the firſt, nor any that can be conveniently borrow'd</hi> from other Churches, <hi>Ordination by the Impoſition of Hands may</hi> then <hi>be validly and lawfully performed by others.</hi> And it is no more than what a famous Biſhop of <hi>Saliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> in his <hi>Expoſition on the thirty nine Articles,</hi> has freely declared: For He affirms, that, <hi>whatever ſome holter Spirits have ſince thought of it;</hi> yet not only thoſe who pen'd the Articles, <hi>but the Body of the Church for above half an Age afterward</hi> were of a Perſuaſion which implied, that <hi>they thought no ſpiritual Powers ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the Exerciſe of the Evangelical Miniſtry, except what the People could convey</hi> to ſuch of their Body as they might judge qualified for it.</p>
               <p>We may alſo be free and ready to grant, that <hi>Elders meeting in a Council or Synod,</hi> with Brethren, <hi>may at the Deſire of a particular Church, ordain its Officers:</hi> But then, as it has bin the Judgment of theſe Churches in Times paſt, there is yet no good Reaſon why theſe Churches ſhould change their Judgment, that <hi>the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:004275_0078_10043259C3CD28E8"/>ſo convened in Council or Synod with their Brethren for this Service, have no Power or Juriſdiction of their own, but act by vertue of the Power derived from the particular Churches which ſent for them:</hi> So that, in ſhort, <hi>particular Churches are the firſt Subjects of this Power</hi> of ordaining; as it is <hi>for particular Churches</hi> that <hi>Councils or Synods</hi> convene, when they meet in order to <hi>ordain Officers</hi> for them.</p>
               <p>The very learned FABRITIUS, the Principal Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of Divinity in the Reformed Church of the <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinate,</hi> whoſe Life is written and whoſe Works are publiſhed by the great HEIDEGGER at <hi>Zurich,</hi> 1698, publiſhed two Dialogues in 1685, in the latter of which he endeavours to demonſtrate that <hi>the Controverſy about Baptiſm by a private Man</hi> in Caſe of Neceſſity <hi>does not belong to the fundamental Articles of Faith, but to the Queſtion concerning Order,</hi> it being appointed by the Divine Law that <hi>all Things ſhould be done in order:</hi> Which principally conſiſts in this, that <hi>every one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Duty belonging to his Charge:</hi> And therefore if any Man, even a <hi>Laic,</hi> be <hi>appointed by the Church to</hi> adminiſter the Sacrament, if he does it, <hi>he does nothing but his Duty and neither offends againſt the Faith or againſt good Order.</hi> The learned FABRITIUS indeed does not lay this down as of himſelf; but he <hi>commends both the Ancients and Moderns who are of this Opinion.</hi> And by the ſame Rule he would have <hi>commended ſuch as aſſert the Right of the Brethren to appoint ſome of their Number to confer Orders</hi> on Officers call'd and choſen by themſelves; and ſo our generous and noble Parents would have bin <hi>applauded by him for their Opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Ordination.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As our Fathers tho't, that <hi>Ordination did not conſtitute an Officer nor give him the Eſſentials of his Office:</hi> For they judg'd, that <hi>the Eſſence of the outward Call of an ordinary Officer conſiſted, not in that, but in his free Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the Church and his Acceptance of that Choice:</hi> So they have declared their Opinion, in <hi>the Ninth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:004275_0079_1004325DE6139AB8"/>of their Platform,</hi> that, <hi>in Churches where there are no Elders, Impoſition of Hands</hi> on Officers elected <hi>may be performed by ſome of the Brethren orderly choſen by the Church</hi> for that Servive: And the Reaſon which they there aſſign for this is a good one: <hi>For,</hi> ſay they, <hi>if the People elect Officers which is the greater, and wherein the Subſtance of the Office doth conſiſt, they may much more, Occaſion and Need requiring, impoſe Hands in Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is leſs, and but the Accompliſhment of the other.</hi> But, notwithſtanding the Claim of this Right for our Churches, they go on afterwards and ſay, in the ſame Chapter, <hi>Nevertheleſs in Churches, where they have no Elders, and the Churches deſire it, we ſee not, why Impoſition of Hands may not be performed by the Elders of other Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor are our worthy Predeceſſors ſingular in theſe their Sentiments. The pious and learned PERKINS, writing concerning <hi>Ordination and Succeſſion,</hi> in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary on Gal. I. ii. ſays, that, <hi>if in</hi> Turkey or America, or elſewhere <hi>the Goſpel be received of Men, by the Counſel or Perſuaſion of private Perſons, they ſhould not need to ſend unto</hi> Europe <hi>for conſecrated Miniſters, but have Power to chuſe their own from within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:</hi> And his Reaſon is <hi>becauſe, where GOD gives the Word, He gives Power alſo.</hi> And PHILIP ME<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LANCTHON, the gracious and excellent, expreſſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf much after the ſame Manner in his <hi>Anſwer to the</hi> Bohemian <hi>Miniſters,</hi> who taught the incorrupt Doctrine of the Goſpel, and refutes <hi>the Pretent of Ordination to be taken from Biſhops</hi> from the firſt Chapter of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Galatians.</hi> And the Author of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable <hi>Scotch Diſpute againſt Engliſh Ceremonies,</hi> freely declares, in pag. 285th, that, as, <hi>when Princes are elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the Election gives them</hi> Jus ad Rem, <hi>as they ſpeak, without which the Inauguration can never give them</hi> Jus in Re; <hi>ſo it is as to a</hi> Miniſter: <hi>And</hi> Ordination <hi>only applied him to the actual exerciſing of his Paſtoral Office; which</hi> Ordination <hi>ſhould be given to him alone that is
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:004275_0080_10040657B5A012B8"/>elected, and that</hi> becauſe he is ſo. And the learned VOET, in his <hi>Deſperat. Cauſ. Papat.</hi> L. II. Sect. II. Cap. XX, has irrefragably proved againſt JANSENIUS, <hi>Electionem tribuere Miniſterium,</hi> that it is <hi>the Choice which makes the Miniſter,</hi> by ſix or ſeven Arguments. Now, from theſe declared Sentiments of ſuch eminent Perſons, it appears very plain to me, that the Tho'ts of our Predeceſſors may be clear'd from the Charge of Singularity, and with Eaſe be ſupported and juſtified.</p>
               <p>Nay I cannot but think, that even Arch-Biſhop BANCROFT has furniſhed us with a good Argument in Favour of the Opinion maintain'd by our Anceſtors: For, before the Conſecration of the three Scotch Biſhops at <hi>London,</hi> ANDREWS the Biſhop of <hi>Ely</hi> ſaid, <hi>They muſt firſt be ordained as having received no Ordination by a</hi> Biſhop: But BANCROFT maintain'd, that <hi>there was no Neceſſity for it, ſeeing, where Biſhops could not be had, the Ordination given by Preſbyters muſt be valid and eſteemed lawful: For otherwiſe it might be doubted, if there was any lawful Vocation in moſt of the Reformed Churches.</hi> Now, by the ſame Argument of BAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CROFT'S, (which is to be found in SPOTSWOOD'S Hiſt. l. 7. p. 514.) there will be no Difficulty in maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>the Validity and Lawfulneſs of Ordination by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:</hi> For, where Biſhops or Preſbyters cannot be had, Ordinations by them muſt be <hi>valid and eſteemed law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: Otherwiſe it may be doubted whether there be any lawful Vocation in many, if not moſt, of the Reformed Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore I cannot but ſay with the celebrated Mr. CLAUDE, that <hi>the fierce Opinion that goes ſo high as to own no Miniſtry in the World, but where there are</hi> Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Ordinations, <hi>and which would make all Religion depend on a diſputable Formality; that Opinion can't be look'd upon any otherwiſe than the very worſt Character and the groſſeſt Mark of Hypocriſy and worthy of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt from all the Chriſtians in the World.</hi> But what he has thus ſtrongly, but juſtly, expreſſed concerning
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:004275_0081_10043262F7711D80"/>the hot Opinion about the <hi>Neceſſity of Epiſcopal Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations;</hi> I would ſay and maintain the very ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Opinion about <hi>the Neceſſity of Ordination by</hi> as Preſbytery, as well as a Biſhop: And it will give me very little Uneaſineſs, however vex'd and angry or troubled any may be with me for being of this Mind and freely declaring it: For I am ſatisfied, that their Trouble or Anger muſt ariſe either from groundleſs Fancies or ſomething worſe: So that I cannot have any Reaſon to be diſturb'd or uneaſy at it.</p>
               <p>But, after all, ſome will challenge us to produce any <hi>Texts of Scripture that give Laymen a Right to ordain Miniſters in any Caſe.</hi> And, as this is the Challenge which the Author of <hi>The Prejudices,</hi> &amp;c. made to the famous Mr. CLAUDE, I ſhall recite his Reply to it, which to me appears a full and ſufficient one: It is to be found in his <hi>Defence of the Reformation,</hi> P. IV. p. 94 and 95.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>This Demand, ſays he, is but a vain Wrangling. For, when the Scripture recommends to the Faithful the taking diligent heed to the Preſervation and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of their Faith and to propagate it to their Children; it gives them by that very Thing a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Right to make Uſe of all proper Means to that End:</hi> And every Body knows the Miniſtry is one of thoſe Means: And therefore the Obligation the Faithful are under to preſerve and propagate the Faith includes <hi>that of creating to themſelves Paſtors</hi> when they cannot have them otherwiſe: In ſhort, when the Scripture teaches, that the Faithful have a Right to chuſe their Paſtors, it teaches thereby that they have a Right to inſtall them in their Office in Caſe of Neceſſity: For that <hi>Call conſiſting much more eſſentially in Election than in Inſtallation,</hi> which is but a Formality, there is no Reaſon to believe, that GOD would have given the People a Right to chuſe their Paſtors and to have them inſtalled by others, and that He has not given them at the ſame Time <hi>a
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:004275_0082_1004326498C961F8"/>Power of inſtalling them themſelves,</hi> when it cannot be done otherwiſe. <hi>Since naturally That, which we have a Right to do by another, we have a Right to do by ourſelves.</hi>
                  </q> Thus he.</p>
               <p>Nay, not only the celebrated CLAUDE, but the learned DODWEL, that mighty Oracle of the diſtracted, high-flying Clergy, <hi>acknowleges ſuch a Right in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Societies of chuſing and inveſting their Officers.</hi> 'Tis true this is not at all reconcileable with the other Parts of his [Romantic] Scheme: But this is nothing to us. It is in his <hi>Separation of Churches,</hi> [P. 102 and 52.] that he writes after this Manner; <q>The Church, with whom GOD has made the Covenant, is a <hi>Body Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic,</hi> tho' not a <hi>Civil</hi> one; and GOD has deſign'd all Perſons to enter into this Society.—It is ſufficient for my Purpoſe, that the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Power</hi> be no otherwiſe from GOD, than that is of every <hi>ſupreme Civil Magiſtrate.</hi> It is not uſual for <hi>Kings</hi> to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted into their Offices by <hi>other Kings, but by their Subjects:</hi> Yet, when they are <hi>inveſted,</hi> that doth not in the leaſt prejudice the Abſoluteneſs of their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, where the Fundamental Conſtitutions of the reſpective Places allow it to them.— And (in Pag. 522 and 523) he ſays, "Whenever a Perſon is inveſted with the ſupreme Power, and the Society over which he is placed is independent on other Societies, ſuch a Perſon can never be placed in his Power, if not <hi>by them who muſt after be his Subjects,</hi> unleſs by his <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſor,</hi> which no Society can depend upon for a conſtant Rule of Succeſſion.— I am apt to think, this muſt have bin the Way of making Biſhops at firſt, how abſolute ſoever I conceive them to be when they are once made.— This ſeems beſt to agree with the <hi>Abſoluteneſs of particular Churches,</hi> before they had <hi>by Compact</hi> united themſelves under Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politans and Exarchs into Provincial and Dioceſan Churches. And this ſeems to have bin fitted for the frequent Perſecutions of thoſe earlier Ages, <hi>when
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:004275_0083_100432666ECCFCD0"/>every Church was able to ſecure its own Succeſſion;</hi> without depending on the uncertain Opportunities of the meeting of the Biſhops of the whole Province: And the Alterations of this Practice, the giving of the Biſhops of the Province an Intereſt in the Choice of every particular colleague, <hi>ſeems not to have bin ſo much for want of Power in the particular Churches to do it, as for the Security of Compacts,</hi> that they might be certain of ſuch a Colleague as would obſerve them.— It is probable, that it was in Imitation of the Philoſophers Succeſſions, that theſe Eccleſiaſtical Succeſſions were framed: And, when the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers fail'd to nominate their own Succeſſors, <hi>the Election was in the Schools.</hi>
                  </q> Now, granting theſe Things, we have all that we deſire: For, <hi>if every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church has originally a Power within itſelf to chuſe and inveſt its Biſhop, and the Concurrence of other Biſhops herein be not for want of Power in particular Churches, but only for the ſecuring an</hi> [uncertain] <hi>Agreement of</hi> [arbitrary and troubleſome] <hi>Biſhops among themſelves;</hi> then certainly <hi>all particular Churches,</hi> according to the common Principles of all Societies, have a latent Power of electing and inveſting their Officers; altho' by the Laws of the Community, or thro' Cuſtom they may <hi>conſign the Exerciſe of this Power to a particular Order</hi> of Men amongſt them.— And with this we are ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
               <p>But I have not yet exhauſted my Stock: I have other Teſtimonies to produce in confirmation of the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of thoſe who founded theſe Churches.</p>
               <p>A very valuable and ingenious Scotchman, whoſe Name is ALEXANDER LAUDER in his <hi>Ancient Biſhops conſidered</hi> has theſe Paſſages; <q>The People had an <hi>inherent Right to ſeparate from the Biſhops</hi> at the Reformation; becauſe the <hi>Communion of the Biſhops was then Idolatrous,</hi> and ſo pulluted that it could not be continued in without manifeſt Hazard.— then they had alſo an <hi>inherent Right to ſet up another
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:004275_0084_1004328E24CC3250"/>Communion,</hi> diſtinct from the polluted and hazardous Communion of theſe Biſhops, or <hi>ſet up new Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies:</hi> For their Souls would have bin in Hazard, if they had <hi>lived ſeparately</hi> and had not ſet up new Communions or Aſſemblies, thro' want of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and other Means of Grace or Acceſs to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God in a public Way.— There is no Right more authentic than that which is founded on <hi>indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable Neceſſity:</hi> In that Caſe GOD has not only given People a <hi>Right</hi> to do the Thing, but has <hi>laid an Obligation</hi> upon them to do it.— The people had alſo <hi>an inherent Right to ſet up new Biſhops and Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters</hi> to themſelves;— ſuppoſing that not one or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained Perſon had joined with them in their Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that all the Biſhops and Preſbyters without Exception had adher'd unto the Pope and the Roman Church.— What Probability is there, that CHRIST would refuſe to give His People a Right or Power to do what was needful for them; contrary to His expreſs Promiſe, that He <hi>will give Grace and Glory and withold no good Thing from them that walk up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly?</hi> — Biſhops and Preſbyters after their Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were neceſſary for them: They could not enjoy the Ordinances of the Goſpel without them.— It muſt be ſaid, either that <hi>CHRIST gave them a Right to create Biſhops and Preſbyters to themſelves or obliged to have Recourſe to the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>for them.</hi>— To ſuppoſe that is ridiculous and monſtrous; yea it is a <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> and a Reflection upon the Wiſdom of GOD Almighty: For, according to this Suppoſition, He laid it on them as a <hi>Duty to ſeparate</hi> from the idela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous <hi>Popiſh</hi> Communion and <hi>crect diſtinct Churches</hi> to no Purpoſe at all, and to bring them into as great or greater Difficulties than they would have bin, in if they had continued in the Idolatrous Popiſh Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</q> — And the ſame worthy Writer, quoting an Order of a Council at <hi>Rome,</hi> that <hi>the Biſhop to be conſecrated be choſen by all the Church,</hi> and an Order of
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:004275_0085_1004326B85D34988"/>another Council at <hi>Clermont</hi> to the ſame Purpoſe, makes this agreable Reflection in the Margin; <q>Hence it is evident, that <hi>Perſons are conſtituted or made Biſhops by the Election of the People, and not by Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> which is performed by Biſhops: One is made or conſtituted a Biſhop by that, by which he is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to the high dignity of the Miniſtry: But, according to theſe councils, the <hi>Suffrage of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> is the Thing, and not an <hi>Ordination,</hi> that advances one to the high dignity of the Miniſtry: This is alſo evident from Canon XXII. of the Council of <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> For in it <hi>the Election and Promation of a Biſhop are one Thing.</hi>
                  </q> Thus he.</p>
               <p>And the worthy Mr. SIMON BROWNE, in an <hi>ordination-Sermon</hi> preached not long ſince by him, found himſelf obliged to give ſuch Sentiments as theſe; <q>Neither <hi>Ordination by Biſhops nor by other Miniſters is abſolutely neceſſary to the Being of the Miniſtry.</hi> A Perſon may be a Miniſter without Ordination by other Miniſter. This Power is <hi>not given,</hi> but <hi>acknowledged</hi> and declared in Ordination. And yet in many Caſes a Man may be obliged to the Work when he cannot be ordained: And, where the Obligation is notorious and Plain, there is a ſufficient and valid Doclaration of his Miniſterial Power or of the Will of CHRIST that he ſhould act in his Office. If a Company of Chriſtians were Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wreck'd on a remote and unkown Shore, to which they were uncapable of fetching ordained Miniſters from any other Place, I think a Man muſt be <hi>out of his Wits</hi> to aſſert, that this Body of Men muſt <hi>live like Heathens,</hi> and not openly own CHRIST by performing all common Chiſtian Exerciſes in public Aſſemblies <hi>for want of an ordained Miniſter.</hi> Without Doubt he, who was the <hi>moſt capable</hi> among them to teach the reſt and perform the other Duties of a Miniſter, <hi>was bound in Conſsience to undertake that Work;</hi> and, <hi>if obliged to do the Work</hi> of a Miniſter, he had certainly
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:004275_0086_1004326FF4CD1AE8"/>Authority from CHRIST to be a Miniſter, unleſs we make CHRIST'S Commands contradictory, and ſay, A Man was <hi>obliged in Duty to do that, which when done would be unlawful</hi> and a Sin for want of ſufficient Authority. The like may be ſaid, <hi>if Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter or Biſhops refuſe Ordination to qualified Men,</hi> unleſs they will ſubmit unto unlawful Terms, and no other Miniſters can be procured to do the Work; which was the Caſe of ſeveral of the firſt Reformers: In theſe and all ſuch like Caſes Ceremonies muſt be waved, whilſt a due Regard is had unto what is chief and principal.</q>

               <p>Nor may I leave the Judgment of the uncommonly learned VOET untranſcribed, as he has left it, in his <hi>Deſperat. Cauſ. Papatus.</hi> L. II. Sect. II. Cap. XXI. in Anſwer to JANSENIUS, where he ſays as follows, <q>The Succeſſion and Calling of Paſtors can and ought to be repaired by <hi>the Church,</hi> that is to ſay, by the <hi>Society of Company of the Faithful,</hi> tho' they be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether <hi>deſtitute of Biſhops and Preſbyters:</hi> For every Church has eſſentially and properly the Power of Calling, tho' it may <hi>put over ſome Acts of that Calling</hi> to ſome other Perſons: For, as the <hi>Pope</hi> is created and conſecrated by thoſe who are <hi>not Popes,</hi> and as the <hi>High Prieſt</hi> in the Old Teſtament was conſecrated by his Inferior; ſo a <hi>Biſhop</hi> may be proclaimed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted and endowed with Miniſterial Power by 2 <hi>Preſbyter,</hi> and a <hi>Preſbyter</hi> by <hi>any Member of the Church,</hi> that is peculiarly delegated to that Service by the Suffrages of his Brethren. And indeed what ſhould hinder that the formal Solemnity of <hi>Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craction</hi> may not in ſuch a neceſſitous Caſe be laid aſide, and that he who is lawfully choſen may not without it perform the Buſineſs of his Miniſtry? Truely there is nothing at all, that from the Divine Right of ſuch Formalities can ſhew them to be a <hi>neceſſary Mean.</hi>
                  </q> And in the ſame Chapter He has many other Paſſages to the ſame Purpoſe. Wherefore
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:004275_0087_100432727169EED0"/>I cannot but fall into the ſame declaration with him, in the <hi>fifth</hi> Part of his <hi>Select Diſputations, De Eccleſ.</hi> P. 384. <hi>Our</hi> Belgian <hi>Churches, as alſo the</hi> French <hi>Churches and</hi> others <hi>are true Churches and indeed pure, yea and integral; tho' they want Biſhops as at this Day called: And their Miniſters are true Miniſters, truely and lawfully called; tho' they neither have that pretended Epiſcopal Ordination, nor would have it or care at all for it.</hi> Theſe Citations, as well as the foregoing ones, are of great Weight and Importance, not only on the Account of the Character and Quality of the Writers, which with many may go pretty far; but alſo becauſe, let their Character and Quality be what it will, their Arguments are well ſupported and cofirmed.</p>
               <p>And well may <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſpeak and write, as I have rehearſed, when even Father PAUL, in his Treatiſe <hi>of Beneficiary Matters,</hi> ſays expreſly, <q>Pope LEO ſhews amply, that <hi>the Ordination of a Biſhop could</hi> not be lawful or valid, which was not required by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and approved by them; <hi>which is ſaid by all the Saints of thoſe Times:</hi> And St. GREGORY thought CONSTANCE could not be sonſecrated Biſhop of <hi>Milan,</hi> being elected by the Clergy, wihtout the Conſent of the Citizens, who by Reaſon of Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion retired to <hi>Genoa;</hi> and He prevail'd that they ſhould be firſt ſent unto to know their Will. <hi>A Thing worthy to be noted,</hi> continues He, <hi>in our Days, when that</hi> Election is declared to be illegitimte and null, in which the People have any Share.</q> Thus that <hi>rara Avis</hi> in the Romiſh Communion.</p>
               <p>Thus I have ſhewn the Opinion of our diſcerning Predeceſſors concerning <hi>Ordination,</hi> and recited various Aruguments and Authorities by which their Opninon may be deſended and juſtified: And I am ſure, that however amiſs any way think of their Opinion on any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </head>
               <p>AS <hi>Churches</hi> cannot with Convenience repair to diſtant Places upon recurring Occaſions; it is for this Reaſon requiſite and neceſſary, that on ſuch Occaſions they ſhould uſe the <hi>vicarious Help of others.</hi> And, as every particular Church, that hath <hi>Elders</hi> and other Members adorned with mental and gracious Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications fitting them for public Service, hath an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted <hi>Right to improve</hi> and make Uſe of them in the beſt Manner and on the beſt Occaſions; ſo, if <hi>the Honour of our bleſſed Lord and the Welfare of any of the Churches</hi> require it, they have then <hi>the Liberty of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing and ſending forth</hi> their Elders and other Dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates.</p>
               <p>Thus it was unqueſtionably in ancient Times: For the Brethren of the Church at <hi>Antioch</hi> determined that PAUL. and BARNABAS and <hi>certain others ſhould go up to</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>to conſult the Apoſtles, Elders and Brethren</hi> there. And the <hi>Philippians</hi> ſent forth the worthy EPAPHRODITUS to the Apoſtle PAUL with a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; for this is the meaning of their <hi>Fellowſhip in the Goſpel,</hi> for which the Apoſtle <hi>thanks GOD,</hi> in Phil. I. 5 and 6 Verſes. It means their contributing or <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating to his Support</hi> while he was <hi>in Bonds to make
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:004275_0091_1004328B1B4A4460"/>Apology for the Goſpel</hi> before that roaring Lion NERO: And it appears from Chap. II. Verſ. 25th of that Epiſtle, that EPAPHRODITUS was <hi>their Meſſenger;</hi> who alſo in Return was to act in our Apoſtle's Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half and diſcharge his Office to the <hi>Philippians:</hi> For this is the Senſe of the Verſe, <hi>your Apoſtle</hi> or Meſſenger <hi>and the Performer of my Office towards you <note n="(b)" place="bottom">Veſtrum autem Apoſtolum &amp; mei muneris vicarium. Caſlellio.</note>,</hi> as a very ingenious Man has juſtly expreſſed it. And we read of one, whoſe <hi>Praiſe was in the Goſpel throughout all the Churches,</hi> that was <hi>choſen by the Churches to travel</hi> with our Apoſtle on a charitable Occaſion, in 2 Cor. VIII. 18 and 19.</p>
               <p>And, that the Churches continued afterwards to claim this Right, it will abundantly appear from CLEMENT'S firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians:</hi> For this Epiſtle, which weareth his honourable Name, was ſent by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> unto the <hi>Corinthians</hi> by CLAUDIUS, EPHE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BUS, VALERIUS, BIBO, FORTUNATUS, who were <hi>their Apoſtles</hi> 
                  <note n="(i)" place="bottom">vid. <hi>Clement.</hi> Epiſt. ad Corinth.</note> or Meſſengers to the Church at <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth:</hi> And theſe Perſons, you muſt know, were <hi>not Officers</hi> in the Church at that Time, nor appear to be mention'd at all under that Character; but they were <hi>prudent and ſit Members</hi> of that Chriſtian Community to be ſent with this Epiſtle and act in Behalf of the Church of ROME: It follows therefore, that, as <hi>this Letter</hi> was ſent by the Church and <hi>theſe Meſſengers</hi> were appointed and diſpatch'd <hi>in the Name of the Church</hi> with it, the Church muſt be heartily conſenting unto the <hi>ſending of the Letter and the Meſſengers;</hi> and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>the Church muſt meet together;</hi> for, without <hi>this,</hi> how could they <hi>conſent to the ſending Letter or Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the Church of the Corinthians?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Particular Churches</hi> then are poſſeſs'd of this Right and Privilege of appointing and ſending forth Elders and other Delegates on ſuitable Occaſions: And by the
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:004275_0092_10040652D8419C28"/>ſame Reaſon they may <hi>call them to an Account at their Return:</hi> And, if upon Enquiry it ſhall be found, that they have done any Thing prejudicial to the Truth and Peace of the Goſpel, they may juſtly <hi>expoſtulate</hi> with them and aſk the Reaſons of their Conduct and refuſe to regard what they have bin doing.</p>
               <p>Nor indeed can any Thing be more fit and ſuitable than this, that the Meſſengers of particular Churches, who have <hi>done amiſs,</hi> or <hi>ly under the Suſpicion</hi> of irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Conduct and a faulty Management of their Affairs, ſhould be queſtioned by the Churches, whoſe Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers they are, and in whoſe Service they are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd.</p>
               <p>And as this is <hi>fit and ſuitable in itſelf,</hi> that the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in particular Churches ſhould call their Delegates to an Account for their Management in their Service; there is alſo an <hi>Inſtance</hi> to be given from <hi>the Scripture,</hi> which will ſufficiently juſtify the Brethren in the Uſe of this Liberty: It is in Act. XI. 2 and 3 Verſes, where we read, that, <hi>when PETER was come up to</hi> Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, <hi>they that were of the Circumciſion</hi> contended with <hi>him,</hi> or rather <hi>call'd him to an Account</hi> in order to paſs their Judgment; <hi>ſaying, Thou wenteſt in to Men uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed and didſt eat with them:</hi> And it follows in the next Verſe, that <hi>PETER rehearſed from the Beginning, and expounded</hi> by Order <hi>unto them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, if the Brethren might demand of an Apoſtle the Reaſons of his Behaviour, and if the Apoſtle tho't himſelf accountable to them and therefore oblig'd to apologize for his Conduct before them; the Concluſion is ſtrong and irreſiſtable, that now <hi>the Brethren have the Liberty much more</hi> to enquire concerning the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their Elders and other Delegates whom they improve, and to require Satisfaction of them concerning any Breaches of Rule into which they may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd; and <hi>Elders and other Meſſengers are now much more obliged</hi> to render them an Account and ſatisfy them, when they properly and honeſtly demand that
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:004275_0093_1004327BE8B5D448"/>they ſhould do ſo: And the Reaſon is plain: For no Perſons have any Right to conſult, vote or act in behalf of any particular Church but <hi>by vertue of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legation</hi> from that Church: It is <hi>this</hi> alone that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powers them: And, if without ſuch empowering, any ſhall pretend to act as their Delegates, they muſt be deemed <hi>buſy Bodies in other Men's Matters:</hi> And, ſince theſe Things are ſo, ſurely particular Churches may appoint whom they pleaſe to any Truſt or Service, and <hi>may challenge an Account of their Stewardſhip and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagements for them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſuppoſing, as it is a ſuppoſeable Caſe, that any <hi>Delegates from particular Churches</hi> upon emergent Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions <hi>ſhould ſubſtitute others in their Room,</hi> and ſo ſhould not be able to give any Account of their Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions? I anſwer, That, altho' <hi>the Caſe may be ſuppoſed,</hi> yet <hi>the Thing ought not to be:</hi> For <hi>none</hi> in ſuch Caſes <hi>have the Power of ſubſtituting</hi> others in their Room and Stead; any more than an <hi>Embaſſador</hi> from one Prince or Commonwealth to another Prince or Commonwealth hath the Power of ſubſtituting whom he pleaſes to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Embaſſy for him <note n="(j)" place="bottom">

               <p>Animated by ſuch Conſiderations as theſe, ſome of the <hi>ancient Fathers</hi> were not at all <hi>backward,</hi> but very <hi>forward and ready to ſubmit to the Brethren:</hi> Nay ſome

So that, upon theſe Accounts, I may very conſiſtently blend the <hi>ſixth and ſeventh</hi> Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphs recited from the <hi>Platform</hi> together.</p>
               <p>That the Power of the Church extends to the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of their Elders,</hi>—This ſeems to be a pretty ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt Caſe: For, <hi>if the Church have Power to chuſe their Officers and Miniſters; then, in Caſe of manifeſt Unworthineſs and Delinquency, they have Power alſo to depoſe them: For to open and ſhut, to chuſe and refuſe, to conſtitute in Office and remove from Office are Acts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing

               <p>And it is entirely <hi>juſt and reaſonable,</hi> that <hi>particular Churches ſhould have this Power:</hi> For they are <hi>Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Societies confederate,</hi> that is to ſay, they are <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, before they have Officers and even without</hi> them: And, altho' they may be in ſuch a State as this, yet even then <hi>a ſubordinate Eccleſiaſtical Power</hi> is under our Lord JESUS CHRIST, and by HIM delegated unto them: So that, having <hi>the Nature and Eſſence of a Church</hi> as they ſurely have, <hi>they may act as ſuch:</hi> And, as it is <hi>natural to all Societies and Bodies</hi> whatſoever to preſerve themſelves, <hi>the Churches of CHRIST</hi> alſo are doubtleſs <hi>furniſhed with ſufficient Power for their own Preſervation and comfortable Subſiſtence <note n="(t)" place="bottom">Ejuſd.

               <p>Nor indeed can it well be diſputed, that the Churches in the Days of primitive Chriſtianity were poſſeſſed of this moſt valuable Right and Privilege; when there are ſuch Teſtimonies in the ancient approved Writers, which fully demonſtrate it.</p>
               <p>It is as clear as the Light from that deſervedly priz'd Remain of Antiquity, CLEMRNT'S firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> which is worthy of frequent Citations from it, that <hi>the Church of</hi> Corinth <hi>at that Time had and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed this Privilege:</hi> For, he ſays to them in that
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:004275_0099_100432DACF39DF78"/>Epiſtle, <hi>We perceive that ye have removed ſome, who have performed their Office well, from the Miniſtry which they were thought to deſerve, as having no Fault to be found with them: Ye are too contentious, Brethren, and too hot about theſe Things which appertain not to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note n="(u)" place="bottom">vid. <hi>Clement.</hi> Epiſt. I. ad Corinth.</note>:</hi> Now is it not very plain from theſe Paſſages, that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> had depoſed and laid aſide their Miniſters, <hi>merely becauſe in leſſer or diſputable Points their Judgments did not pleaſe them?</hi> 'Tis true the good CLEMENT blames them, and it muſt be confeſſed that they deſerved to be blamed, for caſting off thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, <hi>who had holily and unblameably perform'd the Duties of their Epiſcopacy:</hi> But CLEMENT never twits or blames them at all for exerciſing a Power which did not belong unto them: No, far from it: All that he faults them for, and indeed all that can be objected againſt them, is, that <hi>they exerciſed the Power,</hi> of which they were poſſeſſed, <hi>in an irregular Manner, when the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion did not require it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it is alſo certain, that the particular Churches of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, enjoy'd this Privilege, at leaſt until the <hi>two hundred and fifty eighth Year</hi> after CHRIST: For, in that Year, a Synod convened, in which CYPRIAN preſided: And that Synod approv'd and commended the Proceedings of ſome Churches who had depoſed their Biſhops, upon the Application of thoſe Churches to the Synod in order to obtain their Opinion concerning their Conduct.</p>
               <p>As for CYPRIAN'S own Judgment in this Matter it may eaſily be ſeen by reading ſome of his Epiſtles: For, in one of his Epiſtles, he expreſly acknowleges that in his Time <hi>the People had the Power, as of chuſing worthy Miniſters, ſo</hi> likewiſe <hi>of refuſing and caſting off thoſe who were not ſo <note n="(v)" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Cyptian.</hi> Epiſt. 4.</note>;</hi> and in another Epiſtle, he
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:004275_0100_100432DC548DEAC8"/>affirms, <hi>that this Power belongs to the Church, and that it was given to the Church by Divine Authority <note n="(w)" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Cyprian.</hi> Epiſt. 68.</note>.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the learned ORIGEN was of the ſame Mind: For he freely declar'd to his People, <hi>If I ſeem to you to be a</hi> right Hand, <hi>and am call'd a Preſbyter and ſeem to preach the Word of GOD; yet, if I ſhall do any Thing contrary to Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline and the Rule of the Goſpel, ſo that I give Scandal or Offence to the Church, let the whole Church conſpire and with one Conſent cut me off, altho' I am their Right Hand <note n="(x)" place="bottom">

               </p>
               <p>But, if for the ſake of Peace it ſhould be granted, that <hi>this Power is too great for the Brethren,</hi> and that they have not ſufficient Authority for it; may we not then ſay, that <hi>they may withdraw from their Male-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtring Elders,</hi> and that there cannot be any reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Objection againſt ſuch a Withdraw from them? Truely we may well ſay this, and it may very well be granted us; For, as every particular Church <hi>ſets up their Preſbytery by profeſſing their Subjection</hi> to them in the LORD; even ſo, when they <hi>walk diſorderly in their Office and are chargeable with Male-Adminiſtration</hi> in it, then they may <hi>avoid them and profeſſedly withdraw their Subjection to them:</hi> So that, if according to the Opinion of ſome, the Brethren ſhould <hi>not have the Power of depoſing their Elders;</hi> yet, if they have <hi>the Power and Liberty of withdrawing from them</hi> on requiſite Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which cannot be denied them, they have what is tantamount to the <hi>Depoſing Power, at leaſt with reſpect to themſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, that <hi>the Churches have this Pewer and Liberty,</hi> we may ſafely argue from our Apoſtle's Inſtruction to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in Rom. XVI. 17. where he <hi>beſeeches</hi> them to <hi>mark ſuch as cauſe Diviſions, —and avoid them,</hi> or withdraw from them: For, our Apoſtle, foreſeeing by the Holy SPIRIT enlightning him, the
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:004275_0101_100547DAF82A24B0"/>vaſt Occaſion of giving this Counſel to the Church at <hi>Rome,</hi> therefore affectionately and faithfully gave it, and entreated that Church to make Uſe of this Liberty, as there ſhould be Occaſion for ſo doing: And it is a juſt Obſervation of ALARDUS upon the Text, that the Word which we render here <hi>mark</hi> is a Military Term deriv'd from the <hi>Speculatores</hi> or Centinels upon a Watch-Tower, who are conſtantly to mind and obſerve and tell the Motions of an Enemy: So that the <hi>Romans</hi> are entreated, after their Example, to <hi>take ſpecial No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of their Elders in their Adminiſtrations,</hi> and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>withdraw from ſuch of them as cauſe Diviſions and Offences.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>this Right and Liberty of the Brethren,</hi> for which we plead, is ſo fully repreſented by CYPRIAN, and ſo ſtrongly <hi>proved</hi> to belong to them from Paſſages which he urges <hi>out of the old and new Teſtament</hi> that I ſhall refer you unto him <note n="(y)" place="bottom">vid. <hi>Cyprian.</hi> Epiſt. 68.</note>: In the mean Time I cannot but tranſcribe a few Sentences from him; <hi>For this Cauſe,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the People chedient to the Commands of the LORD and fearing GOD ought to ſeparate themſelves from a wicked Biſhop: For they principally have the Power of chuſing worthy Prieſts</hi> and <hi>rejecting the unworthy, which comes from Divine Authority <note n="(z)" place="bottom">Piopte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>IN our Opinion <hi>the compoſing Churches of Habitual Sinners,</hi> and that either with reſpect to Sins of Omiſſion or Commiſſion, inſtead of <hi>erecting Temples to the Honour of GOD and the Redeemer,</hi> would be only the ſetting up <hi>Synagogues of Satan and Chappels to the Devil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Churches indeed are far from denying the Communion unto any Perſon whatſoever, <hi>whoſe Duty it may be to aſk the Favour of</hi> enjoying it: Nor do we oppoſe the Right and Intereſt of any <hi>baptized Perſon</hi> in our Churches; but, conformably to the univerſal Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:004275_0103_1005474E70AB1758"/>of the primitive Churches after the Deceaſe of the Apoſtles, we adviſe them to ſuch Methods as will qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify them for a <hi>Reception to the Glory of CHRIST,</hi> and to <hi>partake of Divine Ordinances to their own ſpiritual Edification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Things, which we judge requiſite, abſolutely requiſite, in all thoſe that would enjoy the Communion in theſe Churches, are <hi>Repentance towards GOD, and Faith towards our LORD JESUS CHRIST, and a fixed Reſolution to lead a Life of Piety and Vertue:</hi> And we think, that ſuch as are <hi>ſincere</hi> in theſe Things, altho' they ſhould be but weak Chriſtians, <hi>but Babes in CHRIST <note n="(&amp;)" place="bottom">
                        <hi>I have heard or read ſomewhere, that my great Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, the holy and learned Mr. COTTON, once ſaid to his Congiegation, that,</hi> if any Perſon, tho' a poor Indian ſhould ſtep forth and ſay, <hi>I love the LORD JESUS CHRIST in Sincerity and Truth,</hi> and ſhould teſtify his Willingneſs to walk according to the Goſpel, tho' his Defects were great for Ignorance and the Like, He ſhould be for admitting him to the LORD'S Table.</note>,</hi> may not nevertheleſs be excluded nor yet diſcouraged from attending the Communion with us in our Churches.</p>
               <p>But however we expect, and we may well expect, that all, who are ſincere in theſe Things and are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of Communion in theſe Churches, ſhould <hi>make Profeſſion</hi> of their Faith and Repentance and Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for a good Life: And we proteſt, that we cannot admit any into full Communion and an actual Partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation in all the Privileges of our Churches, <hi>without ſuch a Profeſſion,</hi> and unleſs this <hi>Profeſſion be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by a moral and Chriſtian Conduct:</hi> For, without <hi>ſuch a Profeſſion, and ſuch a correſponding Conduct,</hi> there is no Perſon, that manifeſts himſelf meet and qualified for obtaining an Intereſt in the Privileges of any pure Society of Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>Theſe Churches therefore may lawfully require the <hi>making ſuch a Profeſſion</hi> and that it ſhould be <hi>adorned in the Conduct</hi> of thoſe that expect Communion with
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:004275_0104_1005473FEA010958"/>them: Nay they ought peremptorily to inſiſt upon theſe Things: For <hi>particular Churches</hi> will never <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve</hi> or <hi>recover their brighteſt Glory,</hi> unleſs they are careful as to theſe Matters.</p>
               <p>And, as <hi>particular Churches</hi> may and ſhould demand <hi>the witneſſing of a good Confeſſion</hi> from thoſe that offer themſelves to their Communion; ſo it is reaſonable and proper, that the <hi>Candidates</hi> for Communion ſhould <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the Demand:</hi> For, as is well obſerved in one of the <hi>Homilies</hi> of the Church of <hi>England</hi> for <hi>Whitſunday, If any Man be a dumb Chriſtian, not profeſſing his Faith openly, but cloaking and colouring himſelf for Fear of Danger, he giveth Men Occaſion juſtly and with good Conſcience to doubt, leſt he have not the Grace of the HOLY GHOST within him, becauſe he is Tongue-tied and doth not ſpeak.</hi>

Some, we are ſenſible, in the preſent Times of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy and Corruption are bitter Enemies to the Churches having and execiſing this Privilege, and plead that the <hi>Elders</hi> of the Churches only are poſſeſs'd of this Right and they only ſhould improve it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But,</hi> when <hi>the Brethren</hi> of the Churches are not duely apprized <hi>of the Fitneſs</hi> of thoſe who offer themſelves as Candidates for Communion with them, <hi>by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſſion</hi> which they make, and by <hi>ordering their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations</hi> according to it; but, on the contrary, <hi>have Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be diſſatisfied</hi> about their Fitneſs, as they will frequently have Reaſon to be, where the Elders only have the Management of ſuch Affairs, <hi>their Liberty in ſuch Churches</hi> is manifeſtly invaded and infringed.</p>
               <p>The Brethren in our Churches may poſſibly be wrought upon ſo far as to <hi>part with this Privilege to unreaſonable Claimers</hi> of it: But, beſides the <hi>Diſhonour</hi> reſulting from ſuch a tame Reſignation of a valuable Right, <hi>our Brethren ought to conſider the bad Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,</hi> the vaſt Miſchief, <hi>of parting with it:</hi> There cannot indeed be a <hi>greater Inlet to Corruption</hi> than this; for <hi>Churches</hi> muſt unavoidably be <hi>corrupted and the Ordinances miſerably defiled</hi> in them, while the unworthy are freely received into them and <hi>the Brethren have not the Power,</hi> as they have the Right, <hi>of refuſing ſuch Perſons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Reaſon of the Thing</hi> therefore is ſufficient for the Juſtification of theſe Churches <hi>in the Uſe of their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to judge concerning the Qualifications of thoſe that offer themſelves to their Communion:</hi> But we have <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Authority and Example</hi> beſides, in favour of the <hi>Brethren's Power and Liberty to propound any juſt and reaſonable Exceptions</hi> againſt ſuch Perſons as appear diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualified for Admiſſion into their Communion and the Privileges conſequent upon ſuch an Admiſſion: For the Apoſtle PETER himſelf would not admit the Family of CORNELIUS to <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> until he had enquired of the Brethren, whether any of them had any Thing to
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:004275_0106_1005479354BC9800"/>object againſt the Admiſſion of them, as in Act. X. 47. And we read concerning SAUL, that, offering himſelf to the Communion of the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he was <hi>not immediately admitted</hi> into it, but kept off from it, until <hi>the Exception</hi> which was taken againſt him by the Diſciples was <hi>removed,</hi> as in Act.

               <p>And the moſt <hi>primitive Antiquity,</hi> next to the Days of the Apoſtles, has taught theſe Churches to be <hi>careful about their Admiſſions</hi> into Communion: 'Tis true in the extraordinary Converſions to Chriſtianity which were made among the <hi>Jews,</hi> they were all <hi>immediately added to the Church:</hi> And it is not much to be wondred at that they were ſo, becauſe they were <hi>before</hi> acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Law and the Prophets, and were already <hi>brought into the Covenant</hi> of GOD: But <hi>afterwards</hi> the Churches did not make it their ordinary Practice <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to admit Perſons into full Communion;</hi> but kept them as <hi>Catechumens,</hi> that ſo their Knowlege might be encreaſed and the Truth of their Profeſſion might be tried, until they were judged <hi>qualified</hi> for joining to the Church and enjoying complete Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in it.</p>
               <p>And this is a Thing that appears, not only from JUSTIN MARTYR, who aſſerts, that <hi>none were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd to communicate in the Church</hi> in his Time <hi>but ſuch as were baptized and believed the Doctrines of Chriſtianity and lived according to the Laws of JESUS CHRIST;</hi> but it is alſo manifeſt from numberleſs ancient Writers, that <hi>the Baptized</hi> were of old <hi>confirmed</hi> before they were admitted into Communion, and that in <hi>ſome</hi> of the primitive Churches <hi>none</hi> could be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into full Communion or be <hi>perfect</hi> among them, until he had given ſome Evidence of a Principle of Goodneſs within him.</p>
               <p>Nor is it a Matter of much Diſſiculty to prove, that in the <hi>Prinitive Times</hi> none were received to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Chriſtianity, unleſs they had firſt given ſome
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:004275_0107_10054795707E94D0"/>Evidences of their Sincerity; either by <hi>enduring ſome initiatory Penances,</hi> as <hi>three Days Faſting,</hi> which was preſcribed in the Time of the Author of the falſe <hi>Clementine Recognitions <note n="(o)" place="bottom">Pſcudo <hi>Clement.</hi> Recog.

               </p>
               <p>It muſt be confeſſed indeed, that, as it was uſual among the Primitive Chriſtians to imitate the Heathens <hi>too far</hi> in ſeveral Reſpects referring to their ſacred Rites, <hi>they</hi> particularly diſtributed their Converts into <hi>two Claſſes</hi> according to the <hi>Pagan</hi> Style: For, as among the <hi>Pagans</hi> there were <hi>Learners and Illuminated Perſons;</hi> thus we find in the Fathers theſe <hi>two</hi> very frequently mentioned: And in them, as the <hi>Perſons</hi> are diſtinguiſhed, ſo are their <hi>Duties and Privileges:</hi> And it muſt be acknowleged, that the Apoſtle PAUL fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently <hi>alludes to theſe Diſtinctions,</hi> and that the ancient Divines afterwards made an ill Uſe of thoſe Allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
               <p>But, altho' the Improvements which were made of ſuch Diſtinctions proved in Proceſs of Time not only <hi>ſuperfluous,</hi> but alſo very prejudicial to Chriſtianity; nevertheleſs, that Things may be done <hi>agreable to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Prudence,</hi> and that all Things may be perform'd <hi>decently and in Order</hi> according to Apoſtolical Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Churches ſhould be careful not at once to admit the <hi>Learners</hi> among the <hi>Illuminated:</hi> For there is <hi>no Divine Warrant nor any Reaſon,</hi> why ſuch as are not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of <hi>witneſſing a good Confeſſion</hi> and have not mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted their <hi>Faith</hi> and the Truth of their Profeſſion <hi>by their Works</hi> ſhould be favour'd with equal Privileges to thoſe who are capable of theſe Things.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, upon the whole, let the <hi>Elders</hi> of the Churches be as <hi>careful</hi> as they pleaſe <hi>in their Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of ſuch as preſent themſelves for Candidates of Communion, and let them endeavour to be fully <hi>certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of their Fitneſs</hi> for complete Fellowſhip; but, at the ſame Time, <hi>let not theſe Churches be negligent of their Duty, but except againſt all,</hi> whom they think to be diſqualified for Communion with them, either <hi>by Reaſon

               <p>THE Churches of JESUS CHRIST in this Land are of Opinion, that, not only the <hi>Miniſters</hi> or Elders or Biſhops of the Churches, but <hi>all the Chriſtians</hi> alſo which compoſe them, <hi>have the Care of their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren;</hi> and that every Chriſtian, by the Authority of JESUS CHRIST, may <hi>confirm and eſtabliſh his Brethren in Knowlege and Faith, and exhort them to proceed in the Ways of Religion and Goodneſs;</hi> and that, if any of his Brethren ſhould ſubſide either into <hi>fatal Doctrinal Errors or irregular Behaviours,</hi> every Chriſtian ſhould uſe his Endeavour to <hi>reduce</hi> them from their Errors in Judgment and the Irregularities of their Conduct to the Truth of the Chriſtian Doctrine, and a diligent Conformity to the Divine Precepts: This is the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of theſe Churches; and the Reformation of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches by this Diſcipline, wherein <hi>Love without Diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> is exerciſed, we judge to be the only Method of recovering Evangelical Love out of its Languiſhments and reſtoring it to its primitive Vigour and Glory.</p>

Our bleſſed SAVIOUR has expreſly enjoined, as in Mat. XVIII. 15, <hi>If thy Brother ſhall treſpaſs againſt Thee, go and tell him his Fault between Thee and Him alone: If He ſhall hear Thee, Thou haſt gained thy Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> Which Injunction, altho' it ſpeaks concerning <hi>the Offence of a Neighbour againſt his Chriſtian Brother,</hi> nevertheleſs, as every true Chriſtian cannot but think that <hi>every Offence againſt GOD is a Treſpaſs againſt</hi> Himſelf, therefore <hi>it may well reach,</hi> and indeed ought to reach, <hi>to every Sin and Tranſgreſſion</hi> whatſoever: Now, beſides <hi>the Dignity of the Perſon</hi> who gives this Injunction, <hi>the good and ineſtimable Conſequence</hi> of it is to be conſidered by us: For our gracious LORD ſays, <hi>If He ſhall hear Thee, Thou haſt gained thy Brother,</hi> that is, Thou haſt brought Him over to Repentance and Reformation, and ſo to Salvation and Happineſs. And it is required by the holy and inſpired Apoſtle, in Gal. VI. 1, <hi>Brethren, if a Man be overtaken in a Fault, ye, which are</hi> ſpiritual, <hi>reſtore ſuch an one in the Spirit of Meekneſs,</hi> &amp;c: In which Text, whether we take <hi>ſpiritual</hi> to ſignify <hi>Chriſtians in general,</hi> or ſuch as were <hi>eminent in the Church</hi> for ſpiritual Knowledge and Gifts, as the Word is ſometimes uſed, the Senſe is plain and eaſy; and the Command is ſtrong to <hi>all Chriſtians,</hi> eſpecially to ſuch as are <hi>advanced in ſpiritual Knowledge,</hi> to take a particular Care of their offending Brethren, and ſhew all that Tenderneſs and Lenity towards them which is becoming the Goſpel. — And how plain is the Precept to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> in 1 Theſ. V. 14, to <hi>warn them that are unruly, to comfort the feeble-minded, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the weak,</hi>  and in Verſe 11th, to <hi>exhort and edify one another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It appears then to be indiſpenſably neceſſary, that all ſuch as would approve themſelves to be <hi>true Chriſtians</hi> ſhould, from a ſacred Regard to the Authority and Precepts of their declared LORD and Maſter, <hi>take the moſt watchful Care of their Brethren</hi> and continually <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort them to every good Office</hi> and <hi>uſe their beſt Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,</hi>
                  <pb n="95" facs="unknown:004275_0112_100547A053642838"/>as to <hi>keep them from that which is evil,</hi> ſo to <hi>recover them</hi> likewiſe <hi>out of the Snares</hi> in which they may be unhappily entangled.</p>
               <p>And, as it is neceſſary that Chriſtians ſhould <hi>thus</hi> ſhew their Care of their Brethren, their Watchfulneſs over them; it is alſo equally needful, that <hi>ſuch as are admoniſhed, corrected and exhorted</hi> by their Chriſtian Brethren ſhould <hi>acknowlege the Appointment</hi> of CHRIST and <hi>ſubmit to</hi> His Diſcipline, <hi>thankfully receiving Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly Admonition and Correction</hi> as becomes the Diſciples of the lowly JESUS, and <hi>ſtudiouſly conforming to the ſame:</hi> Nor in Truth will they demean themſelves as becomes <hi>ſerious Chriſtians,</hi> if they <hi>deſpiſe ſuch</hi> as from the Word of CHRIST admoniſh and correct them: For, if they <hi>deſpiſe ſuch,</hi> nor will hearken to their pious Reproofs and Exhortations, they are <hi>not the Diſciples of</hi> JESUS CHRIST: For, whereas it is He that ſpeaketh to them by their faithful Reprovers, they do not ſee meet to hear Him.</p>
               <p>This is the <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> concerning which we cannot have too good an Opinion nor expreſs ourſelves in too lofty a Strain: For we may ſay in the Style of CY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PRIAN of this Diſcipline, that <hi>it is wholeſome to follow it, whereas Averſeneſs to it and Neglect of it is fatal <note n="(&amp;)" place="bottom">Hane &amp; ſectari ſalubreeſt &amp; averſari ac negligere lethale.

               <p>Wherefore, that ſo this Diſcipline may rightly and properly be adminiſtred, there is a <hi>twofold Diſtinction of Offences</hi> to be obſerved: For, while ſome are <hi>ſecret and private,</hi> others are <hi>public and open;</hi> and ſome are <hi>great,</hi> whereas others are comparatively <hi>ſmall:</hi> According to which Diſtinctions, the Diſcipline of CHRIST is to be <hi>privately exerciſed</hi> towards ſuch whoſe <hi>Offences are private;</hi> whereas, if the <hi>Offences</hi> of any be <hi>public</hi> and to the Scandal of the Church, they are to be <hi>publickly admoniſhed and cenſured.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the <hi>Offence,</hi> that is committed by a Chriſtian Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, be <hi>private,</hi> provided two or three are obſervers of it, there ſhould the be <hi>three Steps</hi> taken by his Chriſtian Brethren in dealing with him: <hi>Firſt of all,</hi> one of thoſe who has ſeen the Offence of his Brother, ſhould <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately admoniſh and reprove</hi> him for it: And, if the <hi>offending Brother deſpiſe the Admonition and Reproof</hi> given him; then, in the <hi>next</hi> Place, he, that is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his Brother's Offence and grieved at his ſlighting his Brotherly Correction, ſhould <hi>take one or two more of his Brethren</hi> with him, that ſo <hi>by the Mouth of two or three Witneſſes</hi> the Regularity of the Procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure may be eſtabliſhed: And, <hi>in fine,</hi> if <hi>the offending Brother ſhall continue to ſlight the Admonitions</hi> which are
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:004275_0114_100547A44E19B9D8"/>thus duely given him, the <hi>third and laſt</hi> Step to be taken is, to <hi>tell the Church</hi> of his Fault and of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regard of the Chriſtian Conduct of his Brethren to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him.</p>
               <p>But, if the Offence be <hi>at firſt public</hi> and manifeſt unto all, then there is <hi>no need of ſuch a regular and gradual Proceſs;</hi> but <hi>your open and flagitious public Tranſgreſſors</hi> are at once <hi>to be rebuked before all, that others alſo may fear,</hi> as in 1 Tim. V. 20. And yet even <hi>this public Diſcipline</hi> ſhould be exerciſed according to the Diſtinction of <hi>great Tranſgreſſions</hi> or compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively <hi>ſamll</hi> ones; according to which Diſtinction, there ſhould be either a <hi>public Admonition and Reproof</hi> or <hi>a Deprivation of the Privileges of their Chriſtian Brethren</hi> who walk orderly: For <hi>Admonition and Reproof</hi> is a ſufficient Correction for <hi>ſmaller</hi> public Offences. But, as for <hi>groſſer Sins,</hi> and <hi>Stubbornneſs under kind Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions</hi> even tho' for <hi>ſmaller Faults,</hi> theſe deſerve to be puniſhed with denying the further Enjoyment of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion and Eccleſiaſtical Privileges.</p>
               <p>So then the <hi>Duty</hi> of the Brethren is clear, and their <hi>Power</hi> is great and invaluable: It is their <hi>Duty</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulate with their Brethren, and as ſuch to deal with them, <hi>when they are guilty of private Scandals, in a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Way,</hi> in a friendly and Chriſtian Manner: And it is their <hi>Duty, Power and Privilege</hi> alſo <hi>to hear and judge concerning their Brethren in public Scandals;</hi> and, as they may <hi>forgive and receive</hi> ſuch as are truely <hi>peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,</hi> they may alſo <hi>reprove, rebuke, exhort and cenſure notoricus Offenders:</hi> For, when our SAVIOUR requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth a Chriſtian, that, if he cannot ſucceed ſo far as to heal the Offence <hi>in private,</hi> he ſhould then <hi>tell the Church;</hi> He certainly means <hi>a particular or Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church <note n="(b)" place="bottom">

               <p>That <hi>the Church or Brethren have the Power of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> as has bin ſaid, may be argued from <hi>ſeveral Paſſages upon ſacred Record;</hi> from which Paſſages it is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly evident, that they gave their Determination and Judgment in ſuch Caſes as properly came before them.</p>
               <p>Not to mention, that the <hi>Brethren of the Circumciſion</hi> expoſtulated with PETER about his Communion with CORNELIUS and his Family, and that He was ſo far from <hi>rejecting their Complaint,</hi> as if they had gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their proper Power and Limits, that He readily undertook and endeavour'd to give them ſuitable Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, as has already bin obſerved.</p>
               <p>We find, that <hi>the Brethren</hi> of the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> paſs'd their Cenſure upon the <hi>Inceſtuous Corinthian:</hi> And the Apoſtle PAUL reproved them all, that they had <hi>no ſooner put him away</hi> from among them, as in 1 Cor. V. 2; and, at Verſe 12th, He expreſly aſſureth them, that they had <hi>the Power of Judging ſuch as are within <note n="(x)" place="bottom">Hujuſmodi autem Diſciplina pertinere ad Eccleſiam ſatis apparet Ex toto. <hi>Cap.

<pb n="101" facs="unknown:004275_0118_100547AB019C8960"/>is tranſlated <hi>diſorderly:</hi> For this is a Power belonging to all the Members of the Church, as is manifeſt from theſe Directions to them.</p>
               <p>And it moreover appears, that <hi>particular Churches have ſuch a Power;</hi> becauſe they are <hi>chargeable with Guilt, if any Offences are committed by their Members and yet remain uncenſured</hi> by them: Thus the Church of <hi>Pergamos</hi> is reproved as guilty of Offence <hi>for ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering BALAAM and the</hi> Nicolaitans <hi>among them,</hi> as in Rev. II. 14 and 15; and, at Verſe 20, CHRIST has <hi>a few Things againſt</hi> the Church at <hi>Thyatira</hi> for ſuffering JEZEBEL among them: But, if theſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches had <hi>not ſufficient Power to turn out</hi> the Offenders in them, it would be <hi>hard to blame them for the Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of them in their Communion. And hence we may conclude, that, what our SAVIOUR wrote to any of thoſe Churches, <hi>HIS SPIRIT ſays to all the Churches:</hi> So that, if we would anſwer the Divine Expectations, we ſhould beware of <hi>Remiſſneſs in Diſcipline and calmly tolerating the like Offences</hi> among ourſelves; and we ſhould alſo be <hi>careful to admoniſh other Churches about</hi> us <hi>with Love and Faithfulneſs for the Offences obſervable in</hi> them.</p>
               <p>But, beſides the <hi>Scriptural Directions and Patterns</hi> in Favour of ſuch a Diſcipline, <hi>the Reaſon of the Thing</hi> plainly ſpeaks for ſuch a Power in particular Churches: For, as that animal <hi>Body</hi> is defective, weak and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound in its Nature and Conſtitution, which has not Strength <hi>equal to the Expulſion of the malignant Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours</hi> which are brought into it; even ſo thoſe <hi>Bodies,</hi> particular Churches, would be but <hi>in a feeble State,</hi> which have not <hi>Power to get rid of their vicious, corrupt and offenſive People:</hi> Nor can we think it for the Honour of our bleſſed SAVIOUR to leave His Churches in ſuch a feeble State:— But we have Reaſon to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that the great Head of the Church has given His Churches ſuch <hi>an athletic Conſtitution</hi> that they have Power equal to the Purging themſelves of their ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:004275_0119_100547AD5CC109C8"/>and vicious Homours: And bleſſed be GOD, while ſome other Churches are complaining for the Want of a <hi>godly Diſcipline,</hi> theſe Churches enjoy it and will not ſuffer ſuch as are known to be prophane and vile Perſons to eſcape it.</p>
               <p>Perhaps it will be demanded here, <hi>whether the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> in the Ages immediately ſucceeding the Apoſtles Days <hi>were in the Poſſeſſion of ſuch Power and exerted it upon proper Occaſions?</hi> Now, in Anſwer to this Enquiry, I would ſay, that, ſuppoſing they <hi>had not nor did exerciſe ſuch a Power,</hi> this does not hinder but that <hi>it properly belonged unto</hi> them, as it appears that it did from the <hi>Injunctions and Examples upon ſacred Record:</hi> So that they might lawfully and honeſtly <hi>take and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe this Power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Truth is, we find, that <hi>the Churches in the Ages after the Apoſtles</hi> poſſeſſed this Power, and on ſuitable Occaſions uſed the ſame.

                     </gap>ille Lachrymaoe!</hi> Hence the <hi>Power of Diſcipline</hi> has bin taken out of the Hands of the People, and infinite Diſorders have enſued upon it: For, when a <hi>Biſhop or a ſmall Number of Miniſters</hi> have the Superviſion or Overſight and Management of Affairs, it is next to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible but that <hi>Pride and Ambition, Faction and Envy, Political Regards and Secular Intereſts</hi> ſhould govern: And indeed this is no more than what is obſerved by the Hiſtorians SOCRATES and SOZOMEN, as well as by ſeveral other Fathers.</p>
               <p>I would not be underſtood, notwithſtanding all that has bin ſaid, <hi>entirely to exclude the Elders from the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of the Diſcipline of the Church:</hi> For the <hi>Duty of admoniſhing Offenders privately and perſonally</hi> belongs to them <hi>in common with the reſt of the Church;</hi> tho' it does not properly belong to the <hi>Elders as ſuch,</hi> but only <hi>as Brethren of the ſame Society:</hi> And yet it muſt be allowed, that <hi>Elders</hi> by Virtue of their Office are <hi>enabled to do it with more Authority in a moral Senſe,</hi> tho' they do not ſtrictly and properly <hi>exerciſe the Power of their Office.</hi> And it muſt be acknowleged, that in the Diſcharge of their Office they may be capacitated to ſee and know the Faults of the Brethren ſooner than others; but yet, in the Exerciſe of this Diſcipline every Member is <hi>equally concerned with the Elders,</hi> as appears from the Obligations which lie upon them to watch over and exerciſe ſpecial Love towards one another; for their Obligations to this are equal: And indeed this Duty is ſo incumbent on <hi>every Member</hi> of the Church, that, if any neglect it, he <hi>ſins againſt the Inſtitution of CHRIST</hi> and becomes <hi>a Partaker in the Sin</hi> of the offending Party, and is <hi>guilty of his Danger and Ruin,</hi> as well as <hi>chargeable with all the Inconveniencies and I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>uries accruing to the Church</hi> by the Continuance of its Members in Sin and Wickedneſs: So that, upon theſe Conſiderations, all the Brethren not only have the
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:004275_0122_100547B3EF3BF6F8"/>
                  <hi>Liberty of admoniſhing one another,</hi> but it is their <hi>plain and indiſpenſable Duty</hi> ſo to do: And whoſoever of them <hi>neglects</hi> this Duty is chargeable with the <hi>Hatred of his Brother.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, altho' this Duty be perſonally incumbent on every <hi>particular Member of the Church,</hi> this however hinders not but that, if <hi>ſeveral</hi> at the ſame Time <hi>know the Sin</hi> of an Offender and jointly are offended at it, they may <hi>together,</hi> if they think it prudent, <hi>in the firſt Inſtance admoniſh</hi> him: And, if they do ſo, this is to be conſidered as <hi>the firſt and private Admonition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Way and Manner</hi> wherein this Duty is to be diſcharged, I would only obſerve, that it ſhould be done <hi>with Prudence, Tenderneſs and a due Regard to all Circumſtances, from Love to the Perſon offending, out of Obedience to JESUS CHRIST, agreably to the Rule</hi> which is given for our Direction in it and <hi>with a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs to receive Satisfaction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now the great and good <hi>Ends</hi> to be propoſed in ſuch a Diſcipline are, that <hi>undiſſembled Love may be maintained,</hi> that the <hi>offending Brother may be gained,</hi> that he may be <hi>preſerved from Diſhonour</hi> by the unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Divulging of his Failings and Errors, that the <hi>Churches may not be ſcandalized</hi> by the haſty expoſing of the Failings of their Members whether they be real or imaginary, and that <hi>the Trouble of a public Hearing may be prevented:</hi> And, if theſe <hi>Ends</hi> be obtained, by the <hi>accuſed Perſon's manifeſting his Innocence</hi> as to the Facts alleg'd againſt him or by his <hi>Acknowlegement, Repentance and Promiſes of Reformation,</hi> then this Part of the Diſcipline of CHRIST'S Church has obtained the deſired Effect.</p>
               <p>But, if theſe good <hi>Ends</hi> be not anſwered, then <hi>the Perſons,</hi> who have endeavoured to reclaim their offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Brother by <hi>private Methods,</hi> are to <hi>inform the Elders of the Church</hi> concerning their Proceedure; and <hi>by them the Report ſhould be made</hi> to the Church, as of the <hi>Crime committed,</hi> ſo of the <hi>Teſtimonies given</hi> to prove the Truth
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:004275_0123_100547B5F44C90A8"/>of it, of the <hi>Means uſed</hi> to bring the Offender to Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowlegement and Repentance, and concerning the <hi>Deportment of the Offender</hi> under the private Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions given him, to wit, <hi>his Rejection of them and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to render any Satisfaction</hi> on the Account of his Offence.</p>
               <p>And, when Things are thus propoſed to the Church and the Offender heard, <hi>the whole Church,</hi> Elders and Brethren, are to conſider the <hi>Nature of the Offence and to judge concerning the Offence,</hi> as well as <hi>the Demeanour of the Offender:</hi> And, if <hi>the Offence be evident and glaring,</hi> the Offender is to be <hi>admoniſhed with the Conſent and Concurrence of the Church</hi> by the Elders: But, if the Offender <hi>deſpiſe the Admonition</hi> of the Church and <hi>continues obſtinate and impenitent,</hi> then it is the Mind and Will of our bleſſed SAVIOUR, that he ſhould be <hi>cut off from the Privileges of the Church and caſt out of the Society:</hi> And this is the <hi>laſt Act of the Diſcipline of the Church</hi> for the Correction of Offenders: So that, by the Conſtitution of JESUS CHRIST, <hi>the Body of the Church or the Multitude of the Brethren are intereſted in the Adminiſtration of the Diſciplinary Power in the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the Diſcipline of theſe <hi>Congregational Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> which we apprehend to be <hi>moſt conformable to Reaſon and the Holy Scriptures, to the Practice of the Apoſtles and the Primitive Chriſtians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to a <hi>Power faſtned to the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> a Power of Binding and Looſing, by which Men can <hi>excommunicate and deliver up a Perſon to the Devil</hi> in the Name and by the Authority of JESUS CHRIST, <hi>we pretend to no ſuch Power:</hi> Nor do we approve of any ſuch Power, to which ſome make their Pretences, by which <hi>Paſtors or Synods,</hi> in Conjunction and Confederacy with the <hi>Civil Magiſtrate,</hi> or by <hi>an Eccleſiaſtical Power</hi> diſtinct from the Magiſtrate's, but equal to it, <hi>are capable of binding and loſing,</hi> as has bin ſaid: <hi>Nay we deteſt it.</hi>

                  <pb n="107" facs="unknown:004275_0124_10054744033EFE60"/>
We know, that <hi>Excommunication</hi> was an Act of Apoſtolical Authority; but we can ſee no Reaſon, why <hi>Delivering up to Satan</hi> to be buffeted ſhould be made <hi>the common Form of Excommunication,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a <hi>Precedent for the conſtant Practice of the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That this was an <hi>Act of miraculous Power</hi> viſibly lodged with the Apoſtles is plain to us; becauſe, as they could <hi>ſtrike Men blind and dead,</hi> they <hi>had the Power</hi> alſo <hi>of letting evil Spirits looſe</hi> to terrify, plague and puniſh ſuch Perſons as were Enemies of Truth and Righteouſneſs, that ſo a <hi>terrible Remedy</hi> might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted for a <hi>dreadful Evil:</hi> We do not therefore won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that the Apoſtles never mention <hi>this</hi> among the <hi>ſtanding Appointments for the Church</hi> to obſerve nor give any Charge or Directions about it: And it appears very ſtrange unto us, that this <hi>Method of denouncing Anathemas has obtained ſo much in Churches,</hi> and even among ſuch Churches as pretend to elevated Degrees of Reformation; believing, that the abſurd Notion of the <hi>Infallibility of the Church</hi> has bin carried on by it, and that <hi>it has laid the Foundation for endleſs Animoſities and the greateſt Uncharitableneſs.</hi>

               <p>In fine then; Altho' theſe Churches may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached by many as very <hi>defective in their Politicks,</hi> inaſmuch as they did not <hi>erect an infallible Tribunal, but yet expect the good People to ſubmit to their Deciſions,</hi> altho' they are ſubject to Error; whereas, in other Eſtabliſhments, the <hi>People are obliged to ſubmit</hi> to an uncontroleable infallible Authority <note n="(x)" place="bottom">Qualibet Eccleſia ſibi Verbis arrogat <hi>Orthodoxiam,</hi> R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="111" facs="unknown:004275_0128_100547BE152F5318"/>and trampled upon his Body after he was dead.— And it is remarkable, hat the <hi>Canons,</hi> which have the beſt Doctrine and the trueſt Morality and Goodneſs in them, were not made by <hi>Aſſemblies of Clergymen,</hi> nor by <hi>nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Synods and Oecumenical Councils,</hi> wherein the Clergy have had the chief Management, but in <hi>thoſe Councils and Synods which were private and conſiſted of a few Perſons of the Laity</hi> as well as the Clergy: And hence moſt of the <hi>Aſrican</hi> Councils were the beſt in all the World: For the <hi>Aſrican Biſhopricks</hi> were like our Congregational Churches; nor did the <hi>Biſhops or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters</hi> ſtrive who ſhould be greateſt in them, according to the Manner of ſome in other Places.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>particular Churches,</hi> we readily concede, that they, as of equal Power, may in ſome Caſes appointed by JESUS CHRIST <hi>meet together by themſelves or by their Delegates in a Council or Synod</hi> and may perform ſundry Acts of Eccleſiaſtical Power; but yet it is our avowed Principle, that the <hi>Members of Councils and Synods,</hi> with <hi>all the Power</hi> which they exerciſe and put forth, <hi>are all of them primarily given to the ſeveral par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titular Churches,</hi> on whoſe Account they are gathered and employed, either as the <hi>firſt Subject</hi> in whom they reſide or the <hi>firſt Object</hi> about whom they are conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant: So that, altho' we differ from ſome of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours about <hi>the Power of Councils and Synods,</hi> we have no Difference at all with them about their <hi>Being;</hi> for we freely acknowlege, that they <hi>ought to be, when pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Occaſions</hi> require.</p>
               <p>Dr. HUMPHREY HODY has publiſhed an <hi>Hiſtory of Engliſh Councils and Convocations, and of the Clergy's ſitting in Parliament,</hi> in 1701, in which he has taken a great deal of Pains and Care in turning over ancient Hecords and collecting Paſſages out of them; but by them <hi>it does not appear, where the Original Right of convening Councils and Synods was lodged:</hi> He ſhews indeed, that <hi>Synods were ſometimes called by the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Clergy, and at other Times convened by the
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:004275_0129_100547C015E5F118"/>Prince:</hi> But this does not determine, where <hi>the Right of Convening</hi> them is placed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Councils and Synods</hi> ſhould be compoſed of ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as are fit and proper, both of the <hi>Elderſhip and the Laity;</hi> and both have <hi>equal Right to ſpeak their Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> in them: 'Tis true <hi>a particular Regard</hi> may ſometimes be had to <hi>Paſtors and Biſhops</hi> in ſending De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legates to Synods: But, if the Churches ſhould only have ſuch <hi>Biſhops or Paſtors</hi> as are either <hi>not ſo well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted</hi> with their Conſtitution or are <hi>Enemies unto</hi> it, it is their <hi>Duty to keep them at Home</hi> at leaſt.</p>
               <p>And, when a Number of pious, ſkilful and prudent Perſons, both <hi>Miniſters and Brethren,</hi> are ſent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened in Council or Synod, they ought to have <hi>equal Power and Authority</hi> in acting and voting: This is the <hi>Right of the Fraternity;</hi> and, in order to ſupport and eſtabliſh this <hi>Right of the Fraternity</hi> in Councils and Synods, there are a few brief Remarks to be offered, which have conſiderable Weight and Significance in them.</p>
               <p>It is certain, that we have the <hi>Authority of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and the Practice of the Church</hi> in the Apoſtle's Days for this Power of the Brethren: For we read, that the <hi>Apoſtles and Elders came together to conſider of the Matter</hi> that was to be laid before them, in Act. XV. 6: And it follows, at Verſe 22, <hi>then pleaſed it the Apoſtles and Elders,</hi> with the whole Church, <hi>to ſend eboſen Men,</hi> &amp;c: From which Paſſages it plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that, not only the <hi>Apoſtles and Elders,</hi> but <hi>the whole Church</hi> alſo, and ſo the <hi>People,</hi> were preſent in this Council and were concerned in the definitive Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of it: But now <hi>this Council</hi> ought to be <hi>the Rule and Pattern for all other Councils</hi> whether greater or ſmaller: Since therefore in this Council, not only the <hi>Apoſtles and Elders,</hi> but <hi>all the People</hi> are ſaid to give their Opinion and unite in the definitive Decree; ſurely <hi>the ſame Rule ought to be obſerved in all other Councils or Synods:</hi> For, as all other Synods are vaſtly-inferiour to
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:004275_0130_1005474609E88B78"/>this Apoſtolical one, it may well be expected that they ſhould be <hi>conformable to the ſame.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, beſides this <hi>Example</hi> upon ſacred Record to juſtify <hi>the Right of the Brethren to ſit and act in Council,</hi> there are ſeveral Places of Scripture, which <hi>allow all the Faithful</hi> in Eccleſiaſtical Conventions to judge in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Matters: Not to inſiſt upon that Paſſage, in 1 Cor. XIV. 24, where it is ſaid, <hi>If all propheſy, and there come that believeth not or one unlearned,</hi> he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of all, he is judged of all: It is plain both from the <hi>old any new Teſtament,</hi> that <hi>Divine Matters ſhould be publickly conſidered</hi> by the People and the <hi>final Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> referring to them ſhould be left with the People. So we read, in 1 King. XVIII. 21 and 39 Verſes, that ELIJAH <hi>came to all the People and ſaid, how long balt ye between two Opinions? If the LORD be GOD, follow HIM; but if</hi> Baal, <hi>follow him: And the People anſwered Him not a Word.—And when all the People ſaw</hi> [how the Sacrifice was conſumed from above] <hi>they fell on their Faces and ſaid, The LORD HE is GOD, the LORD HE is the GOD.</hi> And it is written, that, when <hi>PHILIP preached to the City of</hi> Samaria, <hi>the People with one Accord gave Heed to the Things which He ſpake, and there was great Joy in the City,</hi> as in Act. VIII. 6 and 8 Verſes. So that it ſhould ſeem, as if the People, upon hearing and maturely weighing the Diſcourſes of PHILIP, publickly teſtified their Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of what He taught them.</p>
               <p>And it is worthy to be obſerved, that <hi>this Right of the Laity</hi> has bin aſſerted and exerciſed in later Times: For, not to mention it, that the <hi>Temporal Lords and Commons,</hi> in the two Reigns that brought on the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, were much better Judges of Religion, than the Biſhops and the Convocation; and, if they had not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted the Reformation, tho' <hi>poor Laicks,</hi> the Engliſh Nation to this Day had lain buried in the <hi>Aegyptian,</hi> and worſe than Aegyptian, <hi>Darkneſs of Popery.</hi>—It is well known, that, when the Calling of that infamous
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:004275_0131_100547C2903BDE58"/>Aſſembly the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> was propoſed at <hi>Norim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi> in the Year 1522, all the Eſtates of <hi>Germany</hi> deſired and inſiſted, that <hi>Admittance might be granted unto Laymen</hi> as well as Clergymen, to be, not only <hi>Spectators and Witneſſes,</hi> but alſo <hi>Judges</hi> in the Council: Which being refuſed, they would not come unto it, but publiſhed the Reaſons of their withdraw; one of which was, <hi>becauſe Laymen were not allowed to vote among them.</hi> And what learned Engliſhman is there that can be ignorant, how our learned WHITAKER, our excellent JUEL, our ſkilful and induſtrious WIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LET and other Writers of our Nation, in writing againſt the <hi>Romaniſts, maintain the Right of Laicks to ſit and judge in Eccleſiaſtical Councils?</hi> And, as the moſt famous Councils and Synods in the Churches of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion have admitted ſuch Members in them; ſo, in the primitive Times and the Ages next unto the Apoſtles, it is unqueſtionable that ſuch had not only <hi>Seats,</hi> but <hi>Votes</hi> in Councils allowed them: And, even in as late a Council as that of <hi>Calcedon,</hi> we find <hi>ſeven Earls, ten Senators and others,</hi> beſides Eccleſiaſticks.</p>
               <p>But, in Truth if there were <hi>no Inſtances or Examples</hi> of this, this is very plain and evident, that <hi>the Divine Spirit ſometimes and very frequently beſtows ſuch Gifts on the Brotherhood</hi> as render them worthy to be heard and make it fit that they ſhould declare their Judgment: So that <hi>the Reaſon of the Thing</hi> requires, that <hi>their Gifts ſhould not be deſpiſed,</hi> but that they ſhould <hi>have the Liberty of exerciſing them freely upon requiſite Occaſions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Natural Juſtice,</hi> beſides, ſupplies us with an Argument in Defence of the <hi>Brethren's Right to ſit and act in Councils:</hi> For nothing can be more fit and juſt and equal, than that <hi>the common Cauſe of all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſhould be determined by the Votes and Suffrages of the Churches:</hi> And, inaſmuch as the HOLY SPIRIT with His influences is not confined to <hi>any particular ſort of Men</hi> in the Churches, it is fit that <hi>every Brother ſhould exerciſe freely the Gifts which he has freely received:</hi> For
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:004275_0132_100547C424F65B48"/>that which concerneth all ought to be handled in ſome good Meaſure or Degree <hi>by all who are qualified:</hi> And, as the <hi>Faith</hi> of Chriſtians, as well as what ſhould be their <hi>Practice,</hi> is a Matter of univerſal Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; therefore the Brethren, who are qualified as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſhould in Councils have their Share in diſcuſſing theſe Things and giving their Determinations upon them.</p>
               <p>Furthermore; As the <hi>Scripture</hi> is the <hi>Supreme Judge of all Controverſies</hi> in Religion and <hi>the infallible Rule of all Judgment;</hi> and as they who ſit and act in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils and Synods are only to be <hi>Interpreters and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainers</hi> of what is contained in the Word of GOD, therefore <hi>the Brethren,</hi> as well and as much as their Officers, <hi>may give their Judgment in Councils and Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods.</hi> And indeed the Opinion of <hi>one Layman,</hi> which is agreable to the Scriptures, is to be preferred before the ſolemn Judgment of an whole Council of Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men which is contradictory to them. SO GRATIAN acknowleges, that <hi>the Authority</hi> of JEROM <hi>ſupported by the ſacred Scripture is to be valued before that of an whole general Council <note n="(q)" place="bottom">

Why truely it is ſaid, that they are <hi>generally more wiſe and learned</hi> than their
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:004275_0133_100547C5B24A4098"/>Neighbours and therefore they ſhould eſpecially be employed: But it muſt be confeſſed, that it is often, otherwiſe: And therefore, if there can be found any <hi>Laymen</hi> more learned than their Miniſters or equally wiſe, there can be no good Reaſon why they ſhould not be <hi>called to Councils and act and judge in</hi> them, in all Reſpects <hi>equally with their Miniſters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nor,</hi> in fine, <hi>is primitive Antiquity a Stranger to this Liberty of the Fraternity.</hi> I could quote numerous Paſſages out of the Hiſtorians EUSEBIUS, SOZOMEN and THEODORET, from which it appears, that not only <hi>Biſhops or Miniſters,</hi> but <hi>Laymon</hi> alſo, were not only <hi>preſent in Councils,</hi> but alſo <hi>ſpake their Minds and argued and gave their Determinations.</hi> But it is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for our preſent Purpoſe, that, from <hi>the Acts of ancient Councils,</hi> it is very manifeſt that <hi>the Brethren voted and acted in them:</hi> In the firſt Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> not only <hi>Biſhops and Elders</hi> ſat and judg'd, but the <hi>Laity</hi> alſo had <hi>equal Liberty with</hi> them: And a <hi>Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> in the Preſence of the whole Council, diſputing with a Pagan Philoſopher, <hi>overcame him and converted him to the Chriſtian Faith <note n="(t)" place="bottom">

               <p>Upon ſuch <hi>Grounds and Reaſons</hi> as theſe, the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in <hi>New-England</hi> have aſſerted the <hi>Right of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to ſit and act in Synods</hi> in their <hi>Platform of Church-Diſcipline:</hi> And agreable to theſe Principles, as well as the concurring Practice of the Primitive Churches, theſe Churches have always allow'd the <hi>Brethren</hi> their full Liberty in Councils. And it is worthy to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked, that in the Synod of theſe Churches, convened in the Year 1679, ſome <hi>Elders</hi> came from ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches to repreſent them <hi>without any Brethren:</hi> at which the Synod was ſo far diſſatisfied, that they <hi>would not ſuffer thoſe Paſtors to ſit with</hi> them, until they had prevailed with their Churches to ſend ſome <hi>Brethren</hi> along with them: For they were very jealous of allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Thing, that might <hi>look like an Infringement</hi> of that Liberty which by Divine Inſtitution belongs to particular Churches.</p>
               <p>But, if any ſhall remain diſſatisfied upon this Head, after all that has bin offered; I muſt beg leave to refer them for the more full Diſplay and Confirmation of it to a learned <hi>Diſquiſition concerning Eccleſiaſtical Councils,</hi> which was publiſh'd by my Grandfather Dr. INCREASE MATHER;wherein there is enow ſaid to ſatisfy any reaſonable Man concerning <hi>this Right of the Brethren</hi> for which I have bin pleading.</p>
               <p>Theſe Churches in <hi>New-England</hi> have never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened in a General Synod but upon the Motion of the <hi>Civil Magiſtrate</hi> to conſider of Affairs wherein all the Churches were concerned: But they ſuppoſe, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this, that they have a full Liberty to meet in <hi>Synods,</hi> without the Direction of the <hi>Civil Magiſtrate:</hi> For <hi>ſuch a Liberty</hi> the primitive Churches had before
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:004275_0135_100547CB48BB4A60"/>CONSTANTINE aſcended the Imperial Throne: And ſurely <hi>no Chriſtian Prince has any Right to hinder theſe Churches</hi> in the Exerciſe of this Liberty, when they judge it requiſite for the preſerving of their Peace and good Order.</p>
               <p>And this will more eſpecially appear, if it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that the <hi>Synods of theſe Churches are not like thoſe of other Churches:</hi> For they have <hi>no Weapons but what are ſpiritual:</hi> They neither pretend to nor deſire any Power that is <hi>juridical:</hi> If they can but <hi>inſtruct and perſuade,</hi> they gain their End: But, when they have done all, <hi>the Churches are</hi> ſtill <hi>free to accept or refuſe their Advice:</hi> As they have no <hi>ſecular Power</hi> to enforce their Canons, they neither aſk nor deſire its Aid. And, ſince theſe Synods are ſuch <hi>innocent and inoffenſive Things,</hi> none, that have any due Information concerning them, can reaſonably object againſt their Meeting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether or forbid them, <hi>without a manifeſt Invaſion of the common Liberties of Mankind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have ſaid, that theſe Churches, when they meet in Synods, <hi>claim</hi> to themſelves <hi>no Juridical Power:</hi> For they are of the celebrated CHAMIER'S Opinion, that <hi>the Determination of a Council</hi> or Synod <hi>is perſuaſive, not compulſive; a miniſterial Judgment, not bringing along with it any Authority and Neceſſity; and ſo a deciſive Suffrage not in itſelf, but as it is taken out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <note n="(&amp;)" place="bottom">Sententia Concil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Doctors, or Congregations of Doctors, may err as groſsly as any others, and build upon a Foundation of Hay or Straw, empty and combuſtible Matter.

And, if we conſult many other learned Writers of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> we ſhall find Cauſe to conclude them to be againſt the <hi>Power and Juriſdiction of Councils,</hi> and that <hi>they</hi> are for <hi>Concord rather than Regimen</hi> or <hi>Government.</hi> Thus in the Scheme of Church-Government, drawn up by the eminently learned Dr. USHER, Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Armagh. there is not aſcribed to Synodical Conventions any proper Juriſdiction over any Parochial Church.</hi> And, whereas ſome aſfirm the <hi>Dioceſan Church to be a ſingle one</hi> of the loweſt Sort, and that whatever Power, A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>hority or Juriſdiction belongs to a particular Church of the loweſt Rank belongs to the Dioceſan Church; now This the famous Dr. BARROW has endeavoured to prove <hi>to be
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:004275_0137_100547CF476EF058"/>independent:</hi> So that, if the Bounds of particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches be made <hi>Parochial,</hi> it muſt needs follow, that what is ſaid to belong to the <hi>Dioceſan</hi> Church muſt be ſeated on the <hi>Pariſh Church.</hi> And, if ſo, what will become of the <hi>ſuperiour juridical Power?</hi> And the worthy Reforming Biſhops CRANMER, TONSTAL and others, being required to give their Opinion concerning <hi>the Authority of General Councils,</hi> freely declared, that <hi>this Authority did not flow from the Number of the Biſhops, but the Matter of their Deciſions:</hi> So that, by this, they could never by their Authority make an indifferent Thing to become a Duty: But, as GROTIUS expreſſes it, <hi>proeant ipſi Judicio directivo,</hi> they may ſhew Men what they apprehend to be Sin and Duty; not, like <hi>Parliaments,</hi> make any Thing ſinful or a Duty which was not ſo before.—But having occaſionally mention'd GROTIUS, I would take the Occaſion here to mention it, that [in his Book. <hi>De Imperio Sum. Poteſtat.</hi> p. 168.] he has fully proved that <hi>there was never a truely General Council called,</hi> excepting that at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that <hi>Councils have no governing or legiſlative Power by Divine Right,</hi> and that <hi>what was written in Synods</hi> for the ſake of Order <hi>are not called Laws,</hi> but Canons, <hi>and have the Force of</hi> Advice only, or <hi>oblige by Way of Conſent and Agreement.</hi> But to return, I would cite a Paſſage from the learned Mr. RICHARD HOOKER, wherein he delivers, not only his own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Judgment, but, as he apprehended, the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> The Paſſage of this zealous Aſſertor of the Church's Authority to which I refer, is to be ſeen in his celebrated Book of <hi>Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Polity,</hi> and is as follows; <hi>I grant,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that Proof derived from the Authority of Man's Judgment is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>t able to work that Aſſurance, which doth grow by a ſtronger Proof; and therefore, altho' ten thouſand</hi> General Councils <hi>ſhould ſet down one and the ſame definitive Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence concerning any Point of Religion whatſoever; yet one demonſtrative</hi> Reaſon <hi>alledged or one</hi> Teſtimony cited
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:004275_0138_100547D26725BA80"/>from the Word <hi>of GOD Himſelf to the Contrary could not chuſe but overſway them all: Inaſmuch as for them to be deceived it is not ſo impoſſible, as it is that</hi> Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrative Reaſon or Divine Teſtimony <hi>ſhould deceive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet, after all, it is of very little Conſequence unto us, <hi>who are for or againſt a Juridical Power</hi> in Synods or Councils: It is enow for us, that <hi>we have weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and unto us <hi>ſufficient and ſatisfactory Reaſons againſt allowing ſuch a Power</hi> unto them. And <hi>the Reaſons,</hi> which have moved theſe Churches to give into theſe Sentiments, are ſuch as theſe: We know, that our Lord JESUS CHRIST is <hi>the ſupreme Teacher ſent from GOD,</hi> and that <hi>His Word is the ſupreme Law of Chriſtians,</hi> altogether infallible, and that therefore <hi>our laſt Appeal ought to be to that:</hi> We think, that <hi>all the Power,</hi> which any Servants of CHRIST ought to have in the Churches, <hi>is miniſterial only,</hi> and not <hi>Proetorian:</hi> Our Opinion is, that, if the <hi>Embaſſadors of earthly Princes</hi> may not exceed the Inſtructions of their Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <hi>much leſs</hi> may any Miniſters, or Embaſſadors of the Prince of Peace go beyond the Directions of their great LORD and Maſter: It is our Judgment, that, if <hi>the Determinations of Councils</hi> be founded upon the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of Men, weak and fallible Men, and not upon the Truth of GOD'S Word, the bleſſed GOD would be contrary to HIMSELF: For how can it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent for Him, to <hi>define and appoint one Thing in the Scripture, and to determine otherwiſe in a Council?</hi> And, in fine, We are confirmed in theſe our Sentiments from the <hi>Practice of all lawful Councils:</hi> For we find in the Apoſtolical Council, JAMES anſwered, ſaying, <hi>Men and Brethren, hearken to me: SIMEON hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, how GOD at firſt did viſit the</hi> Gentiles <hi>to take out of them a People for his Name: And to this agree the Words of the Prophets,</hi> as in Act. XV. 14 and 15. And, agreable to this, has bin the Practice of other approved Councils: For, ſo ſays ATHANASIUS, in the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> the <hi>Faith of the Fathers was

               </p>
               <p>Some of our Brethren, we are fully ſenſible, think it not enow for Councils to perſuade and give Advice, but <hi>want ſomething more</hi> for them; nor can they be pleaſed, unleſs they have them <hi>clothed with a binding juridical Power:</hi> But to theſe our Brethren it is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to ſay, that, if they would have <hi>this Power of bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and giving Law in indifferent Things,</hi> they are for <hi>exceeding the Bounds of the Commiſſion which was given to the Apoſtles</hi> themſelves: And a larger Commiſſion than theirs cannot with any Modeſty be challenged by Elders, Synods or Churches. But, if this <hi>binding Power</hi> be deſired and pleaded for only <hi>in Eſſential Matters,</hi> then we may proceed and argue thus, that, as <hi>Synods</hi> may meet to communicate Light and Peace to ſuch Perſons or Churches as are erronious or contentious, they may alſo at the ſame Time <hi>have Power not only to give Light and Counſel, but likewiſe to require them in the Name of JESUS CHRIST to attend and conform to the ſame:</hi> But, after all, we muſt ſuppoſe that <hi>the

               </p>
               <p>Many, we are aware, are forward to contend, that <hi>Councils and Synods are not ſo liable to err as particular Churches, and that</hi> therefore <hi>Appeals ſhould in all Caſes be preferred unto them:</hi> This is the Reaſon, which the celebrated RUTHERFURD gives for ſuch Appeals.

                  </q> Thus he. And Dr. BURNET juſtly
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:004275_0144_100547DD62804E50"/>obſerves, that the Writers of the <hi>fourth and fifth Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies</hi> give us <hi>diſmal Repreſentations of the Councils of thoſe Times:</hi> And beſides, there is Roaſon to think that <hi>Truth and Right</hi> may ſometimes be <hi>found with one ſingle Perſon as ſoon as in a Council:</hi> SO CYPRIAN, in his <hi>Seventy firſt</hi> Epiſtle, allows, that <hi>many Things are better revealed to ſingle Perſons:</hi> Nay we have a Proof of this in the firſt Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> which is reputed the beſt of any; for there had certainly bin iſſued a Canon for <hi>divercing married Prieſts,</hi> if the old PAPHNUTIUS had not ftood up and reaſoned againſt it.</p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>England</hi> has well determined in its <hi>nineteenth</hi> Article, that <hi>the Churches of</hi> Jeruſalem, Alexandria, Antioch <hi>and</hi> Rome <hi>have erred in Points of the greateſt Conſequence:</hi> And, in the <hi>twenty firſt</hi> Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, that <hi>General Councils may err.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But yet, ſuppoſing that a <hi>General Council were infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible,</hi> we muſt then conclude, that <hi>the Church has now loſt its Infallibility:</hi> For, as there has bin no ſuch Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil for many Scores of Years, there is alſo no Likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of another: And, if there might be one, the many Villanies in <hi>Trent</hi> may ſufficiently inſtruct the World that <hi>no Good is to be expected from ſuch a Council.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon the whole then; Since even <hi>General Councils</hi> may trick and be trick'd, and are as liable to err as a Synod or even a particular Church; Mankind muſt be very ſtupid indeed to think, that <hi>they ſhould have a binding Power and may force their Decrees upon any Society or Perſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But yet, if after all it ſhould be allowed for Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's ſake, that <hi>ſuch Councils were infallible and all their Decrees were entirely agreable to the Mind of GOD;</hi> ir will not nevertheleſs appear, that they have <hi>any juri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical Power</hi> at all: For, if we grant them a <hi>Doctrinal Power,</hi> by which they could unerringly clear up the Mind of GOD our SAVIOUR, ſtill <hi>the Power of Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,</hi> as has bin already explained, <hi>would remain in
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:004275_0145_100547E0DD577D68"/>the particular Churches,</hi> wherein CHRIST JESUS has placed the ſame: And indeed this is no more than what that excellent Preſbyterian Mr. RUTHERFURD is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to acknowlege, as I have before quoted him.</p>
               <p>In fine; <hi>The Way of theſe Churches</hi> has bin, and it is the <hi>beſt Way</hi> that can be obſerved, to enquire <hi>where our bleſſed SAVIOUR has placed the laſt Cenſuring and final Determination of Cauſes:</hi> And, having found this, they <hi>ought to reſt contented: Councils and Synods,</hi> when Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Aſſiſtance is needed, <hi>may be uſed by them;</hi> but it is not either their <hi>not Erring at all</hi> or their <hi>Erring more rarely,</hi> that is a ſufficient Reaſon for placing any Power of Juriſdiction in them, unleſs our great LORD and Maſter has ordered that they ſhall have ſuch a Power: But, as yet, <hi>this does not appear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore it is to be hoped, that <hi>the Brethren</hi> in theſe Churches <hi>will always maintain their Right to ſit and act in Councils and Synods;</hi> but yet that they will <hi>never think of placing any juridical Power</hi> in them, but will <hi>always continue to aſſert the Powers and Privileges of particular Churches, which are ſacred Things, by no means to be ſlighted and undervalued, nor to be left at the Mercy of any Claſſes or Councils, Synods or General Meetings.</hi>

               <p>THrough the Favour of our bleſſed SAVIOUR, <hi>His Churches may hold Communion with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> For, altho' <hi>no particular Church is ſubject to another</hi> particular Church of however large an Extent, as the Churches in the <hi>united Provinces</hi> have bin ſo free as to declare with us in <hi>the firſt Article of their Eccleſiaſtical Conſtitution;</hi> yet <hi>all the Churches may enjoy mutual and reciprocal Communion among</hi> themſelves: And there are <hi>ſeveral Ways, wherein this Communion may be</hi> regularly and laudably <hi>exerciſed;</hi> ſome of which have in ſome Meaſure bin conſidered or hinted at be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; but yet there will be no great Hurt in making a <hi>particular Mention</hi> of them here and giving a fair Deſcription and Recommendation of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt of all; Theſe Churches may partake with one another at the LORD'S Table;</hi> and the Members of one Church, coming occaſionally to another where the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="131" facs="unknown:004275_0148_100406B10F893028"/>
                  <hi>Nextly;</hi> Encouraged by the Example of the Apoſtle PAUL, who recommended PHEBE a Member of the Church at <hi>Cenchrea</hi> to the Church at <hi>Rome;</hi> theſe Churches may <hi>recommend their Brethren</hi> to Neighbour Churches, giving a good Teſtimony concerning them and entreating the Neighbour Churches to receive them to their ſacred Fellowſhip and to watch over them in Brotherly Love: And, if any Brother have real Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, either on the Account of his Buſineſs or for any other juſt End and Motive, to <hi>remove with his Family</hi> and take up his Abode in ſome other Place, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon acquaints the Church to which he belongs of his Purpoſe and the Grounds of his Removal; the Church may then <hi>write more full Letters of Recommendation</hi> to the Church to which he removes, reſigning <hi>him</hi> to their Charge and entreating <hi>them</hi> to <hi>receive him as a Brother</hi> and allow him all the Privileges of the Eccleſiaſtical State among them: And, when, according to the Tenour of ſuch <hi>Letters recommendatory,</hi> the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended Brother is <hi>accepted into the Fellowſhip of the Church,</hi> he is to all Intents and Purpoſes a Member of that Church; ſo that he may perform the Duties and enjoy the Privileges of a Member in that Society.— Such <hi>Letters of Recommendation</hi> the Apoſtle PAUL ſpeaks of in his <hi>Second</hi> Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> Chap. III. Verſe 1, as <hi>needful for others,</hi> tho' not for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.— And beſides it is <hi>reaſonable in itſelf,</hi> that none, <hi>without any Recommendations from the Churches</hi> to which they belong, ſhould claim or be allowed the Privileges of Societies to which they have no Relation or do not properly appertain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly;</hi> If any particular Church, that for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Time has <hi>walked in the Fear of GOD and the Comforts of the HOLY SPIRIT,</hi> has bin <hi>edified and multiplied</hi> to ſuch a Degree as to be overcharged with Members; they may <hi>ſend forth their Members</hi> that are qualified for it <hi>to enter into an Eccleſiaſtical State</hi> among themſelves: And by the ſame Reaſon, if a Number of
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:004275_0149_1004335F26AA8770"/>Chriſtians ſhould come from foreign Parts to a Place where the Church may be ſo full that they cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently join with it, <hi>that Church</hi> may warrantably <hi>encourage them to enter into an holy Combination</hi> among themſelves: For ſuch a <hi>Propagation of Churches</hi> is agreable to Nature and Reaſon, conſonant with the Practice of the Apoſtles and indeed neceſſary for the Enlargement of our SAVIOUR'S Kingdom in all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Generations to the End of the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly;</hi> When <hi>particular Churches have Occaſion of ſpiritual Refreſhment or temporal Succour, Neighbour Churches may afford it:</hi> They may furniſh them with <hi>able Members</hi> or <hi>ſpare ſuitable Officers</hi> to them; and, if they can <hi>conveniently</hi> ſend ſuch to their indigent Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, they ought with Readineſs to impart them: For ſo, when <hi>Tidings came to the Ears of the Church at</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, [concerning the Succeſs of the Goſpel] <hi>they ſent forth BARNABAS that he ſhould go as far as Antioch,</hi> as in Act. XI. 22: And it is entirely fit, that ſuch Churches as are <hi>full of uſeful Members and Officers</hi> ſhould be ready <hi>from their Fulneſs to ſupply the Neceſſities</hi> of their Brethren in other Churches. — And, if any of our Brethren ſhould fall into <hi>ſuch poor external Circumſtances that they cannot ſupport themſelves and the Goſpel,</hi> it is then <hi>our Duty to miniſter to their Neceſſities</hi> as GOD ſhall enable us: For ſo <hi>the Churches of the Gentiles</hi> made their <hi>liberal Contributions for the poor Saints at</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, as in Rom. XV. 26 and 27; where alſo <hi>the Reaſonableneſs of their ſo doing</hi> is declared: And to be ſure both <hi>Reaſon and Religion</hi> challenge it from Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to <hi>do Good and communicate</hi> to ſuch Brethren and Churches as are deſtitute.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly: Theſe Churches may lawfully conſult with one another</hi> and ought to do ſo as Occaſion requires: For it is very probable, that <hi>other Churches may be better acquainted with Perſons and Cauſes</hi> than ourſelves; and therefore <hi>their Judgment and Counſel ought to be required.</hi> Thus particularly, <hi>when a new Church is to be gathered,</hi>
                  <pb n="133" facs="unknown:004275_0150_10043360AC1DD2C0"/>or <hi>Officers are to be choſen and ordained</hi> over any Church, or there is ſome <hi>Difference among the Brethren</hi> about the Adminiſtration of the Cenſures of the Churches, it is fit and proper to <hi>conſult with Neighbour Churches;</hi> and <hi>Neighbour Churches</hi> ſhould be <hi>ready to ſend</hi> their Elders and other Delegates to help them with their Advice and Counſel.— And, if any Church ſhould <hi>want Light</hi> in any Caſe or ſhould be <hi>at Variance,</hi> they ſhould deſire <hi>Neighbour Churches</hi> to favour them with their Counſel: Whereupon <hi>ſuch Churches,</hi> convening by their Elders and other Meſſengers, may <hi>conſider the Points in Doubt or in Controverſy;</hi> and, having accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their beſt Underſtanding and Endeavours <hi>ſought the Way of Truth and Peace,</hi> they may <hi>communicate</hi> by Letters and Meſſengers <hi>their Sentiments and Advice</hi> to the Churches whoſe Caſe has bin under their attentive and prayerful Conſideration, that ſo, if they ſee meet, they may conform to the ſame and be at Peace.</p>
               <p>Theſe are ſome of the <hi>Ways and Mannors,</hi> wherein Churches are to <hi>ſhew their Care of one another and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs their Communion</hi> with each other: But to theſe there is another to be added: And the <hi>Sixth</hi> Way, wherein Churches are to exerciſe Communion towards one another, is <hi>the Way of Communion by</hi> Admonition: This is called <hi>the third Way of Communion</hi> in our Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form of Church-Diſcipline, Chap. XVth: And, from that Chapter, it appears, that this Method is to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, <hi>when any public Offence is to be found in a Church, which they either diſcern not or are ſlow in proceeding to uſe the means for the Removing and Healing of it.</hi>— I have reſerved the <hi>Conſideration of this Way</hi> to this Place, that ſo I might enlarge upon it, <hi>for the Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch as are unacquainted with it,</hi> for <hi>the confirming of ſuch as are wavering</hi> in their <hi>Apprehenſions</hi> about it, and that I might help <hi>towards removing the Prejudices</hi> of ſuch as have diſtinguiſhed themſelves by their Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition unto it.</p>

If therefore there be <hi>any Corruption in any Church whether in Doctrine or Manners;</hi> a particular Church in the Neighbourhood, having received a <hi>credible Account</hi> of it and having upon diligent Enquiry found <hi>the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port</hi> to be <hi>true,</hi> they ſend <hi>Letters or Meſſengers or both</hi> to the Church wherein ſuch Corruption is ariſen and prevailing, and <hi>admoniſh them with Faithfulneſs and Speed to amend it:</hi> If now the <hi>Elder or Elders</hi> of the Church ſhould be ſo remiſs as <hi>not to communicate</hi> their Admonition, or ſhould actually be <hi>in Fault themſelves,</hi> the <hi>offended Church</hi> ſhould <hi>acquaint</hi> the Brethren of <hi>the Church</hi> offending with the Fault and <hi>exhort them to call upon their Elders to take heed that they fulfil their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry which they have received of the LORD:</hi> If the Church ſhall <hi>hear</hi> the Admonition and remove the Scandal, the Proceſs ſtops: But, if the <hi>corrupt and peccant Church hear not their Brethren;</hi> the Church, which has bin offended and continues to be grieved, then <hi>takes the Help of two or three more Churches,</hi> that ſo <hi>the Admonition diſpenſed may by them be jointly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced:</hi> And, if the Church lying under public Offence ſtill <hi>perſiſt</hi> both in the <hi>Neglect of their Duty</hi> and their <hi>Slight of the good Counſel and Admonition</hi> of their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; <hi>thoſe Churches may forbear Communion</hi> with the offending Church in ſuch Exerciſes as Churches uſually maintain towards each other; and they are <hi>to make Uſe of the Help of a Synod or a large Council of</hi> Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Churches <hi>for their Conviction: And, if they bear not this Synod or Council, the Council or Synod having declared them</hi> obſtinate and impenitent in Scandal, <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches approving and accepting the Judgment of the Synod</hi> or Council, <hi>are to declare the Sentence of Non-Communion reſpectively concerning them, and thereupon, out of a religious Care to keep their own Communion pure, they may juſtly withdraw themſelves from Participation with them at the LORD'S Table and from ſuch other Acts of Fellowſhip as are otherwiſe allow'd and required by the Communion of Churches:</hi> But however due Care
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:004275_0152_100433650951E8F8"/>is to be taken in ſuch a Proceſs, that the <hi>Innocent may not ſuffer with the Offenſive:</hi> For, while the <hi>peccant Party is to be deprived of the Privilege of Communion</hi> with theſe Churches, thoſe particular Members of the offending Church, <hi>who do not conſent to the Offence of the Church but in due Sort bear their Teſtimony againſt it, may be received to wonted Communion in the Churches, and, after due Waiting in the Uſe of Means for healing the Offence of the Church, may withdraw from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of their own Church, with the Allowance of the Council of Neighbour Churches, and upon offering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Communion of another Church, may be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully received by that Church,</hi> as if they had bin regularly diſmiſs'd unto them from their own Church continuing ſtill in Offence.</p>
               <p>This is what is commonly called <hi>the third Way of Communion</hi> in theſe Churches, but it would be better underſtood perhaps, if we called it <hi>the Way of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion by Admonition.</hi> It muſt be acknowleged to the Glory of GOD our SAVIOUR, that, altho' this Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plinary Proceſs has bin <hi>ſeveral Times undertook</hi> with offending Churches, theſe Churches have but <hi>rarely bin put to the utmoſt Extent of their Duty:</hi> For there has hardly bin a Church ſo daringly wicked as to hold out in maintaining the Corruptions and Offences found among them: But, whenever it does fall out, it is as <hi>much the Duty of theſe Churches</hi> thus to be faithful to each other as it is <hi>the Duty of Brethren</hi> in the ſame Church or Communion to be faithful to one another: For <hi>theſe Churches enjoy Brotherly Communion with one another,</hi> as well as Brethren of the ſame Church. The Apoſtles had <hi>the Care of all the Churches:</hi> But it is to be hoped, that <hi>the public Spirit of Love and Peace and Chriſtian Faithfulneſs is not dead</hi> with them: There is not, it is true, <hi>ſo much of this Spirit</hi> as there ought to be: But, wherever it reſides or reigns in Churches, they will <hi>have a watchful Eye over other Churches</hi> for their Benefit, and a tender Care and Concern for their
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:004275_0153_1004336A1DD3A690"/>beſt Intereſts, and <hi>will purſue the ſame in the Diſcipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Method,</hi> which has bin deſcribed, as there ſhall be Occaſion for it.</p>
               <p>I am very ſenſible, that many Perſons, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>Clergymen,</hi> are <hi>averſe to a Compliance</hi> in the leaſt <hi>with this Proceſs of Diſcipline,</hi> and that for this Reaſon; becauſe they do not know any ſuch Thing as <hi>a Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of Churches</hi> among us: So that, inaſmuch as they do not know that there is <hi>any expreſs Agreement of the Churches to conform to ſuch a Proceſs,</hi> they cannot think that <hi>every Church is obliged to regard the Determination of a Synod</hi> in ſuch a Caſe.</p>
               <p>In Anſwer to which Pretence, I would ſay, that it is doubtleſs a Miſtake to declare, that there is no ſuch Thing as a <hi>Conſociation of Churches</hi> among us: For our <hi>Platform of Church-Diſcipline is to be deemed a Covenant,</hi> by which all our Churches and every Member in them is obliged to conform to the Rules, Directions and Orders laid down in it: And for the Proof of this I would obſerve, that <hi>this Platform was compoſed by theſe Churches</hi> in a Body Repreſentative: So that the plain Senſe and Meaning of the Compoſers muſt be, that they <hi>engaged to conform to the Rules and Orders</hi> of it, and that they would <hi>have their Succeſſors,</hi> as well as themſelves, directed and governed by them. Nor can I help obſerving, that <hi>Approbation <note n="(u)" place="bottom">This muſt not be underſtood, as if they abſolutely bound themſelves to a perpetual Conformity unto it: For out pious Fathers <hi>renounced all Attachment to any more humane Syſtems or Forms, and reſerved an entire and perpetual Liberty</hi> for particular Chriſtians and particular Churches <hi>to ſearch the inſpired Records and to form both their Principles and Practice from thoſe Diſcoveries they ſhould make therein, without impoſing them upon others;</hi> as you may ſee by conſulting <hi>the New-England Chronology</hi> of the ingenious Mr. PRINCE: I have refer'd to the Pages in the Appendix to this Apology.</note> of our Platform was voted unanimouſly by the Elders and Brethren of our Churches;</hi> and <hi>there was not ſo much as one appear'd,
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:004275_0154_1004336CCEF79AA0"/>when the Vote was put in the</hi> Negative <hi>in the Synod</hi> on Sept. 10.1679.</p>
               <p>And beſides, that <hi>this Order of Church-Diſcipline is to be deemed an holy Pact or Covenant,</hi> we may argue <hi>from thoſe Synods and Councils which have met here by Vertue of it and maintained conſtant Fellowſhip in many foederal overt Acts:</hi> For, from theſe foederal overt Acts of Councils and Synods from Time to Time, it is pretty manifeſt, that <hi>theſe Churches have all along main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained their firſt Principles</hi> of Church-Diſcipline <hi>and ſo have tranſmitted the Covenant which they made</hi> to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Generations.</p>
               <p>Furthermore; It may be remarked, that in the <hi>Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of new Churches, in the Ordination of Officers in the ſame Churches, and in giving the Right Hand of Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip,</hi> of the Fellowſhip of the Churches, from Time to Time, theſe Churches have ſo often plainly, ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantly and formally <hi>renewed their Original Pact or Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it may, moreover, be mention'd, that even <hi>ſuch Perſons, as have made this Objection, when they can find any Thing in our</hi> Platform of Church-Diſcipline <hi>ſuited to their own Humours and Inclinations</hi> and that will be ſerviceable for a Turn or emergent Occaſion, are very <hi>ready to cite, improve and conform to</hi> it: And this ſeems to afford ſome Evidence, as if they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves look'd upon it as a <hi>ſtanding</hi> and general <hi>Compact,</hi> until the Churches ſhall agree to alter it.</p>
               <p>Theſe Hints are ſufficient to render it probable, and more than probable, that there is here a <hi>Conſociation of Churches,</hi> and that between theſe Churches there is ſtill <hi>as mutual Confoederation:</hi> But, if to pleaſe ſome of our good Brethren it ſhould be allow'd, that there is <hi>no ſuch Compact</hi> between theſe Churches, <hi>nor any Conſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of them; ſtill it may be proved with Eaſe, that <hi>ſuch a Proceſs of Diſcipline,</hi> as has but now bin ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, <hi>ought to be obſerved in theſe Churches.</hi>
               </p>

                  <pb n="138" facs="unknown:004275_0155_1004336E53F786C8"/>
I ſhall not here cice any Authority for the Proof of this; intending in an Appendix to this Book to reprint ſomething referring to this Matter from Dr. INCREASE MATHER'S, my Grandfather's, <hi>Vindication of the Order of the Churches in</hi> New-England; but I ſhall briefly mention a Conſideration or two, which will be ſufficient to <hi>eſtabliſh this Proceſs of Diſcipline</hi> in the good Opinion of all ſuch as are the true Friends of theſe Churches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt of all;</hi> This Proceſs is entirely <hi>agreable to the Nature and Deſign of the Goſpel,</hi> as well as the Reaſon of Mankind: For what is it for <hi>one Church to admoniſh another</hi> on the Account of ſomething judg'd to be amiſs in their Society? It is only for a Neighbour <hi>Miniſter,</hi> or Elder, with a few of his <hi>Chriſtian Brethren</hi> to pay a Viſit to the Neighbour Church and humbly adviſe and exhort them to <hi>ſeek for the Reſtoration of Peace and to rectify their Errors whether in Judgment or Action.</hi> How rational and how Evangelical is this Method? What Aſſuming, what Domineering is there to be found in this? Truely, notwithſtanding the frightful Dreſs in which this Proceſs is repreſented, there is <hi>nothing more Authoritative in it, than one Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's admoniſhing</hi> another, according to the Rules of the Goſpel as well as of right Reaſon.</p>
               <p>Again; This Method is <hi>well calculated for preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Reputation and Honour of particular Churches:</hi> For, as <hi>particular Chriſtians,</hi> ſo <hi>particular Churches,</hi> are but <hi>Men</hi> and by Conſequence are <hi>liable to Errors:</hi> But yet, as all Chriſtians make an high Profeſſion and therefore ſhould be careful leſt there ſhould be any ſlur upon it; even ſo all <hi>particular Churches,</hi> which are <hi>corporate Societies</hi> making a ſplendid Profeſſion of Chriſtianity, <hi>ought carefully to maintain their Social Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour:</hi> And therefore, as with <hi>particular Chriſtian Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> ſo with <hi>particular Churches,</hi> fallen into Errors and Scandals, it would be wrong and injurious to take <hi>at once precipitate and open Meaſures:</hi> Nor indeed would <hi>expoſing their Character openly</hi> at firſt be either a <hi>regular
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:004275_0156_1004336FF55E6A20"/>or a probable Method of effecting their Amendment:</hi> Wherefore, in order to preſerve the Reputation and Honour of theſe Churches, <hi>it is vaſtly better,</hi> I mean more <hi>rational and ſcriptural,</hi> in the <hi>firſt</hi> place, <hi>to follow this private Method,</hi> to which by our Conſtitution alſo we are directed, than <hi>as the Manner of ſome is</hi> to bring the Affairs of a Church <hi>before a Council and to a public Hearing at once.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, in fine, If <hi>this Diſciplinary Method be not care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully obſerved, theſe Churches have no Remedy at all againſt Male-Adminiſtrations in particular Churches:</hi> For I cannot find, that by the Conſtitution of theſe Churches the <hi>Power of calling Councils belongs to any particular Perſons</hi> in them, but to the <hi>Churches them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:</hi> So that, according to this Conſtitution, if there be <hi>Male-Adminiſtration in any particular Church, the Aggrieved Members of it may not convoke ſuch Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies:</hi> But they ſhould deſire the Advice and Aſſiſtance of a Neighbour Church: And, unleſs <hi>one particular Church interpoſe</hi> in this State of Things and enquire into the Caſe in <hi>the Way of Communion by Admonition,</hi> particular <hi>Churches may remain at eternal Variance within themſelves</hi> without ſhewing our Diſlike of their Proceedings: For there is <hi>no other Proceſs</hi> that we know of in the publiſh'd Order of our Churches, by which we can <hi>teſtify againſt them, but in this Diſcipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Method.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, after all, ſome of our good Brethren will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue diſpleaſed with this Proceſs of Diſcipline <hi>from a peaccable Diſpoſition,</hi> as ſhould ſeem from their Diſcourſe about it: For they ſay, that <hi>they cannot by any means approve of this Diſciplinary Method; becauſe the Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of it will occaſion great Diſturbance and Confuſion in Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, for Anſwer to theſe Perſons, it may be <hi>worth the while to expoſtulate</hi> a little with them: Say then. Dear Brethren, <hi>why do you think that this Proceſs ſhould occaſion more Trouble and Conſuſion</hi> than <hi>the
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:004275_0157_10043373DAB19288"/>Method of calling a Council by a few particular Perſons, or even by one Perſon,</hi> diſſatisfied or aggrieved? Or is it, becauſe your own <hi>Adminiſtrations have bin irregular or-unſuitable,</hi> that you are therefore diſaffected to this Proceſs, from a prevalent <hi>Fear of Examination</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it? However, is not <hi>this Diſciplinary Method</hi> ſo <hi>plainly preſcribed</hi> in the Conſtitution of particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational Churches that we muſt be <hi>Browniſts</hi> or Nothing if we recede from it? And, in fine, if it ſhould be ſo, as you ſay, that <hi>Churches will be diſturbed in the Proſecution of this Method;</hi> yet can we ſuppoſe, that <hi>ſome Diſturbance of the Churches in a ſleepy and indolent State</hi> would be amiſs and undeſirable, <hi>if a more eſtabliſh'd Order and a more comely Amendment may be occaſion'd</hi> thro' this Diſturbance in the Churches? Pray, dear Brethren, anſwer theſe Queſtions <hi>in the Spirit of Meekneſs,</hi> as they are propoſed; that ſo, if our Fathers erred in the Preſcription of this Method, the Churches may regularly uſe their Endeavours to get their Error rectified.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole, and from the beſt Obſervations which I have bin able to make; I am free to declare my Apprehenſion, and I hope my Brethren will not be offended with me for making this Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that <hi>the Neglect and Slight of this Rule of Diſcipline by the Paſtors and Churches in this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment has bin the true Reaſon,</hi> if not the ſole Cauſe, <hi>of the Diſturbances and Confuſions in many of our Churches,</hi> and that, as the great VOET obſerved with reſpect to the <hi>Want of Correſpondence among the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, I fear it much: Time will ſhew what will happen, when the Number of Churches is greatly encreaſed, and one will not bear another</hi>

                  <hi>THE CONCLUSION,</hi> in a brief Addreſs to the Churches of <hi>NEW-ENGLAND.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THUS I have endeavoured to ſtate and vindicate the more diſtinguiſhing Liberties of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in <hi>New-England.</hi> As <hi>theſe Privileges</hi> have bin <hi>purchaſed by the Blood of the LORD JESUS,</hi> they <hi>ought to be very precious in our Eſteem,</hi> nor upon any Pretence whatſoever to be ſlighted and undervalued by the <hi>happy People</hi> who enjoy them.</p>
               <p>It is worthy to be always remembred by theſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, that it was not on the Account of any <hi>peculiar Sentiments in Doctrinal Matters</hi> that our wiſe and good Fathers left their Native Countrey and came into this then howling Wilderneſs: For they agreed to the <hi>Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinal Articles of the Church of</hi> England <hi>as much as the</hi> Conformiſts <hi>to that Parliamentary Church,</hi> and indeed much more ſo than moſt of them: But it was from a <hi>pure Reſpect to Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline and Order and to a more refined Worſhip,</hi> that thoſe excellent Men our Anceſtors tranſported themſelves, with their Families, into this Land.</p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as far as in them lies, have <hi>diveſted our great SAVIOUR of His Prophetical, Sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotal and Kingly Offices: Other Churches</hi> have bin ſo far overcome by the Light of Reaſon and Revelation, that they have reſtored as one may ſay <hi>His Sacerdotal Office</hi> to Him and <hi>His Prophetical Office</hi> olſo: But our graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Predeceſſors, obſerving that their Brethen in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> were not willing to allow our Lord JESUS CHRIST to be <hi>the King and Ruler of His Church,</hi> nobly reſolv'd,
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:004275_0160_1004337D729E2910"/>as <hi>the Children of</hi> Zion, <hi>to acknowlege and rejoyce in their King:</hi> And hence they quitted their ungrateful Countrey, that ſo they might obſerve that <hi>refin'd Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Order</hi> which their LORD and Sovereign had in His Word appointed to be obſerved.</p>
               <p>It follows therefore, that any <hi>Degeneracies from the pure Worſhip and Scriptural Order</hi> in theſe Churches would be a direct <hi>Rejection of the Kingly Authority of CHRIST JESUS, and a Means of ſetting up another King or Captain to lead us backward, in the Steps we have taken from</hi> Babylon, <hi>towards it</hi> again: May GOD of His rich Grace therefore preſerve theſe Churches from any ſuch Degeneracies!</p>
               <p>It is evident indeed, that great Pains are taken to <hi>draw our People,</hi> eſpecially our inconſiderate <hi>young People,</hi> who are too unmindful of the King and GOD of their Fathers, <hi>from their Love and Attachment to thoſe firſt Principles of theſe Churches,</hi> which I have bin ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining and enforcing: But, as NABOTH ſaid to AHAB concerning his Vineyard, in 1 King. XXI. 3, <hi>The LORD forbid it me, that I ſhould give the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of my Fathers unto Thee;</hi> even ſo it is fit, that we ſhould ſay to ſuch as would entice us to part with the pure Order of theſe Churches, <hi>This was our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Inheritance:</hi> And GOD forbid, that any ſhould perſuade us to give up our ineſtimable Rights: For the very Thought of parting with them is ſhocking.</p>
               <p>Dear People, The Liberties, which have bin chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leng'd for you, are the ſame as the Brethren in the Times of primitive Chriſtianity enjoyed for <hi>hundreds of Years</hi> together: And, whatever ſpecious Pretences ſome may make to the contrary, the <hi>Diſpoſſeſſing of the Brethren</hi> of theſe their valuable Liberties was a <hi>conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Inſtance of the Romiſh Apoſtocy:</hi> And indeed they have but a ſlender Acquaintance with Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory who do not know, that <hi>the Riſe of Popery</hi> was owing to the <hi>People's tamely giving up their Rights and Privileges,</hi> either thro' Ignorance or Imprudence, <hi>to
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:004275_0161_1004337EF662E1D0"/>the Clergy,</hi> who unreaſonably engroſs'd to themſelves and graſp'd in their own Clutches all Things in the Churches that were of any Worth and Importance.</p>
               <p>There can be no Doubt, that there are many who are <hi>ſworn and inveterate Enemies to the pure Order</hi> in theſe Churches; and, beſides theſe, we have Reaſon to think that there are <hi>many falſe Friends</hi> to it; by which Sort I mean thoſe that <hi>pretend ſome Regard to the Order of the Goſpel</hi> in theſe Churches, but yet at the ſame Time <hi>would gladly ſubvert it:</hi> And it is well, if there are not <hi>ſundry Miniſters</hi> in theſe Churches, who are diſaffected to it: For, as LUTHER has ſomewhere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark'd concerning <hi>Religion, Nunquam magis pericli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur quam inter Reverendiſſimos;</hi> ſo it may be ſaid with reſpect to <hi>the Order</hi> in theſe Churches: <hi>Probably it may be in moſt Danger from ſome of the</hi> Reverend Body.— But ſurely all ſuch in theſe Churches are very unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed and blameworthy: And, if they are not duely <hi>ſenſible of the Tendency of their Diſaffection and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings,</hi> it is a Pity but their Brethren ſhould, and carefully guard againſt them. And truely there cannot any Good be expected from them: For, as they do not produce a <hi>better Diſcipline and purer Order</hi> for our Churches in the Room of that, which they unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly diſlike and would throw away; ſo, if they could produce and offer a <hi>better Order,</hi> which indeed is very unlikely, there is no rational Proſpect of its gaining Ground among us, but with that <hi>Diſturbance and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſion in our Churches,</hi> of which they at other Times are exceedingly fearful. But,</p>
               <p>Theſe Enemies to our <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline and Order</hi> ſeem as if they knew not what they would have. The Scheme, which they would promote, is very far from <hi>Preſbyterial:</hi> For, if one may judge by their Conduct, they ſeem to be fond of <hi>one Miniſter's Ruling and Governing his own Church</hi> without the Conſent of the Brethren or any Elders in Conjunction with him: Whereas the <hi>London</hi> Miniſters, in their <hi>Vindication of
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:004275_0162_10043381AFB72620"/>the Preſbyterial Government,</hi> ſay, that <hi>for one Miniſter to aſſume ſuch Power unto himſelf is to make himſelf a</hi> Congregational Pope.—Dear Brethren, let not theſe <hi>petty Popes</hi> then deprive you of your juſt Rights and invaluable Privileges: But, like your worthy Anceſtors, continue fond of them: For it will be creditable and praiſe-worthy not to let them go: And it will, in the Style of PLINY, be <hi>a moſt honeſt Thing to follow the Footſteps of our Anceſtors, if they have gone before us in a right Path <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Honeſtiſſimum Majorum Veſtigia Sequi, ſi recto I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And, if any upon the Sight of Theſe ſhould want to ſee the Remainder of the Letter, I would here acquaint them, that I have it in my Library and ſhall he ready to give them the Sight of it. The Paragraphs are as follow:</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter">
                     <body>
                        <p>—Give me Leave, Sir, to acquaint you, that I am now <hi>in a Countrey,</hi> which has bin a friendly <hi>Aſylum</hi> to me: It gave me a kind Reception, when my Native Land did in a Manner puſh me out. — It's my humble Petition to your Honour, that you would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a vigorous Patron for the People of GOD in theſe remote Lands. — GOD has <hi>a great People</hi> here, an <hi>able and pious Miniſtry,</hi> and a great many <hi>well order'd Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</hi> Their <hi>Church Government</hi> is <hi>interpendant,</hi> as their witty Mr. WARD called it. — I have bin called to ſome of their <hi>Councils</hi> and have ſeen their good Effect in healing the Breaches of diſturbed Churches. Their <hi>Ordination</hi> to the public Miniſtry is ſolemn by the Paſtors of Neighbour Churches: And, tho' their Cuſtom has bin a new Impoſition of Hands upon every new Call to the Exerciſe of the Miniſtry; yet to us, who came from <hi>Europe,</hi> Mr. BAYLEY and myſelf, it was abated. And, for ought I can perceive, <hi>they mind more the Subſtance of Religion than the Circumſtances of ſome Men's private Opinions <note n="(x)" place="bottom">It was principally for the Sake of this Paſſage in <hi>Iralic,</hi> that I have tranſcribed ſuch a Part of this Letter.</note>.</hi> Their <hi>public Worſhip</hi> in Praying, Singing and Preaching is plain, but grave and ſolemn, and, I hope, ſincere. — The Influence of a Religious Profeſſion upon common and outward Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation is very great: So that lewd Profaneneſs did never openly appear, till a wretched Crew of Frigateers and Red Coats came among us. — I write not all this,
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:004275_0166_1004338DC534C768"/>as if Men were here perfect: For then there were no need of Magiſtracy, Miniſtry or Goſpel Ordinances for their Edification: But certainly, Sir, if GOD has a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple on the Face of the Earth and any Part of the World may be called <hi>Emanuel</hi>'s <hi>Land, New-England</hi> may well put in for a notable Share in that Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. — If your Honour will afford your Aſſiſtance to theſe Gentlemen, I hope you will never have Cauſe to repent it. GOD has heretofore bleſſed the Friends of <hi>New-England</hi> and blaſted all her Adverſaries. May the GOD of Heaven ſo eſtabliſh your Affairs, as may raiſe the Hopes of us your Dependants! May His Wiſdom guide your Counſels and His Power be your Protection, that we with you may rejoyce in the LORD. So daily prayeth your Honour's moſt humble and many Ways obliged Servant,</p>

                  <p>THe next Teſtimony ſhall be from my own Father, who, in a Letter to Mr. FRANCIS DE LA PILLONNIERE, which was printed in <hi>The Occaſional Paper,</hi> but never printed and generally known in <hi>New-England,</hi> writes in the following Manner.</p>
                  <p>—The Truth is, the Reformation that came on, when the <hi>Romiſh Antichriſt</hi> had paſs'd thro' his Time, and his <hi>Two Times,</hi> and was entering into his <hi>Half-Time,</hi> was little better than an <hi>Half-Reformation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Reforming Churches, flying from <hi>Rome,</hi> carried, ſome of them more, ſome of them leſs, all of them ſomething, of <hi>Rome,</hi> with them; eſpecially in that Spirit of <hi>Impoſition,</hi> and <hi>Perſecution,</hi> which has too much cleaved unto them ALL.</p>
                  <p>The Period haſtens for a <hi>New Reformation;</hi> wherein 'tis likely that our holy Lord will, in ſome Degree,
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:004275_0167_1004338F5E1C6790"/>reject ALL the <hi>Parties</hi> of Chriſtians at this Day in the World; and form a NEW PEOPLE of the good Men in the <hi>ſeveral Parties,</hi> who ſhall unite in the Articles of their Goodneſs, and ſweetly bear with one another in their leſſer Differences; leaving each other to the Divine Illuminations.</p>
                  <p>PIETY will anon be the only <hi>Baſis of Union,</hi> in the Churches of the revived, refined, reformed Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and pious Men, in ſeveral Forms, will come to Love, and live, as Brethren; and the purged Floor of our Saviour will be viſited with Tokens of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, that ſhall be very comfortable.</p>
                  <p>It is thus very much in my Country; and therefore, Sir, if <hi>Old England</hi> prove too torrid a Climate for you, come over to <hi>New-England,</hi> where I will do my beſt, that you ſhall be treated with more Chriſtian Civilities.</p>
                  <p>But I hope that our Lord will find greater Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for you in <hi>Europe,</hi> than can be expected on the Weſtern Side of the <hi>Atlantick.</hi> He has qualify'd you for them, and, I hope, what you have ſeen among ſome very <hi>Defective Proteſtants</hi> will animate you to them.</p>
                  <p>Being my ſelf a <hi>Calviniſt,</hi> I muſt needs differ pretty much from a Gentleman who profeſſes himſelf an <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minian.</hi> But I conſider what thoſe <hi>Maxims of Piety</hi> are, which engage the <hi>Arminian</hi> to maintain his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing Poſitions. Thoſe Maxims are, <hi>That</hi> the Holy and Sin-hating Lord muſt not be reproach'd as the Impeller of the Sin, whereof he is the <hi>Revenger: That</hi> our Merciful Father muſt not be blaſphemed, as if He dealt after an illuſory manner with Men, when He invites them to His Mercy: <hi>That</hi> none, among the Fallen Race of the <hi>Firſt Adam,</hi> are to be ſhut out from the Hopes of Life, in the Death of the <hi>Second Adam: That</hi> impenitent Unbelievers muſt not caſt on God the Blame of their Unbelief; but the Wicked muſt lay wholly on themſelves the Fault of their own Deſtruction: And, <hi>That</hi> Men muſt work out their
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:004275_0168_10043390E4986880"/>own Salvation with as much Induſtry, and Agony, and Vigilancy, as if all turned upon their own Will and Care, whether they ſhall be ſaved, or no. Now, theſe are <hi>Maxims,</hi> which every pious <hi>Calviniſt</hi> will alſo moſt heartily conſent unto. And, if I ſhould repeat the <hi>Maxims of Piety,</hi> which make me fall in with the Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a <hi>Calviniſt,</hi> as requiſite unto the ſupporting of them. I am confident the pious Mr. <hi>de la Pillonniere</hi> would moſt heartily ſubſcribe unto them. And we ſhall both of us have the Modeſty to confeſs, that we have alſo to do with Matters which are to us incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible. Now, if good Men are ſo united in the <hi>Maxims,</hi> which are the END, for the ſerving whereof they declare that they purſue their Controverſies; why ſhould not this <hi>Uniting Piety</hi> put an End unto their Controverſies? and beat <hi>their Swords into Plough-Shares, and their Spears into Pruning-Hooks?</hi>

                        <p>THAT amongſt ſo many horrid Alarms of War, amongſt ſo many fatal Differences of Opinion raiſed in Matters of Religion, and that alſo after ſo many, and ſuch unwearied Labours of famous Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, now ſo often in this Cauſe undertaken in vain; you ſhould O <hi>Dury,</hi> the moſt zealous Friend of Peace, not only be ſeriouſly thinking of, but are alſo unto this Day ſtrongly endeavouring the Eſpouſals of Truth and Peace between the Profeſſors of the Goſpel; we verily do largely congratulate you in the conceiving ſo great a Deſign, with our utmoſt, and daily Prayers, helping forward (by God's Aſſiſtance) the Birth of this Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child. Suffer us to ſpeak the very Truth of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor is there any need to deny the ſame: Even as the Holy Scripture relates how the Olive Branch, brought much Comfort to the Parent of the other World after the Flood, while he was lamenting over the Tremendous Spectacle of the Deluge overflowing all here below; in like Manner did your Letter, breathing a very Spirit of Peace, as another <hi>Noah</hi>'s Dove, ſent down from Heaven, wonderfully refreſh the exile Brethren, who were almoſt aſtoniſhed to ſee ſo
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:004275_0170_100406B2A552DEE0"/>many Nations, that profeſs the Goſpel, making irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable War amongſt themſelves, together with the many and great Diſſentions in the Buſineſs of Religion, and that monſtrous Flood of Error breaking forth, not out of the Cataracts of the Clouds, but the very Mouth of the Dragon.</p>
                        <p>Be it ſo, that we are in the utmoſt Parts of the Earth; we have only changed our Climate, not our Minds: We have altered our Place, that we might retain the Faith without alteration. There are indeed ſome, that might have been better employed, at leaſt meer Strangers to our Affairs, who do therefore impute unto us the Guilt of Schiſm, becauſe in the firſt Place we have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured after the pure Worſhip of God. But if any ſee good to enquire into the Reaſon, why theſe Churches in the Wilderneſs left their Country, this it was, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Ancient Faith, and pure Worſhip, might be found inſeparable Companions in our Practice, and that our Poſterity might be undefiled in Religion: Nevertheleſs, we are never unmindful of the Saying of <hi>Auſtin</hi> to the Brethren in the Wilderneſs, as he ſtyles them; <hi>There are two Things conſiderable,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Conſcience and good Name: Conſcience as neceſſary for thy ſelf, good Name for thy Neighbour:</hi> He who truſts to his Conſcience, and neglects his good Name, is cruel, eſpecially if he be ſet in that Place, of which the Apoſtle writing to his Diſciple, ſaith, <hi>In all Things ſhew thy ſelf an Example of good Works.</hi> It may not be unlawful for us, who are in the Wilderneſs on the further ſide of the Seas, as well as thoſe, who through Grace are called to the Miniſtry, though in our ſelves the greateſt of Sinners, and the leaſt of all the Saints, as any others, to Apologize for our ſelves in the Words of the Tribes beyond Jordan a little changed, for the vindicating or preſerving our good Name in a Matter of ſo great Moment, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore great ones, Fathers, Brethren, and every gentle Reader, <hi>The Lord God of Gods, the Lord God of Gods he knows, and Iſrael ſhall know, if wittingly and willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                        <p>But yet notwithſtanding, we are not unmindful of that ſo known Oracle, <hi>[Love the Truth and Peace:]</hi> We neither ſtrive for Truth without making Reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Peace, neither do we purſue Peace with the Loſs of Truth: The former defaceth, this latter teareth the ſeamleſs Coat of the Church.

We are no whit pleaſed with <hi>Caſſanders</hi> ſhak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hands with Papiſts at the furtheſt Diſtance, erring from the Truth; nor yet with the Romaniſt renouncing Communion with them that are otherwiſe minded in leſſer Differences: But in ſpecial Manner we ought to labour, that we may walk with an even Foot, and not to turn aſide an Hair's breadth from the Truth: In the mean Time, it is better to be a <hi>Cyprian</hi> than a <hi>Steven.</hi> It is much more grievous to think aright, and be found a Schiſmatick, than to think amiſs in Things not funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, and be of a peaceable Spirit. The Spirit of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt is a Spirit of Truth, of Peace and Communion: So deſirous of Peace, that it requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth Communion in a true Church, although not pure; and ſo deſirous of Truth, that it forbids impurity in any Church whatſoever. That, that is the Mark at which we aim, and which we endeavour and breath after, in him who is <hi>the Way, the Truth and Life.</hi>

                        <p>It is confeſſed, there are ſome <hi>Apices,</hi> or leſſer Points in Divinity, which the Church of God hath now for above an hundred Years bewailed, as the obſtacles of Peace, concerning which the chief Controverſies main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained

About theſe Points how many thouſand Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick Writings have been extant all abroad, which the Chriſtian World is ſcarce able to contain? Alas! that ever there ſhould be a War about the Sacrament! Alas! that ever there ſhould be any contentious Treatiſes about the Euchariſt, turning the very Badge of Union into an Apple of Contention! Who can refrain from Tears at the uttering of ſuch Things? Yet theſe not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, that there is Place for the ſo much deſired Coalition between the Evangelicks and the Reformed, ſo called, may eaſily be made appear, by running thro' the chief Heads of Things:</p>
                        <p>As namely, Becauſe in the firſt Article, they who were the greateſt Favourers of that eminent Worthy of the former Age, do yet aſcribe the Work of Converſion wholly unto God, and do likewiſe ſtifly maintain, and accurately defend, Grace to be altogether free; who were alſo utter Enemies to that peſtilent Opinion of the Schoolmen, <hi>[That God is bound to him that doth what he can of himſelf.]</hi> And who likewiſe do deſervedly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it meer Pelagianiſm, to make any kind of Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Fitneſs a Moral Motive unto predetermining Grace.</p>
                        <p>As for the Opinion of the Ubiquity of the Humane Nature, by Virtue of the Hypoſtatical Union; it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied, but that Papers have come abroad, written with too much Gall and ſharpneſs. In the mean while it is agreed upon by all, and taken for granted, That the Humane Nature is Perſonally Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipreſent. According to this Rule likewiſe are other Propoſitions about the Perſon to be judged of, under this Head.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, As concerning the Lord's Supper; the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines of either Part, do reject Tranſubſtantiation, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with worſhipping of Bread. But about the Real Preſence, <hi>viz.</hi> Sacramental, of the Body and Blood of Chriſt, it is agreed between both. Theſe ſo many and
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:004275_0173_1004339BF44B6BB0"/>great Differences, are to be accounted as ſo many Heart-griefs, altho' not to be numbred amongſt them which by the Apoſtle are called <hi>Unlearned Queſtions;</hi> yet we judge them not to be of that Moment, as to hinder the giving each other the Right Hand of Fellowſhip, or the Pledges of Eccleſiaſtical Brotherhood <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Tot &amp; talia Diſſidia tot fatemur Cordelia;—Tanti autem eſſe, quo minus dextras daretur jungere Dextris, &amp; mutua audire &amp; red ere Fraternitatis Eccleſiaſtica Symbola, minime judicamus.</note>, building upon that Apoſtolical Canon of holy Communion, <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, in that whereunto we have attained, let us walk by the ſame Rule, let us mind the ſame Thing,</hi> Phil. 3.16.

                        <p>We account it very unequal to faſten upon any one that holds an Opinion all the Conſectaries, which to him that argues according to the exacteſt Grounds of Reaſon, ſeem to follow upon ſuch Premiſes, eſpecially if thoſe Conſequences be diſowned by him: In which reſpect there are no ſmall Errors on both Sides, while thoſe of our Side impeach the other of <hi>Eutyches</hi> his Opinion, tho' refuſing to own it, for the ſake of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation; and they on the other Side go about to make ours guilty of making God the Author of Sin, altho' we never ſo much diſclaim it, in the Point of Predeſtination. The Diſputes about the Conſequences of theſe, whether rightly inferred or not, from the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, belong not to this Place to be examined, yea the Matter itſelf requires rather that we ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear.</p>
                        <p>But this Tragedy is not yet at an End. For, as to Polity, and indifferent Things, they have taken up divers Opinions; who it were to be wiſhed that they would embrace that Concord one with another, which
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:004275_0174_100433A108CFB4F0"/>hath been ſo often endeavoured after. But the Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of this Nature, as they are not ſo ſmall, that the Lovers of Truth ſhould be ſilent about them; ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are they ſo great, that they need be any hindrance to the Seekers of Peace and Quietneſs in the preſent Undertaking; as may appear by the unqueſtioned Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of our Saviour, who refuſed not to celebrate the Worſhip of God in the Jewiſh Church, defaced at that Time with more grievous Corruptions. They who are united to Chriſt by Heart-converting Grace, are Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his Myſtical Body; and whoſoever, but in appearance at leaſt, are joyned to the Head, and have added themſelves to the Polity of Iſrael, are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Members of the Political Body. Now Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion follows upon Union. Beſides the Nature of Political, as well as Chriſtian Society, doth utterly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid to deny the Privileges of Fellowſhip to ſuch Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers as are found without Scandal.</p>
                        <p>Thus much we thought good to ſpeak briefly about this Point, that Honoured Perſons, and Reſpected Brethren, might underſtand what Reaſons moved us to entertain the ſame Opinion with themſelves. We have been taught, that <hi>the Idea, or Pattern of holy Communion ought to be fetched from Divine Writ, and not to be framed after our own Pleaſure <note n="(b)" place="bottom">Communion is Sanctae Ideam a Divina Pagina petendam, non pro Arbitrio noſtro cudendam didicimus.</note>.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Rules of Sacred Society are certain; beyond which, or ſhort of which, it is not in our Power to extend, or withold the Right Hand of Brotherhood. Whoever having attained theſe ſhall acknowledge them; and having acknowledged them, ſhall walk according unto them; ſo holding Communion with Sinners, as he doth not in the leaſt communicate with their Sins, ſo as he is wanting neither to the Truth, nor to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, nor his Brethren, him we deſervedly eſteem both as a Guide and Pillar of the Church: Whether we will
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:004275_0175_100433A3BB405D90"/>or no, we are Brethren; and ſeeing we are Brethren, let us acknowledge our ſelves what we are, namely, <hi>Brethren in the Lord.</hi> A Day would ſcarce ſuffice, to rehearſe how many and how great incitements do call for, and require this. To account the weak in Faith for none, is indeed itſelf a greater Weakneſs. The Name of Brethren is ſweet: It is Matter of great Delight to be ſuch indeed. But it is much to be lamented, that thoſe who are ſo, ſhould not be acknowledged to be ſo. <hi>So to ſtand for Truth, that by too tenacious inſiſting upon Doctrine, we make no reckoning of the Rights of Society, is to be carried with the Study of Parties, not of the Truth <note n="(c)" place="bottom">Veritatem item Operam dare, ut Doctrinae tenacius inhae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendo Societatis Jura ſuſque deque faciamus, eſt Partes ager's non veritati ſtudere.</note>;</hi> and to undertake the Patronage of an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, rather becauſe it is our own, than becauſe it is true.</p>
                        <p>Sounder Philoſophy determines, that the excellency of Union is to be eſteemed according to the Dignity of the Cauſe. We here paſs over in Silence the conſpiring together of the Waters and dry Land to make one Globe; as alſo that of the Frame of the Heavenly and the Earthly Globe, to make one Sphere of the World. There may be found an heap of Miracles in the quiet gathering the living Creatures into the Ark, and there abiding in it, where the moſt ſavage of them laid aſide their ſavageneſs; being ready to acknowledge <hi>Noah</hi> for their Lord (not much otherwiſe than <hi>Adam</hi> in giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Names unto them) where might be ſeen the Wolf ſtanding amongſt the Sheep, neither do the Flocks ſeem afraid of the great Lyons: Theſe are indeed very great Things; but yet if they be compared with the Myſtical Union, ſhining forth in one of the very leaſt of Chriſt's Members, there would want Words to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs how great the Diſtance is. To proceed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if the Union of a very few Believers be of ſo
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:004275_0176_100406B6D0F73B30"/>great Moment, of how great Account ſhould be the Uniting of all Proteſtants in the Faith? But let here pauſe a while, and not think much to weigh this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a little more ſeriouſly, and we ſhall find (unleſs we are much deceived) this very Union about which we are treating, if it be without Hypocriſy and Deceit, but as the very Off-ſpring and Image of the Hypoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Union, and only next unto it on Earth (as to the Kind) and like unto which there will not be found any in Heaven, no not when Angelical Nature remained in its Perfection.

               <head>Part the ſecond, containing <hi>the Proofs and Evidences of a Conſociation of Churches</hi> among theſe Churches for their mutual Light and Aſſiſtance.</head>
               <p>IN the <hi>twenty firſt</hi> Page of <hi>The Diſcourſe concerning Congregational Churches</hi> I have affirmed, that theſe Churches acknowledge <hi>a Conſociation of Churches for imparting mutual Light and Aſſiſtance:</hi> And in the <hi>Eighth</hi> Chapter of this Book I have maintain'd the ſame Thing. Now, for the more full Proof and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of this Point, I ſhall here reprint from my honoured Grandfather's Book, entitled, <hi>The Order of the Churches in</hi> New-England <hi>vindicated,</hi> his Anſwer to this Queſtion, <hi>Is it expedient that Churches ſhould enter into a Conſociation, or Agreement, that Matters of more than ordinary Importance, ſuch as the Gathering of a New Church, the Ordination, Depoſition, or Tranſlation of a Paſtor be done with common Conſent?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is both Expedient and Neceſſary. The <hi>Synod</hi> which Convened at <hi>Boſton</hi> Anno 1662. has ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently cleared this Point. And although there was in
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:004275_0185_100433BBD620DB20"/>that <hi>Synod</hi> ſome diſſent as to the <hi>Queſtion</hi> about the <hi>Subject of Baptiſm</hi> then diſcuſs'd; in the Anſwer to the other <hi>Queſtion</hi> relating to the <hi>Conſociation of Churches,</hi> there was an unanimous Concurrence. The Deſign of which is not (as has <hi>been</hi> well obſerved by Dr. <note n="(a)" place="bottom">

                  <hi>Parker</hi>) to infringe the Liberty of particular Churches, but from the Word of God to direct and ſtrengthen them in the regular Exerciſe thereof. The Reaſons for it are ſuch as theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Churches of Chriſt ſtand in a Siſterly Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion each to other under Chriſt their Head, having the ſame <hi>Faith,</hi> and ought to have the ſame <hi>Order. Eph.</hi> 4.5. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.16. This Union implies a ſuitable Communion, and that they ought to have a mutual Care each of other. <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.8.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Scripture teacheth that in weighty Caſes we ſhould aſk Counſel. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20.18. <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.5. and 15.22. and 24.6. Which General Rules concern <hi>Polities</hi> as well as particular Perſons, and Churches as well as civil Societies.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There are Scripture Examples to inſtruct us in our Duty herein. We find, that when the Church in <hi>Antioch</hi> had a weighty Caſe before them, they ſent to another Church for Counſel, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.2. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſought for the Concurrence, and <hi>Right Hand of Fellowſhip</hi> of other Apoſtles, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.9. Ordinary Elders and Churches have no leſs need of each other to prevent their <hi>running in vain. Gal.</hi> 2.2.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Such a Communion of Churches as that which we plead for, is no <hi>Innovation,</hi> but that which has ever been the Profeſſion and Practice of thoſe that have been called <hi>Congregational.</hi> There is a Book which bears the Title of, <hi>An Anſwer of the Elders of the ſeveral Churches in New-England to Thirty two Queſtions,</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Year 1643. Of which Book my Father

                  <hi>Mather</hi> was the ſole Author. And he wrote it in the Primitive Times of theſe Churches, (<hi>viz.</hi> in the Year 1639.) as himſelf aſſured me. What he wrote was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of by other Elders, eſpecially by Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> unto whom he communicated it. Now in Anſwer to Q. 18. <hi>p.</hi> 64. are theſe Words, <hi>The Conſociation of Churches into Claſſes and Synods, we hold to be lawful, and in ſome Caſes neceſſary: As namely, in Things that are not peculiar to one Church, but common to them all. And likewiſe, when a Church is not able to end any Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which concerns only themſelves, then they are to ſeek for Counſel and Advice from Neighbour Churches, as the Church at Antioch did ſend unto the Church at Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> Act. 15.2. <hi>The Ground and Uſe of</hi> Claſſes <hi>and</hi> Synods <hi>with the Limitations therein to be obſerved, is ſummarily laid down by Dr.</hi> Ames, <hi>unto whom we do wholly conſent in this Matter.</hi> This was, and is the Judgment of all that adhere to the <hi>Order of the Goſpel profeſſed</hi> in the <hi>Churches of New-England.</hi> The World is much miſtaken in thinking that <hi>Congregational</hi> Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are <hi>Independent.</hi> The Name has indeed been faſtned upon them by their Adverſaries; but our <hi>Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form of Diſcipline</hi> Chap. 2.

E. p. 28. &amp;c.</note> another Diſcourſe in which Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi>'s Propoſals reſpecting the <hi>Conſociation</hi> mentioned, are publiſh'd to the World. Moreover, that the concurring Judgment of thoſe who are <hi>Congregational</hi> is according hereunto is evident from the <hi>Declaration</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> which was agreed unto by the Meſſengers of One hundred and Twenty Congregational Churches in <hi>England,</hi> who met at the <hi>Savoy</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> Anno 1658.

<pb n="172" facs="unknown:004275_0189_100433C5CB1E9E60"/>unanſwerable. And who would be willing to be a Member of that Church, in which altho' he ſhould be never ſo much wrong'd, there would be no Relief for him upon Earth? There was once a Church in <hi>New-England,</hi> which having cenſured one of their Members, he complain'd of the ſuppoſed Wrong done him, to Neighbour Elders, who thought he had receiv'd hard Meaſure. The Paſtor and major part of the Church were not willing the Caſe ſhould have a re-hearing before the Elders and Meſſengers of other Churches. Upon this, great Clamours were raiſed, and Prejudices taken up againſt the Congregational Diſcipline. Mr. <hi>Cawdrey</hi> got this Story by the End, and in his <hi>Epiſtle to the Diſſenting Brethren,</hi> p. 10. He ſays that a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter in <hi>N.

But it is a great Wrong to the Churches of <hi>New-England,</hi> and to the <hi>way Congregational,</hi> to repreſent them, and all that are of <hi>that way,</hi> as being of ſuch <hi>Independent and Unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Principles,</hi> which they utterly diſclaim. Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> in his <hi>Diſciplinary Catechiſm,</hi> and eſpecially in the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditament thereunto,</hi> (which was written on Occaſion of a harſh and raſh Cenſure in the <hi>Independent Church</hi> in <hi>Cambridge</hi> in <hi>England</hi>) has with great Evidence of Reaſon, refuted the maintainers of ſuch an <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency.</hi>

For according to <hi>them,</hi> none of the <hi>Scotch,</hi> or <hi>Dutch,</hi> or <hi>French Miniſters,</hi> nor any of <hi>your own,</hi> are <hi>true Miniſters</hi> of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, while they want <hi>Epiſcopal Ordination.</hi> Albeit, the famous Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> has out of <hi>Eutychius</hi> prov'd, That not only <hi>Biſhops,</hi> but <hi>Patriarchs</hi> themſelves, were in the Primitive Times <hi>Ordain'd</hi> by <hi>Preſbyters;</hi> yet now, forſooth, according to our <hi>New Church,</hi> none

For <hi>you,</hi> and <hi>they</hi> too, muſt readily own, That unto the Office of a <hi>Miniſter</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> here are two Things <hi>Eſſential,</hi> namely, <hi>Obligation</hi> to <hi>Teach,</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> to <hi>Rule</hi> the Flock.

               <p>A Third Prejudice that you'll eaſily take up againſt this CANONICAL CHURCH, is the <hi>Number</hi> and <hi>Figure</hi> of thoſe many other good Men, (beſides <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Parliaments)</hi> whom they have <hi>Excommunicated.</hi> This <hi>Laodicean Church</hi> may admire her own <hi>Charity,</hi> (that is to ſay, the <hi>Eaſineſs</hi> of her <hi>Diſcipline</hi> as well as the <hi>Openneſs</hi> of her <hi>Communion</hi> towards the worſt of Men) but ſhe has the moſt <hi>Excommunicating</hi> and moſt <hi>Anathematizing Charity</hi> that ever was in the World.

                  <head>Number I. The Great END and INTEREST of <hi>NEW-ENGLAND,</hi> Stated by the Memorable Mr. JONATHAN MITCHEL, Extracted from an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of His, which bears Date, <hi>Decemb.</hi> 31.1662.</head>
                  <p>THE CAUSE of the People of GOD in NEW-ENGLAND, is, RELIGION; That is, the Profeſſion and Practice of the Truths and Rules of the Word of GOD.</p>
                  <p>As, I King. VIII. 58, 59. <hi>That He may incline our Hearts unto Him, to walk in ALL HIS WAYS, and to keep His Commandments, and His Statutes, and His Judgments, which He commanded our Fathers,—The CAUSE of His People Iſrael at all Times.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>More particularly, REFORMATION of RELI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GION. There was <hi>Religion</hi> in the Places whence we came. But NEW-ENGLAND'S Deſign in this vaſt Undertaking was REFORMATION; that is, The avoiding of ſome ſpecial Corruptions, and the vigorous and more Exact Profeſſion and Practice of the contrary Truths and Rules, according to <hi>Scripture-Pattern.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="201" facs="unknown:004275_0218_10054771AB171508"/>
Hence, Our <hi>Cauſe</hi> is not <hi>Separation</hi> from any thing Good in other Churches; whether Truth of Church-State, or any Doctrine rightly profeſſed, or Ordinance rightly adminiſtred in them.</p>
                  <p>But it is REFORMATION, only of what was <hi>Amiſs</hi> or <hi>Defective</hi> in the Churches we came from.</p>
                  <p>Yet more <hi>Specially;</hi> if it be aſk'd, what REFOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MATION? Or, what Particular we are here to ſeek and ſet up REFORMATION in? I fully cloſe with Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi>'s Diſcourſe, in his Preface before, <hi>Survey of Church-Diſcipline;</hi> That as the <hi>Prophetical</hi> and <hi>Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> Office of CHRIST, was compleatly Vindicated in the Firſt Times of <hi>Reformation,</hi> ſo now the Great CAUSE and WORK of GOD'S <hi>Reforming People,</hi> is, to Clear the Rights of CHRIST'S <hi>Kingly</hi> Office, and in their <hi>Practice</hi> to ſet up His <hi>Kingdom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The KINGDOM of CHRIST, tho' it be now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſted as a <hi>Fanatic Notion</hi> — by the Prophaneneſs of Mens Hearts, which is ready to catch at any Occaſion, to blemiſh it, and to riſe up in Rage againſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt thereof: [Pſal. II. 1, 3, 6.] Yet the True KINGDOM of CHRIST, (as the Scripture ſtates it) is Glorious, and Divine, and that for which GOD will <hi>Overturn, Overturn, Overturn,</hi> until it be Erected in its Glory; and (ſay Men what they will) I will ſtill Pray, <hi>Thy Kingdom Come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The KINGDOM of CHRIST is, in general, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but <hi>The Flouriſhing of RELIGION,</hi> Or that whereby the WORD of CHRIST in the SCRIP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TURE, (which is called <hi>the Word of the Kingdom,</hi>) is fully ſubmitted to. In a Word, Then His <hi>Kingdom Comes</hi> in its Glory, when the Will of GOD is <hi>done on Earth as it is in Heaven:</hi> And ſo far that <hi>Kingdom Comes,</hi> as this <hi>Will is done.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The KINGDOM of CHRIST, or the Reception and Erecting thereof, is more <hi>Inward</hi> and <hi>Perſonal,</hi> in the <hi>Hearts</hi> and particular Converſations of Men; more <hi>Outward</hi> and <hi>Publick</hi> in <hi>Societies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>

The <hi>Former</hi> is, when any <hi>Perſons</hi> are Converted, and help'd to Walk in New-Obedience; tho' they be never ſo Few and Obſcure. Thus CHRIST has always had a KINGDOM on Earth. And when this reaches unto <hi>Many,</hi> it cannot but become <hi>Viſible,</hi> in one Degree or other, and ſo Inſeparable from the Latter. Hence the <hi>General Converſion</hi> of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> will be the Inlet of the Greateſt Glory of CHRIST'S <hi>Kingdom</hi> on Earth. Hence alſo, CHRIST has always had a <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> in ſome Degree <hi>Viſible</hi> in ſome <hi>Societies</hi> of Men; tho' ſometimes very Thin, Low and Obſcure, and kept under by Corruptions and Perſecutions.</p>
                  <p>The Latter Erecting of CHRIST'S <hi>Kingdom</hi> in whole <hi>Societies,</hi> (whereby CHRIST is ſeen Ruling all in a Conſpicuous and open, in a prevailing and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able manner,) was OUR DESIGN and is OUR IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TEREST in this Country: tho' with Reſpect to the <hi>Inward</hi> and <hi>Inviſible</hi> KINGDOM, as the Scope there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. The Public ſetting up of CHRIST'S <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and Enjoyment of thoſe Ordinances and Ways of His, which can only be enjoy'd in whole <hi>Societies,</hi> and that with <hi>Purity</hi> and <hi>Liberty,</hi> was OUR END in coming hither. And this alſo is CHRIST'S Deſign in theſe Latter Days; To ſet up His <hi>Kingdom,</hi> in a Public and Openly prevailing manner, in all the Parts and Ways thereof.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Church,</hi> CHRIST'S <hi>Kingdom</hi> is clearly and gloriouſly ſet up, when ONLY and ALL His <hi>Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> both in <hi>Worſhip</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline</hi> are attended and obſerved in their Purity and Power, according to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Pattern. [<hi>Mat.</hi> XXVIII. 18, 23.] THIS is the Great CAUSE and Intereſt of GOD'S People in this Country, and was the Great END of their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, and hath been the great Matter of this TESTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MONY, in their <hi>Synodical Acts,</hi> and other Writings Publiſhed unto the World.</p>
                  <p>Hence our Great DUTY is to <hi>keep and ſeek all the Commandments of GOD,</hi> [1 Chron. XXVIII. 8.] in
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:004275_0220_100547752E706998"/>that reſpect; that is, all the Inſtitutions and Ordinances of His Houſe; To <hi>hold faſt</hi> what we have attained, that is according to Scripture-Pattern therein, and to <hi>come up</hi> unto what we yet want or are defective in.</p>
                  <p>Hence alſo thoſe among us, that deſire to ſet up in this Country, any of the <hi>Ways of Men's Invention</hi> (as, <hi>Prelacy,</hi> ſtinted <hi>Liturgies,</hi> Humane <hi>Ceremonies</hi> in Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,) they will bid Defiance to the CAUSE and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of CHRIST and of His People, in theſe Ends of the Earth; and will (I perſwade my ſelf) but <hi>lay themſelves as Potters Veſſels under the Iron Rod.</hi> For, CHRIST, who has taken this <hi>poſſeſſion of theſe uttermoſt parts of the Earth,</hi> will not Endure it. Let us <hi>Go forward</hi> to any of thoſe Things of CHRIST, that we are wanting in. But to <hi>Go backward</hi> unto thoſe Things which we know, and have openly Teſtified [<hi>Platform, c.</hi> 1. and <hi>c.</hi> 7. Sect. 6.] to be not of GOD, and which we departed from, will be ſuch a <hi>Wickedneſs</hi> as the Lord's JEALOUSY will not bear withal.</p>
                  <p>Our Work is not only to depart from Mens <hi>Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> but to ſet up All <hi>[ALL]</hi> GOD'S <hi>Inſtitutions</hi> in their Beauty and Power; that we may Exhibit a clear and complete Copy thereof before the World; and that we and ours may have that full Enjoyment of GOD, in all His Ordinances, that we came hither for.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Common Wealth CHRIST'S Kingdom</hi> is ſet up, when all Things therein are ſo ordered, (Laws and all Civil Adminiſtrations) as doth moſt fitly and effectually tend to advance, promote, and maintain <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Reformation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us faithfully cleave to the WHOLE INTEREST and KINGDOM of CHRIST, and He can make us a <hi>Burdenſome Stone</hi> to all Oppoſers, as He has done hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, [<hi>Zech.</hi> XII. 3, 5. <hi>Dan.</hi> II. 44, 45. <hi>Matth.</hi> XXI. 44. <hi>Iſa.</hi> LIV. 17.] and make Good to us, His Promiſe to <hi>Philadelphia;</hi> To keep our <hi>Door open,</hi> and to preſerve us in the <hi>Hour of Temptation</hi> that is upon all the World.</p>

                  <p>[On 1 <hi>King.</hi> VIII. 57, 58, 59.]</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>THE CAUSE of GOD and His People among us, is, The <hi>Cauſe of RELIGION.</hi> — That every Thing in Doctrine, Worſhip, and Diſcipline, be Conformed to and Regulated by, the Rule of the WORD.</p>
                     <p>When the Lord ſtirred up the Spirits of ſo many of His People to come over into this Wilderneſs, it was not for <hi>Worldly Wealth,</hi> or a better Livelihood for the Outward Man. The Generality of the People that came over, profeſs'd the contrary; Nor had we any Rational Grounds to expect ſuch a Thing in ſuch a Wilderneſs. Tho' GOD hath bleſſed His poor People here, and there are that have increaſed here, from ſmall Beginnings to great Eſtates; That the Lord may call this whole Generation to witneſs. — <hi>O Generation ſee!</hi> Look upon your Towns and Fields, Look upon your Habitations and Shops, and Ships, and behold your Numerous Poſterity, and Great Increaſe in the Bleſſings of the Land and Sea; <hi>Have I been a Wilderneſs unto you?</hi> We muſt needs anſwer, <hi>No, Lord, Thou haſt been a Gracious GOD, and Exceeding Good unto thy Servants, even in theſe Earthly Bleſſings; we live in a more Plentiful and
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:004275_0222_1005472FE2DDC800"/>Comfortable manner than ever we did expect.</hi> But theſe are but Additions; they are but Additional Mercies; It was Another and Better Thing, that we <hi>followed the Lord into the Wilderneſs</hi> for. This is never to be forgotten, That <hi>New-England</hi> is Originally a <hi>Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Religion.</hi> And if any Man amongſt us, make <hi>Religion</hi> as <hi>Twelve,</hi> and the <hi>World</hi> as <hi>Thirteen,</hi> Let ſuch an One know, he hath neither the Spirit of a <hi>True New-England Man,</hi> nor yet of a <hi>Sincere Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And the <hi>Cauſe</hi> is not <hi>Separation</hi> from any thing Good in other Churches. The End of our Coming hither was a <hi>Reformaiion</hi> only of what was <hi>Amiſs</hi> or <hi>Defective</hi> in the Churches we came from. We diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between the <hi>Corruptions</hi> and <hi>Diſorders</hi> of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and the <hi>Churches</hi> themſelves. So much for the <hi>Negative.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </q>
                  <p>Now for the <hi>Affirmative.</hi> 'If my weakneſs was able to ſhew, what the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of GOD and His Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in <hi>New-England</hi> is, according to its <hi>Divine Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal</hi> and <hi>Native Beauty,</hi> it would dazzle the Eyes of Angels, daunt the Hearts of Devils, raviſh and chain faſt the Affections of all the Saints.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, This was and is our CAUSE, that CHRIST alone might be acknowledged by us, as the only <hi>Head, Lord,</hi> and <hi>Lawgiver</hi> in His Church; That His <hi>Written Word</hi> might be acknowledged as the <hi>Only Rule;</hi> That Only and All His <hi>Inſtitutions</hi> might be obſerved, and Enjoyed by us, and that with Purity and Liberty, with Peace and Power.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I conceive our CAUSE is not barely a <hi>Reformation,</hi> but a PROGRESS in <hi>Reformation;</hi> To <hi>go on unto Perfection.</hi> A conceit of having already attain'd a <hi>Perfect Reformation,</hi> ſhould be far from us. — Our Fathers <hi>fled into this Wilderneſs from the face</hi> of a <hi>Lording Epiſcopacy,</hi> and <hi>Humane Injunctions</hi> in the Worſhip of GOD. Now, if any of us their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhould yield unto, or be Inſtrumental to ſet up
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:004275_0223_10054778B1443690"/>in this Country, any of the Ways of Men's Invention, ſuch as <hi>Prelacy,</hi> impoſed <hi>Liturgies,</hi> Humane <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies</hi> in the Worſhip of GOD, or to admit <hi>Ignorant</hi> and <hi>Scandalous</hi> Perſons to the <hi>Lord's Table;</hi> This would be a <hi>Backſliding indeed!</hi> It would be a Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding to the Things which we and our Fathers have departed from, and have openly teſtified againſt, to be not of GOD.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Union of Reformers</hi> belongs unto this CAUSE; For there is not any one Duty more preſs'd by our Saviour CHRIST and His Apoſtles, than this of an holy and cloſe Union among thoſe that profeſs His Name. The beſt of Men may err; and there being divers Meaſures of Light and Grace, there cannot but be <hi>Different Apprehenſions</hi> in ſome Things: And therefore, where there is not ſo full an Agreement as is to be deſired, it is our Duty to <hi>forbear one another in Love,</hi> Endeavouring to <hi>keep the Unity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the Chief <hi>Intereſt</hi> of NEW-ENGLAND; the Matter of greateſt Importance in itſelf, and of greateſt Concernment unto us. Whatever may be ſaid of our <hi>Intereſt</hi> in other reſpects, yet we may be ſure of This, that here lies our <hi>pradominant Intereſt</hi> and CAUSE; and the Great END for which we came into this Wilderneſs, and continue in it.</p>

                     <p>As for <hi>Extraction and Deſcent;</hi> O what <hi>Parents</hi> and <hi>Predeceſſors</hi> may we the moſt of us look back unto? Thro' whoſe Loins the Lord hath ſtretch'd forth the Line of his <hi>Covenant</hi> to take us in. — As

                     </p>
                     <p>But, O! what a ſad <hi>Metamorphoſis</hi> hath there of later Years paſt upon theſe Churches and Plantations? —It muſt be ſpoken in the Name of the Lord, O <hi>New-England,</hi> Thy God expects better Things from thee and thy Children; not Worldlyneſs; — not an itching after <hi>new Things and Ways</hi> —; not a <hi>drawing looſe</hi> in the <hi>Yoke</hi> of God?</p>
                     <p>Alas! How is <hi>New-England,</hi> in Danger of being loſt even in <hi>New-England?</hi> How ſadly may we la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it, that <hi>All are not Iſrael that are now in Iſrael?</hi> The <hi>Firſt Generation</hi> have been ripen'd Time after Time, and the moſt of them gather'd in as <hi>Shocks of Corn in their Seaſon;</hi> But we that riſe up to tread out the Footſteps of them that are gone before us, Alas! what are we? It is a ſad Name, to be ſtiled <hi>Children that are Corrupters.</hi> [<hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.4.] But are we not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed many of us <hi>Corrupted,</hi> and that which is far worſe, <hi>Corrupters?</hi> How is our <hi>Wine mixed with Water?</hi> Many, (as we may juſtly fear) would but too <hi>ſoon</hi> and too <hi>eaſily</hi> entertain a <hi>Lie</hi> in the Worſhip of God, and return to the <hi>Onions and Garlick of Egypt again.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The common Intereſt of the People of God, and of <hi>Us</hi> the Lord's People in ſpecial, is, the Intereſt of <hi>practical Piety and Holineſs;</hi> — the Intereſt of <hi>Unmixed Spiritual Goſpel Worſhip;</hi> — the Intereſt of <hi>Unity</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> in the Ways of <hi>Reformation:</hi> The Intereſt of <hi>theſe Things,</hi> and of juſt and righteous <hi>Liberties</hi> in order thereunto; The Times are coming and haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more and more, wherein <hi>Faithfulneſs to God</hi> in all

                  <p>This Eminent Perſon goes on, and earneſtly Adviſes the riſen and riſing Generation of this Land, to make Conſcience, not only of <hi>being rightly informed in that Cauſe of GOD</hi> which we are here wrapt up in, and in adhering to thoſe Things wherein the Lord hath hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to preſerved and bleſſed His Churches and People, but alſo of <hi>getting a Sight and View of the Divine Beauty and Glory thereof.</hi> 
                     <q>And truly, <hi>ſays He,</hi> As to this <hi>Cauſe</hi> and <hi>Intereſt</hi> of GOD, there can be <hi>no other Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions laid than thoſe which have been laid. New-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland's</hi> true and main <hi>Intereſt,</hi> the <hi>Cauſe of Chriſt</hi> in His Churches here, It is a fixed and unalterable Thing: It is not now to be found out by any <hi>new Light,</hi> Let us take heed of inquiring of, or liſtening, in this Matter, unto, the <hi>Determinations</hi> and <hi>Gloſſes</hi> of ſuch as have had no <hi>Standing</hi> in the Ways of God here, but have been grafted in upon <hi>By-Accounts,</hi> or move in the <hi>Eccentrick Orb</hi> of ſome private Intereſt, diſtinct from that of the whole. And let us alſo lay down this as a Rule, <hi>That whatſoever it is that hath been unanimouſly Rejected and Condemned in its Claims by the acknowledged moſt eminent Reformers in each Age, ſince the Apoſtacy of Antichriſt prevailed, this can never in theſe our Days, juſtify its Title to that Cauſe of Chriſt, that is to be maintained and contended for.</hi>

                  <head>Number IV. The TESTIMONY Finiſhed, By Dr. INCREASE MATHER.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Now theſe be the Laſt Words</hi> —</p>
                  <p>HAVING reviewed the Harmonious TESTIMO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NY of thoſe <hi>Three Worthies</hi> in our <hi>Iſrael,</hi> our Memorable MITCHEL, our Venerable HIGGIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SON, and our Honourable STOUGHTON, unto the CAUSE of GOD in the Churches of NEW-EN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GLAND, and the Great END of theſe Plantations, I do now with my DYING HAND Sign my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence thereunto. I am now in the <hi>Eighty Fourth</hi> Year of my Age, and under a Feebleneſs in the <hi>Valley of the ſhadow of Death,</hi> wherein the LORD is yet <hi>a Light unto me,</hi> and makes it but a <hi>Shadow of Death;</hi> and I am every Hour waiting and longing for my <hi>Diſmiſſion</hi> to a Better World. In theſe very ſingular Circumſtances, I am willing to add my TESTIMONY concurrent with the foregoing, and I do <hi>Declare,</hi> That the Principal DESIGN upon which theſe Colonies were at firſt Planted, was to <hi>Profeſs,</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> and <hi>Enjoy,</hi> with undiſturb'd Liberty, the Holy RELIGION of GOD our SAVIOUR, Exhibited in the SACRED SCRIPTURES, and Reformed and Reſcued from the <hi>Inventions</hi> and <hi>Abuſes,</hi> which the <hi>Man of Sin</hi> has intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced; And, more particularly, To ſet up CHUR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHES [Even of the <hi>Aboriginal Natives,</hi> as well as of <hi>Engliſh Chriſtians</hi>] for our Lord JESUS CHRIST, that ſhall keep themſelves <hi>Loyal</hi> to Him, their Glorious KING, in His Word, giving <hi>Law</hi> unto them; and
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:004275_0228_1005478371C9AAA0"/>faithful to the Religion of the SECOND COM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MANDMENT; and hee from thoſe <hi>Offenſive Things</hi> from which our UNITED BRETHREN, of the <hi>Preſbyterian</hi> and <hi>Congregational</hi> Denomination in the <hi>Engliſh Nation</hi> have withdrawn themſelves; and which our Honoured and Beloved BRETHREN, in the Renowned Church of SCOTLAND, have aboliſh'd and abandon'd.</p>
                  <p>It was equally deſign'd by thoſe <hi>Followers</hi> of the Lord into the <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> when it was a <hi>Land not ſown,</hi> That the <hi>pure and undefiled Religion</hi> deliver'd unto us in the <hi>Sacred Scriptures,</hi> (and Exhibited afterwards in our <hi>Confeſſion of Faith,</hi>) ſhould be continually Preach'd, and our <hi>Doctrines of Grace</hi> particularly aſſerted, by MINISTERS of Good <hi>Abilities;</hi> and Exemplary <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs</hi> and <hi>Watchfulneſs,</hi> freely and fairly choſen by the <hi>Churches</hi> whereof they are to be the <hi>Paſtors.</hi> And it alſo belongs unto the <hi>Glory</hi> of theſe <hi>Churches,</hi> to be ſo Conſtituted, as Livelily to Exhibit the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi> to the World: Both <hi>Debarring</hi> from their Communion ſuch <hi>Ignorant</hi> and <hi>Scandalous</hi> Perſons (who can't or won't <hi>Examine themſelves</hi>) as are to be ſhut out from the City of GOD; And <hi>Admitting</hi> of all thoſe (tho' in different Perſwaſions about leſſer Points) of whom it may be Judged, <hi>That CHRIST has received them to the Glory of GOD.</hi> Our <hi>Foundation</hi> is in theſe <hi>Holy Mountains.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is now accordingly the DYING WISH, of One that has been about Threeſcore and Six Years, after a poor manner, but I hope, with ſome Sincerity, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the beſt of Maſters, in the bleſſed Work of the Goſpel; That the CHURCHES may <hi>Stand faſt</hi> in the <hi>Faith and Order of the Goſpel,</hi> and <hi>hold faſt</hi> what they have received, and <hi>Let no Man take away their Crown.</hi> And, that the PASTORS would more Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly from Time to Time, and with proper Inculca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, acquaint the <hi>Churches</hi> with their <hi>True Intereſt;</hi> and thoſe Things which will be their <hi>Beauty</hi> and their
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:004275_0229_1005478794CCA560"/>
                     <hi>Safety.</hi> And conſidering the Relation which I have here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore ſuſtain'd as a <hi>Preſident</hi> for Twenty Years, it is highly proper for <hi>me</hi> to leave it as alſo my more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Deſire, that the <hi>Tutors</hi> in our COLLEGES, from whence the <hi>Churches</hi> expect their <hi>Supplies,</hi> would ſee to have the <hi>Students</hi> well informed in the Points, which they muſt Know and Serve, that ſo the WORK of GOD among us may not be marr'd by falling into Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſkilful and Unfaithful Hands.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, I cannot but go away Rejoicing in it, That the Means, which are indefatigably uſed, for the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>unwary People</hi> into the <hi>Things that will not profit</hi> them, have had ſo little Succeſs; and that the Body of the <hi>Sober People</hi> throughout the Country, (ſo far as I underſtand) generally continue to diſcover ſuch a conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous Averſion to the Things, from the <hi>Face whereof</hi> their Fathers <hi>ſled into the Wilderneſs:</hi> tho' at the ſame time, a too general Decay of that Real and Vital God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, which is to be the <hi>main Intention</hi> of all, is greatly to be bewailed. But there may be Danger of <hi>Another Generation ariſing,</hi> which will not <hi>know the Lord,</hi> nor the <hi>Works</hi> done <hi>by Him,</hi> and for Him, among His Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple here.</p>
                  <p>And therefore from the Suburbs of that Glorious World, into which I am now Entring, I earneſtly Teſtify unto the <hi>Riſing Generation,</hi> That if they ſinfully Forſake the GOD, and the Hope, and the Religious Ways of their pious An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, the Glorious LORD will ſeverely puniſh their <hi>Apoſtacy,</hi> and be <hi>Terrible from His Holy Places</hi> unto them.</p>
                  <p>Now, <hi>The Lord our GOD be with you, as He was with your Fathers; Let Him not leave you, nor forſake you.</hi> LORD, <hi>Let thy Work appear unto thy Servants, and thy Glory unto their Children!</hi>
