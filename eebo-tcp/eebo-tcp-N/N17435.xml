            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>SINCE the publication of the <hi>Elements of Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifery</hi> in 1775, continual reflection, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant practice, have produced many changes in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent parts of them.</p>
            <p>THE firſt rude production of an author unuſed to publication, requires frequent reviſal and copious alterations; but, in another view, this WORK is materially different. In the earlier ſtages, the Author imagined, that Midwifery was in a great meaſure Empirical; and that its principles were few, vague, and uncertain. His opinions were not peculiar; and if he erred, he erred with the greateſt and moſt ſucceſsful practitioners. But he has ſince found, that, though in many reſpects uncertain, the Theory of Midwifery deſerved his attention, as it might of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten direct the Practice; and that its imperfections were not greater than thoſe of the Theory of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine in general, which have not been thought of ſufficient conſequence to preclude the attention of phyſicians.</p>
            <p>With theſe views, he has endeavoured to give at leaſt the rudiments of a complete ſyſtem; and, as
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:022551_0003_0FB944BD9FA86690"/>
the Work was therefore materially changed, it was common juſtice to the world and to himſelf to give ſome information of this change.</p>
            <p>But, independent of this principle, the former Title would not NOW have expreſſed the preſent object and deſign; ſo that a work different in matter ought alſo to differ in form.</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>THE following COMPEND of MIDWIFERY was orginally intend for the uſe of thoſe gentlemen only who favour the author with their attendance on his lectures. But, after having engaged in the work, the importance of the ſubject induced him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it in a more enlarged view.</p>
            <p>Although he cannot lay claim to any particular diſcovery or material improvement in the art, yet he flatters himſelf, that the conciſe and ſimple manner in which the following treatiſe is detailed, will render it not unacceptable to readers of experience. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains ſome of the moſt eſſential principles of the obſtetrical art; and, ſhould it prove an uſeful aſſiſtant to inexperienced practitioners, or ſuggeſt hints to others better qualified to improve them, the end of this publication will be fully anſwered.</p>
            <p>The ſtudy of MIDWIFERY is an object highly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting; and has, in all ages, engaged the attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the moſt diſtinguiſhed of the medical profeſſion. Though ſtill in an imperfect ſtate, its improvements of late, by the labours of men of genius and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, have been numerous and important.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="x" facs="unknown:022551_0009_0FB944CD674CAF28"/>
How few are the modern inſtruments, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of thoſe employed by the ancients! How ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is their conſtruction! And how ſeldom is recourſe had to them! Of late a true ſpirit of obſervation has ariſen, and been directed to the moſt important ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; every diſeaſe has been accurately diſtinguiſhed from thoſe which it more nearly reſembles; and it may with truth be affirmed, that more light has been thrown on his ſubject, within theſe few years, than for above a century preceding. The late publicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Dr SMELLIE, Dr MANNING, Dr HULME, Dr LEAK, Mr WHITE, Mr MOSS, Dr DENMAN, Dr OSBURNE, and others, and the elegant plates of Dr Hunter, may be conſidered as valuable acquiſitions to the practice of midwifery.</p>
            <p>With regard to the plan of the following work, the ſame method has been obſerved which the author purſues in his courſe of lectures. As this plan has ſome peculiarities, it will perhaps be neceſſary to premiſe thoſe reflections which firſt gave occaſion to it; and as they ariſe from the nature of the ſubject itſelf, they will form no unſuitable introduction.</p>
            <p>Nothing is more conducive to the proper method of teaching an art, than to conſider its principle ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, as well as its immediate relations to thoſe that are moſt intimately connected with it. By this means a diſtinction can be made between thoſe parts to
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:022551_0010_0FB944CEEBABB3E8"/>
which attention ought to be chiefly directed, and others which would rather embarraſs than aſſiſt our reſearches.</p>
            <p>If, for inſtance, the ſeveral parts of medicine be conſidered, their ends will be found to be eſſentially different; and, of conſequence, the means by which theſe ends are accompliſhed will be frequently oppoſite. This is particularly illuſtrated by a little reflection on two different branches of the ſcience, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the practice of phyſic, and of ſurgery, ſtrictly ſo called. In the firſt, the nature of the diſeaſe can only be collected from ſymptoms; which, as the ſame ſymptoms pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from different and even oppoſite ſtates of the body, muſt ſometimes unavoidably lead into error; and even the ſymptoms themſelves are often ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory, that nothing can be collected from them; ſo that the phyſician is obliged to proceed on ſome very vague and diſtant analogy. Though theſe difficulties be ſurmounted, the effects of reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are ſtill uncertain? the real effects of many are not known; and, as they operate, not on an inanimate machine, but on a ſyſtem, in which, from any change, motions are excited frequently op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to thoſe expected, it is not ſurpriſing that the expectations of the phyſician are often baffled. Thus the practice of phyſic cannot be regulated by certain rules; it depends much on the ſtate of the
<pb n="xii" facs="unknown:022551_0011_0FB944D066A693B8"/>
body in health, and the very different changes introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by diſeaſe: To ſtudy it properly, all theſe ought to be conſidered; and it is this part which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the Theory of Medicine.</p>
            <p>In a ſubject ſo difficult and obſcure as the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal oeconomy, it is not ſurpriſing that the practitioner ſhould be often embarraſſed; and that inſtead of certainty, he ſhould ſometimes be obliged to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine his conduct by probability, or by a looſe and uncertain analogy.</p>
            <p>But the views of the ſurgeon are leſs obſcure; he is often confined to caſes where manual dexterity <hi>only</hi> is neceſſary, and has, very generally, the objects of conſideration ſubjected to his ſenſes; and, where they are out of the reach of ſenſe, the ſymptoms are more plain, the inductions fewer, and the concluſions more certain. In this part, then, theory is leſs neceſſary, and only uſeful as it ſeems to connect the ſeveral facts: Practice is particularly proper to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that firmneſs and conſtancy of mind, and that manual dexterity, ſo eſſential to the ſucceſs and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a ſurgeon.</p>
            <p>Midwifery, which may be defined <q>The art of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitating the birth of children,</q> is to be conſidered in much the ſame light as the other parts of ſurgery. Theory is leſs eſſential to it, as it chiefly conſiſts in an operation which requires a dexterity, only to be
<pb n="xiii" facs="unknown:022551_0012_0FB944D21B5792A0"/>
learned by practice. But, taken in a more enlarged ſenſe, Midwifery may be defined, <q>The art of facilitating the birth of children, and of managing pregnant and puerperal women.</q> A part of it, therefore, has ſtill a relation to the practice of phyſic; and, as ſuch, muſt be involved in the ſame difficulties and obſcurities.</p>
            <p>In this view, then, two objects are chiefly to be attended to:
<list>
                  <item>I. The operation itſelf, with every thing relative to it.</item>
                  <item>II. The ſtate of the woman after delivery.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>To obtain a proper knowledge of the firſt of theſe, it is neceſſary that the ſtructure and functions of the parts themſelves, the ſeveral changes which they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo, and the cauſes which may prevent or retard either conception, or a proper delivery, ſhould be known. The two firſt of theſe comprehend the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiology of Midwifery; the laſt, what may be called the Pathology.</p>
            <p>An attention to the ſtructure of a machine on which we operate, is certainly a point of the greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence; and it is particularly ſo in the obſtetrical art, as much of the practice depends on a proper knowledge of the parts: And it is not only the ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomical conſideration of every part, but the relations of one part to another, their diſtances and their incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
<pb n="xiv" facs="unknown:022551_0013_0FB944D36979DBE0"/>
both with reſpect to each other, and to other parts of the body, that are abſolutely neceſſary to be attended to. The conſideration of their ſeveral func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions is not ſo eſſential, as it contains only hypotheſes, which, though ſanctified by the authority of great names, are often trifling, generally inſufficient and unſatisfactory. Theſe, however, as they are imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately connected with the ſubject, have not been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. Several opinions with regard to the Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Generation and Conception, have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely mentioned. This may be called the Phyſiology of Midwifery; for if no diſea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e comes on, a natural delivery at full time may reaſonably be expected. But there are many Topical Affections of the parts in the impregnated ſtate, which will influence deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, either by inducing it prematurely, or preventing it altogether. Many diſeaſes may alſo ſupervene in the impregnated ſtate, which will have the ſame effect; thoſe, therefore, muſt be conſidered, and the moſt approved method of relieving them pointed out. Having thus laid a proper foundation, the Operation itſelf, with all its material variations, comes next to be explained. This finiſhes the firſt, and not the leaſt important part of MIDWIFERY, and concludes the preſent work.</p>
            <p>The ſecond part, or the management of lying-in women, and alſo of new born children, ſhould fall next to be conſidered.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xv" facs="unknown:022551_0014_0FB944D4E058F1E0"/>
The management of puerperal women, from the late labours of ſome ingenious accoucheurs already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to, may now be conducted on a more certain footing; the different diſeaſes, for inſtance, may be diſtinguiſhed with greater accuracy, which is a chief point in conducting the cure. The management, where there is no particular diſeaſe, is now directed by an attention to nature, unencumbered by refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments built on fallacious and uncertain theory. This part the author propoſed for the ſubject of a ſecond volume; but the late publications, already menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, have in ſome meaſure anticipitated the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                  <p>THE human ſkeleton is divided into the Head, Trunk, and extremities. The Head includes the Cranium and Face. The Trunk conſiſts of the Spine, Thorax, and Bones of the Pelvis. The latter, which include alſo part of the Spine, are the more immediate objects of the Accoucheur's atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Pelvis</hi> is an irregular cavity, more nearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching to a cylindrical than any other figure; and is chiefly compoſed of the <hi>Oſſa Innominata,</hi> the
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:022551_0016_0FB944D99E452540"/>
                     <hi>Os Sacrum,</hi> and <hi>Oſſa Coccygis.</hi> The two oſſa inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minata conſtitute the lateral and anterior parts; the os ſacrum, and ſmall range of bones called the <hi>coccyx,</hi> form the poſterior part. This bony circumference includes a ſpace which repreſents the figure of a ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, from whence the name PELVIS is derived.</p>
                  <p>To have an accurate knowledge of the Pelvis, it is neceſſary, firſt, to deſcribe ſeparately the different parts of which it conſiſts, and then to conſider it when theſe parts are united.</p>
                  <div n="1" type="section">
                     <head>SECTION I. Of the Parts of the Pelvis ſeparately.</head>
                     <p>THE <hi>Oſſa innominata</hi> are two large expanded bones, which form the ſides and fore-parts of the pelvis, and inferior lateral parts of the abdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. In infancy and childhood, each of theſe bones is divided into three diſtinct parts by interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate cartilages; and tho' afterwards the bones be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come united, and every appearance of former ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is nearly obliterated, the names by which they were diſtinguiſhed in younger years are ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The <hi>Os Ilium,</hi> or Haunch-bone, is the ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or and largeſt portion of the innominatum. It ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends from the ſemicircular ridge at the ſuperior,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:022551_0017_0FB944DDE0EFC728"/>
part, downwards and backwards as a tranſverſe ſecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of two-fifths of the <hi>acetabulum</hi> or cavity which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the round head of the thigh-bone, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to a little below the projection or ridge which forms the brim of the pelvis. Hence a ſmall por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>ilium,</hi> only, belongs to the pelvis, the expanded part being placed entirely without the brim. The different parts of the <hi>ilium</hi> are, the ſuperior ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micircular ridge or ſpine, giving riſe to ſeveral ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualities or prominences, termed <hi>ſpinal proceſſes;</hi> two broad ſurfaces, improperly named <hi>dorſum</hi> and <hi>coſta;</hi> the ſmall irregular ſurface by which it is joined to the ſacrum poſteriorly; the lower, thick, narrow part of the acetabulum; and, the ridge or projection at the inferior anterior part.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The <hi>Os Iſchium,</hi> or Seat-bone, called alſo Huc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle or Hip-bone, is the inferior lateral portion of the os innominatum. Its figure is very irregular, and its extent may be marked by a line drawn through near the middle of the acetabulum.</p>
                     <p>The ſeveral parts of this bone are, the Body, Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beroſity, and Ramus. The Body forms the loweſt and greateſt part of the acetabulum; the ſmall branch, or Ramus, makes up four-fifths of the great hole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to this bone and the Pubis, called <hi>foramen ovale</hi> or <hi>thyroides;</hi> and the inferior bump, flattened by preſſure, is the Tuberoſity which ſupports us in a ſitting poſture. The <hi>tuber</hi> is nearly cartilaginous at birth, and afterwards becomes an <hi>epiphyſe.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="28" facs="unknown:022551_0018_0FB944E2A49422C0"/>
3. The <hi>Os Pubis,</hi> or Share-bone, which makes the anterior middle part of the pelvis, is the ſmalleſt portion of the os innominatum.</p>
                     <p>Its ſeveral parts are, the Body, Angle, and Ramus. The body is the ſuperior outer part, by which it is joined to the os ilium: on this is a remarkable criſta, which forms part of the brim of the pelvis. The Angle runs downwards and forwards; and has a rough unequal ſurface, for the firm adheſion of the thick ligamentous cartilage that connects the bones of the pubes, which is conſiderably thicker and of a ſofter texture in females than in males. This arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation is called <hi>ſymphyſis pubis.</hi> The deficiency of bone below, or ſpace between the two rami, is termed <hi>arch of the pubes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The three portions of bone juſt now deſcribed, compoſe the os innominatum of each ſide; which are connected poſteriorly at the ſacro-iliac ſymphyſis, and anteriorly at the ſymphyſis pubis, by thick car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilaginous agglutinations. Theſe are ſtrengthened in a very particular manner by ſtrong ligaments at the poſterior ſymphyſis, and a double capſular aponeuro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis anteriorly<note n="*" place="bottom">

The bones and cartilages are, however, liable to be ſoftened by diſeaſe, and

the ligaments relaxed, <abbr>

The bones may alſo be fractured, or the articulations forced by mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal injury, as from falls, bruiſes, &amp;c. and ſuppura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may enſue from internal cauſes as well as acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents.</p>
                     <p>The poſterior part of the pelvis is made up of the <hi>Os Sacrum,</hi> or Rump-bone, and its extremity the <hi>Coccyx.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Os ſacrum</hi> called alſo <hi>Os Basilare</hi> by the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, from its uſe in ſupporting the trunk, is, in young ſubjects, compoſed of five or ſix peices, with intermediate cartilages. It has two ſurfaces, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and internal: the former is rough and convex; the latter more ſmooth and concave, marked with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral tranſverſe lines, the remains of the intermedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate cartilages which formerly connected the ſeveral pieces of bone. The flat ſide is bent, firſt downwards and a little backwards, then conſiderably forwards. The <hi>ſacrum</hi> is of a ſpongy cellular texture; and, in proportion to its ſize, the lighteſt bone of the body. Its figure is triangular, having the ſuperior part for the baſe, with the apex dwonwards, gradually becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing narrower terminates in its appendage the <hi>Coccyx.</hi> The ſuperior part, or baſe, anteriorly, has a ſharp ridge, which makes the poſterior part of the brim of the pelvis. Through the holes by which this bone is perforated, many nerves are tranſmitted. Thoſe
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:022551_0020_0FB944E575254150"/>
of the anterior ſuperior part admit ſome of the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt of the whole ſyſtem. The <hi>ſacrum</hi> is articulated above to the laſt vertebra of the loins, in the ſame manner with the true vertebrae. Laterally, it is join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the oſſa innominata by a deep irregular ſurface, where it forms the ſacroiliac ſymphyſis, which makes an immoveable ſynchondroſis; and below, it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with the coccyx by means of ſtrong ligaments. It is ſecurely guarded from external injuries, by the thick muſcles that cover it behind, and by the ſtrong ligamentous membranes which cloſely adhere to it.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Os Coccygis,</hi> which is placed at the extremity of the <hi>ſacrum,</hi> forms the lower poſterior part of the pelvis, and inferior terminting point of the ſpine. Its figure reſembles an inverted pyramid. Like the ſacrum, it is bent downwards and forwards; having an external convex, and internal concave, ſurface. It conſiſts, generally, of four pieces of bones, with intermediate cartilages which admit of conſiderable motion of the bones, in a direction moſt commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly adapted for the enlargment of the inferior ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of the pelvis.</p>
                     <p>In children, the <hi>coccyx</hi> is almoſt wholly cartilage; towards the decline of life, the interpoſed cartilages begin to oſſify: and at length the ſeparate pieces are united, and become one bone with the ſacrum. The immobility of the <hi>coccyx</hi> is not, however, the only reaſon why women advanced in life have commonly difficult and laborious births: various reaſons alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur,

                     <p>In the recent ſubject, this cavity is lined with the <hi>perioſteum,</hi> with cartilages, tendons, membranes, muſcles, and cellular ſubſtance.

                     <p>The pelvis is articulated with the ſpine at the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior poſterior part, and with the oſſa femorum below. Its principal uſes are, to defend thoſe parts contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it from external injury, to ſupport the uterus during geſtation, and to give paſſage to the child at birth. It alſo ſupports the trunk and inferior parts of the body, forming the intermediate connection bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ween them; and is the great centre of motion of the whole machine.</p>

                     <p>THE cavity of the pelvis, or ſpace included with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the bones, is of different ſhapes in different ſubjects; and has been ſuppoſed by different authors to approach more or leſs to an oval, elliptic, trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, or circular form. Its circumference ought to be ſomewhat between an oval and a circle, and to meaſure nearly one-fourth of the height of the body.</p>
                     <p>The leſſer or true pelvis may be diſtinguiſhed by the <hi>brim,</hi> or ſuperior aperture; and the <hi>bottom,</hi> outlet, or inferior aperture. Conſidered in this point of view, the diameters of its brim and bottom, the width, depth, and form of its cavity, muſt be carefully at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to.</p>
                     <p>At the brim, the largeſt diameter of the pelvis is lateral, the next to it diagonal, and the ſmalleſt from pubes to ſacrum. A well-formed pelvis ought to meaſure nearly five inches and one-fourth laterally; four inches and one-half, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>four and three-fourths, diagonally; and four inches and one-fourth from the top of the pubes to that of the ſacrum. Theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions are reverſed at its inferior aperture, where the pelvis is nearly an inch wider from the lower part of the arch of the pubes to the point of the coccyx, when
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:022551_0023_0FB944EC211CFD60"/>
that bone is on the ſtretch, than it is from ſide to ſide: For the diſtance between the tuberoſities of the iſchia is about four inches, or four and one-fourth only; and from the arch of the pubes to the extremity of the coccyx when ſtretched out, five inches, or five and one-fourth.</p>
                     <p>The pelvis at the ſides is nearly twice as deep as at the fore-part, and almoſt three times deeper be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind; <abbr>viz.</abbr> from the top of the ſacrum to the point of the coccyx, when extended, ſix inches, four at the ſides, and two only at the pubes. The upper and lateral parts of the pelvis, at the brim, are nearly perpendicular: but the anterior part is ſhallow; and the lateral openings in the recent ſubject are covered with membranous, muſcular, and ligamentous parts, which yield with the coccyx to the preſſure of the child's head, and form a concave nearly equal to that of the ſacrum.—From this conſtruction, added to the curve and concavity of the ſacrum, and mobility of the coccyx, the bottom is conſiderably more capacious, and ſomewhat more circular than the brim.</p>
                     <p>A line from the ſymphyſis of the pubes, to the junction of the two laſt vertebrae of the ſacrum, is horizontal. And a line that biſects this horizontal line, as well as the two diameters of the brim, makes the axis of the pelvis; and, if produced, will paſs through the umbilicus in an erect poſture; but, if in a reclining poſture, the line that paſſes through the umbilicus will be at right angles to the diameter of
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:022551_0024_0FB944EDB08DB7D0"/>
the brim: and, in general, whatever is ſaid of the angle which the axis makes with the diameter, is to be underſtood of the diameter of the brim, when the woman is erect; and of the horizontal line when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined. But, towards the end of pregnancy, a line to paſs through the centre of the pelvis muſt fall half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way between the navel and ſcrobiculus cordis.</p>
                     <p>The axes of the different parts of the pelvis, form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a diagonal, ſhow the curved line of direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which the child's head deſcribes in paſſing; and if theſe axes are ſuppoſed to be prolonged, they give the <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>THE female pelvis differs from the male chiefly in the following particulars: The angle which the vertebrae lumborum make with the ſacrum is more obtuſe, the ilia are more expanded, the concavity of the ſacrum and coccyx is larger, the connection of the coccyx with the ſacrum is looſer, the tuberoſities of the iſchia are placed at a greater diſtance, the ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſis of the pubes is thicker, the arch of the pubes and the lateral openings are more conſiderable, and the pelvis is wider in all its dimenſions.</p>

                     <head>SECTION III. Diſtorted pelvis.</head>
                     <p>THE figure and proportions of the pelvis vary in ſome degree in different women; for the depth and form may be ſo affected by different degrees of diſtortion, as not only greatly to diminiſh its cavity, and occaſion leſs or more difficulty and danger in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery, but in ſome inſtances to ſuch a degree as to render the birth of a living child altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible. As the proportions above deſcribed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute what is called a <hi>ſtandard pelvis,</hi> if it come ſhort of theſe dimenſions, the pelvis becomes faulty or diſeaſed.</p>
                     <p>There are different kinds, as well as degrees, of narrow pelves. Sometimes the cavity of the pelvis is conſtitutionally ſmall, without any deformity. Sometimes there is a narrowneſs confined to the brim; ſometimes to the inferior aperture. Sometimes the diſtortion is general over all the pelvis: And ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the capacity is retrenched by an intruſion of the vertebrae lumborum over the ſacrum; which may be ſo conſiderable, as to reduce the diameter of the brim to the ſpace only of two or three inches, or even leſs: and this is the ſpecies of diſtortion moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently obſerved in practice. The vertebrae of the ſacrum may be alſo, from preſſure while in a morbid

ſtate, ſo deformed and protruded, as to render that bone quite ſtraight, and from the ſame cauſe often convex inſtead of concave.</p>
                     <p>The cauſes of narrow pelviſes are chiefly ricketty affections in infancy, alſo external violence; ſuch as fractures and diſlocation of the bones, &amp;c. The bones alſo become ſoftened by diſeaſe in the adult ſtate; and are then liable to narrowneſs and diſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, even in women who have formerly had eaſy labours<note n="*" place="bottom">

If the pelvis ſhould not meaſure above two inches and a half from pubes to ſacrum, and not above three laterally, it would be impoſſible to ſave the child at full growth, in any other manner than by enlarging the capacity of the pelvis by an inciſion of the ſymphyſis pubes.</p>
                     <p>It is often extremely difficult to diſcover a narrow pelvis, eſpecially if the narrowneſs be confined to the brim. We may ſuſpect the diſtortion, from the make and ſhape of the woman. The direction in which the ſpine is diſtorted frequently determines it. But the pelvis is not always affected by a morbid cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vature of the ſpine: if that extend, however, to the lumber vertebrae, the pelvis very ſeldom eſcapes: though the moſt certain and infallible diagnoſtic is the diſtortion of the inferior extremities along with a twiſted ſpine. Women who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

the lower extremities, have generally good pelviſes. When theſe are ill proportioned or crooked, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the thigh bones, along with other ſuſpicious appearances, the pelvis is very generally, though not univerſally, deformed.</p>
                     <p>We can generally, by the touch, diſcover any ſpecies of diſtortion in the pelvis, below the brim, from the tuberoſities of the iſchia approaching too near each other, from the convexity of the ſacrum, from the difference of ſhape in the arch of the pubes, .</p>
                     <p>When the deformity is at, or above, the brim, and the woman otherwiſe well ſhaped, it is often impoſſible to aſcertain the narrowneſs till the labour be conſiderably advanced, and the child's head pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting in a conical from, with the bones protruding over one another, which are pretty certain marks of a narrow pelvis, or of a very large head.</p>
                     <p>But in order to underſtand the dimenſions of the pelvis, it will be proper to conſider the ſtructure and form of the head of the foetus; which, being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of different pieces, is admirably well adapted for accommodating itſelf to the figure and diameters of the pelvis.</p>
                     <p>The figure of the head is ſpheroidal, being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of two ovals a little depreſſed on each <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The head is broader behind than before, and the face is broader above than below.</p>
                     <p>On the upper part of the cranium, where the ſagittal and coronal ſutures croſs each other, is a membranous ſpace called the <hi>fontanella</hi> or <hi>open of the head.</hi>

                     <p>The head, like the pelvis, has different diameters. The ordinary dimenſions at birth are as follows:</p>

The length of the face from the chin to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, is about 5¼ inches.</p>
                     <p>The length of the whole head from chin to vertex, about 5½ inches; and when the vertex is ſtretched out in laborious births, about 6 or 7 inches.</p>
                     <p>The total circumference of the head, between 12 and 14 inches, or ſomewhat more.</p>
                     <p>The breadth of the body at the ſhoulders, is about 5 or 6 inches.</p>

                     <p>Conſidering the ſtructure, form, and diameters of the pelvis and child's head, the application, in regard to the mechanical deſcent of the head through the pelvis, is ſufficiently obvious; but, as the bulk and diameter of the one is not always mathematically adapted to the capacity of the other, difficulties muſt ſometimes ariſe. Hence the advantage of this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar ſtructure and mechaniſm of the <hi>cranium:</hi> for if the child's head were one firm oſſified body, whoſe dimenſions at any time exceeded thoſe of the cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drical cavity through which it ſhould paſs, however mechanically and with whatever force it deſcended, the delivery could not be accompliſhed without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary

aſſiſtance; and the conſequences would always prove fatal either to mother or child.</p>
                     <p>The ſhoulders are alſo capable of conſiderable diminution by preſſure; and the ſeparation of the oſſa innominata in the foetus may contribute, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, to facilitate the paſſage in birth.

                     <p n="1">1. THOUGH the cartilaginous ſymphyſes at the anterior and poſterior parts may be, in ſome degree, relaxed in time of labour, it appears ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently obvious, from a ſuperficial view of the ſtructure and articulation, that the bones are incapable of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration ſufficient to enlarge, in any ſenſible extent, the capacity of the pelvis, but in conſequence of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, or from violence. In that ſtate the bones may be forced by the throes of labour; but the woman becomes lame, and generally continues ſo for life.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Such a ſeparation may, however, be procured by inciſion at the ſymphyſis pubis, in general, though not always with ſafety to the mother; and a child, which would otherwiſe infallibly be deſtroyed; may
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:022551_0031_0FB94502A249CD30"/>
by that means be extracted alive. The ſucceſs of this operation, ſince firſt performed by Mons. Sigault, is not yet ſufficiently eſtabliſhed to enable us to ſpeak of it in a deciſive manner, nor to point out the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular circumſtances in which it may be attempted with propriety. But we may here obſerve, that it cannot, in caſes of difficulty and danger, be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with an abſolute certainty of preſerving either the mother or child, from the difficulty of aſcertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the real dimenſions of the pelvis, and of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed ſpace to be gained by the operation.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The ſhape and conſtruction of the child's head, which admits of conſiderable diminution by preſſure, ſufficiently compenſate for the want of motion of the bones of the pelvis: for the head is of an oval or ſpheroidal figure, and the membranous ſutures permit a free play of the cranial bones by the force of labour. But in different ſubjects it varies in ſhape, ſtructure, and ſolidity. Hence, in paſſing through the capacity of the pelvis, it will not always be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiouſly modelled to ſuffer that diminution of its bulk, from preſſure, which may be neceſſary. If, therefore, the volume of the child's head be diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned to the diameters of the brim or outlet of the pelvis, or if the long axis of the one be applied in an improper direction to the other difficulties will occur that will require extraordinary aſſiſtance.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It is therefore of the utmoſt conſequence to know the figure, ſtructure, mode of poſition of the
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:022551_0032_0FB945054C1DF590"/>
child's head, and the ſhape and proportions of the different openings of the pelvis; and to remember, that theſe proportions are reverſed in the ovals of the poſterior and inferior apertures; that the depth of the ſuperior part is to the anterior as three to one, and to the ſides as three to two.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Theſe proportions are, however, liable to conſiderable variation in different ſubjects; and the whole pelvis may become ſo affected, as to have its brim, depth and inferior aperture, conſiderably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched and diminiſhed, either from an original mal-conformation, from bruiſes, poſtures, &amp;c. or from diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Thoſe women who appear, from ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtortions, to have been ſubject to rickets, have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably a contracted pelvis; and the probability is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtrengthened if the lower extremities have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Deformities of the ſpine from the other cauſes do not generally influence the pelvis; ſo that every woman apparently crooked, has not always a labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and difficult birth.</p>

                  <p>The external parts are, the <hi>mons veneris,</hi> the <hi>labia externa,</hi> the <hi>labia interna alae minores</hi> or <hi>nymphae,</hi> the <hi>clitoris</hi> with its glans and praeputium, the orifice of the <hi>urethra,</hi> the <hi>os externum,</hi> membranous expanſion cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>hymen, carunculae myrtiformes, ſphincter vaginae,</hi> and glands of the parts.</p>
                  <p>The internal parts are, the <hi>vagina,;</hi> the <hi>uterus,</hi> with the ligaments, <hi>ovaria,</hi> and Fallopian tubes; and the blood-veſſels and nerves of the parts.</p>
                  <p>The contiguous parts are, externally, the <hi>anus, ſphincter ani,</hi> and <hi>perinaeum;</hi> internally, the bladder, <hi>urethra</hi> and <hi>rectum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>mons veneris</hi> is nothing more than the ſkin raiſed by a quantity of adipoſe ſubſtance collected under it, that cuſhions it up externally in the form of a tumor. From the lower part of which the great <hi>labia</hi> begin, and run downwards, till they are boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the perinaeum, or by what the French call <hi>fourchette.</hi> In their ſtructure they are cellular, but more ligamentous than the mons veneris. Their inner ſurface is villous and glandular, ſeparating a
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:022551_0034_0FB94507E94458A8"/>
ſebacious kind of liquor analogous to that about the corona glandis of the male.</p>
                  <p>Upon ſeparating the labia externa, a red projecting body appears, called <hi>clitoris,</hi> compoſed of two crura, which ariſe from the lower part of the oſſa pubis, approach one another, and form the body of the cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toris, whoſe extremity is its <hi>glans,</hi> covered with a looſe doubling of the ſkin, called <hi>praeputium.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>nymphae</hi> are placed immediately within the external labia, and are continued downwards and forwards on the anterior ſymphyſis pubis nearly as far as the orifice of the urethra. They are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions or folds of the integuments reſembling fraena, and very vaſcular. When the labia externa are open, they will devaricate; and when ſhut, come into contact.</p>
                  <p>Downwards from between the nymphae runs a ſmooth <hi>foſſa;</hi> at the bottom of which is a promin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in the centre of which is the <hi>orifice</hi> of the <hi>ure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thra.</hi> Its uſual ſituation is nearly oppoſite to the inferior extermities of the nymphae.</p>
                  <p>Below the urethra is the aperture into the vagina, called <hi>os externum;</hi> which has round its orifice the <hi>carunculae myrtiformes,</hi> ſuppoſed to be the remains of the ruptured hymen (a membrane peculiar <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> infancy, that ſurrounds the entry of the vagina in form of a creſcent): but many anatomiſts deny that theſe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unculae are formed from the lacerated hymen, and maintain that they exiſt previous to its rupture.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="45" facs="unknown:022551_0035_0FB9450969B5DB40"/>
The <hi>ſphincter vaginae</hi> is a flat muſcle, coming out inſenſibly from the perinaeum, and is loſt chiefly in the crura clitoridis. In very muſcular ſubjects, its fibres run quite round the vagina. There is a plexus of nerves and blood-veſſels, called <hi>plexus reteformis,</hi> that goes up on the inſide of this muſcle, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates with the clitoris; which, of conſequence, will be compreſſed between it and the penis in coition.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>glands</hi> of theſe parts are ſituated in ſuch a manner, that, upon preſſure, a conſiderable quantity of viſcus humour is thrown out in time of coition; ſo that by many this liquor was thought to be the <hi>ſemen faemineum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſtructure of theſe parts renders them all cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated for nearly the ſame purpoſe, <abbr>
                        <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </abbr> to give titillation <hi>in coitu.</hi> The clitoris is ſituated in the part where it is moſt expoſed to friction by the introduced penis: its uſe, therefore, chiefly, is to render the ſenſation <hi>in coitu</hi> more exquiſite. Theſe parts, in proportion to their ſenſibility, are exceedingly irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and ſubject to conſiderable inflammation and tumefaction even in the eaſieſt labours. Hence the impropriety and hazard of <hi>officious touching</hi> in the beginning of labours, while the preſenting part of the child is at a diſtance, while the paſſage is narrow and tight, and not yet ſufficiently relaxed by the lubri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating mucus which is afterwards ſo plentifully
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:022551_0036_0FB9450AF1F959A8"/>
thrown out for the purpoſe. The orifices of theſe parts, obſerving the direction of the ſacrum and peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeum, do not run ſtraight out, but downwards and forwards; by which the vagina, uterus, and rectum, are in leſs danger of protruſion. In the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction of the catheter, the point ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be directed, firſt a little downwards and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, then gently raiſed forwards and upwards rather than quite ſtraight.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>vagina,</hi> or paſſage to the womb, lies immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately under the bladder, and upon the rectum. It is commonly in length about four or five inches: but this differs in different ſubjects, and at different ages: as alſo its diameter, which is narrow and contracted in young women, but capable of very conſiderable dilation; for in virgins it is full of rugae, but ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in married women and thoſe who who have born children. It is compoſed of a plexus of muſcular fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres, and a rugous membrane; and its ſtructure is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo nervous and glandular. Its internal coat is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued upwards, and makes the inner covering of the uterus.</p>
                  <p>The vagina and body of the uterus are connected with the bladder, a good deal higher up than with the rectum.</p>
                  <p>The vagina leads to the os uteri, which projects a a little into that cavity, and advances rather more for ward in the lower poſterior that in the upper anterior part.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="47" facs="unknown:022551_0037_0FB9450C6EE5AD20"/>
The <hi>uterus</hi> lies in the middle of the pelvis, looſely between the rectum and bladder; but its poſition is liable to variation at different periods of life, and is affected by various other circumſtances. It is tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angular, of the figure of a pear or ſmall powder-flaſk, and generally about three inches long, ſomewhat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vex on its ſuperior part and, by preſſure, a little flattened below.</p>
                  <p>It is divided into its cervix or collum, and fundus. On being cut open, it appears of a compact ſolid ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, broader at its upper part, and narrower at the neck: its cavity is very inconſiderable in the unim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated ſtate, for the ſides of the plane almoſt come in contact. Though its ſtructure is muſcular, its muſcular fibres can with difficulty be traced: They appear to be moſtly circular; but are very difficult to unravel. Its veſſels proceed from the ſpermatics aud hypogaſtrics. The arteries are very ſmall in proportion to the veins; which, in time of the geſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are ſo much dilated, as to have obtained the name of <hi>ſinuſes.</hi> Its nerves come from very ſmall fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laments: and are chiefly furniſhed from the intercoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, thoſe of the ſacrum, and the ſympathetici maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi. It is alſo ſupplied with lymphatic veſſels.</p>
                  <p>The uterine <hi>ligaments</hi> are of two kinds; the <hi>ligamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta lata</hi> and the <hi>ligamenta rotunda.</hi> The former are no more than part of the peritonaeum, which, after gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a coat to the uterus, goes out laterally to form theſe ligaments and are therefore only doublings of
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:022551_0038_0FB9450F74CF7860"/>
that membrane, like the meſentery to the inteſtine. Through theſe doublings the veſſels of the uterus run. they have two folds in their upper part: The ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior contains the Fallopian tubes; the poſterior, the ovaria.</p>
                  <p>Each of the ligamenta rotunda is a little plexus of of muſcular fibres, nerves, and veſſels, enveloped in a common membrane, in the form of a cord or liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, coming down before the Fallopian tubes, and going out at the rings of the abdominal muſcles to be loſt in the groin.</p>
                  <p>In the anterior plica of the broad ligaments the <hi>Tubae F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>llopianae</hi> are contained. They have one extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity fixed to the fundus uteri, where the perforation is ſo ſmall it will hardly admit of a hog's briſtle; but the diameter gradually enlarges, becoming wider and wider like a trumpet, till it terminates in a looſe floating extremity called <hi>Morſus Diaboli.</hi> This cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is not ſtraight, but convoluted: When inflated, it ſeems to be ſtrung upon the broad ligament, as the the inteſtines are upon the meſentery.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>ovaria</hi> are two flattened oblong bodies, not very unlike the male teſtes, ſituated at the ſides of the uterus, on the poſterior part of the ligamenta lata. Their ſhape and ſize are different in different women: Their outer ſurface is divided by a number of chops but is ſmoother and more uniform in virgins than in married women who have had children. There is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to be obſerved in their texture, except a number
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:022551_0039_0FB94510E58CD2D0"/>
of veſſels, and ſomething like veſiculae or water-bags; theſe were ſuppoſed to be the ova, remarkable in the ovaria of quadrupeds. When a woman dies with child, one particular cavity is obſerved, which was thought to be the calyx from whence <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">

Moſt of the phenomena of impregnation correſpond with this theory. Foetuſes have been found in the cavity of the abdomen, where there has been no rupture of the uterus; and bones have made their way through the belly, while the uterus has been found perfectly ſound.</p>
                  <p>Contiguous to the genital parts are, externally, the <hi>anus</hi> and <hi>perinaeum;</hi> internally, the <hi>rectum, urethra,</hi> and <hi>bladder</hi> of urine.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>anus</hi> is the orifice of the rectum, which is the centre of axis of the pelvis. It is contracted into ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gae by a plexus of muſcular fibres called <hi>ſphincter ani,</hi> which anſwers nearly the ſame purpoſe as it does in the male, and is loſt in the perinaeum, inſtead of the bulb of the urethra.</p>

The <hi>rectum</hi> runs in a line, not quite ſtraight, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the vagina and uterus, in the hollow part of the ſacrum, through the capacity of the pelvis, and is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported upon the coccyx and muſcles below, as in the male.</p>

                  <p>As the vagina and urethra lie between the rectum and bladder, any diſorders in the one will readily bring the other into ſympathy.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>perinaeum</hi> is the ſeptum or ſpace between the os externum vaginae and the anus. It is chiefly made up of the ſphincter ani and vaginae muſcles, the common integuments, and cellular ſubſtance. In its natural ſtate it does not much exceed an inch in length, but is conſiderably ſtretched in time of labour.</p>

begins to appear in women about the age of puberty, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the menſtrual flux.</p>
                  <p>At the age of 13 or 14 years, and nearly at the ſame time that the ſemen begins to form itſelf <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> male, a conſiderable change happens to the female: for at this time the blood begins to circulate with an increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed force: the pubes begins to be covered with hair, the breaſts to ſwell, and the menſes to make their appearance. The veſſels of the womb, which in the foetus tranſuded a thin whitiſh liquor, and in the young girl a ſort of ſerum, begin now to ſwell with blood, and to diſpoſite ſome of it in the cavity of the uterus. They continue ſo to do for ſome days, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly three, four, or five; when the uterine veſſels gradually contract themſelves, and only allow a little ſerous moiſture to paſs as before, till again, at the end of three or four weeks, they open and diſcharge a like quantity of blood. This evacuation continues to return periodically, till about the 45th year, though with ſome it continues longer, and with others it ſtops ſoon after the 40th, or between this and the 50th year.</p>
                  <p>This diſcharge from the uterus does not flow in a ſtream, but gently drills for three, four, or five days; though moſt commonly for three only. The quantity generally evacuated is beween 5 and 10 oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>

                  <p>The cauſe of this periodical evacuation, peculiar to the females of the human ſpecies, has been a curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and perplexing ſubject of inquiry in all ages.</p>
                  <p>In the infancy of medicine, when fancy more than judgment influenced the theory, it is not ſurpriſing that the moſt chimerical reaſons ſhould have been gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to account for an appearance ſo ſtriking and ſo important. Thus it was attributed to the influence of the moon, from its periodical appearance; to a ferment in the fluids, when fermentation was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to account for every phenomenon. Men, in other views reſpectable, have exerted all their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity in defence of theſe theories; but they are now exploded, and the catamenia are ſuppoſed to ariſe from an univerſal plethora, or a topical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion: theſe opinions we ſhall proceed to examine.</p>
                  <p>From a ſuperficial view of the ſeveral phenomena, it would appear probable that the menſes are occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by plethora. But this idea of itſelf is vague, and will not account for all the appearances. By plethora we underſtand, a larger quantity of blood
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:022551_0043_0FB94517B889B970"/>
than is adapted to the capacity of the veſſels, either of the whole ſyſtem, or of any particular part. This may depend on the increaſe of the abſolute quantity of the fluids; or on a conſtriction of the veſſels. It is the former of theſe that ſeems to be meant by the advocates for a general plethora; and the chief argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſeem to be derived from the debility, inactivity, and ſwelling of the breaſts. The two former, though often depending on plethora, may be produced by many other cauſes; ſo that no argument can be drawn for them. The laſt by no means ſhows an increaſed quantity of the fluids in general; it ſeems much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with the ſtate of the uterus, and takes place in ſtates of the ſyſtem very diſadvantageous for a general <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ulneſs. We may, with ſome confidence, therefore, reject an opinion that has many direct arguments againſt it. For many of the ſymptoms are not to be explained by plethora, or by any other ſuppoſition.</p>
                  <p>A late and probable opinion is, <q>that the MENSES depend on a TOPICAL CONGESTION.</q> This opinion has been for ſome time delivered at this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity by the ingenious Dr CULLEN; and is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, not only by the moſt plauſible arguments, but by its conſiſtency with many other apppearances in the human body.

upon the increaſe of the quantity of fluids gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving occaſion to the diſtention of the veſſels, and thus producing the gradual evolution and full growth of the whole ſyſtem. This evolution does not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen equally in every part of the body at the ſame time, but ſucceſſively according to the different ſize and denſity of the ſeveral veſſels determined by the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſtamina. Thus the upper parts of the body firſt acquire their natural ſize, and then the lower extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities. By the ſame conſtitution it ſeems to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, that the uterus of the human ſpecies ſhould not be conſiderably evolved, till the reſt of the body is nearly arrived at its full bulk. But as the veſſels of every part, by their diſtention and growth, increaſe in denſity, and give thereby more reſiſtance to their further growth, at the ſame time, by the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, they determine the blood in greater quantity into the parts not yet equally evolved. By this means the whole of the ſyſtem muſt be ſucceſſively evolved, till every part is brought to that degree of of diſtention which is neceſſary to bring them to a balance in reſpect of denſity and reſiſtance with one another. Upon theſe principles, there will be a period in the growth of the body, when the veſſels of the uterus will be diſtended till they are in balance with the reſt of the ſyſtem; and their conſtitution may be ſuch, that their diſtention may proceed ſo far as to open their extremities, terminating in the cavity of the uterus, ſo as to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="55" facs="unknown:022551_0045_0FB9451C1FD32010"/>
may happen, that a certain degree of diſtention may be ſufficient to irritate and increaſe the action of the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and thereby to produce an haemorrhagic effort, which may force the extremities of the veſſels, with the ſame effect of pouring out blood.</p>
                  <p>"In either way, he accounts for the firſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a flow of blood from the uterus in women. In order to this, he does not ſuppoſe any more of a general plethora in the ſyſtem, than what is conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary to the ſucceſſive evolution of the ſeveral parts of it; and he proceeds upon the ſuppoſition, that the evolution of each particular part muſt eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially depend upon the plethora, or increaſed congeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in its proper veſſels. Thus he ſuppoſes it to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen with reſpect to the uterus; but as its plethoric ſtate, he obſerves, produces an evacuation of blood from its veſſels, this evacuation muſt empty theſe veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels more eſpecially, and put them again into a relax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtate with reſpect to the reſt of the ſyſtem. This emptied and relaxed ſtate of the veſſels of the uterus will give occaſion to a new congeſtion of blood in them, till they are again brought to that degree of diſtention that may either force their extremities, or produce a new haemorrhagic effort, that may have the ſame effect. Thus an evacuation of blood from the uterus, being once begun by the cauſes before mentioned, it muſt, by the operation of the ſame cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, return after a certain period, and muſt continue to do ſo till particular circumſtances occaſion a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable

change in the conſtitution of the uterus. What determines the periods of theſe returns to be nearly in the ſpace of a month, he cannot exactly explain; but ſuppoſes it to depend upon a certain ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance between the veſſels of the uterus and thoſe of the other parts of the body. This muſt determine the firſt periods; and when it does ſo, it can be underſtood, that a conſiderable increaſe or diminution of the quantity of blood in the whole ſyſtem will have but little effect in increaſing or diminiſhing the quantity diſtributed to the uterus. It may alſo be further obſerved, that when the evacuation has been repeated for ſome time at regular periods, it may be ſuppoſed that the <hi>power of habit,</hi> which ſo readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly takes place in the animal ſyſtem, may have a great ſhare in determining the periodical motions of the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terus to be with great regularity, tho' in the mean time conſiderable changes may have happened with reſpect to the whole ſyſtem."</p>
                  <p>This theory, though ſtill liable to objections, ſeems, however, as rational as any opinion that has yet been advanced: nor ſhall we ever perhaps be able clearly to inveſtigate the ſecret principles upon which this, and many other phenomena of the animal oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy, equally intricate and myſterious, depend.</p>

HARVEY, our illuſtrious countryman, belongs to the firſt claſs; the acute LEEUWENHOEK, who perceived living a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals, or bodies which reſembled them, in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men maſculinum, has added luſtre to the ſecond; and the Count de BUFFON, whoſe ingenuity and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteneſs are diſtinguiſhable even in an enlightened na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is the chief ſupporter of the third opinion.</p>
                     <p>We ſhall conſider, at ſome length, their ſeveral ſyſtems in another place; it is enough, at preſent, to obſerve, that the pride of ſcience, and brilliancy of imagination, have been equally unſucceſsful. To elude difficulties which they cannot conquer, modern philoſophers have endeavoured to transfer the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and by ſuppoſing the animal already to exiſt complete in its ſeveral parts, but of an aſtoniſhing minuteneſs, have rather laboured to ſhow by what means it is animated, and by what aſſiſtances evol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                     <p>This view, when extended to ſucceſſive genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, at firſt ſtartles the modeſt inquirer by its appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent abſurdity, and perplexes the moderate calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.

It, however, is not more contradictory than many phyſiological poſitions which have never been controverted; and it is ſome addition to its credit, that it is ſupported by BONNET and HALLER. On this foundation, which is ſupported alſo by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of HARVEY, the <hi>principle of animation</hi> muſt be the <hi>ſemen maſculinum;</hi> and it is not entirely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reaſon, that BONNET conſiders it as the firſt and chief ſupport of the foetus: but an extenſive period is required to evolve the ſeveral very intricate organs of which the human frame conſiſts.—The embryo is, at firſt, almoſt entirely vegetative: it adheres to the fundus uteri, and extracts the fluids of its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without any exertions that are peculiarly its own. But it ſoon ſhows ſome marks of animation. Its heart is obſerved to beat: it ſeems to prepare flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ids for its own purpoſes, and to ſeparate thoſe which are no longer beneficial: in ſhort, it acquires a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct ſyſtem; from part of which it is ſupplied with the original portion of its fluids; and which it, in its turn ſupplies with the ſame fluids more highly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laborated, and more carefully prepared. But this rather belongs to the hiſtory of the ovum, which we ſhall next conſider.</p>

                     <head>SECTION II. Structure of the Ovum in early Geſtation.</head>
                     <p>WHEN the germ is conveyed into the uterus, <hi>impregnation</hi> is ſaid to take place. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum, ſoon after its introduction, adheres to ſome part of the internal ſurface of the uterus: at firſt it appears like a ſmall veſicle, ſlightly attached; and gradually increaſes in bulk, till it apparently comes in contact with the whole cavity of the fundus.</p>
                     <p>The embryo, or unformed foetus, with placenta, umbilical cord, membranes, and waters, in early geſtation, conſtitute the ovum; which then appears like a thickened fleſhly maſs, the more external la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mellae and other parts, which are afterwards ſeparate and diſtinct, being blended and jumbled in ſuch a manner that they cannot be readily diſtinguiſhed or traced.</p>
                     <p>In the progreſs of geſtation, the external lamella, or membranous ſurface, by ſtretching, grows thinner; the cavity which contains the rudiments of the foetus becomes more apparent; and then a thick vaſcular part on the outſide of the chorion called <hi>placenta,</hi> can be readily diſtinguiſhed from the membranous porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ovum.</p>
                     <p>The external membranous part of the ovum (or bag which contains in its cavity the embryo, funis, and watery fluid in which the embryo floats) is origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:022551_0051_0FB9452BE8FFB270"/>
compoſed of three coats: the internal lamella, or that next the foetus, is called <hi>amnios;</hi> the next is the <hi>true chorion;</hi> and the external is called the <hi>falſe</hi> or <hi>ſpongy chorion.</hi> But it is ſuppoſed to derive an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary lamella immediately from the uterus, which conſtitutes the external covering of the ovum. This production, which is ſuppoſed to be entirely formed by a continuation of the internal membrane of the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terus, is at firſt looſely ſpread over the ovum, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards comes in contact with the falſe chorion. Theſe two lamellae, which form the external vaſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſurface of the ovum, are much thicker than the internal membranes of the true chorion and amnios; and the proportion which they bear to the other parts is ſo great, that, in early conception the maſs of the ovum is chiefly compoſed of them. Dr Ruyſch called this exterior coat the <hi>tunica filamentoſa;</hi> more modern authors, the <hi>falſe</hi> or <hi>ſpongy chorion.</hi> But Dr Hunter has found the ſpongy chorion to conſiſt of two diſtinct layers: that which lines the uterus he ſtiles <hi>membrana caduca</hi> or <hi>decidua,</hi> becauſe it is caſt off after delivery: the portion which covers the ovum, <hi>decidua reflexa,</hi> becauſe it is reflected from the uterus upon the ovum, forming the connecting medium be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. The portion which covers the ovum is a complete membrane, like the true chorion and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nios: but that which immediately lines the uterus is imperfect or deficient, being perforated with three

                     <p>Thus, according to Dr Hunter, the embryo, on its firſt formation in the ovum, and the foetus du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the whole time of geſtation, is incloſed in four membranes, <abbr>
                           <hi>viz.</hi>
                        </abbr> the double, falſe or ſpongy chorion, called <hi>membrana decidua,</hi> and <hi>decidua reflexa;</hi> the true chorion, and the amnios, which include a fluid cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>liquor amnii,</hi> in which the embryo floats.</p>
                     <p>The true chorion and the amnios are decidedly organized membranes, containing veſſels, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of regular layers of fibres. The decidua, and decidua reflexa, differ in appearance, and ſeem to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble thoſe inorganic ſubſtances which connect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed viſcera. If they be original membranes, and only viſible from their evolution and increaſe, it is not eaſy to conceive how the ovum gets behind them, ſince the Fallopian tubes are not covered by them. We are therefore inclined to adopt an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuggeſted firſt by Mr Falconer and Mr Crook-ſhanks, and rendered probable by the experiments of Signor Scarpa, <q>That they are entirely compoſed of an inſpiſſated coagulable lymph,</q> in a manner that we ſhall have occaſion to explain.</p>
                     <p>Between the amnion and chorion a quantity of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latinous fluid is contained in the early months; and a

ſmall bag, or white ſpeck, is then obſerved on the amnion, near the inſertion of the umbilical cord. It is filled with a white liquor, of a thick milky con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance; and is called <hi>veſicula umbilicalus, veſicula al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba</hi> or <hi>lactea:</hi> it communicates with the umbilical cord by a ſmall funis, which is made up of an artery and vein. This veſicle, and duct or tube leading from it, are only conſpicuous in the early months; and afterwards become tranſparent, and of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence inviſible<note n="*" place="bottom">

                     <p>Though the bag, or external parts of the concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, at firſt form a large proportion of the ovum in compariſon of the embryo or foetus, in advanced ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation the proportions are reverſed. An ovum be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the eighth and ninth week after conception, is nearly about the ſize of a hen's egg, while the embryo ſcarcely exceeds the weight of a ſcruple: at three months, the former increaſes beyond the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude of a gooſe's egg, the weight above eight oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; but the foetus does not then amount to three ounces: at ſix months, the foetus weighs twelve or thirteen ounces, and the placenta and membranes only ſeven or eight: at eight months, the foetus generally weighs ſomewhat more than five pounds, the ſecundines little more than one pound: at birth, the foetus weighs from ſix or ſeven to nine pounds,

                     <p>As ſoon as the embryo has acquired ſufficient con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence to be the ſubject of any obſervation, a little moving point, which is the heart, diſcovers itſelf.

                     <p>It is alſo exceedingly difficult to determine the age or proportional growth of the foetus.

The progreſs of the foetus appears to be much quicker in the early than latter months: but the proportional increaſe is attended with difficulty in the calculation; for this, among other reaſons, that we have not an opportunity of knowing the magnitude or weight of the ſame foetus in different months.

                        <p>The foetus is connected to the placenta by the umbilical cord, or navel-ſtring; which may be defin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, "a long vaſcular rope, compoſed of two arteries and a vein, covered with coats derived from the membranes, and diſtended with a quantity of viſcid gelatinous ſubſtance to which the bulk of the cord is chiefly owing."</p>
                        <p>The cord always ariſes from the centre of the child's belly, but its point of inſertion in the cake is variable. Its ſhape is ſeldom quite cylindrical; and its veſſels are ſometimes twiſted or coiled, ſometimes formed into longitudinal ſulci. Its diameter is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly about the thickneſs of an ordinary finger, and its length ſufficient to admit the birth of the child with ſafety, though the placenta ſhould adhere at the fundus uteri. In length and thickneſs, however, it is liable to conſiderable variation. The extremity

This ſuggeſts an important advice to practitioners, to be cautious of pulling the rope to extract the placenta when they feel the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of its ſplitting as it were into two diviſions, which will proportionally weaken its reſiſtance, and render it liable to be ruptured with a very ſlight de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of force in pulling.—The uſe of the cord is to connect the foetus to the cake, to convey the nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious fluid from the mother to the child, and to return what is not employed.</p>

It differs in ſhape and ſize, it is thickeſt at the centre, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually becomes thinner towards the edges, where the membranes go off all round, making a complete bag or involucrum to ſurround the waters, funis, and child.</p>
                        <p>Its ſubſtance is chiefly vaſcular, and probably in ſome degree glandular. The ramifications of the veſſels are very minute, which are unravelled by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceration, and, when injected, exhibit a moſt beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:022551_0059_0FB9453F18D160D8"/>
appearance reſembling the buſhy tops of a tree. It has an external convex, and an internal concave, ſurface. The former is divided into a number of ſmall lobes and fiſſures, by means of which its adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the uterus is more firmly ſecured. This lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulated appearance is moſt remarkable when the cake has been raſhly ſeparated from the uterus; for the membrana decidua, or connecting membrane be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween it and the uterus, being then torn, the moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and alarming haemorrhagies frequently enſue.</p>
                        <p>The internal concave ſurface of the placenta is looſely covered with the amnion, and by the chorion more immediately and intimately. From this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſurface ariſe innumerable ramifications of veins and arteries, which inoſculate and anaſtomoſe with one another; and at laſt the different branches unite, and form the <hi>funis umbilicalis.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The after-birth adheres to every part of the internal ſurface of the uterus, as at the poſterior and anterior ſuperior parts, laterally; and ſometimes, though more rearly, part of the cake extends over the <hi>orifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium uteri;</hi> from whence, when the orifice begins to dilate, the moſt frightful and dangerous floodings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe. But the moſt common place of attachment of the cake is from the ſuperior part of the cervix to the fundis.</p>
                        <p>Twins, triplets, &amp;c. have their placenta ſometimes ſeparate and ſometimes adhering together. When
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:022551_0060_0FB945418BCA7690"/>
the placentae adhere, they have generally the chorion in common; but each foetus has its diſtinct amnion. They are commonly joined together, either by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervening membrane, or by the ſurfaces being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous to one another: and ſometimes the veſſels of the one cake anaſtomoſe with thoſe of the other.</p>
                        <p>The human placenta, according to Dr Hunter, is ſimilar in ſtructure to that of quadrupeds: and ſeems to be compoſed of two diſtinct ſyſtems of parts, a ſpongy or cellular, and a vaſcular ſubſtance. It has of conſequence two diſtinct ſets of veſſels. The ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy or cellular part, formed by the decidua, is derived from the mother; and, if filled with injection, will increaſe the placenta to nearly twice its ordinary thickneſs; the more internal vaſcular part belongs entirely to the foetus, and can only be injected from the cord, as the ſpongy part by the filling the veſſels of the uterus. This will be better underſtood when the mode of circulation between the parent and child is explained.</p>

They form a pretty ſtrong bag, commencing at the edge of the cake, going round the whole circumference, and lining the internal ſurface of the womb. When ſeparated from the uterus, this membranous bag is
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:022551_0061_0FB9454261ED12E8"/>
ſlender and yielding, and its texture readily deſtroyed by the impulſe of the contained fluid, the preſſure of the child, or of the finger in touching; but in its natural ſtate, while it lines the womb, and is in cloſe contact with its ſurface, the membranous bag is ſo tough and ſtrong as to give a conſiderable degree of reſiſtance. It is alſo ſtrengthened in proportion to the different layers of which it is compoſed, whoſe ſtructure we ſhall proceed to explain more particularly.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The <hi>Membrana Decidua,</hi> or that lamella of the ſpongy falſe chorion which is in immediate contract with the uterus, is originally very thick and ſpongy, and exceedingly vaſcular, particularly where it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches the placenta. At firſt it is looſely, as it were, ſpread over the ovum; and the intervening ſpace is filled with a quantity of gelatinous ſubſtance. It gradually becomes more and more attenuated by ſtretching, and approaches nearer to the interior la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mella of the decidua, called <hi>decidua reflexa;</hi> and about the fifth month the two layers come in contact, and adhere ſo as to become apparently one mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane<note n="*" place="bottom">

foramina, which are the orifices of veſſels that open into this internal ſurface. In advanced geſtation, it adheres intimately to the former membrane, and is with difficulty ſeparated when the double decidua comes off entire; but the outer lamella more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly adheres to the uterus after the placenta and other membranes are expelled, and is afterwards caſt off with the cleanſings.</p>
                        <p>The decidua reflexa becomes thicker and more vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular as it approaches the placenta, and is then blended with its ſubſtance, conſtituting the cellular or <hi>mater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> part of the cake, as it is termed by Dr Hunter. The other or more internal part belongs to the foetus, and is ſtyled the <hi>foetal</hi> part of the placenta.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>double decidua</hi> is opake in compariſon of the other membranes; the blood-veſſels are derived from the uterus, and can be readily traced into it. Dr Hunter ſuppoſes that the double decidua lines the uterus nearly in the ſame manner as the peritonaeum does the cavity of the abdomen, and that the ovum is incloſed within its duplicature as within a double nightcap. On this ſuppoſition the ovum muſt be placed on the outſide of this membrane, which is not very readily to be comprehended; unleſs we adopt Signor Scarpa's opinion already mentioned, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it to be originally entirely compoſed of "an inſpiſſated coagulable lymph."</p>

<pb n="73" facs="unknown:022551_0063_0FB94546D8867528"/>

It adheres pretty cloſely to the internal ſurface of the cake, which it covers imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately under the amnios, and gives alſo a coat to the umbilical cord. It is connected to the amnion by means of a gelatinous ſubſtance, and is eaſily ſeparated from it.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The <hi>Amnion,</hi> or internal membrane, forms the external coat of the umbilical cord. This internal lamella of the membranous bag is by much the moſt thin, attenuated, and tranſparent of the whole; and its veſſels are ſo delicate, that they can hardly be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered; their diameters are ſo ſmall, as to be inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable in their natural ſtate of admitting globules of red blood. It is, however, firmer and ſtronger than the chorion, and gives the greateſt reſiſtance in the breaking of the membranes.</p>
                        <p>The ſmall bag, called <hi>veſicula umbilicalis,</hi> formerly deſcribed, and only conſpicuous in the early months from its ſituation, is placed between the amnion and chorion, near the the attachment of the cord; and, from the colour of its contents, has been miſtaken for the urachus: but there is no allantois in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſubject.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>allantois</hi> in quadrupeds is an oblong mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous ſac, or pouch, placed between the chorion
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:022551_0064_0FB9454938ADE728"/>
and amnion. This membrane communicates with the urachus, which in brutes is open, and tranſmits the urine from the bladder to the allantois.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. The <hi>Waters</hi> are contained within the amnion, and are called the <hi>liquor amnii.</hi> They are pureſt, cleareſt, and moſt limped in the firſt months; accqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a colour and ſomewhat ropy, towards the latter end. They vary in different ſubjects, both in regard to conſiſtence and quantity; and, after a certain pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, they proportionally diminiſh as the woman advances in her pregnancy. This liquor does not, in any reſpect, reſemble the white of an egg; it is generally ſaltiſh, and therefore unfit for the nutrition of the child; ſome of it may perhaps be abſorbed by the foetus, but the child is chiefly nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the navel-ſtring. In the early months, the organs are not fit for ſwallowing; and monſters are ſometimes born alive, where ſuch organs are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wanting.</p>
                        <p>Water is ſometimes collected between the chorion and amnion, or between the lamellae of the chorion. This is called the <hi>falſe water:</hi> It is generally in much ſmaller quantity than the true water; and, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thout detriment to the woman, may flow at any time of pregnancy.</p>

                     <p>THOUGH the uterus gradually encreaſes in ſize from the moment of conception till full time, and although its diſtention is proportioned to that of the ovum, with regard to its contents, it is ſtrictly ſpeaking, never completely diſtended: for, in early geſtation, they are entirely confined to the fundus; and, at full time, the finger can be paſſed for ſome way within the orificium uteri without touching any part of the membranes<note n="*" place="bottom">See Dr Hunter'<hi>s</hi> Tables, Pl. XXXi. fig. 1.</note>. Again, though the capacity of the uterus increaſes, yet it is not mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally ſtretched, for the thickneſs of its ſides does not diminiſh. The increaſed ſize ſeems, therefore, to depend on a proportional quantity of fluids ſent to that part, nearly in the ſame way the ſkin of a child, though it ſuffers ſo great diſtention, does not become thinner, but preſerves it uſual thickneſs.</p>

This is proved from ſeveral inſtances of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uterine foetuſes, where the uterus, though there were no contents, was nearly of the ſame ſize, from the additional quantity of fluids tranſmitted, as if the ovum had been contained within its cavity. Boehme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus<note n="*" place="bottom">
                           <hi>Vide</hi> Boehmeri Obs. Anatom. Rarior. Faſciculus notabil. circa uterum human. Obſervatio de Conceptione ovaria, tabula prima.</note> relates the ſame circumſtance, without attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to explain it, in the hiſtory of a caſe of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uterine conception in the fifth month. The uterus is painted of a conſiderable ſize, though the foetus was contained in the ovarium.</p>
                     <p>The gravid uterus is of different ſize in different women; and will vary according to the bulk of the foetus and involucra. The ſituation alſo varies ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the increaſe of its contents, and the poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the body. For the firſt two or three months, the cavity of the fundus is triangular as before im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnation; but as the uterus ſtretches, it gradually acquires a more rounded form. In general, the ute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus never riſes directly upwards, but inclines a little obliquely; moſt commonly to the right ſide<note n="†" place="bottom">See Dr. Hunter's Tables, Pl. i. iii. and iv.</note>: its poſition is never, however, ſo oblique as to prove the ſole cauſe either of preventing or retarding delivery.</p>
                     <p>Though conſiderable changes are occaſioned by the gradual diſtention of the uterus, it is difficult to
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:022551_0067_0FB9454DA5F813D8"/>
judge of pregnancy from appearances in the early months. For the firſt three months, the os tincae feels ſmooth and even, and its orifice is nearly as ſmall as in the virgin ſtate. When any difference can be perceived, it will conſiſt in the increaſed length of the projecting tubercle of the uterus, and and the ſhortening of the vagina from the deſcent of the fundus uteri through the pelvis. This change in the poſition of the uterus, by which the projecting tubercle appears to be lengthened, and the vagina pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionally ſhortened, chiefly happens from the third to the fifth month. From this period the cervix begins to ſtretch and be diſtended, firſt at the upper part; and then the os tincae begins alſo to ſuffer conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able changes in its figure and appearance. The tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bercle ſhortens, and the orifice expands: but, during the whole term of geſtation, the mouth of the uterus is ſtrongly cemented with a ropy mucus, which lines it and the cervix, and begins to be diſcharged on the approach of labour. In the laſt weeks, when the cervix uteri is completly diſtended, the uterine orifice begins to form an eliptical tube, inſtead of a fiſſure; and ſometimes, eſpecially when the parietes of the abdomen are relaxed by repeated pregnancy, diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears entirely, and is without the reach of the finger in touching. Hence the os uteri is not placed in the direction of the axis of the womb, as has gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally been ſuppoſed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="78" facs="unknown:022551_0068_0FB9454F9F60D258"/>
The progreſſive increaſe of the abdominal tumor, from the ſtretching of the fundus, affords a more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſive mark of the exiſtence and period of pregnancy than any others; and the progreſs is nearly as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
                     <p>About the fourth, or between the fourth and fifth month, the fundus uteri begins to riſe above the pubes or brim of the pelvis, and the cervix to be ſomewhat diſtended. In the fifth month, the belly ſwells like a ball with the ſkin tenſe, the fundus extends about half way between pubes and navel, and the neck is ſenſibly ſhortened. In the ſeventh month, the fundus, or ſuperior part of the uterine tumor, advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as far as the umbilicus; and the the cervix is then nearly three-fourths diſtended. In the eighth, it reaches midway between the navel a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Thus at full time the uterus occupies all the umbilical and hypogaſtric regions: its ſhape is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt pyriform, that is, more rounded above than below, and having a ſtricture on that part which is ſurrounded by the brim of the pelvis<note n="*" place="bottom">

                     <p>During the progreſs of diſtention, the ſubſtance of the uterus becomes much looſer, of a ſofter texture, and more vaſcular than before conception; and the diameter of its veins is ſo much enlarged that they

                     <p>The arteries paſs from the uterus thro' the decidua, and open into the ſubſtance of the placenta in an oblique direction. The veins alſo open into the placenta; and by injecting theſe veins from the uterus with wax, the whole ſpongy or maternal part of the placenta will be filled<note n="*" place="bottom">

                     <p>The muſcular ſtructure of the gravid uterus is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely difficult to be traced with any exactneſs. In the wombs of women who die in labour, or ſoon after delivery, fibres running in various directions are obſervable more or leſs circular.</p>

                        </abbr> from the place where the placenta adheres, and from the aperture or orifice of each of the tubes; but it is almoſt impoſſible to demonſtrate regular plans of fibres continued any length without interruption.</p>
                     <p>The appendages of the uterus ſuffer alſo conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble changes; for the tubes, ovaries, and ligaments, gradually go off below the fundus as it ſtretches, and at full time are almoſt entirely obliterated. At full time, eſpecially in a firſt pregnancy, when the womb
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:022551_0070_0FB94553CCE80FD8"/>
riſes higher than in ſubſequent impregnations, the ligamenta rotunda are conſiderably ſtretched; and to this cauſe thoſe pains are probably owing which ſtrike from the belly downwards in the direction of theſe vaſcular ropes, which are often very painful and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſing towards the latter end of geſtation. Again, as the uterus, which is chiefly enlarged towards the fundus, at full time ſtretches into the cavity of the abdomen without any ſupport, leaving the broad li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaments below the moſt bulky part, we can readily ſee, that by pulling at the umbilical cord to deliver the placenta, before the uterus is ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, the fundus may be pulled down through the mouth of the womb, even though no great violence be employed. This is ſtyled the <hi>inverſion of the uterus;</hi> and is a very dreadful, and generally fatal accident. It is the conſequence only of ignorance or temerity; and can ſcarcely happen but from violence, or from an officious intruſion on the work of nature, by pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at the rope while the woman is faint or languid, and the uterus in a ſtate of atony.</p>
                     <p>In ſome rare inſtances, the force of labour which propels the child where the cord is ſhort naturally, or rendered ſo by circumvolutions round the body of the child, may, when the placenta adheres to the fundus uteri, bring it down ſo near the os tincae, that little force would afterwards be ſufficient to complete the inverſion. This ſuggeſts a precaution, that in the

above circumſtances, if ſtrong labour-pains ſhould continue, or a conſtant bearing down enſue, after the delivery of the child, the practice of pulling by the cord ſhould be carefully avoided, and the hand of the operator be prudently conducted within the uterus, to ſeparate the adheſion of the cake, and guard againſt the hazard of inverſion<note n="*" place="bottom">Of ſeven unhappy caſes of inverted uterus where I have been called within ſeveral years, the conſequence of ignorance or temerity of the practitioner, in one ſingle inſtance only the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſurvived the ſhocking accident.

No anaſtomoſes of blood-veſſels between them have yet been clearly ſhown by the experiments of any phyſiologiſt; nor has any colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed injection been puſhed from the uterus into the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior vaſcular part of the cake, nor from the foetus or umbilical veſſels into the cellular part, except by the force of extravaſation, This cellular part of the placenta is probably derived from the decidua; and is not a ſpongy inorganic ſubſtance, merely intended for the attachment of the cake; but probably a regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly conſtructed and organiſed part belonging to the mother. The cells, therefore, cannot be filled by injection from the umbilical veſſels, though an injec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will readily paſs from the veſſels of the uterus.</p>
                     <p>We find the ſame ſtructure obtain in cows, where the cellular can be eaſily ſeparated from the vaſcular part, and the diſtinct property of each aſcertained.</p>
                     <p>As the ſtructure of the cellular part of the placen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:022551_0073_0FB9455BE1F5EC88"/>
is ſomewhat ſimilar to that of the more ſimple glands, it may be reaſonably inferred, that it is inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for other purpoſes beſides merely abſorbing blood and conveying it to the umbilical veſſels of the child. It ſeems probable, therefore, that an operation ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to ſecretion is carried in the placenta; that the veins and arteries of the foetus, in the vaſcular part of the cake, are continuous; and that abſorbents ariſe in the follicles, which ſoon terminate in veins. From this view it appears, that the placenta is not only the connecting medium between the mother and child, intended for conveying and returning nutritious fluid from the one to the other, but alſo changes and prepares it, in a particular manner, for circulating through the minute veſſels of the delicate foetus.</p>
                     <p>This mode of circulation is admirably well contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for the preſervation of the child from diſeaſes which would otherwiſe be communicated from the mother, if the mutual communication were kept up by continuous veſſels, the foetus would conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be in danger of ſuffering when the mother's circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation was accelerated or otherwiſe diſturbed.</p>

the umbilical cord to the foetus for its ſupport and increaſe circulates in the ſyſtem of the non-natus in the following manner.</p>
                     <p>The blood paſſes directly from the placenta into the umbilical vein; which running along the funis, perforates the belly of the foetus, and enters under the liver, where it divides into two branches, nearly at half a right angle. One of theſe branches, called the <hi>ductus venofus,</hi> carries part of this liquor immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the lower vena cava. The other carries the reſt to the vena portarum; where, after circulating through the liver, it alſo gets into the vena cava, and ſo to the heart: but the circulation here is carried on without any neceſſity for the lungs being dilated. For foetuſes have an oval hole open between the two auricles of the heart, and a large communicating canal, called <hi>canalis arterioſus,</hi> going between the pulmonary artery and aorta; which two paſſages al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the reſt of this circulating fluid, that returns by the cava ſuperior, to be tranſmitted to the aorta, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out paſſing thro' the lungs.</p>
                     <p>The blood is returned from the foetus by the <hi>arter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                     <p>THE foetus is commodiouſly adapted to the cavity of the uterus, and deſcribes an oblong or oval figure; its ſeveral parts being collected together in ſuch a manner as to occupy the leaſt poſſible ſpace. The ſpine is rounded, the head reclines forward to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the knees, which are drawn up to the belly, while the heels are drawn backwards towards the breech, and the hands and arms are folded round the knees and legs. The head of the child is generally downwards. This does not proceed, as was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly alleged, from the funis not being exactly in the middle of the child's body, for it is not ſuſpended by the funis: the reaſon is, becauſe the ſuperior parts are much larger and heavier in proportion than the inferior. When other parts preſent, it ſeems owing to the motion of the child altering its figure when the waters are much diminiſhed in quantity, or to circumvolutions of the cord: when the poſition is once altered, it becoms confined or locked in the uterus, and cannot eaſily reſume its original po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture.</p>
                     <p>As the figure of the foetus is oval, and the head na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:022551_0076_0FB945613B7A1300"/>
falls to the moſt depending part of the uterus, the vertex generally points to the os tincae, with the ears diagonally in the pelvis between the pubes and ſacrum. The foetus is mechanically diſpoſed to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume this poſition from its peculiar figure and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, particularly by the bulk of the head and articulation with the neck, by the action of its muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and by the ſhape and conſtruction of the cavity in which it is contained.</p>

                     <head>SECTION IX. Peculiarities of the Foetus.</head>
                     <p>THE foetus, both in external figure and internal ſtructure, differs materially, in many ſtriking cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, from the adult. It is ſufficient for our preſent purpoſe to mention a few particulars.</p>
                     <p>The head is very large in proportion to the reſt of the body; the cranial bones are ſoft and yielding, and the ſutures not yet united; ſo that the bulk of the head may be diminiſhed in every direction, and its paſſage conſequently be rendered more commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious. The bones of the trunk and extremities, and all the articulations, are alſo remarkably flexible. All the apophyſes are epiphyſes; even the heads and condyles and brims of cavities, inſtead of bone, are of a ſoft cartilaginous conſiſtence.</p>
                     <p>The brain, ſpinal marrow, and whole glandular as
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:022551_0077_0FB94564E3617308"/>
well as nervous and ſanguiferous ſyſtems, are conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably larger in proportion in the foetus than in the adult. It has a gland ſituated in the fore-part of the cheſt between the laminae of the mediaſtinum, called the <hi>thymus.</hi> The liver and kidneys are much larger in proportion; and the latter are divided into a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſmall lobes, as in the brute.</p>
                     <p>The foetus alſo differs in ſeveral circumſtances from a child who has breathed.</p>
                     <p>The cavity of the thorax is leſs in proportion than after reſpiration. The lungs are ſmaller, more compact, of a red colour like the liver, and will ſink in water; but putrefaction, and a particular emphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſema, as in diſeaſes of cattle, and blowing into them, will make them ſwim: which ſhould prevent us from haſtily determining, from this circumſtance, whether a child has breathed or not; which we are often called on to do. Neither does their ſinking prove that the child never breathed; for a child may die, or be ſtrangled in the birth, or immediately after, before the lungs are fully inflated.</p>
                     <p>The arterial and venous ſyſtems are alſo different from that of the child. Hence the difference in the manner of circulation already taken notice of.</p>

                        <head>I. SUPER-FOETATION.</head>
                        <p>SOON after impregnation takes place, the cervix and orificium uteri become entirely cloſed up by means of a thick viſcid gluten: the internal cavity is alſo lined by the external membrane of the ovum, which attaches itſelf to the whole internal ſurface of the fundus uteri: the Fallopian tubes alſo become flaccid; and are, as geſtation advances, ſuppoſed to be removed at ſo great a diſtance, that they cannot reach the ovaria to receive or convey another ovum into the uterus. For theſe and other reaſons, the doctrine of ſuper-foetation, or the poſſibility of one conception ſoon after ſupervening another in the ſame woman, is now pretty generally exploded:—A doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine that ſeems to have ariſen from the caſe of a double or triple conception; where, ſome time after their formation and progreſſive evolution <hi>in utero,</hi> one foetus has been expelled, and another has remained; or, after the extinction of life at an early period, one or more may ſtill be retained, and thrown off in a ſmall and purtrid ſtate, after the birth of a full-grown child.</p>
                        <p>The uterus of brutes is divided into different cells; and their ova do not attach themſelves to the uterus

ſo early as in the human ſubject, but are ſuppoſed to receive their nouriſhment for ſome time by abſorp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Hence the os uteri does not cloſe immediately after conception; for a bitch will admit a variety of dogs while ſhe is in ſeaſon, and will bring forth pup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of theſe different ſpecies.—Thus it is common for a gre-hound to have, in the ſame litter, one of the gre-hound kind; a pointer; and a third, or more, different from both: Another circumſtance that has given riſe to ſuper-foetation in the human ſubject, which can only happen when there is a double ſet of parts; inſtances of which are very rare.</p>

                        <p>THE impregnated ovum, or rudiments of the foetus, is not always received from the ovarium by the tuba Fallopiana, to be thence conveyed into the cavity of the uterus. For there are inſtances where the foetus ſometimes remains in the ovarium, and ſometimes even in the tube; or where it drops out of the ovarium, miſſes the tube, falls into the cavity of the abdomen, takes root in the neighbouring parts, and is thereby nouriſhed: But they are always leſs than the uterine foetuſes; they either do not receive ſo much nouriſhment as in the ſucculent uterus, or they generally come to their full growth long before their common term.</p>

                        <p>EVERY conſiderable deviation in the ſtructure of a foetus from the common order of nature is conſidered as monſtrous, whether ſuch deviation be conſiſtent with life or not; and the production is commonly termed a <hi>monſter.</hi> This idea of a monſter will, however, comprehend all the variety that has been obſerved; and theſe we ſhall endeavour to reduce under four ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral heads.</p>

                        <p>IT is very difficult to give an explanation of theſe deviations, nor indeed is it to be expected, while the proceſs of generation is itſelf ſo great a myſtery. If we allow with BONNET, &amp;c. that a germ or embryo of the future production exiſts in the female previous to the impregnation, many of theſe deviations muſt to it be referred. Though this, however removes the difficulty, it by no means ſolves it. Supernumerary parts may be more readily accounted for: for if two ova become contiguous in their gelatinous ſtate, they may eaſily unite: and this contiguity and union will prevent the evolution of many of the parts, and the production will appear as one. This we can ſay with ſome certainty has been often the caſe, as in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemian ſiſters mentioned under the firſt ſpecies; and the union in the different monſters has at various times been ſeen gradually more and more complete, ſo that moſt ſupernumerary parts evidently proceed from this cauſe.</p>

to an enormous ſize: but as they commonly adhere by a ſmall peduncle, their exciſion is a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple operation, and ſeldom followed with conſiderable haemorrhage; they leave but ſlight marks behind them, and for the moſt part eaſily heal.</p>
                     <p>Oedematous ſwellings are of two kinds; general or local. The firſt are the attendants of an univerſal leucophlegmaſia, the conſequence of a dropſical habit; and the treatment muſt then be conducted on gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral principles, with a view to correct the fault in the habit. The latter ariſe from venous plethora, and the preſſure of the bulky uterus interrupting the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning blood from the lower extremities; hence the ſerous part is extravaſated, and forms a local oedema. The ſwelling at firſt appears on the feet and legs, and gradually extends to the thighs and labia. Though ſometimes formidable, it is entirely ſymptomatic of pregnancy; and for the moſt part, entirely ſubſides ſoon after delivery.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>labia,</hi> when inflamed or abraded; from what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever cauſe, (as from the involuntary diſcharge of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crid urine, or any other acrimonious diſcharge which excoriates the parts), may grow together if not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by frequent bathing; ſhould this happen, they muſt be ſeparated with a ſcalpel, and the like acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by proper care in future prevented.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>urethra,</hi> too, is ſubject to diſorders and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents; ſuch as fungous excreſcences, contuſion, laceration, inflammation, gangrene, and the ſtone.</p>
                     <p>The firſt of theſe may, when large, be cut out with the ſciſſars, or deſtroyed by the application of the bougie. All the others, as now enumerated, may be the conſequence of a ſtone ſticking in the paſſage: when the expulſion cannot be forwarded by the ſemicupium, the ſtone muſt be extracted, either by dilating the urethra itſelf, or cutting upon it through the vagina. The ſymptoms of a ſtone in the female bladder, towards its neck, or in the ure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thra, are nearly ſimilar to thoſe which occur in the male, and the treatment and operation are too well known to require a deſcription.</p>

Preternatural conſtrictions may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be induced, from the uſe of ſtyptic applications, or fumigations. The cure may be attempted by emol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lient fomentations; as by the ſteams of warm water directed to the parts; and by introducing a ſmall tent of compreſſed ſponge, which hath been previouſly moiſtened and kept tight bound with tape till dry. This by imbibing the moiſture, will ſwell and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pand; and thus the aperture will be gradually ſtrech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

The dilation, which previous to impregnation ſeemed impracticable, has very often been accompliſhed by labour-pains.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes there is a natural defect in the genital parts, from an original mal-conformation; ſo that the vagina is either imperforated altogether, or a foramen only remains ſufficient to tranſmit the menſtrual blood. If, from coalition of the parietes of the vagina, the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage be entirely ſhut up, an attempt to force it would be vain.

delivery, is ſubject to inflammation, tumefaction, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceration, and their conſequences; and theſe, in ſome caſes, are not confined to the perinaeum only, but even extend to the vagina, rectum, and bladder. If theſe complaints reſiſt the common means of relief, ſuch as frequent bathing, fomentations, cataplaſms, &amp;c. and terminate in gangrene, leaving behind them fiſtulous ſores with callous lips, unleſs a cure be effected by time, they generally continue in a fiſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſtate, without a poſſibility of remedy.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>uterus,</hi> like other parts, may alſo be affected with various diſorders: Theſe are chiefly inflammation and its conſequences; ſarcomatous, fungous, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypous tumors; ſtoney concretions, dropſy, tympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites, ſcirrhous and cancerous tumors.</p>
                     <p>When the <hi>os tincae</hi> is ſhut up, either originally, or by cicatrix in conſequence of ſuppuration, laceration, ulceration, or the like, the caſe is generally incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; except the menſtrual blood by its weight force a paſſage, or point out the manner of procuring it: if that fails, a future ſterility is the unavoidable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence.</p>
                     <p>Original conformations of this kind ſeldom admit of any treatment, for this reaſon: Becauſe, beſides the imperviouſneſs of the os tincae, the uterus itſelf ſometimes appears a ſolid body without any cavity in the centre.</p>
                     <p>SARCOMATOUS, FUNGOUS, or POLYPOUS TU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MORS,

ariſe from all parts of the vagina and uterus. They happen to women at every period of life, but moſt frequently towards the decline. They gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally proceed from an obſtruction of the ſmall glands of the parts, and are leſs or more difficult to diſcover or remove, as their origin is low or high in the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gina or uterus. Their texture or conſiſtence is very different; ſometimes they are tender and muci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laginous, like thoſe in the noſe; at other times firm and ſolid, like a wen. Their exiſtence is diſcovered by a careful inquiry into the circumſtances of the caſe, and by an examination of the parts; ſometimes their baſis is very conſiderable; though they generally adhere by a ſmall neck. They ſometimes, like ſcir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhi, continue indolent for many years; and are alſo liable to degenerate into ſcirrhus and cancer. In their mildeſt ſtate, they are attended with perpetual ſtillicidium from the vagina, and ſometimes with profuſe and dangerous floodings. They muſt be carefully diſtinguiſhed from <hi>herniae, prolapſus uteri,</hi> and other tumors. Polypi, when curable by an ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, may generally be removed by ligature; a ſafer method than cutting with the ſcalpel, as they are often ſupplied with large blood-veſſels, from which there may be danger of a fatal haemorrhagy.</p>
                     <p>For fixing the ligature, the fingers of the operator will be ſometimes ſufficient. When this method fails, Dr HUNTER's needle, or M. LEVRET's dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:022551_0089_0FB9457D9FD5CF90"/>
canula for applying and fixing the ligature over the tumor, are the moſt ſimple and ſucceſsful expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients. M. LEVRET's inſtrument is nothing more than a piece of flexible gold or ſilver wire, paſſed through a double hollow probe in the form of a nooſe: This is to be conveyed into the vagina, and carried over the tumor till it reach the baſe; the ends of the wire muſt be gently drawn, or it muſt be twiſted round as tight as the patient can eaſily bear; the canula muſt afterwards be fixed to the thigh, and the wire tightened every day as it ſlackens. By this means the circulation in the tumor is ſtopped, and in two or three days the polypus will drop off. In fixing the ligature, the operator muſt be cautious not to miſtake the tubercle of the os tincae for the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypous tumor; a blunder which would prove of fatal conſequence to the patient.</p>

                     <p>A COLLECTION OF WATER, called HYDROPS UTERI, is ſometimes formed in this cavity; a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe

which has been often miſtaken for pregnancy, as the menſes are generally obſtructed. When the diſeaſe is aſcertained by a fluctuation ſenſibly felt in the part, and if there ſhould be no ſuſpicion of real geſtation, the water may be evacuated by intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing a finger, or the catheter, through the os uteri; if this ſeems impracticable, the conſtricted parts muſt be relaxed by warm baths and fomentations. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the evacation of the water, the cure may be completed by ſuitable regimen, ſtrengthening me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, and proper exerciſe.</p>

Theſe tumors, like ſimilar complaints in other parts, tho' they may long remain in an indolent ſtate, ſeldom admit
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:022551_0091_0FB94583BAE82B70"/>
of relief from medicine, and generally at length de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate into cancer. Nor is any good to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Peruvian bark, ſarſaparilla, or even the ſo-much extolled cicuta. The general health muſt then, in a very particular manner, be attended to, and the moſt urgent ſymptoms muſt be palliated. For this purpoſe, a cooling regimen, the moderate uſe of gentle laxatives, occaſional bleedings, and opiates are the chief means.</p>
                     <p>A foetid bloody diſcharge, along with an increaſe of pain, heat, and itching, mark the ulcerated or cancerous ſtate of the diſeaſe. The progreſs is then rapid; and the ſtench becomes intolerable even to the attendants as well as to the patient. The rava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the diſeaſe are ſhocking; for ſtools, urine, blood, and matter, are ſometimes diſcharged from one orifice. In theſe unhappy circumſtances, lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle can be attempted by way of treatment, but to amuſe the patient, by palliating the painful ſymptoms with opiates, and keeping the ſores clean by injec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, till death brings the only relief.</p>
                     <p>PROCIDENTIA or PROLAPSUS UTERI. The uterus ſometimes changes its place, and falls down into the vigina, frequently protruding through the os externum. The cauſe may either be general de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, or topical relaxation of the connecting parts, particularly of the vagina. The cure conſiſts in the reduction and retention of the prolapſed part. When
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:022551_0092_0FB945858DB38D98"/>
peſſaries are diſagreeable, the uterus may be ſuſpended by a bit of ſponge: Gently reſtringent injections ſometimes prove uſeful, but a long-continued uſe of them will as certainly be hurtful, ſo that they ſhould always be employed with caution. The ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral conſtitution ſhould be ſtrengthened by a proper regimen, bark, mineral waters, and the cold bath.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>ovaria,</hi> in common with other glandular parts, are ſubject to diſeaſe, ſuch as ſcirrhous, ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomatous, and dropſical ſwellings; by which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo much enlarged, as to occupy the whole abdomen. Such caſes generally prove incurable. Tumors of the ovaria at length generally terminate in dropſy: the ſymptoms are analogous to thoſe of the aſcites; from which, however, they ſometimes differ in ſeveral particulars.</p>
                     <p>In the beginning, the enlarged ovarium may be eaſily diſtinguiſhed from the aſcites, by the ſwelling and pain being circumſcribed, and confined to one ſide; in the progreſs, by the advances being more ſlow and gradual; in its advanced ſtages, by ſome oedema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous ſwellings of the leg and thigh on the ſide affected, and by one being able to feel it from the vagina. The cure differs in nothing very material from that of the true hydrops aſcites<note n="*" place="bottom">
                           <hi>Vide</hi> Dr Monro's Treatiſe on the Dropſy.</note>. When the tumor points outwardly, the contents, whether water or pus, muſt be evacuated by a free opening; when gelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous

or purulent, a conſtant drain, by means of a ſeton, may, in ſome caſes, be employed with advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. The patient muſt afterwards be treated in the uſual manner. The extirpation of the ovarium, in a diſeaſed ſtate, has been by ſome authors propoſed: but when the tumor is very much enlarged, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps adheſions to the neighbouring parts are already formed, the exciſion would at leaſt prove a difficult, if not a very hazardous operation.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Fallopian tubes</hi> are alſo liable to diſeaſe. Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is ſometimes collected in them, and either floats through the whole cavity of the tube or each end coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſces in conſequence of ſome inflammation, and the water appears to be contained in a cyſt. It is difficult to be diſtinguiſhed from the diſeaſed ovarium, with which it is often complicated, and requires a ſimilar method of treatment.</p>

I. AMAENORRHOEA conſiſts of two ſpecies.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. The retention or abſence of the menſes beyond their uſual period of appearance, called <hi>emanſio menſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. An interruption in the periodical revolution, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the law of habit is eſtabliſhed, ſtyled <hi>ſuppreſſion</hi> or <hi>obſtruction.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                     <p n="1">1.] The <hi>Retention of the Menſes</hi> proceeds from dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent cauſes; and may be referred to general debility of the ſyſtem, which impairs the action of the heart and arteries: or to ſome fault in the uterus itſelf, as torpor or rigidity of the veſſels. The firſt produces ſymptoms of debility, which are generally ſtyled <hi>chlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotic:</hi> and the indications of cure are, to ſtrenghen the ſtomach and ſyſtem; which is chiefly effected by bark, chalybeats, regimen, and the cold bath. Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>por and rigidity of the uterine veſſels may be ſometimes removed by the means uſually employed for relaxing torpor and rigidity of the whole ſyſtem: or by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the action of the uterine veſſels, more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly by ſtimulating the neighbouring organs. This is chiefly to be attempted in thoſe caſes where nature makes an effort; but, from debility or ſome other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, is unable to accompliſh it. She is then to be gently aſſiſted, not forced. Aloetic purges, tinctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra melampodii, ſmall doſes of calomel, or electricity, are the uſual remedies; but they ought to be cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and prudently uſed. Tinctura fuliginis, or an
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:022551_0095_0FB9458A5F5652D8"/>
extract prepared from it, and given in the doſe ℈j twice or thrice a day, is a more ſafe, and often moſt efficacious medicine in the latter caſe, along with the foetid gums. But the warm bath, or a change of climate, are the moſt powerful antiſpaſmodics, and may be often ſucceſsfully employed when other reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies fail.</p>
                     <p>Though we are in general able to diſtinguiſh theſe two cauſes of debility and torpor, yet it muſt be allowed, that retention of the menſes, from every cauſe, ſoon induces a debility, which, without ſome attention, may be miſtaken for the original defect.</p>
                     <p n="2">2.] <hi>Suppreſſion of the menſes.</hi> The evacuation may be defficient in periods or quantity. The firſt is more properly termed <hi>ſuppreſſion,</hi> or, in vulgar lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, <hi>obſtructions;</hi> the latter <hi>ſparing</hi> or <hi>painful men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruation</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Suppreſſion.</hi> The menſes are rarely ſuppreſſed in conſequence of weakneſs: though it muſt be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that they are readily affected by any general diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order in the habit: and, in that view, the deviation is to be conſidered merely as ſymptomatic: and the cure will depend on correcting the fault in the conſtitution.</p>
                     <p>Spaſm, or rigidity of the uterine veſſels, is, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, a more frequent cauſe than any other, occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, more remotely, by cold, irregular paſſions, plethora, &amp;c. The cure muſt then be directed with a
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:022551_0096_0FB9458EAD64F0F0"/>
view to remove the conſtriction of the uterine veſſels, and adapted to particular conſtitutions and ſymptoms. Venaeſection, the warm bath, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menagogues, ſuited to the peculiar circumſtances of the caſe, are the proper remedies. Medicines under the name of <hi>emmenagogue</hi> are not, however, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied on; and the means employed for reſtoring the evacuation are moſt ſucceſsfully exhibited when our efforts concur with theſe of nature. Violent uterine emmenagogues, ſo far as they may have any tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to affect the general health, are always improper and frequently hurtful. In a ſimple ſuppreſſion, it is often ſufficient to keep the patient quiet; to avoid cold, and irregularities of diet; with the uſe of the warm bath, ſemicupium, or ſteams of water directed to the uterus, when the expected period approaches.</p>
                     <p>When the ſuppreſſion is more obſtinate, aloetic purges, electricity, and the moſt powerful relaxants and antiſpaſmodics, muſt be employed.</p>

                     <p>Theſe ſymptoms are beſt relieved, by avoiding cold and irregularities for ſeveral days preceding the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed period; by uſing actual warmth then, and more particularly during the time of menſtrua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; by drinking, every night before bed-time, and in ſmaller quantities through the day, any mild, dilu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, tepid drinks; by frequent reſt on a bed or ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fa; and, occaſionally, by the uſe of opiates.</p>
                     <p>II. MAENORRHAGIA.—The menſes are only to be conſidered as exceſſive, when the periods recur ſo often, the duration is ſo long, or the quantity eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated ſo great, as to induce debility, with its uſual ſymptoms. In all theſe caſes, Leucorrhoea is a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent attendant. The cauſes may be active or paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, in common with other preternatural haemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhagies. Of the former are, Plethora, univerſal or local; increaſed action of the veſſels from fever; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive exerciſe, paſſions; ſtimuli applied to the ute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, or neighbouring parts; and every cauſe which determines the blood more forcibly to the uterus. Of the latter, Relaxation, univerſal or local. To diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh <hi>active</hi> from <hi>paſſive</hi> maenorrhagia, is of the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt conſequence in directing the treatment.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>firſt</hi> caſe, which is generally preceded with headach, oppreſſed breathing, attended with
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:022551_0098_0FB9421DB524F330"/>
heat, thirſt, quick full pulſe, and other febrile ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, ſhe muſt be exceedingly cautious of giving a ſudden check to the flow, till the veſſels have been ſufficiently emptied, naturally from the diſcharge, or by the prudent uſe of venaeſection. A ſpare cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diet, cool air, open belly, and the ſtricteſt anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlogiſtic regimen, are then eſſentially neceſſary. Heat, violent agitations and exerciſe, and every cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal and mental exertion, ſhould be avoided.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>paſſive</hi> maenorrhagia, the diſcharge, muſt be-moderated by ſtyptics and opiates given internally; by cold wet applications to the pubes and external parts; by confinement to a horizontal poſture on a firm bed, with hair matreſs, and few bed cloaths; by giving cold aſtringent drinks; and by avoiding e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very cauſe of irritation.</p>
                     <p>The vis vitae muſt be duly ſupported by nouriſhing diet; but while the flow continues, every thing of the ſtimulating kind under the name of <hi>cordial</hi> muſt be very cautiouſly uſed.</p>
                     <p>When the haemorrhagy hath entirely ceaſed, the interval muſt be improved to uſe the proper means for reſtoring the conſtitution. Of theſe, ſtrengthening diet, the moderate uſe of cordials, gentle exerciſe, the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruvian bark, and chalybeates, are principally to be relied on. In ſome paſſive caſes, the ſlow is almoſt conſtant cordials and tonics are then particularly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated: and gentle exerciſe in a carriage has been often known to moderate or ſuppreſs the flow.</p>

Under this article of <hi>Maenorrhagia</hi> may alſo be mentioned,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Irregularities towards the ceſſation of the menſtrua.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The menſes generally become irregular towards their final ceſſation. This critical period in the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male conſtitution is commonly announced by irregular interruptions, unexpected returns, or immoderate diſcharges; in many inſtances, by exceſſive, long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, or frequent and alarming floodings. The ſymptoms aſſume a variety of appearance, as influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by conſtitution, habit, manner of life, and the ſtate of the uterine ſyſtem. They are rather to be conſidered as the conſequence of a general change in the conſtitution, which terminates the age of child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing, than merely the effects of an accidental inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, or exceſs of the periodical evacuation.</p>
                     <p>Every important change which the conſtitution ſuffers, is introduced by ſlow and inſenſible degrees: the alarming ſymptoms which at this period occur, proceed from the decline of life ſtrictly ſpeaking, a diſeaſed ſtate of the uterus, or may be aſcribed to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken management. In ſome women, the menſes take their leave more abruptly; in other more ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and no material inconvenience is perceived in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſe. Women who never had children, nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed good regular health, or whoſe conſtitution is impaired by frequent labours or miſcarriage, the ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:022551_0100_0FB94220AB587F20"/>
and delicate, are more commonly the ſubjects of complaint towards this period.</p>
                     <p>The particular ſymptoms and conſtitution, the age of the patient, her manner of life, and other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances formerly mentioned, will direct the proper treatment.</p>
                     <p>If no obvious inconvenience ariſes from the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the menſes, it would ſurely be abſurd to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure the conſtitution by a ſudden change of manner of living, by abſtemious diet and debilitating eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations. On the contrary, if the ſymptoms indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate a full habit and plethoric diatheſis, venaeſection, purgatives, and ſpare diet, will then be neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>Frequent or immoderate floodings, attended with ſymptoms of debility, muſt be treated as already di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected. In relaxed weakly women, the conſequences are always to be leſs or more dreaded: the flux muſt be checked by cold wet applications; the painful ſymptoms relieved by opiates; and the conſtitution afterwards ſtrengthened by nutritious diet, bitters, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Shooting pains about the region of the uterus, the pubes, and breaſts, along with frequent floodings, or leucorrhoea, indicate ſuſpicion of ſcirrhous or cance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous diſpoſition, and are generally preludes of diſeaſe which ſoon ends fatally, or renders the remains of life uncomfortable.</p>
                     <p>Floodings, ſeemingly alarming and hazardous
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:022551_0101_0FB942222A270400"/>
from their exceſs or frequency, are never to be dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, while no quantity of clots or concretions are void<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, while they are unaccompanied with violent pain in the hypogaſtric region or other ſymptoms of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid prediſpoſition. They may generally be modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by ſome of the means formerly recommended in <hi>maenorrhagia;</hi> and if the ſtrength be kept up, though the haemorrhagy may occaſionally recur at vague and irregular periods, even for two or three years, I have never, in the courſe a long practice, known it to end fatally in a ſingle inſtance: a complete recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is generally at laſt accompliſhed, and the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution reſtored, with the proſpect of a ſtate of good health for a conſiderable time after.</p>
                     <p>III. LEUCORRHOEA, <hi>Fluor Albus,</hi> or <hi>Whites,</hi> is a diſcharge of ſerous or mucous matter of a whitiſh colour, from the vagina. Its ſource is chiefly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be from the veſſels which pour out the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrual blood; and the diſcharge is therefore conſidered as a mere depravity, or morbid ſtate, of the catame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia: but it probably often proceeds from the glands at the cervix uteri, and not unfrequently from the lacunae of thoſe of the vagina; for many women ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to leucorrhoea have the diſcharge nearly of the uſual appearance and quantity during pregnancy, and it is more ſeldom obſerved to be periodical. Its co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and conſiſtence vary according to the nature and duration of the diſeaſe, the conſtitution, ſeaſon, cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:022551_0102_0FB94223B1F6B9C8"/>
and other circumſtances. It is probably mild and ſerous when firſt poured out; afterwards, by ſtagnating, becomes more thick and acrid, varying alſo in colour and odour.</p>
                     <p>Few women, ſomewhat advanced in life, eſpecially thoſe who have had children, who have been ſubject to miſcarriage, or irregularities of menſtrua, are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely free from it. The inactive and ſedentary; full, jolly, or flabby women; and the relaxed and weakly; are eſpecially liable to it.</p>
                     <p>Pain and weakneſs of the back and loins, diſpepſia, and the other ſymptoms of debility and indigeſtion, ſuppoſed to be its almoſt conſtant attendants, only occur when the diſcharge is exceſſive or very long continued. From quantity, or acrimony, eſpecially in warm weather, in groſs habits, or from neglect to keep the parts clean, painful excoriations are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently occaſioned: in that ſtate it may be readily confounded with <hi>gonorrhoea.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The cure muſt be regulated by particular circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. Groſs habits, and thoſe who have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to full rich diet, with little excerciſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire frequent purging, along with a mild ſpare diet and cooling regimen. In weakly relaxed conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, the indications are, To reſtore the tone and vigour of the ſyſtem, by proper regimen; bark, mineral waters, with ſteel and alum, and the cold bath.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="113" facs="unknown:022551_0103_0FB94225336D2558"/>
In either caſe, the parts ſhould be kept clean by frequent cold bathing. Any gently aſtringent waſh, after general evacuations, may be freely uſed in the former caſe: and in the latter, injections of alum-water, tinctura roſarum, or bals. traumatic. in a very dilute ſtate, or waſhing the parts with a ſponge ſoaked in the ſtyptic liquor, often ſenſibly diminiſh the diſcharge; and, in recent caſes, entirely remove it.</p>
                     <p>Gellies of hartſhorn, or ichthyocolla, bals. capivi, and topical aſtringent injections and waſhes, are the beſt palliatives.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Leucorrhoea</hi> may be diſtinguiſhed into <hi>local</hi> and <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral;</hi> a morbid affection of the parts, or a weakneſs of the ſyſtem, In the former caſe, aſtringent waſhes or injections; in the latter, tonics, as bark or bitters, with lime-water, have the beſt effects.

                     <p>FUROR UTERINUS. There is a ſpecies of fluor albus, deſcribed by many authors under the name of <hi>furor uterinus.</hi> But even the exiſtence of that diſeaſe is as confidently denied: We can at leaſt with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence aſſert, that the real nympho-mania is rarely known in this country. Nothing farther is probably meant by it, than an increaſed acrimony of the fluor albus, occaſioning heat, pain, itching, and of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:022551_0104_0FB94228E21CAA80"/>
irritation in theſe parts. The cure muſt therefore be conducted nearly in the ſame manner as in the former diſeaſe: The parts ſhould be conſtantly kept clean by frequent bathing, or injections; of theſe a dilute ſolution of ſacch. ſaturni in roſe-water has been generally found to prove the moſt ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; a cooling regimen muſt alſo be enjoined, and occaſional cauſes counteracted. Sometimes the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of this irritation has been diſcovered within the urethra, when the bougie has proved the cure.</p>
                     <p>STERILITY. From moſt of the preceding com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, and from various other diſeaſes incident to thoſe parts, the uterus may be unfit to receive or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the male ſeed; or the tubes may be too ſhort, or may have loſt their erective power: in theſe caſes, no conception can take place. Or, either from uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal debility and relaxation, or a local one of the genital ſyſtem, the tone and contractile power of theſe parts may be deſtroyed, ſo that the ſemen is thrown off immediately <hi>poſt coitum;</hi> which will in like manner occaſion ſterility. Theſe cauſes of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſs are obvious; for where the aperture of the vagina, or of the uterus was impervious, there is not one inſtance of conception to be found in the records of medicine. The ſame effects generally follow from imperforation of the tubes, or diſeaſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varia.</p>
                     <p>There are, however, many other cauſes of ſterility;
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:022551_0105_0FB9422B4A3284F8"/>
but theſe, while the manner of generation is a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, are beyond the power of phiſiological inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.—Hence medical treatment can only avail in caſes ariſing from univerſal and topical debility; in correcting irregularities of the menſtrual flux, one of the moſt common cauſes of barrenneſs; and in removing tumors, cicatrices, or conſtrictions of the paſſages, by the art of ſurgery.</p>

                     <p>VARIOUS diſeaſes incident to the uterine ſyſtem, and other morbid affections of the abdominal viſcera, frequently excite the ſymptoms, and aſſume the appearance, of uterine geſtation<note n="*" place="bottom">Vid Morgagni de cauſis et ſed.

In many of theſe caſes, the menſes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appear; nauſea, retchings, and other ſymptoms of breeding enſue. Flatus in the bowels is miſtaken for the motion of the child; and in the advanced ſtages of the diſeaſe, from the preſſure of the ſwelling on the adjacent parts, tumefaction and hardneſs of the mammae ſupervene, and ſometimes a viſcid ſerous fluid diſtills from the nipple.

                  <p>THE changes introduced by conception, frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prove the ſource of diſorders which aſſume a variety of appearance in different conſtitutions, and at different periods of pregnancy.

                  <p>Some women, ſoon after conception, ſuffer the moſt violent ſickneſs and feveriſh indiſpoſition, which harraſs and diſtreſs them for ſeveral months; and, in ſome inſtances, continue during the whole term of geſtation.

                  <p>In the pregnant ſtate, the courſes are generally ſtopped; and conſequently, the determination of the blood is altered: from this difference of determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion many of the ſymtoms of pregnancy may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for; particularly the appearance of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and ſometimes of a local, plethora. It muſt be confeſſed, however, that many of the ſymtoms ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be entirely of the nervous kind, and not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily explicable in the preſent ſtate of our Phyſiology: but they are ſuch as the ſtoppage of any accuſtomed evacuation will often produce.</p>

                     <p>The ſickneſs from breeding is ſometimes ſo ſevere as to reſemble ſea-ſickneſs, and it is often as little in our power to relieve it. Theſe early ſymtoms have been generally aſcribed to the ſtoppage of the menſes, altho' they commence often before the obſtruction occurs. In many conſtitutions, however, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the young and healthy, a certain degree of ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoric diſpoſition, even in the more early periods of pregnancy, ſeems to prevail; ſmall bleedings, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore where the ſickneſs is attended with fluſhings, dry parched mouth and ſauces, vertigo, or any other ſymtoms of fever, are ſafe and beneficial, and often give all the relief in our power to afford. Although a raſh, indiſcriminate, or frequent uſe of venaeſection is to be guarded againſt as a hazardous expedient; on the contrary, if prudently employed, it may often be the means of preventing abortion. It may be ſafely performed at any time of geſtation, and repeated ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the urgency of the ſymtoms. But ſmall bleedings are always to be preferred to copious eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations; which, in every period of pregnancy, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in the early months, when the hazard of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage is greateſt, ſhould be avoided.</p>

                        </gap>uan, or of infuſions of chamomile flowers or of carduus. The violent efforts of natural vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting, which threaten the moſt diſagreeable conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, and ſometimes actually throw off the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, are in ſome inſtances entirely removed, in many caſes greatly diminiſhed, after the operation of a gentle emetic.</p>
                     <p>Small doſes of rhubarb ſhould be given to keep the body moderately open: the patient ſhould alſo be put on a courſe of light, aromatic, and ſtrengthening bitters; and her diet, air, exerciſe, and amuſement ſhould be properly regulated.</p>
                     <p>In conſtitutions of the nervous irritable kind, opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates ſometimes procure a temporary relief from ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and vomiting, when every other remedy fails.</p>
                     <p>VERTIGO AND DROWSINESS.—Theſe prooceed from fullneſs and plethora, connected with a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſtate of the nervous ſyſtem. Small bleedings when very troubleſome, gentle exerciſe, an abſtemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous temperate diet, and every means of obviating ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thora, and diverting the attention by promoting a cheerful ſtate of mind, are the beſt remedies.</p>
                     <p>HEARTBURN, DIARRHOEA, &amp;c. are common ſymptoms of breeding-ſickneſs, and muſt be treated nearly in the ſame manner as ſimilar complaints from other cauſes. They chiefly depend on the ſtate of
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:022551_0111_0FB9423BB253C618"/>
the ſtomach, peculiarly influenced by that of the uterus. The aſceſcent tendency of the ſtomach ſhould be obviated, and the digeſtive faculty reſtored.</p>
                     <p>TUMEFACTION, TENSION, <hi>and</hi> PAINS <hi>in the</hi> MAMMAE.—If tight lacing be only avoided, and the breaſts be permitted to expand, no material in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience will ariſe from their enlargement. Theſe ſymptoms are the natural conſequence of a natural cauſe, and ſeldom require medical treatment. If they ſhould be very troubleſome and uneaſy, bathing with oil, or anointing with pomatum, and covering them with ſoft flannel or fur, will in moſt caſes leſſen the painful tenſion. In plethoric habits, where painful hardneſs and ſwelling are exceſſive, and do not readily yield to more ſimple remedies, venaeſection and gentle purging may be neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>DELIQUIA, NERVOUS or HYSTERIC FITS—Lowlineſs and depreſſion of ſpirits are incident to the early ſtages of pregnancy, and are merely the effects of uterine irritability communicated to the nervous ſyſtem; for the mind, as well as the body, is <hi>then</hi> pecularly ſuſceptible of irritation.</p>
                     <p>FAINTINGS more ſeldom occur, but about the term of quickening. They ſeem to ariſe from the ſudden change of poſition of the uterus, emerging from its more cloſe confinement within the bony pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietes of the pelvis, and from the irritation communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by the child's motion. They are commonly
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:022551_0112_0FB9423D27FA8710"/>
ſlight and tranſient, and leave no bad effects behind them.</p>
                     <p>DELIQUIA, which are occaſioned by falls, frights and paſſions of the mind, are of more ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, and the ſhock is frequently fatal to the child.</p>
                     <p>THE complaints which occur in the early months require a variety of treatment in different circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. When ſymptoms of fullneſs appear in young women, formerly healthy and accuſtomed to live well, indicated by pain or giddineſs of the head, fluſhings in the face and palms; or when the ſickneſs is conſtant or exceſſive; venaeſection, an open belly, with abſtemious diet, and every other means to obviate plethoric diſpoſition, muſt be uſed. But, in oppoſite circumſtances, where there is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of nervous delicacy, along with ſymptoms of dyſpepſia and conſequent debility, bleeding muſt be avoided with the ſtricteſt care. Nouriſhing diet given in ſmall quantities and often repeated, the moderate uſe of cordials, good air, cheerful ſociety, eaſy exerciſe, variation of ſcene, ſuited to the peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar circumſtances of the patient, and, in a word, thoſe means adapted to ſooth or diminiſh ſenſibility and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                        <p>The cure conſiſts in reſtoring the uterus to its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per poſition, and guarding againſt the hazard of relapſe.</p>
                        <p>Previous to attempting the reduction of the uterus, the counteracting obſtacles muſt be removed. With this view, repeated venaeſection may be neceſſary; fomentations, or the ſemicupium, ſhould be uſed to diminiſh ſwelling and inflammation; the catheter ſhould be paſſed to evacuate the urine; and the rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum ſhould be waſhed out with repeated glyſters.</p>
                        <p>The reduction of the uterine tumor ſhould then be attempted, by placing the patient on her knees and arms, with her head reclined and properly ſupported, endeavouring, by every poſſible means, to reſtore the uterus to its proper poſition. The force employed ſhould be gentle at firſt, preſſing backwards and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in different directions, (to draw the os tincae down from the pubes), not by ſtarts, but conſtantly

and equally, gradually increaſing the exertions of force, as far as they can ſafely be carried, till the end in view be obtained.</p>
                        <p>After the reduction the patient muſt be confined moſtly to bed, and the diſtention of the bladder and rectum muſt be carefully prevented, till the uterus riſes above the brim of the pelvis, when ſhe will be ſecured from future danger. But if the obſtinacy of the diſeaſe ſhould render every effort ineffectual ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to evacuate the urine or replace the uterus, it has been propoſed to puncture the bladder at the pubes; and, if that ſhould fail to facilitate the reduction, to thruſt a trocar into the ſubſtance of the uterus to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure abortion; or to enlarge the pelvis by inciſion at the ſymphyſis pubes, in order to accompliſh the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the uterus.—The two firſt propoſals are ſhocking and deſperate: the laſt gives a more reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able proſpect of ſaving both the mother and child.</p>

                        <p>It may be obviated or prevented, by attention to diet, and the occaſional uſe of gentle laxatives; of theſe ripe fruit, magneſia, cream of tartar, ſoluble tartar, lenitive electuary, ol. ricini, or an aloetic pill, when the patient is not ſubject to any haemorrhoidal

affection, or has been formerly accuſtomed to it, are the moſt proper.</p>
                        <p>But in caſes of obſtinate coſtiveneſs, to break down and remove indurated ſcybili, emollient gly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, occaſionally rendered moderately ſtimulent with ſoap, or a ſmall proportion of common ſalt, ought to be repeatedly exhibited.</p>
                        <p>PILES—are ſmall tumors placed a little way within the rectum, or protruding like varicous ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings without the verge of the anus, attended with throbbing pain, heat itching; frequently with fever and reſtleſſneſs, and ſometimes liable to frequent or exceſſive haemorrhagies. Their occaſional cauſes chiefly are, coſtiveneſs, and venous plethroa from geſtation.</p>
                        <p>The treatment ſhould be directed nearly on the ſame principles as ſimilar caſes from other cauſes with the precaution which pregnancy ſuggeſts. Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiveneſs muſt be obviated by cooling laxatives: of which cream of tartar and flowers of ſulphur are the beſt.

They are merely ſymptomatic, and only attended with a temporary inconvenience; as almoſt in every inſtance, where the conſtitution is otherwiſe unim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, they ſubſide immediately after delivery.</p>
                        <p>The beſt palliatives are—ſmall bleedings and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle purgatives, with a light ſpare diet, if the patient be full and plethoric; if otherwiſe, ſtrengthening diet, the moderate uſe of cordials, an open belly, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent reſt on a bed or couch: and in either caſe, eaſy exerciſe when ſhe is able to bear it, and friction with a fleſh-bruſh, applied to the legs evening and morning, to promote the circulation and abſorption of the ſtagnant fluids.</p>
                        <p>VARICOUS SWELLINGS are merely diſtentions of the coats of the veins from venous plethora, occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by preſſure of the gravid uterus. They are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally confined to the legs or thighs, and ſeldom proceed ſo far as to burſt and throw out their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents. When very large or painful, gentle eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations may be neceſſary; and topical aſtringent applications uſed, to remove local laxity; as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes ſoaked in any ſtyptic liquor, and retained by
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:022551_0120_0FB9424922CB0738"/>
the application of a bandage. A moderate preſſure on the part by compreſs and bandage, when the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulation is conſiderable, will, in moſt caſes be ſufficient to remove any inconvenience occaſioned by the ſwelling till delivery; ſoon after which, they generally diſappear, or are conſiderably leſſened.</p>
                        <p>PAINS in the BACK or LOINS, COLIC, CRAMP —are occaſioned by the ſtretching of the uterus, or by its preſſure on the neighbouring parts, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the diaphragm. They are moſt troubleſome in a firſt pregnancy, or when the diſtention of the abdomen is enormous.—Small bleedings, gentle laxatives, a light ſpare diet, and occaſional opiates, are the beſt palliatives.</p>
                        <p>If the patient be of a full habit, and where a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to inflammatory complaints prevails, any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent fixed pain about the back or loins, along with fever, or in the abdominal viſcera, exciting ſymptoms of <hi>Colic,</hi> is highly alarming and dangerous in advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced geſtation where the preſſure is great. The threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening event can only be prevented by repeated venaeſection, and the antiphlogiſtic treatment.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Cramps</hi> are ſometimes very troubleſome towards the latter end of geſtation.

Their occaſional cauſes are, the ſtretching of

the womb, or its continued preſſure on one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar part.—When frequent or violent, and the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit is full or plethoric, bleeding is neceſſary. The ſudden expoſure of the body to cold, or change of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, as getting out of bed and walking about, may be often ſufficient to give a temporary relief; and opiates may be uſeful to leſſon nervous irritability.</p>
                        <p>COUGH, DISPNOEA, VOMITINGS, DIFFICUL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TY or INCONTINENCY of URINE—The cauſe in advanced geſtation is ſufficiently obvious. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of theſe ſymptoms are chiefly to be alleviated by ſmall bleedings, gentle laxatives, light ſpare di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, and opiates. The patient ſhould be placed, when in bed, in an eaſy poſture, with her head and ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders conſiderably raiſed, and the bed-room ſhould be as large and airy as poſſible.

                        <p>THE appearance of epileptic fits in pregnant wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men is frightful; the ſymptoms are alarming; and the event is always precarious, often fatal.</p>

The paroxyſms generally come on without any obvious prelude. Headach intolerably violent, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe pain or oppreſſion about the praecordia, are the moſt common preſaging ſymptoms.</p>
                        <p>At whatever term of geſtation, there is great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; but, in the advanced months, the diſeaſe is more deſperate. The danger is alſo to be judged of by the violence of the ſymptoms, the duration and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of the fits, connected with the occaſional cauſe and conſtitutional temperament of the patient, and from her condition during their remiſſion.</p>
                        <p>The remote cauſes are, Increaſed irritability from pregnancy, particularly uterine irritability communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by ſympathy to the encephalon, in ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances probably originating from the ſtruggles or convulſive motions of the foetus, ariſing from its aukward or hampered poſition; and preſſure of the gravid uterus interrupting the circulation through the abdominal viſcera, diſturbing their functions, and changing the determination both of the circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting fluid and nervous energy. They may alſo ariſe from inanition, in conſequence of profuſe haemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhagies, or other debilitating evacuations; or be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by mechanical injury of the uterus, from violent bruiſes, wounds, &amp;c. and by paſſions of the mind, and other occaſional cauſes, ſufficient to bring on convulſions in the unempregnated ſtate.</p>
                        <p>Hyſteric or nervous ſpaſms are readily diſtinguiſhed
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:022551_0123_0FB9424F28C8F6B8"/>
from convulſions. The former are milder than the latter in their ſymptoms; and much leſs frightful in appearance, by the abſence of foamings and diſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: They have no ſenſible effect in bringing on la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; they are ſeldom followed with bad conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and yield to the common treatment. Women of vigorous conſtitutions, rigid fibres, and plethoric habits, are more uſually the ſubjects of the latter: the delicate, the nervous, and irritable, of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
                        <p>Convulſions, during pregnancy, may be referred to three dictinct periods at which they may occur; thoſe of the early months, thoſe of the latter, and thoſe that come on along with labour.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Thoſe which appear in early geſtation, chiefly happen to young women of a plethoric habit; and can only be obviated or palliated by a free uſe of the lancet, by gentle purging, cooling regimen, and low diet. After ſome evacuations in this way, if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant nauſeating ſickneſs <hi>ſtrongly</hi> indicate a diſordered ſtomach, a mild emetic may be of uſe; but it ſhould be employed with the moſt judicious and guarded caution.</p>
                        <p>In oppoſite circumſtances, a different treatment muſt be directed. Opiates, or caſtor and muſk given internally, emollient glyſters, warm fomentations applied to the legs, the ſemicupium, and every means to ſoothe nervous irritability and remove ſpaſmodic
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:022551_0124_0FB9425767E420B0"/>
ſtricture, will then prove the moſt effectual remedies. When it cannot be received into or retained in the ſtomach, opium, in large quantities, ſhould be exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by way of glyſter.</p>
                        <p>When the patient is totally inſenſible and coma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toſe, ſtimulating purgative glyſters ſhould be given; and epiſpaſtic and ſtimulating cataplaſms, in order to rouſe her, ſhould be applied to the legs and hams. In deſperate circumſtances, the ſemicupium, or warm bath, ſhould be frequently uſed, and long continued, with a view to relax and open the orifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium uteri, and bring on labour.</p>
                        <p>In the intervals of the paroxyſms, or after they have ceaſed, the patient, when languid or much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, muſt be ſupported by nouriſhing diet and ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table cordials; and, when ſhe is no longer able to ſwallow, nouriſhment muſt be ſupplied by way of glyſter.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. In the advanced months, the attacks are more ſudden, the progreſs more rapid, and the event more fatal, than in early geſtation: therefore the moſt active and vigorous meaſures are neceſſary; for, like appolexy, a fit or two then, in ſome inſtances, terminates the diſeaſe with the loſs of life. If any treatment can prevent the threatening cataſtrophe, immediate and copious venaeſection, occaſionally repeated, may chiefly be relied on.</p>

NEPHRITIS and CALCULI. The former muſt be palliated by venaeſection, diluent drinks, opiates. If the calculus ſticks in the urethra, and the woman is near her time, it ſhould, if poſſible, be puſhed back into the bladder with the catheter: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, when eaſily come at, the ſtone may be cut upon and extracted.</p>

Bandages can ſeldom be uſed with ſafety in the pregnant ſtate; at leaſt tight preſſure by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon umbilical bandage muſt be avoided.

THE FLUOR ALBUS or LEUCORRHOEA—is ſometimes cured, ſometimes increaſed, by geſtation. Except the little variety which an attention to the gravid ſtate requires, the cure is the ſame as at other times.</p>
                     <p>GONORRHOEA and LUES VENEREA.—The cure of the former is to be conducted inpretty much the uſual manner; that is, by keeping the parts clean by frequent bathing by drinking freely of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luent drinks, by an open belly and cooling diet. If complicated with ulcers and chancres within the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia, or any where about the vulva, the prudent uſe of mercury becomes requiſite: It may either be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven internally, or rubbed on the ſkin by way of uncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>In the confirmed lues, we can only, in general, propoſe to ſtop the progreſs of the diſeaſe, or palliate the ſeverity of the ſymptoms. But, in early preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy, when the conſtitution is good, and the ſeaſon favourable, if a mercurial courſe be regulated with prudence, both mother and child may obtain a radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal cure.

FEVERS.—Women are leſs ſubject to febrile diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders during pregnancy than at other times. There is, however, an univerſal heat all over the body; which with ſome is a ſymptom of conception, and with others continues during the whole term, that hardly deſerves that name.</p>
                     <p>The limits of the preſent work neither admit of of our entering into any diſquiſition on the nature of fever in general; or the treatment of the variety of ſpecies. All great evacuations muſt then be avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and whatever might excite any violent ſhock to endanger abortion and its conſequences. The treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt otherwiſe be directed on the common principles, attending to the management neceſſary to be obſerved in circumſtances ſo peculiarly critical.</p>

                     <p>ABORTION, and its common attendant FLOOD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING, are neither confined to the early nor latter months; but happen indiſcriminately to every peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od of geſtation. The one is a frequent conſequence of the other, and the event is often hazardous. In the earlier months, when the child has little life, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable diſcharge of blood frequently precedes the expulſion of the ovum; and, in the latter ſtages, the effuſion is ſometimes ſo exceſſive as to endanger the mother's life.</p>

Floodings ſeldom prove fatal to the mother before the ſeventh month of geſtation, but are afterwards proportionally more alarming and dangerous. In the early months, there is always hazard of the loſs of the foetus, even from an inconſiderable diſcharge; and from the increaſed diameter of the blood-veſſels in the more advanced periods, the diſcharge is often fatal to the parent.</p>
                        <p>To check the haemorrhagy, the indications are,
<list>
                              <item>I. To diminiſh plethora, as well as the impetus of the heart and arteries.</item>
                              <item>II. To reſtore a more equable circulation in the whole ſyſtem.</item>
                              <item>III. To reſtore the tone of the ſolids, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the conſtriction of the veſſels.</item>
                           </list>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. To anſwer the firſt intention, venaeſection, a free circulation of cool air, coolling diet, drink, and other refrigerants, are the principal remedies.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The ſecond indication is with difficulty fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed; for the exertion which the ſeveral remedies that produce this effect occaſion, will be often very hurtful.</p>
                        <p>Vomiting and purging, except with the moſt cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neutrals, are ſeldom admiſſible; and warmth, applied to the ſurface, is equivocal in its effects. The only means, therefore, which we can recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend with this view, is to keep the feet warm with flannels and gentle friction, and the body and mind
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:022551_0131_0FB9426BA95B43D8"/>
in the moſt perfect tranquillity. Opium, in the form of of Dover's powder, is alſo frequently effectual in ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the circulating more uniform and equable. Might not the opium and ipecacuan only, be kept mixed, and the powder given in thoſe caſes, in freſh ſolution of nitre, in a full doſe? Such a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mula would probably be a powerful remedy for hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhagies of all kinds.</p>
                        <p>Some of the cauſes which we have mentioned are evidently beyond our reach. Theſe indications are, however, chiefly uſeful in the early ſtages: the eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation itſelf ſoon takes off plethora, as well as the haemorrhagic effort of the heart and arteries; ſo that the chief buſineſs of the practitioner is,</p>
                        <p n="3">3. To reſtore the tone of the ſolids, and promote the conſtriction of the veſſels. With this view, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal aſtringents, and the application of cold, are the moſt effectual means. The ſtyptics generally employed are, the vitriolic acid, alum, terra Japo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica, and gum kino: but cold applications to the pudendum and neighbouring parts are chiefly to be truſted; as thick linen compreſſes wet with cold vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar and water, applied to the os externum, pubes, and loins, and often renewed leſt they ſhould become warm. A bladder with cold water, in which ſome crude ſal ammoniac is diſſolved, may be uſed for a topical application, and will retain the cold fluid lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than any other compreſs.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="142" facs="unknown:022551_0132_0FB9426D2DC5E540"/>
By thus keeping the patient quiet and cool, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving internally cooling things and opiates, and by the application of cold to the organ affected, the haemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhagy may be reſtrained, tho' threatening and alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and the woman, after ſeveral attacks, may, under proper management, be enabled to carry the child to the full term of delivery.</p>
                        <p>Debility and relaxation muſt afterwards be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, by nouriſhing diet and tonic remedies; and, in relaxed habits, the hazard of relapſe guarded againſt by the uſe of the Peruvian bark, moderate exerciſe, and the other remedies uſually employed after caſes of profuſe menorrhagia. In full habits, or where there is an evident diſpoſition to plethora, gentle eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations, cooling regimen, and an abſtemious ſpare diet, are the beſt prophylactics.</p>
                        <p>In the latter end of pregnancy, when the haemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhagy proceeds from the ſeparation of a portion of the cake which adhered at the cervix, over the orifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium uteri, the deluge is ſometimes ſo impetuous as to kill the mother very ſuddenly. The only method, then, in our power, for preſerving both the parent and child, is by an <hi>expeditious delivery;</hi> I mean expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious with reſpect to the time it is attempted, for the operation of delivery ſhould be ſlowly perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
                        <p>In all caſes of flooding, when any portion of the pappy ſubſtance of placenta can be felt by the finger
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:022551_0133_0FB94270269EAC48"/>
to preſent before the child, delivery ſhould be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as ſoon as the orifice of the womb is ſufficiently relaxed to admit of the introduction of the hand, after gently ſtretching<note n="*" place="bottom">See a valuable eſſay on this ſubject by Mr Rigby.</note>: and if the repetition of floodings without pain be frequent, or the diſcharge ſo profuſe as to bring on faintings, it may be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to deliver, even though there ſhould be no ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible dilatation of the uterine orifice, and though no part of the placenta can be felt to the touch; for, if the woman is previouſly much exhauſted, ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaved by delivery.</p>

                        <head>II. ABORTION.</head>
                        <p>ABORTION is, "The premature delivery of the foetus;" which comprehends every period before the evolution of its ſyſtem be ſufficiently complete to enable the child to exiſt after the connection with the parent is diſſolved.</p>
                        <p>Some authors ſtill make the following diſtinction. When the ovum is expelled in the early months, they call it an <hi>abortion;</hi> and, if the foetus be delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at any period between the fifth month and the full time, a <hi>miſcarriage.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Abortion is commonly preceded by ſome of the following ſymptoms: Flooding, pains in the back or belly, uterine bearing-down pains with regular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſions, the diſcharge of a watery fluid.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="144" facs="unknown:022551_0134_0FB94271AC98FE00"/>
If, along with flooding, any portion of a vaſcular ſkinny ſubſtance, which is the membrana dicidua, ſhould be diſcharged, abortion for certain will enſue. None of the other ſymptoms are infallible; even the evacuation of a watery fluid is not neceſſarily follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with delivery, ſince it may proceed from a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection on the outſide of the ovum, between the lamellae of the membranes. In the early months exceſſive floodings ſometimes occur; and yet, by proper management, the woman is often enabled to retain the child.</p>
                        <p>There is leſs fear of abortion while the blood eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated is pure and without clots, unattended with uterine pain and preſſure. But, in forming a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the conſtitution, occaſional cauſe, and term of geſtation, muſt be regarded.</p>
                        <p>Abortions happen more frequently from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the ſecond to the end of the third month, that at any other period.</p>
                        <p>The immediate cauſe of abortion is the ſame with that of real labour.</p>
                        <p>The more remote cauſes are,</p>
                        <p>I. Whatever interrupts the regular circulation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the uterus and placenta; as,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Diſeaſes of the uterus.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Imperviouſneſs, or ſpaſmodic conſtriction, of the extremities of the uterine blood-veſſels.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The ſeparation of any portion of the cake, or
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:022551_0135_0FB942776101B8E8"/>
decidua, from the uterus.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Determination of the fluids to other parts.</p>
                        <p>II. Every cauſe which prevents the diſtention of the uterus, or excites ſpaſmodic contraction of its muſcular fibres; as,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Extreme irritability, preventing the extenſion of that organ.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Violent exertions, as coughing, ſneezing, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting, ſtraining at ſtool: mechanical injuries, as ſtrains, falls, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Irritation from the confined motion of the foetus, its kicking or ſtrugglings.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. A habitual diſpoſition to abortion.</p>
                        <p>III. The death of the foetus; which many be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned from,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Diſeaſes peculiar to itſelf.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. An original defect tranſmitted from the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. External accidents affecting the mother.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. diſeaſes of the placenta, membranes, or cord.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Too ſlight adheſion of the cake or membranes to the uterus.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Weakneſs, or want of reſiſtance, in the tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the membranes; or an exceſſive quantity of the liquor amnii.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Knotty circumvolutions of the umbilical cord.</p>
                        <p>The ſize of the obortive ovum in early geſtation is as follows: Six weeks after conception, its bulk is
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:022551_0136_0FB9427C964B36E0"/>
nearly equal to a pigeon's egg; in eight weeks, to that of a hen; and in twelve to that of a gooſe.</p>
                        <p>Where there is no reaſon to dread abortion, every probable mean ought to be employed to relieve pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſymptoms by reſt and opiates, to check haemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhagy by the means already directed, and to obviate occaſional cauſes as much as poſſible; and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhould be encouraged to hope as long as there is grounds for it.</p>
                        <p>As abortion, in many inſtances, is preceded by no alarming ſymptom, till a diſcharge of watery fluid, or an exceſſive flooding, with clots and portions of the decidua, announce the approaching event; either to remove immediate ſymptoms, or prevent the accident that is dreaded, often baffles our boaſted ſkill; for the circulation in the ovum perhaps had ceaſed a conſiderable time previous to any threatening ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of its expulſion.</p>
                        <p>Little, therefore, can or ought to be done by way of treatment, beſides obviating plethora, adviſing reſt of body and tranquillity of mind, and guarding againſt every cauſe of irritation. Though the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may ſuffer a conſiderable ſhock from miſcarriage, and it may be ſome time before her conſtitution be ſufficiently reſtored for any future fortunate preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy, women are rarely known to ſuffer fatally, but from miſmanagement in the early months. Any manual operation to aſſiſt delivery, is ſeldom neceſſary
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:022551_0137_0FB942847591A368"/>
at an earlier period than the ſixth month of geſtation, unleſs the mother's life ſhould be in danger from flooding. When this happens, the bag may be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by thruſting the finger againſt it in time of pain, or endeavouring to aſſiſt its expulſion when within reach of the finger; but otherwiſe the delivery ſhould be <hi>wholly</hi> truſted to nature. It is even hazardous to deſtroy the ſtructure of the ovum in the early months: for when it breaks, the ſmall foetus is firſt expelled; and the bag or placenta may be afterwards retained for a week or more, during which time the flooding often continues to be exceſſive; whereas, if the conception comes off entire, the effuſion ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ceaſes immediately.</p>
                        <p>From long retention, the placenta, without cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, is liable to become putrid: it is then expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in different portions; and inflammation, excori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, or gangrene of the uterus and vagina, often enſues. In theſe circumſtances there is a neceſſity for keeping the parts clean, by frequent bathing, or by injections thrown into the vagina; and bark, with elixir of vitriol, ſhould be given freely. Gently ſtimulating glyſters, to promote the contraction of the uterus, in caſes of retention of the placenta where there is no great flooding, are often uſeful.</p>
                        <p>As women who have once aborted are liable to a repetition of that accident from a ſimilar or very tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling occaſional cauſe, it ought to be guarded againſt
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:022551_0138_0FB94289A8D216A8"/>
by every poſſible means. With this view, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement during pregnancy ſhould be properly regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.</p>

                     <p n="4">4. The dreſs of pregnant women ought to be looſe and eaſy. Tight lacing is injurious at every period of geſtation. In the early months, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting the uterus from riſing out of the pelvis, it endangers miſcarriage, and is ſtill more hazardous in the advanced ſtages. Jumps, without knots, buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, or whale-bone, ſecured with ſtraps of broad tape or ribbon, ſhould be had recourſe to ſoon after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, and worn conſtantly.</p>

5. Pregnant women require free, pure air; their inclinations ſhould be gratified by every reaſonable indulgence; and their ſpirits kept up by cheerful company and variety of objects, that their minds may be always compoſed and happy.</p>

                     <p>WHEN the uterus will admit of no greater diſtention, without a material, or probably fatal diſorder, from its impeding the ſeveral functions, labour enſues.</p>
                     <p>At this period, the organization of the foetus is ſufficiently evolved to enable it to continue its exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; for as it derives no injury from a longer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, ſo it can ſurvive a ſlight acceleration of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant change.</p>
                     <p>The period of geſtation varies in the ſeveral claſſes of different animals. The mare, the cow, the ewe, and the goat, are reſtricted, each within its proper limits. In the human ſpecies, nine kalender months ſeem neceſſary for the perfection of the foetus; that is, nearly 39 weeks, or 273 days, from conception. The term does not, however, appear to be ſo ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrarily eſtabliſhed, but that Nature may tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:022551_0141_0FB94291E3C643A0"/>
her uſual laws; and, as many circumſtances frequently concur to anticipate delivery, it certainly may in ſome inſtances be protracted. Individuals of the ſame claſs of quadrupeds, it is well known, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in their periods of pregnancy. May we not from analogy, reaſonably infer, that women ſometimes exceed the more ordinary period? In ſeveral to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerably well atteſted caſes, the birth appears to have been protracted ſeveral weeks beyond the common term of delivery. If the character of the woman be unexceptionable, a favourable report may be given for the mother, though the child ſhould not be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced till nearly ten kalendar months after the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence or ſudden death of her huſband.</p>
                     <p>LABOUR is <q>an effort of nature to expel the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the gravid uterus.</q> It is chiefly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed by the ſpaſmodic contraction of the uterus itſelf. The diaphragm, muſcles of the abdomen, and others concerned in reſpiration, and all the muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the body, are called in as auxiliary powers. Theſe efforts alternate with intervals of eaſe; and the exertions, or parox<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                     <p>The <hi>immediate cauſe of labour</hi> ſeems to be, <q>Irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from previous diſtention of the uterus, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the foetus and waters.</q> The uterine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:022551_0142_0FB942936D3C46C8"/>
being propelled againſt the orifice, the muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſtructure of that organ will be ſtimulated into action, and labour-pains conſequently enſue.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>final cauſe</hi> of labour is, the birth of the child.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Spurious pains</hi> frequently occur towards the latter end of geſtation. Their cauſes are a ſlight degree of irritation of the uterus from exceſſive ſtretching; ſpaſmodic affections of the abdominal viſcera; or, any ſtimulus communicated from the inteſtinal canal, as colic from coſtiveneſs and other cauſes. They of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten nearly reſemble labour, and ought to be carefully diſtinguiſhed from it.</p>
                     <p>They are more vague and irregular, both in fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency and force, than thoſe ariſing from genuine labour; they do not produce any ſenſible change on the orificium uteri; they are not attended with any conſiderable diſcharge of the ropy mucus, which ſometimes precedes, and always accompanies, the firſt ſtage of real labour. They are generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to the lumbar region, or to the belly, without ſtriking down the thighs; they are commonly moſt troubleſome towards evening occaſion inquietude and reſtleſsneſs in the night, and abate in the morning. They are further known to be ſpurious, by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief procured from glyſters and opiates.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Genuine labour</hi> is known to approach from the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances which uſually precede it: the progreſs is
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:022551_0143_0FB9429896E09CF8"/>
marked by the duration, force, and frequency of the pains; by their effects on the general ſyſtem; more particularly by the dilatation of the uterine orifice, and protruſion of the water and child.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>ſymptoms of approaching labour</hi> are, the ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the abdominal tumor at the ſuperior part; hence, at firſt, a relief from weight, preſſure, and uneaſineſs formerly felt; afterwards, a diſcharge of ropy mucus from the vagina, ſometimes tinged or ſtreaked with blood, commonly ſtyled the <hi>ſhews;</hi> then, ſlight pains of the belly or loins, frequent mic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turition, ten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſmus, ſometimes colic or diarrhoea, extreme reſtleſſneſs, alternate rigours and hot fits.</p>
                     <p>The throes of labour uſually commence with pain in the region of the loins, which ſpread round for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and downwards, and again extend from the belly to the pubes, ſhooting down the thighs. At firſt they are vague, more ſlight and tranſitory; but gradually increaſe in force, and recur at more regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar intervals.</p>
                     <p>Sickneſs of the ſtomach, retching, and vomiting, alternate rigours and hot fits, in ſome inſtances ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the earlieſt ſymptoms of labour; in others, horripulatio occurs in the progreſs, and ſeems then to be occaſioned by the preſſure of the head of the foetus againſt the irritable uterine orifice.</p>
                     <p>Pyrexia, in young plethoric women, is a frequent attendant of labour; for, with increaſed pain, the face becomes fluſhed, the pulſe full, ſtrong and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celerated,
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:022551_0144_0FB942996D0F3B88"/>
along with dry parched mouth and fauces, and the other ſymptoms of fever, ſtyled by authors <hi>febris parturiens.</hi> Iſchuria, or ſuppreſſion of urine, and ſometimes an involuntary diſcharge of faeces, enſue.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>progreſs of labour</hi> generally proceeds in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owing manner.</p>
                     <p>In conſequence the great diſcharge of lubricating moiſture, the genital parts are firſt relaxed, and then gradually begin to dilate. The membranes alſo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually ſeparate from the internal ſurface of the uterus; and, by its ſpaſmodic contractions, the membranes and contained water is protruded in form of a ſoft, yielding bag, before the preſenting part of the child. In the abſence of the pain, the waters retreat; the membranous bag is relaxed, or flaccid; and the child, if within reach, can be diſtinctly felt through. When the pain recurs, the membranes become tenſe and turgid; ſpread out more and more; and, advancing lower and lower as the pains increaſe in force and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency, they gently and ſafely ſtretch and dilate the the paſſages preparatory to delivery, in a manner which no human artifice can poſſibly imitate. When that important end is accompliſhed, the ſlender bag yeilding to the propelling force, gives way, and the contained fluid is evacuated.</p>
                     <p>In a natural eaſy labour, the progreſs of the head of the foetus through the pelvis correſponds with the
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:022551_0145_0FB9429B11C0D490"/>
protruſion of the membranes and dilation of the ſoft parts. The head advances in a mechanical manner, its large axis being generally applied to that of the pelvis. When the vertex is nearly arrived at the lower circumference of the bony cavity, the membranes give way; ſoon after which, the pains are renewed with increaſed force. The vertex advances through the axis of the vagina; the occiput gradually emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges from under the arch of the pubes; and the ſoft parts at the bottom of the pelvis beginning to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded in a form of a tumour, the os externum is radually dilated. As the occiput riſes from below the pubes, the face is turned towards the concavity of the ſacrum; the forehead preſſes againſt the moveable coccyx; the vertex now protruding without the os externum and the ſtimulating exertions becoming ſo exceſſive as to throw the whole frame into the moſt violent agitation, the os externum is forced open, and the head of the child propelled. After ſome interval of eaſe, the pain, in a more moderate degree, recurs, and continues till the child is completely delivered, the ſhoulders making the ſame mechanical turns with the head.</p>
                     <p>When the woman has ſomewhat recovered the ſhock, the uterus again renews its contractions; and by a more gentle and moderate exertion of the ſame power by which the membranes were ſeparated and protruded and the child was propelled, the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centa
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:022551_0146_0FB9429C6B20BDB0"/>
is detached from its adhenſion to the womb, forced downwards to the orifice, and expelled.</p>
                     <p>This is the manner and progreſs of natural eaſy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. But a variety of circumſtances frequently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur to diſappoint our hopes, and render the birth te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and painful. The original poſition of the foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus <hi>in utero;</hi> the bulk, ſhape and ſolidity of the head; the age, conſtitution, and previous condition, as well as preſent health and management of the patient; the action of the uterus itſelf, conſidered as a hollow muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle; the rigidity of the os tincae; the conſtruction and capacity of the pelvis; the texture of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes; the tightneſs or conſtriction of the vagina; the reſiſtance of the os externum, &amp;c. occaſion an aſtoniſhing variety in the degree of pain, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs or duration, and manner of termination of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Practitioners ſhould therefore be cautious of giving an opinion reſpecting the time of delivery, at leaſt till the progreſs be conſiderably advanced.</p>
                     <p>A judgment of the duration and event of labour is chiefly to be derived from the force, continuance, and recurrence of pains; from the reſiſtance of the os tincae, or the contrary; from the period when the membranous bag is ruptured; from the poſition of the child's head, and relative proportions that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain between it and the pelvis.</p>
                     <p>Young women, apparently well proportioned of
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:022551_0147_0FB9429DECAD5120"/>
a lax fibre and healthy conſtitution, may be preſumed to have eaſy, favourable labours. We may expect the delivery to be tolerably eaſy and expeditious, when the pains come on regularly; when the child preſents properly; when the membranes begin early to form a bag, and protrude the os tincae; when it is thin, ſoft, and yielding, and is felt by the touch to dilate ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly by the force of the pains; when the head can be felt thro' the membranes during the remiſſion of pain, advances progreſſively through the pelvis, preceded by the amnion tumor and the rupture of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes, when the head can be felt to preſs againſt the orificium uteri.</p>
                     <p>But, even in thoſe circumſtances, the progreſs of labour is often unexpectedly interrupted, by the remiſſion or diminiſhed force of pains for a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble interval; by the conſtriction of the vagina after the os tincae is completely dilated; or, by the rigidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the external parts, though no obſtacle ſhould occur from any defect in the conſtruction of the pelvis.</p>
                     <p>In ſome inſtances, the progreſs is retarded by the early rupture of the membranes, ſlow dilatation of the os tincae, feebleneſs of the throes, and a variety of other cauſes. Nothing can therefore be more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, than to aſcertain, or gueſs at, the time neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to accompliſh the wiſhed-for event. The more ordinary limits of a natural eaſy labour are from ſix
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:022551_0148_0FB9429F76D47FC0"/>
to twelve hours; it is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> however, ſometimes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted within two hours, and ſometimes requires ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral days. But the firſt labour is generally, from obvious cauſes, the moſt painful and tedious.</p>

                     <head>§ 2. Diviſion of Labours.</head>
                     <p>THE ancients, as far as can be collected from their writings, divided labours into two kinds, Natural, and Preternatural. The firſt included head, or, according to ſome, head and breech, preſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and all others were implied in the latter. Dead children ſeem to make a third diſtinction, and are directed to be delivered in a particular manner by ſharp hooks.</p>
                     <p>In different authors we find different arrangements, and the claſſification is ſtill arbitrary. That of Dr SMELLIE appears to be leaſt liable to exception. He refers all labours to three general claſſes: 1<hi>ſt.</hi> Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; 2<hi>dly,</hi> Laborious; and, 3<hi>dly,</hi> Preternatural. He calls thoſe caſes <hi>natural,</hi> where the head preſents, and the child is expelled by the natural pains; <hi>labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> when the head preſents, but the birth is uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly protracted, or requires the interpoſition of art; and <hi>preternatural,</hi> when any other part but the head firſt preſents, or when the feet are delivered before ſhe head.</p>
                     <p>A great variety of diviſions and ſubdiviſions, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:022551_0149_0FB942A0E75B16A8"/>
ſtill prevail among modern practitioners; as, Natural and Non-natural, Slow and Lingering, Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult and Laborious, Preternatural, Wrong and croſs Poſitions, Perilous, Mixed and complicated Labours, &amp;c.; and different explanations have been gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by different authors to the ſame terms. Such indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite diſtinctions ſerve to involve the ſubject in obſcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to miſlead and embarraſs inexperienced prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners.</p>
                     <p>All diſtinctions ought to be reſtricted to thoſe caſes merely which require a different mode of practice.

                        <p>ON the commencement of labour, and previous to any attempt to aſſiſt it, the neceſſary ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratus ſhould be prepared. The room ſhould be lofty, the bed equally diſtant from a confined ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a current of air; the curtains, and every part of the furniture, ſhould be thin and incapable of retaining either moiſture or ſmell. The coverings of the ſheets ſhould be carefully adapted to prevent the blood or the waters, from penetrating through them.</p>
                        <p>The patient ſhould be permitted to walk, or reſt in her uſual poſtures, till the os uteri is dilated, and the pains be frequent and preſſing: ſhe ſhould then be placed on her ſide, with her knees drawn up; and, in advanced labour, they may be ſeparated by
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:022551_0152_0FB942B2E04A1918"/>
a pillow, and a reſiſtance given to the feet by an aſſiſtant. Before ſhe is placed in this poſition, every indelicacy, by frequent touching, is highly improper. It is afterwards more eſſential, and ſhould never be neglected immediately after the rupture of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes; for the child's arm, or any portion of the umbilical cord which may threaten to preſent, may then be replaced with eaſe.</p>
                        <p>Having obviated every cauſe which may impede labour, and guarded againſt every thing which may diſturb or irritate the patient, we ſhould wait with patience till nature has protruded the head of the child, or the membranes filled with their fluid.

In the former caſe, the parts of the mother have been lacerated; and, in the latter, violently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed, in conſequence of the long-continued preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the child's head.</p>
                        <p>When the parts are violently ſtretched, the peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeum may be gently ſupported during a pain, and a counter-preſſure is generally recommended when the labour is rapid; but it ſhould be remembered, that this ſupport is only uſeful as it retards the labour, which is often inconvenient, and ſometimes dangerous. A laceration of the perinaeum is a very rare occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and generally the conſequence of previous diſeaſe. It is therefore doubtful, how far a hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous expedient is to be recommended to obviate an uncertain accident.</p>
                        <p>After the head is delivered, there is ſeldom any danger: the ſhoulders accommodate themſelves to the paſſage; and the birth may then be ſafely faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litated by the hands of the Operator, if any aſſiſtance ſhould happen to be neceſſary.</p>

                        <p>HAVING given the child to the nurſe or one of the attendants, the next object of our regard is, the Management of the Placenta.</p>
                        <p>The ſame powers which expel the foetus, are again, after a ſhort interval, renewed, but in a leſſer degree, to exlude the ſecundines. Their ſtructure is, however, different from the more ſolid maſs of the foetus. The uterus ſometimes contracts unequally; the os tincae is more irritable than the fundus; and the muſcular fibres round the edge of the orifice ſometimes contract ſo quickly, that the aperture ſoon diminiſhes, and may for a little time prevent the cake from paſſing after its adheſion to the uterus is diſſolved. From the unequal or partial contraction of the muſcular fibres of the uterus where the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centa
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:022551_0155_0FB942C091D809F8"/>
is attached, one portion may be ſeparated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore another: all which render a variety of mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement, in peculiar circumſtances, neceſſary.</p>
                        <p>Hence the oppoſition of ſentiment of authors on the ſubject; ſome recommending as a general rule, to precipitate the extraction immediately after the delivery of the child, leſt the uterus ſuddenly clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, ſhould render the operation difficult and hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous; while others adviſe, in all caſes, to truſt the management entirely to nature.</p>
                        <p>The middle courſe is, in general, the moſt ſafe and proper; and both extremes ſhould be equally guarded againſt.</p>
                        <p>As the ſeparation is accompliſhed by the ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous contraction of the uterus, more or leſs time will be neceſſary, according to the previous ſtate of geſtation, duration and management of the preceding part of labour, condition of the woman immediately after, and a variety of other occaſional cauſes which may impede or promote the action of the uterus.</p>
                        <p>In moſt caſes, the adheſion is diſſolved within half or three-fourths of an hour after the birth of the child. The contraction of the uterus is moſt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious, and of conſequence the placenta moſt eaſily and quickly ſeparated, after a firſt pregnancy, when the woman is in good health, and when the labour has been properly managed. The contraction of the uterus is more ſlow and imperfect, and conſequently

the adheſion of the cake more tenacious, in prema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture births, when the woman's health is impaired from previous indiſpoſition; in caſes of tedious and difficult labours,—of languor or faintneſs after deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,—and when haſty attempts have been officiouſly employed to force the extraction.</p>
                        <p>The diminiſhed bulk, and ſhifting of the abdomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal tumor, which may be felt by the application of the hand externally, afford the beſt means of informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>when</hi> to attempt expediting the expulſion of the ſecundines; and, in general, enable us to judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any other child be retained <hi>in utero.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The approach of the birth of the placenta is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly announced by the diſcharge of ſome clotted blood, and by a ſlight degree of uterine niſus, called by the women <hi>grinding</hi> or <hi>griping pains.</hi> Then is the time to aſſiſt the expulſion; which ought to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in this manner.</p>
                        <p>The cord muſt be twiſted round the fingers of the left-hand, ſo that a firm hold is obtained; two fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and the thumb of the right-hand ſhould alſo be applied, to graſp the cord within the vagina. The advantage of a pain, when it occurs, ſhould always be taken. The cord muſt be pulled from ſide to ſide, and backwards towards the perinaeum, endeavouring to drag in ſuch a direction as to bring the central part of the cake through the axis of the uterus and pelvis, and deſiring the woman to employ her own
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:022551_0157_0FB942C52A65B6C8"/>
exertions moderately by bringing a deep inſpiration and bearing down gently; but, violent efforts of coughing, retching, ſneezing, or ſtraining, ſhould be conſtantly avoided, leſt dangerous floodings or deliquia might follow. It is known to advance, by the lengthening of the cord, and the ſtraining of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. When the bulky part of the maſs arrives at the os tincae, the inverted cake, preſſing againſt the orifice in a globular form, ſometimes gives conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable reſiſtance. This obſtacle may be removed, either by paſſing up two fingers of the right-hand, guided by the cord, to bringdown the edge; or by waiting a few minutes, then pulling gently at the cord with the left-hand, and preſſing on the ſubſtance of the cake with the fingers of the right, higher and higher till the edge can be brought down, which muſt be graſped firmly, the funis being ſtill extended with the other hand. The whole ſubſtance of the cake, with the membranes, being at laſt entirely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engaged, are to be gradually extracted, put into a baſon, and removed.</p>
                        <p>But, if the placenta does not advance when the cord is fully extended, and the woman ſuffers conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable pain, the operator muſt immediately deſiſt; leſt, by carrying the attempt further, floodings might be occaſioned, the cord be ruptured, or the uterus inverted. A ſoft warm cloth ſhould then be applied to the os externum, and the patient allowed to reſt
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:022551_0158_0FB942C678CB5268"/>
for five minutes. If it does not yet advance, ten or fifteen minutes more ſhould be waited for; and, in the interval, a moderate degree of preſſure on the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen, in different directions, may promote the contraction of the uterus, and aſſiſt the ſeparation. By gradually proceeding in this manner, and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently waiting for the contraction of the uterus, the placenta will be produced ſo low, that the centre can be felt, the edge brought down, and the extraction ſafely accompliſhed.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>introduction of the hand</hi> into the uterus to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate the adheſion, or aſſiſt the expulſion of the after-birth, is not perhaps abſolutely neceſſary in one of ſeveral hundred caſes. However cautiouſly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, it occaſions a conſiderable degree of pain; the very apprehenſion of an expedient ſo harſh and unnatural, inſpires the utmoſt dread and horror, and not unfrequently cauſes deliquia or fits. It is cruel and barbarous to employ a painful mode of aſſiſtance, it is criminal to hazard the conſequence of violence, where the ſame end may be obtained by gentle means, perhaps by waiting an hour or two extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary. In every view, the operation of introducing the hand to remove the placenta ſhould only be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the moſt urgent caſes.</p>
                        <p>It muſt, however, be acknowledged, that the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centa cannot always be removed by pulling at the cord. It may be ruptured: A profuſe flooding in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicates

                           <p>A PROFUSE haemorrhagy ſupervening the delivery of the child, is alarming and dangerous; if it does not ſoon ceaſe, fatal ſyncope will probably enſue. Though it ſeem to abate, if the woman be low and faint, the relief may be fallacious; and is perhaps occaſioned by part of the placenta forced down at the cervix uteri, and by plugging up the orifice prevents the effuſion externally.</p>
                           <p>The conſequences to be dreaded can only be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanted by removing the placenta; for, while one portion adheres and another is detached, there is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle chance that the flooding will ſtop till the uterus be put into a condition for contracting. The hand of the operator is to be gradually, but with a certain degree of courage and reſolution, introduced into the uterus, taking the navelſtring for a guide, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering the fingers together in a conical manner. If the placenta ſeems attached to the oppoſite ſide, the
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:022551_0161_0FB942D152C10298"/>
hand already introduced muſt be withdrawn, and the other paſſed in its ſtead; or if, from its adheſion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the upper part of the womb, it appears to be without the reach of the hand, the poſition of the woman muſt be altered, and ſhe muſt be ſhifted from oneſide to the other, from the ſide to the back, croſs the bed, or placed on her knees and elbows, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the particular circumſtances of the caſe.</p>
                           <p>The placenta, by its firmneſs, can be readily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed from looſe clots of blood; and, from the womb, by its ſoftneſs and want of feeling. It may be diſengaged by inſinuating the fingers between it and the womb, through the membranes, when the ſeparated edge of the cake can eaſily be come at. If it cannot, the thick middle part of the placentary maſs ſhould be graſped firmly, ſpreading out the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and gathering them together upon it, and in that manner gradually endeavouring to diſengage and bring it away. It is dangerous to ſtrip or peel it from the womb, by placing the fingers on the outſide of the membranes, as authors generally adviſe; for, by that means, where the womb has loſt its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractile power, a fatal deluge may be occaſioned.</p>

                           <p>Though it might perhaps be the ſafeſt practice, both in this caſe and when the cord is torn, to delay the interpoſition of manual aſſiſtance even for a day or two, when the cake will probably be expelled in time of ſleep, ſoon after waking, or forced off du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the effort of paſſing urine; <hi>yet there is always hazard of leaving the woman before the after-birth is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered.</hi> She may ſuffer from anxiety and agitation; or a flooding from partial ſeparation may enſue, and life itſelf be quickly extinguiſhed.</p>

                           <p>THE placenta is liable to become diſeaſed. It ſometimes partially or wholly degenerates into hyda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tides, becomes ſcirrhous, cartilaginous, more rarely bony. Either of theſe ſtates is probably originally preceded with ſome degree of inflammation; in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of which the intermediate connecting mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane between the cake and the uterus is deſtroyed, and a coalition formed between them.</p>
                           <p>Of all the cauſes of retention, this is the moſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult and dangerous. The caſe is intricate and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexing. If the placenta remains, and nature fails to expel it, the woman generally dies from uterine inflammation and gangrene. She is often alſo the unhappy victim of the unſucceſsful attempt of the operator: for the uterus has been torn by the offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or unſkilful efforts of the practitioner; or mortal floodings, inflammation, or gangrene have enſued.</p>
                           <p>If, in theſe circumſtances, we ſhould wait for the natural expulſion, the woman may be quickly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by flooding, from partial ſeparation. If we attempt to force a ſeparation of the adheſion, by tearing the placenta from the uterus with the fingers while that organ is in a ſtate of atony, a fatal deluge from the deſtruction of vaſcular ſubſtance may enſue before the hand could be withdrawn from the uterus.</p>

The beſt and ſafeſt practice, in theſe alarming ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, is to defer our attempts as long as poſſible: then, but before the putrid proceſs commences, to inſinuate the hand with the utmoſt caution and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs; attentively examine the cake, by feeling every part of its ſubſtance; carefully avoid tearing by force at that place where the diſeaſed hardneſs or ſcirrhoſity is; ſeparate cautiouſly that portion which is looſe and ſoft and which yields to gentle efforts: the reſt muſt be left to nature; to be expelled with the cleanſings, or deſtroyed and diſcharged by means of ſuppuration.</p>
                           <p>Upon the whole, it is hazardous to precipitate the delivery of the placenta, or to truſt in alarming or difficult caſes the imperfect efforts or <hi>limited powers of nature.</hi> From over haſty or violent attempts to force the extraction, the moſt dreadful accidents, as inflammation, laceration, or inverſions of the ute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, and mortal haemorrhagies, frequently happen.

                     <p>A LABOUR, though ſtrictly natural, with reſpect to the poſition of the child, the management, and termination, may be tedious and lingering in the progreſs or duration of its different ſtages. This is exceedingly diſtreſſing to the patient, perplexing and vexatious to the practitioner.</p>
                     <p>When the labour is protracted beyond the more uſual limits the woman becomes anxious and deject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the pains occaſionally remit and recur with fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency and violence, or alternate with imperfect and irregular intervals of eaſe; the progreſs is ſlow and imperceptible; her ſpirits are exhauſted from reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſneſs and apprehenſion, or while the pains abate ſhe inſenſibly falls into ſhort but unrefreſhing ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. After a long and obſtinate conflict, by the reiterated ſucceſſion of feeble efforts, the head of the foetus moulds itſelf to the paſſage; the crannial bones are compreſſed; the vertex lengthens out, forming a ſoft conical tumor; the reſiſting yield to the propelling powers: and the birth, after perhaps a period of two or three complete days, is at laſt, however, ſafely accompliſhed.</p>

                     <p>As theſe cauſes exiſt ſingly or combined, the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour will be leſs or more difficult and painful.</p>
                     <p>Moſt of the obſtacles now mentioned are to be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted by patience and perſeverance. If the labour is otherwiſe natural, though from peculiarity of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit and a variety of particular circumſtances it ſhould prove tedious, the ſafeſt and beſt practice, in general, both for mother and child, is to truſt the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>wholly to nature.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The difficulty is frequently owing merely to the reſiſtance of the ſoft parts; hence ſtrong robuſt wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſuffer more than the nervous and delicate. In the
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:022551_0168_0FB942DE71447CE0"/>
former, the parts are tenſe and rigid, and ſtretch ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. In the latter, they are more relaxed, ſoft, and yielding. The firſt require the cooling, ſedative plan; the latter, light nouriſhing food, in ſmall quantities, often repeated, with the moderate uſe of cordials and anodynes. In either caſe, tranquillity ſhould be promoted, by keeping the patient quiet and eaſy; by conſtantly avoiding fatigue, buſtle, and noiſe; at the ſame time ſoothing and comforting her with the beſt aſſurance of a happy delivery.</p>
                     <p>We ſhall conciſely treat of theſe ſeveral cauſes.</p>
                     <p>I. In the MOTHER.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Any defect in the action of the uterus itſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as a muſcular organ, or of the auxiliary Powers of parturition, impairs the force of the labour-throes; or, in other words, renders the pains feeble and trifling.</p>
                     <p>The over-diſtention of the uterus impairs the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its muſcular fibres, and may for ſome time prevent thoſe ſpaſmodic efforts by which the os tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cae is opened and the foetus expelled; there may be alſo other cauſes of torpor, or want of irritability, of which we are ignorant. Exceſſive diſtention of the uterine fibres can only, however, have a temporary effect to retard the labour; and it is little in our power to obviate the defect, till the membranes can be ruptured and the water evacuated: the uterus
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:022551_0169_0FB942E1E9016020"/>
then coming in cloſe contact with the body of the foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, the head will begin to preſs againſt the orifice, and the pains become ſtrong and forcing.</p>
                     <p>But, as many inconveniences are known to enſue from an early diſcharge of the waters, that expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſhould be the reſult of the moſt cautious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate reflection; and ſhould never be had recourſe to till the orifice be ſufficiently dilated. Any defect in the auxiliary powers will produce the ſame effect in a leſſer degree: For, ſince the whole ſyſtem of muſcular parts is employed in the action of parturiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in proportion as any of theſe are impaired or weakened, the exertions of labour will be leſs ſtrong or forcing. But particularly, whatever affects the diaphragm and muſcles concerned in reſpiration, will materially impede or interrupt the action of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turition. A narrow cheſt, difficult reſpiration from whatever cauſe, hydrops aſcites, &amp;c. have a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable influence on delivery.</p>
                     <p>The treatment of all theſe variety of caſes muſt be directed with a view to remove, or obviate the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of interruption as much as poſſible.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. More remotely, the progreſs of labour may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted by debility, from</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>a.</hi> FLOODING.—Though flooding, in advanced geſtation, is always alarming and dangerous, it is
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:022551_0170_0FB942E2E62E2798"/>
leſs hazardous when it occurs along with labour-pains: for by proper management the haemorrhagy may generally be checked, till the pains become ſtrong and regular; it afterwards uſually ſtops or abates, and the delivery terminates favourably. But, if the flood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proceeds from the attachment of the placenta at the cervix or over the orificium uteri, which can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily be known by a careful examination from touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the caſe is highly alarming, the danger immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and the event to be dreaded can only be prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an expeditious delivery.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Diarrhaea</hi>—when exceſſive, exhauſts the patient, brings on debility, and diminiſhes the force of the labour pains. Warm-water glyſters to waſh out the rectum, and opiates, are the beſt palliative remedies. The ſtrength muſt be kept up by proper nouriſhment; as beef-tea with rice, hartſhorn gellies, &amp;c. and the moderate uſe of cordials.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>b.</hi> EPILEPTIC FITS—when ſo violent or frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repeated as to leave the patient in a ſtate of ſtupor and inſenſibility, retard labour, and endanger the lives of both parent and child. If the foetus ſhould not be expelled by a few paroxyſms,—if ſymptoms are threatening, and the child is within reach of the forceps, delivery ſhould be effected as ſoon as poſſible. But any violent exertions to procure delivery, by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly ſtretching the parts, and counteracting nature,
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:022551_0171_0FB942E70C9B5B20"/>
with a view to turn the child, as many adviſe, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable with any probability of ſucceſs. In every inſtance it ought to be a rule, to wait till the head of the foetus is ſufficiently protruded, that the acceſs may be eaſy to apply the forceps.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>c.</hi> CRAMPISH SPASMS—are generally confined to the thighs and legs, more rarely the belly is affected. They proceed from the preſſure of the child's head on the nerves as it advances through the pelvis, and can only be removed by delivery. But as the pains are ſeldom attended with danger, few caſes occur to render the aſſiſtance of art neceſſary, except by breaking the membranes, which often relieves the pains when exceſſive. Venaeſection, glyſters, and opiates, may be occaſionally employed a palliatives, when the belly is the ſeat of the diſeaſe.</p>

                        <hi>d.</hi> SICKNESS, LOWNESS, AND FAINTNESS—of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten occur, and have alſo a conſiderable influence in retarding the termination of labour. They hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen chiefly to women of weak nerves, or others whoſe health has been impaired from previous ſickneſs or miſmanagement; and accompany the firſt part of labour only. In its progreſs, the woman acquires freſh vigour and additional reſolution; the pains be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſtrong and forcing; the delivery, even where the patient appears to be weak and exhauſted, often
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:022551_0172_0FB942E822E1B000"/>
has a ſafe termination, though ſeveral days ſhould be neceſſary to accompliſh it; and the recovery is as favourable as if the whole management had been regulated by the wiſhes of the attendants<note n="*" place="bottom">I have attended a patient three days and nights, and one whole fourth day, without danger: the woman crooked, and the child large.

                     <p>In caſes of lowneſs and depreſſion, the great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to be aimed at is to gain time, to ſupport the patient's ſtrength and ſpirits; to guard againſt putting her on labour too early, and to uſe every means for reſerving her ſtrength and reſolution. When the pains are ſlow and trifling, when ſhe is reſtleſs, anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and dejected, opiates often produce the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt effects; they remove grinding fruitleſs pains, recruit the ſpirits, and amuſe the patient during the tedious and painful time. We can ſcarcely aim at more; for, though the dilatation of the uterus, and progreſſive ſteps of the labour, advance by ſlow de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, under proper management, and while no alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſymptoms occur, no danger from delay is ever to be dreaded.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. Local impediments interrupting the paſſage of the child; as,</p>
                     <p n="1">(1.) <hi>In the Bones, affecting the Dimenſions of the Pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis.</hi>—Narrowneſs from diſtortion of the bones can readily be diſcovered when the defect is confined to the outlet. But when the brim is faulty, and the woman in other reſpects tolerably well proportioned, we can only judge from the effects.</p>
                     <p>If the progreſs of the labour be ſlow and tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous—if, from the general figure and conſtruction of the woman's body, there ſhould be reaſon to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a faulty pelvis;—if the ſpine be twiſted, the legs crooked, the breaſt bone raiſed, or the cheſt nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row;—ſuch conſtitutions, independent of any defect in the baſon, require a particular management; they cannot ſuffer much confinement to bed, on account of their breathing; nor give much aſſiſtance to the pain by their own exertions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="184" facs="unknown:022551_0174_0FB942F76C7DA600"/>
Diſtortions of the brim are more difficult to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover; but we can diſtinctly feel any material defect in the ſhape of the ſacrum and coccyx, in the poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the iſchia or diſtance between them, and any deviation on the arch of the pubes. Where the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion is ſo general that the whole cavity of the pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis is affected, the ſhape of the body, the ſlow pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the labour, and the ſtate of the parts to the touch, afford ſufficient information. In either caſe, after the firſt ſtage of labour, narrowneſs of the pelvis can be known from the ſymptoms; though it is difficult, and almoſt impoſſible, to aſcertain the degree of deviation with mathematical accuracy. The hand cannot be introduced while the paſſage is obſtructed with the head of the foetus; the pelvime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Monſieur COUTOULY, or graduated probe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended by others for meaſuring the pelvis, are leſs to be truſted<note n="*" place="bottom">See the method of examination by the fingers and hand to detect narrow pelvis, as directed by Dr Wallace Johnſton, <hi>Syſtem of Midwifery,</hi> 4to, p. 288, to p. 291.</note>. In one word, we are to judge of the narrowneſs, from the fruitleſs efforts of coer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive throes after the uterus is ſufficiently dilated,—from the head of the foetus advancing in a coni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal form, with the cranial bones overlapped, giving a ſharp feel to the touch like a ſow's back<note n="†" place="bottom">See Dr Smellie's Tables, Pl xxvii. &amp; xxviii.</note>; and of the degree of diſtortion by practical knowledge.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="185" facs="unknown:022551_0175_0FB942FAD896DC60"/>
A ſlight diminution of capacity will be overcome by the gradual compreſſion of the bones of the cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium: but, if the diſtortion be conſiderable, the child's head large, or unuſually well oſſified, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains obſtinately wedged in the pelvis; if the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's ſtrength is impaired, along with ſwelling of the parts, ſuppreſſion of urine, &amp;c. in theſe circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces it would be dangerous to delay the proper means of affording aſſiſtance, as both mother and child might become the victims of neglect or miſmanagement. We ſhould be aware, however, of being impoſed on, either from the anxiety of the diſtreſſed patient, or by the noiſy clamours of impertinent attendants. It muſt be remembered, that the gentleſt aſſiſtance our hands, or inſtruments, in laborious births can procure, is always attended with ſome degree of hazard: that if inſtruments be employed too early, that is, improperly, nature will be interrupted; and, from the bruiſes by the force of pulling, from the reſiſtance to the mechanical power applied, or from the inſtrument loſing its hold, the moſt fatal conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences may enſue.—On the contrary, if artificial aſſiſtance be too long deferred, the ſtrength of the patient being exhauſted, ſhe may die undelivered; ſink during the operation, or ſoon after. But, mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical exertions to force delivery, where in time nature unaſſiſted might accompliſh the taſk, has, in fact, proved
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:022551_0176_0FB942FC9C6DDCD0"/>
more fatal than the latter. To draw the line of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction between Lingering and ſtrictly Laborious Labour, is exceedingly difficult, or to determine the critical time of interference. It is, however, an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject highly, intereſting:—the honour of the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,—the credit of the practitioner,—the important lives of a worthy mother and her progeny, depend on it; and the Accoucheur is culpable for his neglect or miſconduct.</p>
                     <p n="2">(2.) <hi>In the ſoft Parts;</hi> as,</p>
                     <p>a. <hi>Conſtriction or Rigidity of the cervix or Orificium Uteri.</hi>—This is one of the moſt common cauſes of lingering labours; it chiefly occurs in elderly wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, in ſtrong robuſt conſtitutions, or where the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals between child-bearing have been diſtant. If the orificium uteri, inſtead of kindly opening with the pains, and becoming thin, ſoft, and dilatable, ſhould form a thick ring or flap, ſtretch ſlowly, and the pains are frequent, but unprofitable, a tedious la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour may be expected. Warm glyſters, injections of warm oil into the vagina, and the vapours of warm water, after the waters have paſſed, are the only means of relief; for it is difficult and dangerous to ſtretch the mouth of the womb with the fingers. But, though the labour be lingering, if we have on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly patience to wait on nature, we ſhall generally find her efforts ſufficient: for, in a firſt labour, or when
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:022551_0177_0FB94303B39F9380"/>
the woman is advanced in life, and the parts are dry and rigid, from 36 hours till three days may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired for the dilatation of the orifice of the womb; yet if the management be properly regulated, neither the mother nor the child will be in danger, and the mother's recovery will perhaps go on as favourably as if the delivery had been accompliſhed in a few hours.</p>
                     <p>b. <hi>Conſtriction or Rigidity of the Vagina and Os Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternum.</hi>—The diſadvantage of theſe contractions in the ſoft parts chiefly is, that the head of the child is detained for ſome time from advancing without the os externum, after it has paſſed through the bony ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity. But the child ſeldom ſuffers; and, when in hazard, can ſeldom be ſaved without injuring the mother. Warm fomentations to ſoften the parts, not to heat the body, may in theſe caſes be uſed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> conſequence that the parts ſhould ſtretch ſlowly; ſo that we ought not to haſten the ſtretching by any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual application.</p>
                     <p>c. <hi>Scirrhous or Polypous Tumors.</hi>—There is ſeldom occaſion, in caſe of cicatrices about the os tincae or vagina, to dilate with the ſcalpel, to remove poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous tumors by exciſion, or to cut upon and extract a ſtone from the urethra in time of labour. But if
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:022551_0178_0FB94304A7B40060"/>
circumſtances are urgent, ſuch expedients are ſafe and practicable, and warranted by many prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents.</p>
                     <p>From previous ulceration, or laceration of the os uteri and vagina, diſagreeable conſtrictions happen: but they are frequently overcome in time of labour. There are many well atteſted inſtances, where, at the commencement of labour, it was utterly impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to paſs a finger within the contracted orifice of the vagina; yet the parts dilated as labour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, and the delivery terminated happily. In ſome caſes, the dilatation begins during pregnancy, and is completed in time of labour.</p>
                     <p>d. <hi>Tumefaction from hardened faeces</hi>—frequently proves an obſtacle to labour; for the contents of the gut form a large tumor, which can be readily felt from the vagina, and diminiſhes its cavity. This tumor has been ſometimes miſtaken for the child's head; but the miſtake is ſoon diſcovered by a ſkilful practitioner, for it is removed by frequent glyſters.</p>
                     <p>e. <hi>Stone in the Urethra.</hi>—In thoſe women ſubject to graveliſh complaints, a bit of ſtone thruſt forwards by the force of labour, from the neck of the bladder into the urinary paſſage, will occaſion difficulty, pain or ſuppreſſion of urine: and may, if not removed, prove an inſurmountable obſtacle to the progreſs of labour. If it cannot be eaſily puſhed back by intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:022551_0179_0FB943074F58D158"/>
the catheter, a ſurgical operation muſt be had recourſe to.</p>
                     <p>f. <hi>Diſtention of the Bladder with Urine</hi>—in ſlow la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, frequently occurs, and is a dangerous circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. It ſhould be early guarded againſt by abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence from drink; and removed by evacuating the urine, gently preſſing back the child's head with the fingers when the introduction of the catheter is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult.</p>
                     <p>g. <hi>Prolapſus of the Uterus, Vagina, and Rectum.</hi>—In a pelvis too wide in its dimenſions, the <hi>womb</hi> at full time may deſcend into the vagina by the force of the throes of labour; though ſuch caſes very rarely oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur. The only treatment is to ſupport the womb well by preſſure with the hand in time of the pain, that the ſtretching of the parts may be gradual.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>vagina,</hi> in weakly women, often prolapſes in time of labour, and is protruded before the child's head by the force of the pains, If this happens, it muſt be replaced in the abſence of the pain, by gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle preſſure with the fingers, introduced in a proper manner and direction, and its return afterwards pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>The Bulk and Oſſification of the Head.</hi>—There may be either a natural diſproportion between the head and body, or the ſwelling may be occaſioned from a collection of water in the head, or be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of the child's death.</p>
                     <p>From the ſtructure and make of the pelvis and head in a natural ſtate, it is evident, that a head of a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſize, having the bones ſoft and moveable, will paſs through the pelvis with leſs difficulty, and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion leſs pain in the birth, than a ſmaller head, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the bones more ſolid, and the ſutures more firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly connected. A large head may be ſuſpected when the vertex does not lengthen out by the force of the pains (as it commonly does in lingering labours); when the progreſs of the labour is ſuſpended, though the pains continue to be ſtrong and frequent, after the ſoft parts are ſufficiently dilated; when the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is in good health, and there is no other apparent cauſe to account for the protraction.</p>
                     <p>When the ſwelling proceeds from a collection of water in the child's head, it may be known by the head preſenting at the brim of the pelvis in a round bulky form, by the diſtance between the bones of the
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:022551_0181_0FB9430AAF4A6648"/>
head, and by a ſoftneſs and fluctuation evident to the touch.</p>
                     <p>When the child has been long dead, the head and body often ſwell to a great ſize. This may be known from the hiſtory of the caſe; from a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular puffy feel of the preſenting part of the child; from the diſcharge of putrid waters, ſometimes mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the meconium of the child; and from the ſeparation or peeling of the outer ſkin of the head when touched: Though it may be here obſerved, that the moſt probable or ſuſpicious ſymptoms of the child's death are often deceitful.</p>
                     <p>From whatever cauſe the head is enlarged, if the difficulty ariſes from that circumſtance, and the force of the pains proves inſufficient to puſh it forwards; if it has made no ſenſible progreſs for ſeveral hours after the waters were diſcharged, and the os uteri is fully dilated; and if the pains ſhould begin to remit or ſlacken, and the woman to be low, weak, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected; it will then be neceſſary to have recourſe to the aſſiſtance of art.</p>
                     <p n="2">(2.) <hi>The unfavourable Poſition of the head.</hi>—The head of the child may be ſqueezed into the pelvis in ſuch a manner as not to admit of that compreſſion neceſſary for its paſſing through the bony cavity.</p>
                     <p>Where the pelvis is well formed, and the head of an ordinary ſize, although it ſhould preſent in the moſt awkward and unfavourable poſition, it will yet
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:022551_0182_0FB9430C48BF74C8"/>
advance; and nature, under proper management, will, in moſt caſes, ſafely accompliſh the delivery. The labour will unavoidably be more painful and laborious; but, whatever time may be required, there is leſs hazard either of the mother or child, than if delivery had been haſtened by the intruſion of offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious art.</p>
                     <p>But if the woman be weak or exhauſted, and the pains trifling; if the head of the child be large, the bones firm, and the ſutures cloſely connected; or if there be any degree of narrowneſs in the pelvis; a difficult labour may be expected, and the life of both mother and child will depend on a well-timed and ſkilful application of the ſurgeon's hands.</p>
                     <p>The unfavourable poſition of the head may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to two kinds, which include a conſiderable variety.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1ſt, <hi>When the Crown inſtead of the Vertex preſents.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2dly, <hi>Face-Caſes.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>When the Fontanella, or Open of the Head, inſtead of the Vertex,</hi> firſt preſents to the touch, a more painful or tedious labour may be expected: for the head does not take the ſame mechanical turns in paſſing through the pelvis as in natural labour; the face either originally preſents to the pubes, or takes that direction in paſſing. The bulky crown is forced within the brim of the pelvis with more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty;
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:022551_0183_0FB9430DC28051E0"/>
the progreſs of the labour is more ſlow and painful; and, when the head has advanced ſo far that the crown preſſes on the ſoft parts at the bottom of the pelvis, there is much greater hazard of the tearing of the perinaeum, than when the lengthened<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out vertex preſents: but, if no other obſtacle occurs, the labour, notwithſtanding, will, by proper ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement, generally end well; and much injury may be done by the intruſion of officious hands.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Face-Caſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Of laborious births, face-caſes are the moſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult and troubleſome. From its length, roughneſs, and inequality the face muſt occaſion greater pain; and, from the ſolidity of the bones, it muſt yield to the propelling force of labour throes with more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty than the ſmooth moveable bones of the crani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um. Our ſucceſs in delivery in theſe caſes will chiefly depend on a prudent management, by care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſupporting the ſtrength of the woman.</p>
                     <p>The variety of face-caſes are known by the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the chin; for the face may preſent.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1<hi>ſt,</hi> With the chin to the pubes.</item>
                        <item>2<hi>dly,</hi> To the ſacrum.</item>
                        <item>3<hi>dly,</hi> and 4<hi>thly,</hi> To either ſide.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>The rule in all theſe poſitions is, to allow the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to go on till the face be protruded as low as poſſible.</p>
                     <p>It is often as difficult and hazardous to puſh back
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:022551_0184_0FB943135480DEF0"/>
the child, and to bring down the crown or vertex, as to turn the child and deliver it by the feet.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes a ſkilful artiſt may ſucceed in his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to alter the poſition, when he has the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of the delivery from the beginning; or in thoſe caſes where the face is conſiderably advanced in the pelvis, may be able to give aſſiſtance by paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a finger or two in the child's mouth and pulling down the jaw, which leſſens the bulk of the head; or, by preſſing on the chin, to bring it under the arch of the pubes, when the crown getting into the hollow of the ſacrum, the head will afterwards paſs eaſily. But, in general, FACE-CASES ſhould be truſted to nature; and interpoſition by the hand, or inſtruments, is ſeldom adviſable or even ſafe.</p>
                     <p n="3">(3) <hi>The Bulk, or improper Deſcent of the Shoulders</hi> through the pelvis, rarely proves the cauſe of protract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed labour. The head is always pretty far advanced before any obſtruction can ariſe from this cauſe; and, if the head has already paſſed, in a pain or two the ſhoulders will follow. The ſame reaſoning will alſo apply with regard to the aperture of the uterus itſelf. If the head paſſes freely, in like manner will the ſhoulders: the os uteri rarely, if ever, is capable of contracting upon the neck of the child, and thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting the advance of the ſhoulders; and, ſhould this prove the caſe, what can we do but wait with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? After the delivery of the head, if the woman
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:022551_0185_0FB94314698CB418"/>
falls into deliquia; or if, after ſeveral pains, the ſhoulders do not follow, and the child's life be in danger from delay; we ſhould naturally be induced to help it forward in the gentleſt manner we are able, by paſſing a finger on each ſide as far as the axilla, and thus gradually pulling along: or, if this method fails, the ſhoulders may be diſengaged by preſſing on the ſcapula.</p>
                     <p>III. The third general cauſe of Tedious or Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering Labour, ariſes from the PLACENTA, its Apendages, and the LIQUOR AMNII.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>The Membranes may be too ſtrong or too weak.</hi>—From the former of theſe cauſes, the birth is, in ſome inſtances, rendered tedious; but, as the ſame effect is more frequently produced by the contrary, and the conſequences are much more troubleſome and dangerous, practitioners ſhould be exceedingly cautious of having recourſe to the common expedient of breaking them till there be a great probability that the difficulty proceeds from that circumſtance; and, even then, it ought not to be done till the parts be completely dilated, and the head of the child well advanced in the pelvis.</p>
                     <p>Many inconveniences enſue from a premature evacuation of the waters: for the parts then become dry and rigid: the dilatation goes on more ſlowly;
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:022551_0186_0FB94318B08F2700"/>
the pains often either remit, or become leſs ſtrong and forcing, although not leſs painful and fatiguing; the mouth of the womb which was previouſly thin and yielding, may be obſerved to contract, and to form a thick ring, for ſome time obſtinately reſiſting the force of the pains; the woman's ſtrength lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes, and her ſpirits are overcome and exhauſted; and, at laſt, the child's head becomes locked into the pelvis, merely from want of force of the pains to propel it.</p>
                     <p>An inconvenience of <hi>too great rigidity</hi> of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes is, that the child at full time may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded, incloſed in the complete membranous bag, ſurrounded with the waters. But ſuch inſtances ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom occur. When the whole ovum is thus protru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at once, there is hazard of flooding from the ſudden detachment of the placenta and membranes. It ſhould, therefore, be prevented by breaking the membranes, when they advance and ſpread out at the os externum, and the head of the child follows in the ſame direction.</p>
                     <p>The method of breaking the membranes is, to pinch them between the finger and thumb; to puſh a finger againſt them in time of a pain; to run the ſtilet of catheter through them; or, when there is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle water protruded, and they are applied cloſe in contact with the child's head, they muſt be deſtroyed by ſcatching with the nail; but care ought to be
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:022551_0187_0FB9431A8D75F028"/>
taken leſt the ſcalp of the child's head, covered with mucus, ſhould be miſtaken for the membranes.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>The Waters may be too copious, or too ſparing.</hi>—The firſt is inconvenient; for, by this means, the weight of the water gravitating to the under-part of the membranes in time of a pain, may burſt them too early, and occaſion the diſadvantages before-mentioned.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>An extraordinary quantity of Water</hi>—may overſtretch the womb, and prevent or weaken the pains. Such a cauſe of protraction may be ſuſpected, if the firſt ſtage of labour goes on very ſlowly, if the woman be very big-bellied, and if much time be ſpent before the head of the child becomes locked in the bones of the pelvis. In theſe circumſtances, if the pains ſhould ceaſe or become trifling, the membranes may be ruptured with ſafety and advantage.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Little or no Water</hi>—is ſometimes contained in the membranes. The parts, then, ſtretch with more difficulty and pain, and muſt be lubricated from time to time with butter or pomatum, in the manner mentioned under the article of <hi>Rigidity of the ſoft Parts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>The Cord may be too ſhort, or too long.</hi>—The extraordinary length of the cord, by forming folds round the child's neck or body, may prove the cauſe of protracted labour: but there is generally ſufficient
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:022551_0188_0FB9432314688C60"/>
length to admit of the birth of the child ſafely; and it is time enough, after the child is delivered, to ſlip the nooſe over the ſhoulders and head. After the head is protruded, the ſhoulders are ſeldom prevented from advancing by folds of the cord round the neck; and it very rarely becomes neceſſary to paſs a finger between the child's neck and the cord, in order to divide the cord while the child is in the birth; a practice that may be attended with trouble and hazard.</p>
                     <p>Another inconvenience of the great length of the cord, though it may alſo proceed from the low at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment of the placenta, is,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The prolapſus or falling down of the Cord, doubled, before the Child's Head.</hi>—A circumſtance which often proves fatal to the child; for, if it be not reduced by puſhing it up within the uterus, beyond the bulky head of the child, and prevented from returning with the fingers, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ill the head, by the force of the pain, deſcends into the pelvis, the circulation will ſoon ſtop from the preſſure of the cord between the head and pelvis, and the child will infallibly periſh. If this method of reducing the cord ſhould fail, or if the pains be too quick and forcing to admit of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, a warm cloth ſhould be applied to the os ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternum over the cord, to cover it from the cold, and the natural pains ſhould be waited for; if the pains <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e very ſtrong and forcing, and the progreſs of labour quick, the child may yet be born alive. Some adviſe
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:022551_0189_0FB943267010B3E8"/>
to preſerve the child, by turning and delivering by the feet; but it is, at beſt, a precarious expedient: for new difficulties may afterwards occur; the operation of turning is painful and hazardous; and it would be extremely criminal to expoſe the mother's life to danger, when there is no certainty of preſerving the child.</p>
                     <p>The navel-ſtring is, ſometimes, naturally thick and knotty; or thickened, and of conſequence ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, by diſeaſe. If this happens, part of the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centa may be ſeparated as the child advances, and a flooding enſue; or, the ſtring may be actually ruptured, and occaſion the death of the child; but ſuch inſtances are very rare.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The fourth cauſe is, <hi>The improper attachment of the Placenta over the Orifice of the Womb,</hi> and is a more dangerous circumſtance than any other; for, if the delivery be not ſpeedily accompliſhed, blood, from the ſeparation of the placenta, will pour out ſo profuſely, that the unfortunate woman will very quickly ſink under it. This unhappy event can be prevented by no other means but by an expeditious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery. The alarming ſituation of the woman will be ſufficiently indicated by the appearance and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid increaſe of flooding, and by the ſoft pappy feel of the after-birth to the touch. One half-hour's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, or leſs, may in ſuch circumſtances prove fatal to the mother and the child; therefore the friends ſhould
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:022551_0190_0FB94328B2EE2988"/>
immediately be appriſed of the danger, and the earlieſt aſſiſtance be procured<note n="*" place="bottom">See method of delivery in flooding caſes, claſs 4th of Preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Labours.</note>.</p>
                     <p>THUS, in all labours merely lingering, the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, under proper management, will end favourably; the head, in the moſt awkward poſition, where the pelvis is tolerably well proportioned, will collapſe by preſſure; and, though the progreſs for ſome time may be ſlow and gradual, the termination of labour is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as ſafe for the child, and the recovery of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as expeditious, as if the birth were accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a few pains.</p>

                           <p>The forceps is an inſtrument intended to lay hold of the head of the child in laborious births, and to extract it as it preſents. This inſtrument, as now im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, in the hands of a prudent and cautious ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator, may be employed without doing the leaſt inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry either to mother or child.</p>
                           <p>The forceps, ſince their original invention, have undergone ſeveral important improvements and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations. Thoſe of Mr Wallace Johnſton, lately improved, ſeem preferable to every other. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the head, when high in the pelvis, may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by a long pair, ſuch as the long forceps of Dr SMELLIE, Mr PUGH, or Dr LEAK; but their application and powers are difficult and dangerous, and they can only be uſed with abſolute ſafety in the hands of an expert practitioner<note n="*" place="bottom">See a figure of the improved forceps in Dr Smellie's Plates.</note>.</p>

                           <head>GENERAL RULES for uſing the FORCEPS.</head>
                           <p n="1">1. The forceps ſhould never be employed till the firſt ſtage of labour be completely accompliſhed; till the head of the child is protruded below the brim of the pelvis; and till, by the continued preſſure of the head, the tumor of the perinaeum is in ſome degree formed.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. As the ſafety of the mother is our only apology for uſing inſtruments, the forceps ſhould never be employed but in the moſt urgent and neceſſitous ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: as, for example, when the woman is much ſpent or exhauſted: when the parts are ſwelled, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with <hi>ſuppreſſio urinae;</hi> when the pains are weak or trifling, or have ceaſed entirely, and are not likely to recur; or when ſhe is threatened with convulſions, floodings, or faintings.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. The contents of the rectum and bladder ſhould be emptied in all caſes where inſtruments are employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to aſſiſt the delivery.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. The poſition of the head ſhould be exactly known before attempting to apply the forceps.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. The poſition of the woman muſt be regulated by the preſentation of the child's head. In the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleſt and eaſieſt of the forceps caſes, when the head is ſo far advanced as to preſs conſiderably againſt the perinaeum, and the ears are nearly lateral or diagonal, ſhe may be placed on her back or ſide, with her
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:022551_0196_0FB9433930A82958"/>
breech over the edge of the bed; but, when the head is higher in the pelvis, and the ears towards the pubes and ſacrum, the ſide, with the knees drawn up to the belly, as in natural labour, is the moſt commodious poſition both for the patient and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. The parts of the woman muſt be gently ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and well lubricated with the hand gradually introduced into the vagina, and the operator ſhould be able to touch the ear of the child with one or more fingers, before he attempts to introduce the firſt blade of the forceps.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. The Accoucheur being placed on a low ſeat, or in a kneeling poſture, let the right hand be ſlowly paſſed through the vagina into the pelvis, and ſearch for the ear of the child, which will always be found under the ramus of the iſchium, towards the pubes, or diagonally.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. He muſt then, with the left-hand take up the firſt blade of the forceps, previouſly lubricated, and warmed if the weather is cold, and conduct it along the palm of the right-hand, between it and the head of the child, till the point of the clam reaches the ear. The handle muſt be h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           <p n="9">9. It muſt then be inſinuated very ſlowly by a wriggling kind of motion, and the point kept cloſe
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:022551_0197_0FB9433BEBE41580"/>
to the head of the child, puſhing it on till it be applied along the ſide of the head over the ear.</p>
                           <p n="10">10. The firſt introduced hand muſt then be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn, the handle of the firſt blade ſteadily ſecured with it, and the other blade introduced, guided along the left-hand, in the ſame ſlow cautious manner and direction with the former.</p>
                           <p n="11">11. The blades being applied over the ears of the child, and the handles placed exactly oppoſite to each other, theſe laſt are to be brought gradually to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; carefully locked; and, leſt they ſhould ſlip in extracting, properly ſecured by tying a fillet or garter round them; but this muſt be looſed during the intervals of pulling, to prevent the brain from being injured by the continued preſſure.</p>

                           <p n="13">13. It ſhould be a conſtant rule, when difficulties occur in paſſing the forceps, to introduce the moſt troubleſome blade firſt. The handles ought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">

                           <p>IF the general rules for uſing the forceps are under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, we ſhall ſeldom be at a loſs how to apply them in particular caſes. They may be reduced to two general claſſes:
<list>
                                 <item>1. The ſmooth part of the cranium,</item>
                                 <item>2. The face, preſenting.</item>
                              </list>
                           </p>
                           <p>I. The variety of caſes where the CRANIUM pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, chiefly are,</p>
                           <p n="1">1. <hi>Natural Preſentation,</hi> with the head ſo far advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that the perinaeal tumor is conſiderably formed, the ears of the child nearly lateral, and the face to the coccyx.</p>
                           <p>The LEVER, by an expert practitioner, may be
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:022551_0199_0FB9433E812E1FC0"/>
ſometimes in this preſentation ſucceſsfully employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                           <p>If the FORCEPS are uſed, the woman may be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther placed in the natural poſition, or on her back; it is ſcarce neceſſary, then, to tie the handles. When applied, a pain ſhould be waited for. With one hand the perinaeum ſhould be guarded; with the other, the handles of the forceps gently raiſed towards the woman's belly, to bring the hind-head with a half-round turn from under the arch of the pubes; the operator at the ſame time riſing from his knees, if the woman be placed on her back.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. The <hi>Vertex preſenting with the Face laterally in the Pelvis.</hi>—The forceps can be ſeldom applied with ſafety in this poſition till the bulky part of the head has paſſed the brim, with the vertex preſſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the under part of the iſchium, and till an ear can be felt under the arch of the pubes.</p>
                           <p>The ear when felt, will determine to which ſide the face points.</p>
                           <p>Let the woman be placed on the oppoſite ſide where the face is.</p>
                           <p>Let the blade under the pubes be firſt applied, with the fore-part of the clam, to the occiput of the child.</p>
                           <p>Let the ſecond blade be introduced oppoſite to the firſt. Bring the handles together, and ſecure with a fillet.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="210" facs="unknown:022551_0200_0FB9433FEB3D59E8"/>
Gently move from blade to blade; favouring the direction (of the face to the ſacrum) which the head as it advances naturally takes; and, as the birth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, uſing the proper precautions to ſave the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinaeum.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. <hi>Fontanel preſentations</hi>—are the moſt difficult and dangerous of the forceps caſes.</p>
                           <p>In the progreſs of the labour we generally find, when the crown preſents, that the face points to the pubes; but the poſition can be readily learned from the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the fontanel and the direction of the ear.</p>
                           <p>The common ſhort forceps can ſeldom be ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully employed here, till the head be conſiderably ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in the pelvis. The forceps ſhould never be attempted to be applied in the fontanel preſentations till an ear can be eaſily felt. They muſt be intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced over the ears, and the extraction conducted on the general principles; carefully obſerving the direction which the head inclines to take, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in the moſt cautious deliberate manner, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                                 <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                              </gap> the parts of the woman may have time to ſtretch.</p>
                           <p>When the fontanel preſents, with the crown of the head nearly equal with the brim of the pelvis, and the face placed to the pubes or ſacrum, the long ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is of the head interſects the ſhort diameter of the pelvis. Though the forceps be applied in this poſition, and a firm hold obtained, it is ſometimes impoſſible to accompliſh the extraction; as the head
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:022551_0201_0FB9434166BBFC30"/>
will neither advance in the ſame direction, nor can the preſentation be altered by puſhing up and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the mechanical turns which Dr SMELLIE di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects, without the hazard of injuring the mother.</p>
                           <p>If the common method, therefore fails, the forceps ſhould be withdrawn, and the long ones attempted to be applied over the forehead and occiput. As the volume of the head, by the compreſſion it ſuffers from the action of the forceps, will be ſomewhat di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed the extraction may be then ſucceſsfully performed, and the child preſerved.</p>
                           <p>If this method ſhould alſo fail, in preference to the dreadful operation of embryotomy, Dr LEAK's double-curved forceps with the third blade may be had recourſe to. But of this expedient little can be ſaid with confidence; for the introduction of a third blade into a narrow paſſage, when two have already per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps been paſſed with difficulty, however ingenious the invention, is not eaſily to be put in practice.</p>
                           <p>All other varieties of cranial caſes muſt be treated according to the rules already directed.</p>
                           <p>II. FACE PRESENTATIONS.—From its length and unequal ſurface the face will occaſion greater pain, and from the ſolidity of the bones it yields to the propelling force with more difficulty, than the uniform moveable ſurface of the cranium. The head will, however, in moſt caſes, advance in that
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:022551_0202_0FB94343ACE0EFF8"/>
poſition, by the force of the natural-pains, though the delivery will be more ſlow or painful. I have ſeldom had occaſion, in a well-formed pelvis, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfere in face-preſentations, in any other manner than by introducing two fingers into the mouth, and pulling down the jaw.</p>
                           <p>As the attempts of the moſt expert practitioners, if too early exerted, may be attended with fatal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences; and, even when aſſiſtance is given at the proper time, our endeavours are often diſappointed; in whatever manner the face preſents, it ſhould be allowed to advance as low as poſſible: by which means the acceſs will be more eaſy; and the poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for the application of inſtruments, more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable.</p>
                           <p>In theſe awkward poſitions, the injury occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by officious interference has been often fatal; whereas, if time had been given, and the patient pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſupported, the delivery would have generally ended well.</p>
                           <p>The variety of FACE-CASES may be reduced to the following.</p>
                           <list>
                              <item>1<hi>ſt,</hi> The face preſenting with the chin to the pubes.</item>
                              <item>2<hi>dly,</hi> To the ſacrum.</item>
                              <item>3<hi>dly,</hi> Laterally.</item>
                           </list>
                           <p>Face-poſitions are readily known, from the ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualities of the ſurface to the touch; from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:022551_0203_0FB94346B727CFE0"/>
noſe, the fiſſured mouth, &amp;c. In theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations, care muſt be taken, left, by the preſſure of the finger in touching, the eyes ſhould be injured.</p>
                           <p>When the face is detained at the brim of the pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis, with trifling or deficient pains, and any urgent circumſtance occurs to render the interpoſition of art neceſſary; it may be ſometimes ſucceſsfully accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed by the introduction of the hand into the pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis, to raiſe up the face and reduce the poſition by bringing down the cranium as already directed in Lingering Labour.</p>
                           <p>The ſucceſs of the practitioner, in theſe caſes, will depend on the bulk of the head, the make of the pelvis, and the progreſs of the labour; for, ſhould the head be firmly wedged in the pelvis, no force that can be employed with ſafety would be ſufficient to alter the poſition.</p>
                           <p>In ſuch circumſtances we are ſometimes adviſed to turn the the child; but <hi>turning</hi> is a troubleſome operation to the practitioner, hazardous to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, exceedingly precarious to the child; and ought, therefore, ſcarcely ever to be attempted.</p>
                           <p>In uſing the forceps in face-caſes, the general rules muſt be attended to. More particularly let the following directions be obſerved.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Before the firſt blade of the forceps is applied, let the jaw of the child be pulled down gently with a finger or two introduced in the mouth.</p>
                           <p n="2">
                              <pb n="214" facs="unknown:022551_0204_0FB9434C495F8940"/>
2. Let them be applied over the ears, with the locking parts between the noſe and the lip.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. In extracting, the operator ſhould favour the inclination which the chin takes to the pubes. The chin muſt be entirely diſengaged from under the arch of the pubes before the round of the head is extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, otherwiſe there is great hazard of lacerating the perinaeum.</p>

                        <p>WHEN the infant could not be ſaved by the mode of delivery employed in the extraction, the operation was termed by the ancients, <hi>Embryo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy.</hi>

                        <p>The object of this operation is to ſave the mother, when the child cannot be delivered in any other man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. It ſhould never, therefore, be performed, while there is any reaſonable proſpect of extracting the child alive; and ſhould, when conſiſtent with the mother's ſafe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        <p>Extreme narrowneſs of the pelvis, or extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bulk of the child, are the only circumſtances which juſtify the neceſſity of having recourſe to the horid operation of embryotomy.</p>
                        <p>The chief cauſe of difficult labour, is diminiſhed capacity of the pelvis from diſtortion. For when the

brim, inſtead of 4¼, inches from pubes to ſacrum, meaſures only 1½, 1¼, 2 or 2¼, inches, the uſe of the ſciſſars and crotchet is neceſſary; and if the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe diameter comes ſhort of 3 inches, the head of the foetus, unleſs the ſize be proportionally ſmall or the ſutures very open, is ſeldom protruded ſo low that the forceps can be ſucceſsfuly uſed.</p>
                        <p>We judge of the figure and dimenſions of the pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis, by the general make and conſtruction of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; by the progreſs of the labour; by the touch.

                        <p>But, if the patient is delicate or weakly, if the pains are frequent and teazing, if the progreſs of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latation of the uterine orifice be ſlow, and there is reaſon to ſuſpect conſiderable reſiſtance to the extrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the head from the diſtortion of the pelvis, the opening, with a view to diminiſh the volume of the child's head ſhould be performed as ſoon as there is eaſy acceſs to apply the ſciſſars.

re-ſhut, half-turned, and again widely opened, ſo as to make a crucial hole in the ſkull. They muſt afterwards be puiſhed beyond the reſts, opened dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonally again and again, in ſuch a manner as to tear and break to pieces the bones of the cranium, and deſtroy the texture of the brain; they muſt then be ſhut with great care, and withdrawn along the hand in the ſame cautious manner as they were introduced, leſt they ſhould cut or tear the uterus, vagina, or any other part of the woman. After a free opening in the cranium has been made, the brain muſt be ſcooped out with the fingers, blunt-hook, the ſingle lever, or a common ſpoon; and the looſe ſharp pieces of bone muſt be carefully ſeparated and removed with the fingers of the operator, or a pair of ſmall forceps, that no part of the woman be wounded in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent attempts for extracting the head. The tegu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the ſcalp ſhould then be brought over the ragged bones of the cranium; and the woman ſhould be allowed to reſt for twelve, twenty-four hours, or longer, according to her ſtrength and other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances: the bones of the cranium will afterwards collapſe; and if the patient be not much exhauſted, or the pelvis not exceedingly diſtorted, the head, its volume having been conſiderably diminiſhed, will be protruded by the force of natural pains. If theſe are not ſufficient, it muſt be extracted, either by means of two fingers introduced within the cavity

                           <p>Dr SMELLIE directs the crotchet to be fixed on the <hi>outſide</hi> of the ſkull, which is more difficult and hazardous than the method now employed; and his
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:022551_0211_0FB9435DECD3B928"/>
directions have been, till of late, very generally fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed<note n="*" place="bottom">"Some writers direct us to introduce the crotchet within the ſkull, and, preſſing one hand againſt the point on the outſide, pull along. But this is a <hi>trifling expedient:</hi> and, if a good deal of force is uſed, the inſtrument tears through the thin bone, and hurts the operators hand, or the woman's vagina, if not both: Whereas, in the other method, there is much more certainty, and a better purchaſe to force along the head, which collapſes and is diminiſhed as the brain is diſcharged, and never comes down in a broad flattened form, according to the allegations of ſome people whoſe idea of theſe things are imperfect and confuſed," &amp;c. <hi>Smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie's Midwifery,</hi> Book iii. ſect 7.</note>.</p>
                           <p>When the hook ſlips its hold, the looſe pieces of bone muſt be carefully ſeparated and removed with the fingers; the crotchet muſt again be applied a little higher, and the pulling force repeated as before: proceeding in this manner till the ſuperior part of the cranium is cut and divided, and the ſubſtance of the brain diſcharged.</p>
                           <p>The chief objects to be attended to be in the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the hook, are, firſt to guide the point with the fingers within the opening of the cranium; then, by moving it backwards and forwards, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade the bone ſo as to ſecure a firm hold; and, laſtly, in extracting, to guard againſt the accidents of wounding or otherwiſe injuring the woman, which might readily happen if it ſhould loſe its hold.</p>
                           <p>In the firſt part of the operation, for the reaſons
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:022551_0212_0FB9435F6C048A18"/>
already mentioned, the point of the crotchet ſhould never, if poſſible, be truſted beyond where the fingers can eaſily reach.</p>
                           <p>One blade, in general, is ſufficient to be employed for the extraction. Both branches can ſeldom be uſed at once with advantage or ſafety.</p>
                           <p>After the brain is diſcharged, the <hi>blunt-hook</hi> may be ſucceſsfully employed as an extractor, where the pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis is not remarkably faulty. The ſmall end is to be paſſed into the opening of the cranium, and the point to be guarded with great care, by preſſing externally on the cranium, oppoſite, as in uſing the crotchet.</p>
                           <p>As caſes of extreme narrowneſs of the pelvis from diſtortion very ſeldom occur, the head will, in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, yield to repeated efforts of pulling, in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner juſt now directed.</p>
                           <p>If this method ſhould fail, the crotchet muſt be introduced within the opening as before, and fixed in the baſis of the ſkull where a ſecure hold can be obtained; the handle ſhould be covered with a cloth, to enable the operator to take a firm hold; the point ſhould in general be directed poſteriorly to the mother; and in employing the neceſſary exerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of pulling, the axis of the pelvis and vagina ſhould be attended to. The operator ſhould then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to bring down the head by pulling at firſt moderately, and at proper intervals increaſing the
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:022551_0213_0FB94361F369F4F0"/>
force according to the reſiſtance from diminiſhed capacity of the pelvis. He muſt reſerve his own and patient's ſtrength, by reſting from time to time, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying her with ſuitable nouriſhment; and, in a word muſt perſevere in his endeavours to finiſh the extrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the beſt manner the circumſtances of the caſe will admit of.</p>
                           <p>In face-caſes, where it is impracticable to alter the poſition, and when the pelvis is much diſtorted, the the double crotchet is recommended; the handles muſt be well ſecured, kept well backwards towards the perinaeum, and the motion always from blade to blade. It very ſeldom, however, happens that there is occaſion for the double crotchet: by this means the head is flattened in pulling, and prevented from ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the proper direction; whereas if one blade only be employed, the head is lengthened, and in pulling can better accommodate itſelf to the ſhape of the pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis as it paſſes along.</p>
                           <p>Beſides, in face-preſentations, by applying one blade only towards the lateral part, and pulling ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely to the oppoſite ſide, the poſition may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and eaſy acceſs at laſt obtained to the hairy ſcalp, to make the perforation, evacuate the brain, and diminiſh the volume of the head.</p>
                           <p>When the head is extracted, if from extreme nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowneſs of the pelvis the ſhoulders ſhould give conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable reſiſtance, a crotchet muſt be fixed in the
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:022551_0214_0FB943648CB3E460"/>
ſhoulder, in order to bring down one of the arms, and by pulling at it and the remaining portion of the head covered with a cloth, eaſy acceſs will be procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the other arm, which muſt be managed in the ſame manner. The crotchet muſt then be fixed in the trunk among the ribs, the thorax and abdomen opened if neceſſary, and the delivery accompliſhed by tearing the child away in pieces.</p>
                           <p>Should it be poſſible for a caſe to occur, which by the bye is ſcarce within the reach of reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, an accident which can only happen to an ignorant or very blundering practitioner, where the vertebrae of the neck have been divided by the crotch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, and the head ſevered from the body, both being ſtill retained in the pelvis: In theſe circumſtances, the head, if it cannot be extracted firſt, muſt be puſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up above the brim of the pelvis, the crotchet or blunt-hook muſt be fixed under the axilla, the arms muſt be brought down, and the body extracted, by fixing the crotchet below the ſcapula, on the ſternum, or among the ribs<note n="*" place="bottom">Such a caſe actually occurred to the late Mr Robert Smith ſurgeon in Edinburgh ſoon after he began to practiſe. The parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular circumſtances of this ſingle hiſtory, as communicated to me by Mr Smith himſelf, are as follows.—A young woman had been ſeveral days in ſtrong labour; the head, he imagined, had origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally preſented in an oblique direction at the brim of the pelvis. The patient was ſo much exhauſted when Mr Smith was called, and ſhe was otherwiſe ſeemingly ſo low, that it was doubtful to him whether ſhe could ſupport the fatigue of delivery. The caſe appeared the more diſcouraging and unfavourable, becauſe, on touching, he could not determine the manner in which the child preſented, its head having been formerly cut off from the body by an unſucceſsful attempt to procure a delivery; nor could he even poſitively ſay, whether it was a foetus, or a very ſingular mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous production, from the uncommon feel which the ragged ſtump of the neck gave to the touch. Determined, however, to give the woman a chance of life, he fixed a crotchet in the part which preſented, brought down firſt one arm, then another; and afterwards, to his aſtoniſhment, extracted the trunk of a <hi>body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a head.</hi> On inquiry, he was informed that a ſurgeon in the neighbourhood had in vain, after many fruitleſs efforts, attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make the extraction, but abandoned the woman in that ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and aſſured the relations it was not poſſible to accompliſh the delivery; which they had artfully concealed from Mr Smith. The head was afterwards extracted with the crotchet, and the woman had a good recovery.</note>; a method preferable to that of
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:022551_0215_0FB943696067DE30"/>
turning, as ſome adviſe. The head muſt afterwards be extracted with the crotchet.</p>
                           <p>In thoſe caſes of narrow pelvis, where it is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to diminiſh the volume of the child's head to procure the extraction with ſafety to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, our ſucceſs will chiefly depend on a ſeaſonable performance of the firſt part of the operation. The head ſhould be opened, and the brain diſcharged, as ſoon as the dilatation of the orificium uteri will admit of it. The woman may be then ſafely allowed to reſt for 24 hours or more, even till the compages of
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:022551_0216_0FB9436C71504868"/>
the cranial bones of the foetus be ſomewhat diſſolved by putrefaction; the natural pains, during that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, will either be ſufficient to accompliſh the birth; or the head will by their means be protruded ſo low, that the acceſs will be eaſy to apply the crotchet, and little force be neceſſary to procure the extraction. Whereas, if the firſt part of the operation (to wit, making a ſufficient opening into the cranium for the diſcharge of the brain) be too long delayed, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of violent mechanical force employed, where the extraction muſt be performed in haſte, may be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to the patient.</p>
                           <p>For the propriety of this practice we can appeal to the experience of every practitioner; and if argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were neceſſary to enforce it, we might refer to various hiſtories mentioned by authors, where the head of a foetus in a ſemi-putrid ſtate was expelled by the natural pains, after it had been ſevered from the body and retained in the uterus for ſeveral days; the unfortunate woman having been abandoned to the moſt deplorable ſtate of deſpair by the inhuman o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perator.</p>
                           <p>It is aſtoniſhing, that the rule of obſerving an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval between the firſt and ſecond ſteps of delivery in <hi>embryulcia</hi> ſhould be regarded, in the writings of the lateſt author on this ſubject, as a trifling inſignificant precaution, when the facility of the operation to the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner,
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:022551_0217_0FB9436DAC124D88"/>
and ſafety of the patient, ſo much depend on it<note n="*" place="bottom">"It has of late become faſhionable in practice, when the head has been opened, and the brain evacuated, to ſuffer the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the delivery to be effected by labour, or, if this is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient, to poſtpone it for ſome hours or longer, in order to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the bones of the cranium to collapſe and be puſhed forward, and the woman to be refreſhed. But this delay ſeems totally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper: 1. Becauſe the opening of the head ſhould not be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted whilſt the woman is capable of bearing ſo much longer labour, under the expectation, or the hope at leaſt, that the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of ſo much farther delay might poſſibly bring it within the reach of the forceps. 2. There is no neceſſity for greatly fatigue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or exhauſting the woman in opening the head, or even in bringing it down, provided it be ſufficiently reduced in its ſize. 3. If any inflammation has taken place, the ſoreneſs will be greater after the delay.

                        <p>The operation conſiſts in making an inciſion with a ſcalpel through the common integuments and ſoft

parts, in the direction of the commiſſure of the oſſa pubis. The articulation at the cartilaginous ſymphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, muſt afterwards be divided by the ſame inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The knees of the patient are to be kept gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeparate by an aſſiſtant. A catheter is directed to be introduced, to prevent the accident of wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bladder in the operation; and we are advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, for the ſame reaſon, to make the inciſion, both of the ſoft parts and cartilages, a little towards the left ſide. The diſtraction of the bones is afterwards to be attempted, as far as is neceſſary or practicable, by a cautious and gradual extenſion of the thighs.</p>
                        <p>The operation being finiſhed, the contractile efforts of the uterus are to be waited for to expel the child. The patient is afterwards to be confined to bed for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral weeks, a bandage to be applied round the loins, and the management directed on general principles. But if the natural pains ſhould then fail, the ſciſſars and crotchet muſt be uſed; the child muſt be turned; or the Caeſarian ſection had recourſe to.</p>
                        <p>The firſt propoſition, by deſtroying the child, diſappoints the original intention of the operation. For, if the mother could be delivered by the crot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chet with ſafety, at the expence of deſtroying the child, that method will always be preferable to a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious attempt to ſave the child, at the hazard of the mother's life. If the pain and danger ſhe ſuffers in the new operation, is not to be compenſated by
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:022551_0222_0FB94376056D2900"/>
a moral probability of ſaving the child, the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is then <hi>entirely uſeleſs.</hi> And again, if it ſhould fail to enlarge the dimenſions of the pelvis, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryulcia be afterwards neceſſary, the mother, in that event, is wantonly expoſed to the increaſed danger ariſing from both operations combined, with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional hazard from the violence of mechanical force employed to extract the child, after the parts which ſuffer in the firſt operation have been wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the bones torn from each other.</p>
                        <p>The great ſtreſs applied to the nervous aponeurotic parts, at the ſacro-iliac ſymphyſis poſteriorly, may of itſelf alſo be fatal to the patient, or prove the cauſe of incurable lameneſs, independent of the other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents incident to the operation.</p>
                        <p>With all deference to an authority which is univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally reſpected, and which in few inſtances has been called in queſtion, we muſt beg leave to differ in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion from Dr HUNTER, whoſe ſentiments on this ſubject, though in general unfavourable to the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, incline him to ſuggeſt, <q>that the crotchet may be employed with ſafety to the mother when it fails.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>The ſecond method, of attempting delivery by <hi>turning,</hi> with a view to ſave the child if the natural pains ſhould be inſufficient to protrude the head, after the bones of the pubes have been divided by SI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GAULT's operation, although we are informed it
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:022551_0223_0FB94377630D6F38"/>
has been ſucceſsfully practiſed in one or more caſes in the Continent, is a moſt dangerous expedient to the mother. The proſpect it affords for the ſafety of the child in a narrow pelvis, is too remote to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage an experienced practitioner, who knows the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties that often attend turning in more favourable circumſtances, to engage in this troubleſome taſk. Such a propoſition in this country would be rejected with contempt by the generality of practitioners.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Caeſarean ſection</hi> is the third method propoſed for accompliſhing delivery with ſafety to the child, the ſection of the pubes having failed, if the child cannot be eaſily extracted by the crotchet. It hath actually been practiſed in a ſingle inſtance, under the circumſtances juſt now mentioned. It is needleſs to add, that the unhappy patient ſoon after died. A recovery, under ſuch complicated ſufferings, would have been almoſt miraculous; and few practitioners will be hardy enough, if their miſguided judgement were permitted to rule, to venture a ſecond time on an experiment ſo ſtrictly deſperate.</p>
                        <p>Dr LEAK has, with his uſual judgement, good ſenſe, and humanity, conſidered the advantages and diſadvantages of the Sigaultian operation; and ſeems to favour it in preference to the Caeſarean ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe the former <q>does not carry with it thoſe ideas of cruelty which attend the latter, where the patient is, as it were, embowelled alive.
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:022551_0224_0FB9437B73A3A678"/>
No formidable apparatus is neceſſary, the ſection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made with expedition, and without pain and danger: no blood-veſſel, nerve, or other parts eſſential to life, are wounded; thoſe divided being only <hi>cutis, cellular membrane,</hi> and inſenſible carti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, from which neither <hi>hemorrhagy</hi> nor <hi>ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomatic fever</hi> are to be apprehended<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr Leak's Practicable Obſervations on the Child-bed fever, &amp;c. 5<hi>th edition,</hi> p. 255.</note>.</q> He is therefore inclined to think, that with thoſe <q>who are diſpoſed to give this new operation a fair and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious trial, as <hi>it has already ſucceeded, it will again ſucceed.</hi>
                           </q> But though, in the body of a dead female ſubject in the Weſtminſter lying-in Hoſpital, the bones of the pubes after inciſion receded 2 1/8 inches without much violence, it does not appear that any conſiderable acquiſition of ſpace in the dimenſions of the pelvis was procured by it. I have had occaſion to make the ſame experiment in repeated inſtances on the dead ſubject with no better ſucceſs.</p>
                        <p>Upon the whole, therefore, from all the information we have yet received of the event of this new ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, we have little reaſon to adopt it in preference of the method of delivery by the crotchet, wherever that inſtrument can be uſed with ſafety to the mother; and, as the ſpace to be gained by it is as uncertain as the exact dimenſions of the child's head before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery,
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:022551_0225_0FB9437CF245B870"/>
it would be raſh and unwarrantable to adopt an expedient, precarious with reſpect to the child, and highly dangerous to the mother, in ſubſtitution of embryulcia; which, if not too long delayed, may, in the preſent improved ſtate of the art, be employed in moſt caſes of diſtortion with <hi>perfect ſafety</hi> to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who is always juſtly intitled to the firſt place in our intentions, and whoſe valuable life is the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting and important object of our regard.</p>

                        <p>WHEN the child could not be delivered by the natural paſſages, or when a woman died un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delivered though the child was probably alive, an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration with a view to preſerve the mother and child in the firſt caſe, and to ſave the child in the latter, has been ſtrongly recommended.

                        <p>It is ſtyled <hi>Caeſarean Section</hi> from Julius Caeſar, who is ſaid firſt to have received his appellation from this circumſtance of his birth, and in his turn to have conferred it on the attempt. There is much reaſon, however, to ſuſpect, that this relation, like many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtories of Pliny, is fabulous; and it is more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to ſuppoſe that the name, in fact, was the

But in thoſe days the Grecian phyſicians were held in abhorrence for the cruelty of their operations, and it is ſcarcely probable they would then dare to propoſe the delivery of the child by an expedient which appeared to be as raſh and formidable in the attempt as dangerous in the conſequences. If there is any foundation for the ſtory, it probably refers to the attempt of ſaving the child by this ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in caſes of the ſudden death of the mother: for there is no certain accounts of its having ever been performed by the ancients on the living ſubject.</p>
                        <p>Books are full of hiſtories to ſhow that Hiſteroto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my has been practiſed with ſucceſs by the moderns on various occaſions; yet authors are much divided in opinion on the ſubject. Some poſitively deny that a woman can ſurvive the daring attempt: while others contend that it is frequently ſafe, though ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally dangerous; and relate many examples where it has not only been performed with ſucceſs, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly practiſed on the ſame ſubject.</p>

to prove the improbability, and even impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility, of its ſucceſs, from its analogy with other wounds, as well as the anatomy of the parts. He is at great pains to invalidate the authority of BAU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHIN, ROUSSET, LA MOTT, and other favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of that unparalleled cruelty, by denying the facts they have endeavoured to tranſmit to poſterity in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of it.

At the bottom the rami iſchii were ſo much contracted, that the ſpace between them was ſomewhat leſs than half an inch.</p>
                        <p>It is obvious to a demonſtration, that the volume of the head of a mature foetus cannot, by the operation of embryulcia, be diminiſhed to ſuch a ſize as to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it capable of paſſing through a pelvis whoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions do not exceed either of thoſe juſt now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>

The woman had been five days in ſtrong la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour before Dr KELLIE had an opportunity of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her. <q>The head remained above the brim of the pelvis, and had not then made the ſmalleſt progreſs. It was of a large ſize, firmly oſſified; and the parts in the paſſages were ſo extremely
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:022551_0232_0FB9438EA55459C8"/>
tender, that the poor woman, who was ſomewhat faint and much fatigued by the protraction of labour, could not bear the moſt gentle examination without great pain.</q> The Doctor proceeded to perform the operation of embryulcia <q>by making a large opening in the cranium, which was effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with difficulty, on account of the head project<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo much over the pubes that the ſhank of the ſciſſars was preſſed forcibly againſt the perinaeum, to get the points in a proper direction.</q> He now left the patient; and on returning, in 24 hours af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <q>found the head advanced into the pelvis ſo low, that the jagged end of one of the parietal bones preſſed againſt the inner part of the perinaeum, very near the os externum.

                        <p>It is much to be regretted, that the unfortunate patient, who ſeemed to do well for a week, <q>having imprudently drank freely of raw porter, with ſome people who came to ſee her, was afterwards ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed with a violent purging, of which ſhe died in three days<note n="*" place="bottom">Johnſon's Midwifery, page 284.</note>.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>

The above caſe affords, however, an important leſſon of inſtruction to practitioners of midwifery. If, after the patient had been five days in hard labour, the head of a mature foetus could be truſted for 24 hours after opening to the natural pains, and paſs through a diſtorted pelvis of the dimenſions above mentioned, ſo low as to preſs with the parietal bones againſt the perinaeum, and be capable of extraction with the blunt-hook;—we need not deſpair of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting delivery with the ſciſſars and crotchet, where the pelvis comes ſomewhat ſhort of theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions, if the head be opened early. For, by waiting with patience, as long as there is time for it, the head will collapſe, and be protruded ſo low by the force of the pains, that the acceſs will afterwards be eaſy to apply the crotchet; ſo that by pulling with it, and aſſiſting with the fingers to adapt the ſmall axis of the head to the leaſt diameter of the pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis, the extraction will be accompliſhed with facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſafety.</p>
                        <p>The projection of the angle of the ſacrum towards the pubes, is by much the moſt frequent mode of diſtortion. In ſome inſtances, the intermediate ſpace is ſo inconſiderable, that the diameter at the brim is divided, as it were, into two cavities. In this ſpecies of diſtortion, it is evident, on account of the diſtance of, and conſequently difficult acceſs to, the preſenting part of the child, that the danger in
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:022551_0234_0FB94391B29C2570"/>
embryulcia will be proportionably conſiderable: for if the narrowneſs at the brim proves an unſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mountable obſtacle to the paſſing, and the figure and <hi>diſtortion at the bottom</hi> prevents the introduction of the hand to direct and apply the proper inſtruments with ſafety to the mother: in ſuch circumſtances we muſt either abandon the patient to utter deſpair, or by the laſt reſource of deſponding hope endeavour to ſave her.</p>
                        <p>It remains, then, to inquire,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. If dividing the bones of the pubes by the lately invented operation, affords a reaſonable proſpect of procuring even a ſafe delivery to the mother when it cannot be accompliſhed by embryulcia?</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Is the capacity of the pelvis, in any inſtance, ſo much deſtroyed, from diſtortion, that a dead child cannot be extracted by means of the ſciſſars and crot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chet?</p>
                        <p>Firſt, Where the pelvis is ſo much diſtorted, that, the diminution of the child's head to ſomewhat more than half of the uſual ſize is inſufficient to render deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very practicable, SIGAULT's operation could have little effect to enable the head to paſs unleſs its vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume had been previouſly leſſened. Some advantage would then be gained by dividing the bones of the pelvis; but not ſo much as to encourage us to hope that the child would afterwards be propelled by the natural pains, or in theſe circumſtances, extracted by
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:022551_0235_0FB94393B7E5B528"/>
the crotchet, without employing a degree of violence which might probably be fatal to the mother.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, That the aperture of the pelvis is, in ſome caſes, ſo narrow from diſtortion, as to prove an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurmountable obſtacle to the paſſage of the child by embryulcia, the hiſtories of the Caeſarian ſection in the 4th and 5th volumes of the London Eſſays already referred to, afford ſtriking and inconteſtible examples.</p>
                        <p>In the pelvis of a woman on whom the Caeſarean ſection was performed by Dr YOUNG, late profeſſor of midwifery in the Univerſity of Edinburgh, the tranſverſe diameter at the brim does not meaſure above 1¾ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches at one ſide; the bones of the pubes are bent, and refuſe admittance to a finger at the arch; the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crum is convex anteriorly; the anchyloſed coccyx is angulated; and the diſtance from it to the tuberoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the iſchia is ſomewhat leſs than 1¾ inches. In a pelvis of this conſtruction, where the bottom, and indeed whole capacity, are affected by the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion, embryulcia could ſcarce be attempted.</p>
                        <p>In a collection of bones, in my poſſeſſion, the conſtruction of a diſtorted pelvis of a female ſkele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton is ſtill more unfavourable for the operation of embryulcia than any of thoſe yet mentioned. The diameters at the brim are almoſt entirely deſtroyed by the projection of the lumbar vertebrae and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vexity of the ſacrum; diſtance at one ſide from the ſacrum to to the ilium being ¾ths of an inch only.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="246" facs="unknown:022551_0236_0FB9439656722B88"/>
It is ſufficiently apparent, that here nothing but the Caeſarean ſection could give the patient the moſt diſtant chance of life from the danger which threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened.</p>
                        <p>It is probable, therefore, that a faulty pelvis, whoſe ſmalleſt diameter at the brim or bottom does not exceed 1½ inch, or 1¾, is one motive for the deſperate reſource of the Caeſarean ſection. The difference in the ſize and ſtructure of a child's head may alſo render it neceſſary, where the tranſverſe diameter of the ſuperior aperture of the pelvis, and lateral one of the outlet, ſomewhat exceed the dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions juſt now mentioned.</p>
                        <p>Before we inquire into the practicability of the Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarean operation with a probability that the mother will ſurvive it, we ſhall next endeavour to ſhow that <hi>all the other</hi> caſes in which it has been perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med or propoſed are improper indications for it.</p>
                        <p>II. <hi>Conſtriction from Cicatrix, Calloſity, and Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, any where about the Vagina or Os Tincae.</hi>—The vagina and os tincae are often affected with conſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from cicatrices, with calloſities and tumors; but it is never neceſſary to perform the Caeſarean ſection on their account. Tumors in the vagina may generally be removed with ſafety even after the commencement of labour, and delivery happily ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed; or it may be ſometimes practicable for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coucheur
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:022551_0237_0FB943986346AF78"/>
to paſs his hand by the ſide of the tumor, to turn the child, and deliver. There are many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances where, at the commencement of labour, it was impoſſible to introduce a finger into the vagina; yet the parts have dilated as labour increaſed, and the delivery terminated happily. At other times the dilatation has begun during pregnancy, and been completed before delivery. A ſtriking inſtance of this kind is recorded in the Mem. de l'Acad. des Scienc. 1712, of a woman whoſe vagina was no larger than to admit a common writing quill. She had been married at ſixteen, and conceived eleven years after. Towards the fifth month of her preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy, the vagina began to dilate, and continued to do ſo till full time, when ſhe was ſafely delivered.</p>

                        <p>Dr HARVEY relates a caſe where the whole va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gina was grown together with cicatrices: nature, after a tedious labour, made the dilatation, and a large child was born.</p>
                        <p>M. LA MOTT<note n="*" place="bottom">Traité des Accouchemens, p. 527.</note> mentions his having delivered three women, who had not the ſmalleſt veſtige of an orifice through the vagina to the uterus. Dr SIMP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SON

cut through a calloſity of an os uteri which was half an inch thick<note n="†" place="bottom">Edinburgh Med. Eſſays, Vo. III.</note>, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Upon the whole, tumors in the vagina, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the orificium uteri, may be ſafely extirpated without danger of hemorrhagy or other fatal ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, and the delivery will happily ſucceed: And, if the vagina be impervious, the os externum ſhut up, or the labia grown together, the parts ſhould be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened with a ſcalpel. If the os externum be entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cloſed, if the cavity of the vagina be filled up, or the paſſage conſiderably obſtructed by the tumors, callo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, or conſtriction from cicatrix, and there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſuſpect a fault in the pelvis, of which a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be formed by the common marks of defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, under-ſize, or a rickety habit; it is by much the beſt practice to open a paſſage through the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gina, and deliver the woman in the ordinary way.</p>
                        <p>If there be no defect in the pelvis, the head of the child, or any other bulky part that preſents, will advance in this direction till it meets with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence in the ſoft parts: the teguments, in that caſe, will be protruded before the childs head, in form of a tumor, when a ſimple inciſion downwards to the perinaeum, in the direction of the axis vaginae will remove the cauſe of difficulty, by relieving the head; the child will afterwards ſafely paſs, and the wound will heal without any bad conſequence.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="249" facs="unknown:022551_0239_0FB9439DB21C00C0"/>
When there is any defect in the ſoft parts, which prevents the acceſs of the finger into the vagina, the head of the child may be readily felt, and the ſtate of the parts in ſome degree judged of by the introduction of a finger into the anus.</p>
                        <p>III. <hi>Lacerated Uterus</hi> is another cauſe, for which this operation has been recommended. The uterus may be ruptured from the croſs preſentation of the child in time of pregnancy, when the uterine fibres do not readily yield to the diſtending cauſe, or from mechanical violence in attempting delivery. Theſe caſes are generally fatal; and the life of the mother can ſeldom be ſaved by the Caeſarean ſection, after the foetus eſcapes through the torn uterus into the cavity of the abdomen; becauſe inflammation and ſphacelus have generally affected the parts of the uterus that ſuſtained the preſſure, previous to the rupture; if otherwiſe, convulſions or other fatal ſymptoms ſoon enſue, from the quantity of blood, waters, &amp;c. poured into the cavity of the abdomen.</p>
                        <p>When the child cannot be extracted by the natural paſſages, tremors, ſingultus, cold ſweats, ſyncope, and the death of the mother, for the moſt part ſo quickly follow, that it will at leaſt ſeem doubtful to a humane practitioner, how far it would be adviſable, after ſo dreadful an accident, the woman apparently in the ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onies of death, raſhly to perform another dangerous
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:022551_0240_0FB9439F298662E8"/>
operation, even with a view to preſerve the child, before he had waited till the mother recruits or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires.</p>
                        <p>If part of the child be contained within the uterus and the feet can be reached the beſt practice is to de-deliver by the orifice of the womb. When the whole foetus has eſcaped entirely without the uterus, the Caeſarean operation is recommended as the only means of preſerving both mother and child.</p>
                        <p>But if the operation on this occaſion be ever allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, it may be aſked,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. At what time ſhould it be performed?</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Would it not have the appearance of inhuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, to have recourſe to this expedient immediately after the uterus burſts, when the woman is ſeemingly ready to expire, although it be the only time when there is a chance of ſaving the child?</p>
                        <p n="3">3. In moſt caſes where this accident happens, ſhould the Caeſarean ſection be made, it is not highly improbable that the mother will ſurvive ſo terrible a laceration? At leaſt the uncertainty how long ſhe may ſurvive it, ſeems a conſiderable obſtacle to the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion under ſuch diſagreeable circumſtances; <hi>ne occidiſſe videatur, quem ſors interemit.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>IV. <hi>Ventral Conception</hi> is a fourth indication for this operation, Theſe are either in the ovaria, tubes, or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the abdomen, and ſeldom arrive at great ſize; or are retained, often for a great many years, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

occaſioning much complaint. The iſſue of theſe conceptions has alſo been no leſs various than extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary: for, after having been long retained in an indolent ſtate, abſceſſes or ulcerations have formed, and they have been diſcharged through all the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent parts of the abdomen<note n="*" place="bottom">
                              <hi>Vid.</hi> Mangeti Bibliothec. Medicin.; Journal De Scavans; Memoir. de l'Acad. des Sciences; Chapman's Midwifery; London Medical Obſervations; Dr Duncan's Medical Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, &amp;c.</note>.</p>
                        <p>Moſt women feel pain and violent motion towards the term of ordinary delivery, in theſe caſes of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral conception; if, therefore, the operation be ever neceſſary, then is the proper time to perform it. But in general, as the ſeparation of extra-uterine foetuſes from their involucra may occaſion imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate death in many caſes, in conſequence of the vaſt haemorrhagy that might enſue from the non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contractile power of the parts to which they adhere; unleſs they point outwardly, or excite violent ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, their expulſion ſhould be univerſally truſted to nature.</p>
                        <p>V. <hi>Herniae of the Uterus</hi> are never ſufficient indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to induce us to perform the Caeſarean ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the uterus is very rarely influenced in ſuch a manner, that the orifice cannot be reached, and the delivery ſucceſsfully made. Many inſtances are to be found among Surgical authors, where deliveries, under ſuch circumſtances, have been happily performed,
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:022551_0242_0FB943A324137940"/>
without having recourſe to ſo hazardous an expedient. MAURICEAU mentions a caſe, where the uterus in a ventral hernia was puſhed along with the inteſtines a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the belly, and contained in a tumor of a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ſize; the woman, however, was delivered at the end of her time in the ordinary way. M. LA MOTTE relates the hiſtory of a woman in a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural labour, whoſe uterus and child hang down pendulous to the middle of her thigh; but whom notwithſtanding, he ſafely delivered. And Dr RUYSCH gives a caſe, where the midwife reduced the hernia before delivery, although it was prolap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as far as the knee, the delivery was ſafely perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the woman had a good recovery.</p>

                           <hi>The Poſition or Bulk of the Child.</hi>—Since the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of turning the child and delivering by the feet, and the late improvement of obſtetrical inſtruments, this operation has never been performed on account of poſition, monſtroſity, or any other obſtacle on the part of the child merely. It will be obvious, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that the increaſed bulk of the foetus combined with diſtorted pelvis, will render the delivery propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally difficult and dangerous: and though we may, from a concurrence of fortunate circumſtances be enabled to perform the extraction by embryulcia in a pelvis ſomewhat leſs than the dimenſions menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in Dr KELLIE's caſe formerly referred to<note n="*" place="bottom">
                              <hi>Vide</hi> page 322.</note>,
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:022551_0243_0FB943A469657D08"/>
the difference in the bulk of the child may render it impracticable where the aperture of the pelvis ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what exceeds it.</p>
                        <p>Upon the whole, when, by a careful menſuration with the fingers, the pelvis appears to be faulty to ſuch a degreee as to refuſe paſſage to the diminiſhed ſize of the child's head by embryulcia, and there is no proſpect of accompliſhing delivery by the new opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of dividing the ſymphyſis pubis by inciſion; in other words, when it appears abſolutely impoſſible to deliver the woman by any other means, which is to be determined by a conſultation of experienced prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners; we ought <hi>then only</hi> to employ the dreadful expedient of cutting into the uterus to extract the child.</p>
                        <p>That this operation, frightful and hazardous as it moſt certainly is, has actually been performed with ſucceſs in a variety of caſes, the writings of ſeveral authors of character afford the moſt unqueſtionable evidence<note n="†" place="bottom">See the authors already quoted.</note>.</p>
                        <p>We have reaſon, however, to ſuſpect, that the facts related in thoſe hiſtories have been miſrepreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or the event of the operation in Great Britain ought not to have been ſo univerſally fatal.

                              <p>ELISABETH CLERK, aged thirty, had been married for ſeveral years, became pregnant, and miſcarried in the third month; the expulſion of the abortion occaſioned ſo ſevere a ſtreſs, as actually to lacerate the perinaeum. Some time after her recovery, ſhe was irregular; afterwards had one ſhow of the menſes; again conceived; and the child, as ſhe imagined, arrived at full time. She was attacked, on Monday the 3d January 1774, about mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, with labour-pains; which went on ſlowly, gradually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing till Saturday the 15th, when ſhe was brought from the country to the Royal Infirmary here. Upon examination, the pelvis ſeemed conſiderably diſtorted; but the body was otherwiſe well ſhaped, tho' of ſmall ſize. The os externum vaginae was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely ſhut up; nor could any veſtige of vagina be obſerved, nor any appearance of labia pudendorum: Inſtead of theſe, there was a ſmall aperture at the ſuperior part of the vulva, immediately, under the mons veneri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Another unſucceſsful attempt was made to paſs the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male catheter: at length a male catheter was procured, which was, after ſome difficulty, introduced into the bladder; and the urine evacuated to the quantity of four pounds, high ſmelled and fetid. This occaſioned a neceſſary interruption, for a few mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, between making the opening into the abdomen and uterus; the bladder collapſing, the uterus, which before lay concealed, now came in view; through which an inciſion was made, and a ſtout male child was extracted alive; and immediately afterwards the ſecundines. The uterus contracted rapidly. After cleanſing the wound, the lips were brought together by the quill-ſuture, and dreſſed ſuperficially. The patient ſupported the operation with ſurpriſing courage and reſolution; and no more than five or ſix ounces of blood were loſt on the occaſion.</p>
                              <p>Being laid in bed, ſhe complained of ſickneſs, and had a ſlight fit of vomiting; but, by means of an anodyne, theſe ſymptoms ſoon abated. She was affected with univerſal coldneſs over her body; which alſo abated, on the application of warm irons to the feet. She then became eaſy, and ſlept for four or five hours. Next morning, the 16th, about two o'clock, ſhe complained of conſiderable pain in the oppoſite ſide: for which ſhe was blooded, and an injection was given, but without effect; for the pain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, ſtretching from the right ſide to the ſcrobiculus cordis; nor did fomentations ſeem to relieve her: her pulſe became fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, ſhe was hot, and complained of drought. At 7 A. M. the injection was repeated, but with no better ſucceſs; and eight ounces more of blood were taken from the arm. A third injection ſtill failed to evacuate any faeces; the drought increaſed; and the pulſe roſe to 128 ſtrokes in a minute. At 11 A. M. the pulſe became fuller, and the reſpiration much oppreſſed. No ſtool nor urine paſſed ſince the operation. At 12 ſhe was blooded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, when the ſizineſs appeared leſs than formerly. She now took a ſolution of ſal Glauberi, manna and cr. tart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at ſhort in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals; ſhe vomited a little after the laſt doſe, had a ſoft ſtool, and voided a ſmall quantity of urine. At 3 P. M. her pulſe was 136; and ſhe had another ſtool, when thin faeces were evacuated: ſhe was then ordered two ſpoonfuls of a cordial anodyne mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture every ſecond hour. The vomiting now abated; the pulſe became ſmaller and more frequent: ſhe paſſed urine freely; but the pain and oppreſſed breathing increaſed. At 7 P. M. her pulſe roſe to 142, and became weak and fluttering; ſhe called for bread, and ſwallowed a little with ſome difficulty; her drought was intenſe; the dyſpnoea ſtill increaſed. She was now much op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, began to toſs; the pulſe ſunk, and became impercepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: ſhe complained of faintiſhneſs; but on belching wind, her breathing was relieved, and the pulſe returned, growing fuller and ſtronger. The pain of the ſide ſtill increaſed; two glyſters of warm water with oil were then injected without effect. As 8 P. M. the pulſe became leſs frequent and ſmaller; ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained much of the pain towards the ſcrobiculus cordis; her breathing was much oppreſſed; her belly was tenſe, and ſwelled as big as before the operation; her pulſe was now ſmall and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; ſhe looked ghaſtly; and expired a little after eight, twenty-ſix hours after the operation.</p>

                        <p>Why, therefore, ſhould a recent wound through the teguments, peritonaeum, and uterus, be fatal in almoſt every inſtance<note n="*" place="bottom">
                              <p>About four years ago, in a caſe where the ſhoulder of the child had preſented in an oblique direction at the brim of the pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis, the labour had been permitted to go on from the morning to the afternoon; the midwife had miſtaken the preſenting part for the breech; and the pains, after a few hours, became ſo ſtrong and forcing, that ſhe expected the child to be propelled with every throe. The patient ſoon after became reſtleſs; toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and delirium enſued.</p>
                              <p>In this ſituation I was called in. When the patient was proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſecured by aſſiſtants, I paſſed up my hand with difficulty, and diſcovered a conſiderable rent in the uterus towards the ſuperior lateral part of the cervix, through which the ſhoulder and arm of the child had eſcaped into the cavity of the abdomen. Every at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to inſinuate the hand ſo high as to reach one or both feet, with a view to bring them down and deliver, brought on an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous guſh of blood. I was therefore obliged to deliver with the crotchet; and more readily adopted this method, as there was little reaſon to expect, from the hiſtory of the caſe, that the child was alive; it really appeared to have died the day before. After the feet and body were extracted, the firſt arm was readily relieved; but, in bringing down the other, though every poſſible precaution was employed, the wound in the uterus was increaſed downwards to the very edge of the os tincae.</p>
                              <p>The placenta was removed by the introduction of the hand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the uterus, on account of flooding; and ſome portion of inteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine reduced, which had been forced through the wound of the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terus, and protruded at the vagina almoſt as far as the os exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num. This gave me an opportunity of examining the rupture, which I found already amazingly diminiſhed by the contraction of the uterus.</p>
                              <p>I gave the patient an opiate, and took my leave; not expecting again to have ſeen her in life. She ſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>The particular method of performing the operation is deſcribed ſo ſatisfactorily by Dr MONRO, our learned and accurate Profeſſor, in his Lectures, that we ſhall take the liberty to inſert his own words.</p>

                           <p>By this operation is underſtood, an inciſion made firſt into the cavity of the abdomen, and then into the uterus, in order to extract a foetus. If the perſon on whom we are to perform it has been killed by an accident in the laſt month of pregnancy, or has died of a fever, we need not be very exact about the inciſion, but muſt make it as quickly as poſſible.</p>

                           <p>Next, we ought ſtrictly to examine the ſtate of the bones and of the ſoft parts, leſt we imagine that the bones prevent the delivery; when, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, the ſoft parts only may be in the fault. We may alſo preſume, that there is a ſufficient wide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the bones of the pelvis if the patient is not obſerved to have deformity in the other parts of the body, as a deformity rarely occurs in the pelvis without rickets or a curvature in the ſpine; though in a few caſes this may happen.

                           <p>We firſt empty the inteſtines, the rectum, and veſica urinaria, that the patient may not be diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed too ſoon after the operation, and that the ſize of the bladder may not interrupt it. We then lay the patient in a horizontal poſture, that the inteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines be not puſhed down between the abdominal integuments and uterus. In making the inciſion, we muſt avoid the large arteries in the containing parts.

preferred, and we there readily get into the uterus. By this means, indeed, the uterus muſt be divided towards its ſide, where the veſſels enter and are moſt conſiderable; but we chooſe the outſide of the rectus, becauſe of the veſica urinaria being in danger of contracting inflammation from the inciſion. Except the danger of wounding the ſmall turns of the inteſtines, there is no great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in performing the operation; yet ſeveral cautions are to be obſerved. Operators have not been aware of the cauſes of the danger; and we have more favourable accounts of the operation than we ought to have. We ſhall find in practice, that we ſhall be more frequently diſappointed than we would imagine from the reports of authors who have only mentioned the fortunate caſes. In this city the operation has been performed five times, and always without ſucceſs; tho' ſome of the women, before the operation, were in ordinary health. The great danger, I am perſuaded, ariſes from the admiſſion of the air, as well as from the parts divided; and I have repeatedly found, in making experiments upon animals, that if the air were let in upon the abdominal bowels for a few mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, without any farther injury, the animal often dies, and always recovers with the utmoſt difficulty: And this ſtill more readily happens if a conſiderable quantity of red blood be extravaſated
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:022551_0253_0FB943BBACDDCF30"/>
within the cavity, which produces a moſt violent inflammation. Therefore the ſurgeon is not to go at once into the cavity of the abdomen; but ſhould firſt divide the ſkin and muſcles, and leave the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritonaeum entire until the bleeding from the veſſels has entirely ceaſed: the danger in that way, I find is very much leſſened. We then open the perito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeum, making firſt a ſmall inciſion, and obſerve if the uterus is contiguous: if it is, we divide it with caution; and the aſſiſtant, by making a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate preſſure, hinders the air from getting into the general cavity of the abdomen. The diſcharge of blood from the uterus is ſmaller than we would expect. We then cut the membranes, ſeparate the placenta to extract the foetus, diſcharge the waters; and, as ſoon as the foetus and fecundines are removed, the uterus contracts of itſelf. Then let the ſurgeon paſs his hand into the cavity of the uterus, and with one or two fingers open the os uteri, that the blood, naturally diſcharging into the cavity of the uterus from the wound, may paſs readily out by the vagina. We then ſhut the wound; and, inſtead or leaving an opening for the diſcharge of matter, we truſt to abſorption; for I conſtantly find, that a very cloſe ſuture contributes to the cure; ſo I would ſew the containing parts of the abdomen with the glover's ſtitch, or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted ſutures at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <p>We have already ſaid, that, in the moſt natural poſition, the top of the head preſents; but the feet and breech often firſt appear, and the child is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in that manner.

in the early months, the foetus having once altered its poſition, may be prevented from recovering it by folds of the chord round its body and limbs; and, in advanced geſtation, if the breech ſhould get under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt inſtead of the head, the child will with difficulty be reſtored to its proper poſition, as the quantity of water is conſtantly decreaſing, and the chi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

A hand is often miſtaken for a foot; but the latter may be readily diſtinguiſhed from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer by the weight and reſiſtance it gives to the touch, by the ſhortneſs of the toes, and the length of the heel.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>When one or both feet preſent in the paſſage,</hi> little more ought to be done than if the labour were ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly natural, till the orifice of the womb be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently dilated, and the preſenting part advanced at or without the os externum. The woman muſt then be placed either on her ſide, with the breech o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the edge of the bed, and her head obliquely to the oppoſite ſide; or, on her back croſs the bed, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by an aſſiſtant in the bed to raiſe her head and ſhoulders, and an aſſiſtant at either ſide of the bed on a low ſeat, whoſe office is to ſecure the woman's feet, to ſeparate her knees, and prevent her from ſhifting. When any difficulty in extracting the head may be ſuſpected, or when the practitioner is not very dexterous in the art, the latter poſture is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable. It is alſo, in general, for young practiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners,
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:022551_0259_0FB943C4E6B393D8"/>
the beſt poſition, in all thoſe caſes where it is neceſſary to paſs the hand into the uterus, to make the delivery by turning the child.</p>
                     <p>When the parts are thus ſufficiently open, or the feet, by the force of repeated pains, at, or protruded without, the orifice of the vagina, the operator may then take hold, firſt of one leg, graſping it firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly above the ankle, and gently endeavouring to pull it down in the time of a pain, not in a ſtraight line, but from ſide to ſide, or from pubes to ſacrum; when the pain remits a warm cloth is to be applied to the os externum, and the return of the pain ſhould be waited for. The other leg is then to be taken hold of and pulled down in the ſame gradual gentle manner with the former: by pulling alternately firſt by one foot then by the other, there is leſs ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of injuring the uterus, than if an attempt were made to bring down both feet at once; and the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, being thus gradually ſtretched, will be better prepared for the delivery of the bulky ſhoulders and head.</p>
                     <p>When the feet are ſufficiently advanced for it, a warm cloth ſhould be wrapped round them; which will enable the operator to take a firmer hold, and defend the child from the hazard of injury by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction. But the cloth ſhould be ſo applied as to leave the toes expoſed; for they are the proper direction for turning body. If they already point to the ſacrum, the
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:022551_0260_0FB943C634179A10"/>
child is to be brought along in the ſame direction, till it ſtops from the reſiſtance of the ſhoulders. But if, inſtead of pointing backwards, the toes ſhould point to the ſide or belly, the child's body muſt be gradual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly turned, till the belly be applied to the back of the mother, and the back of the child to the mother's pubes.</p>
                     <p>The proper time to begin to turn, is a little before the breech advances to the os externum. The turn ſhould not be made all at once, but gradually; the child's body muſt be firmly graſped with both hands, puſhing a little upwards, then turning to one ſide in time of the pain, carefully obſerving and favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that line of direction which the child naturally inclines to take. The attempt muſt be repeated du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring every pain, till the child's body be turned round, and the face applied to the ſacrum of the mother. The motions of the child's head and body do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways exactly correſpond. Therefore, after the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the child preſſes againſt the perinaeum of the mother, a quarter-turn extraordinary is ſtill neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which muſt again be reverſed before the operator begins to extract. By that means the arm will be prevented from getting under the face, the broad ſhoulders will be applied to the wideſt diameter of the pelvis, the face will be turned towards the angle of the ſacrum, and readily follow in that direction.</p>
                     <p>When the breech is entirely protruded without
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:022551_0261_0FB943C954BF18A0"/>
the os externum, the child muſt be taken hold of by graſping firmly with the thumbs above the haun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and the fingers ſpread over the groins; the extraction muſt be gradually performed, moving from ſide to ſide, preſſing a litlte downwards to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the perinaeum, and waiting for natural pains, or reſting from time to time. As the belly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, the operator muſt ſlide up his hand, or two fingers, and very gently draw down a little the um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilical cord, leſt, being tenſe and overſtretched, the circulation might be interrupted, and the life of the child deſtroyed, which often happens where this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution is neglected.</p>
                     <p>After the breech is protruded, and the navel-ſtring begins to be compreſſed, from the os tincae graſping it like a ring, the delivery muſt be conducted with all the expedition that the mother's ſafety will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of. When the child is advanced as far as the breaſt, its farther progreſs is prevented by the arms going up by the ſides of the head. This obſtacle muſt be removed in this manner: The child's body ought to be ſupported by the left-hand of the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, which muſt be paſſed under the breaſt of the child, in ſuch a manner that the child, may reſt on the palm and arm of that hand; the child muſt then be drawn a little to one ſide, that two or more fingers of the right-hand may be paſſed at the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite ſide into the pelvis, over the back of the
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:022551_0262_0FB943CAAACB71C0"/>
ſhoulder, as far as the elbow, to bring down the arm obliquely along the breaſt, gently bending it at the fore-arm, in ſuch a manner as to favour the natural motions of the joint. Having then ſhifted hands, the other arm muſt be diſengaged, and brought down in the ſame manner.</p>
                     <p>Both arms of the child being relieved, the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man may be allowed to reſt a little till another pain or two follow; when, by bearing down in the time of the pain, the head will generally be forced down and delivered. But, if the woman be much exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, and the head does not quickly follow, the child will be loſt from the preſſure of the navel-ſtring.</p>
                     <p>The pulſation of the arteries in the chord ſhould regulate the time for extracting the head: while the pulſation is ſtrong, there is no hazard from delay; if the pulſation be weak or languid, more eſpecially if the chord begins to be cold and flaccid, the extrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt be quickly performed, otherwiſe the child will be deſtroyed.</p>
                     <p>The extraction of the head in preternatural labours, is often the moſt difficult and dangerous part of the delivery. The cauſe of reſiſtance, when it does not advance, is chiefly owing to its confinement between the ſacrum and pubes, when the bulky part of the head is detained at the brim, or at the lower part, by the chin catching on the ſacro-ſciatic liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The method of delivery is to introduce two
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:022551_0263_0FB943CC26E23940"/>
fingers of the right-hand (which hand and arm at the ſame time muſt ſupport the body of the child) into the mouth, and pull down the jaw towards the breaſt; then applying the other hand with the fingers ſpread, ſo as to preſs down the ſhoulders, the operator muſt riſe from his ſeat, and pull in a direction from pubes to ſacrum with conſiderable force, alternately raiſing and depreſſing the head till it begins to yield, ſo that, the chin being conſtantly preſſed to the breaſt, the face will deſcend from the hollow of the ſacrum: the delivery muſt then be finiſhed, by bringing the hind-head from under the pubes with a half-round turn.</p>
                     <p>During theſe efforts, an aſſiſtant muſt be directed to preſs on the perinaeum; and, whenever the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the caſe will admit of it, the exertions of the operator ſhould coincide with the natural throes of labour, by which the extraction will be greatly facilitated.</p>
                     <p>If the poſition be unfavourable, the face, if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſhould be turned towards the ſacrum, by puſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the head, or by preſſing on the chin; if the mouth cannot be reached, the preſſure ſhould be made any where on the lower-jaw; if the difficulty ariſes from the folds of the chord round the legs, thighs, body, or neck of the child, theſe muſt be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engaged in the eaſieſt manner poſſible. The contrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the orificium uteri round the child's neck
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:022551_0264_0FB943CEA28BCBB8"/>
rarely proves the cauſe of the reſiſtance, except when the feet are pulled down too early, or in premature labours, when it may be gently ſtretched with the fingers, and further endeavours ſhould be delayed for ſome time.</p>
                     <p>If the head does not yield after repeated efforts, in the manner directed, there is a neceſſity for reſting ſome time; as the head does not ſo ſoon collapſe, and mould itſelf to the paſſage, in preternatural as in natural preſentations. Whatever obſtacle prevents it from advancing, it will ſtill be prudent to reſt for a little; and, after a proper interval, renew our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions by thus alternately reſting, and attempting to extract, the head will yield, and the child may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, after a conſiderable exertion of force has been uſed.</p>
                     <p>If the cauſe of reſiſtance appears to be the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary bulk of the head from hydrocephalus, the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments may be burſted by the the force of pulling, by thruſting a finger through them, or by perforating the cranium with the long ſciſſars.</p>
                     <p>If by the violent exertions employed, there is ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of diſlocating the cervical vertebrae, and ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the body from the head, the operator muſt cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly deſiſt from pulling, and wait for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions of the uterus, employing his exertions du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of pains only.</p>
                     <p>If the head is of a monſtrous ſize, or the pelvis
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:022551_0265_0FB943D161344268"/>
very faulty, the former muſt be opened with the ſciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars at the baſis of the ſkull, and the extraction after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards performed with the crotchet.</p>
                     <p>The fingers of the operator introduced into the mouth, or preſſing on the upper or lower-jaw, will be ſufficient to accompliſh the extraction of the head where there is no great diſproportion between it and the pelvis; ſo that the forceps will ſeldom be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. In more difficult caſes, the crotchet muſt be uſed.</p>
                     <p>Caſe 2. <hi>When one foot only is protruded into the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gina,</hi> the other is ſometimes detained by catching on the pubes, and, if eaſily come at, ſhould be brought down, always obſerving to humour the natural mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the joint; but, if the leg ſhould be folded up along the child's body, or of difficult acceſs, the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt is not only troubleſome, but dangerous, as there is hazard of tearing the uterus. It is leſs ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, as the breech will be either naturally forced down by the aſſiſtance of pains, or by pulling at one leg only.</p>
                     <p>Caſe 3. <hi>When one or both knees preſent,</hi> the legs of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten cannot be brought down, till the breech be gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raiſed and puſhed a little back into the pelvis.</p>
                     <p>Caſe 4. <hi>If the feet ſhould offer along with the breech,</hi> it muſt be cautiouſly thruſt back, while the former are ſecured and brought down, till the poſition be

                     </p>
                     <p>Sometimes the poſition of the breech may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered before the membranes break; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards with more certainty, by the meconium of the child accompanying the waters; and by feeling the buttocks, thighs, or genitals of the child to the touch.</p>
                     <p>In whatever manner the breech preſents, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery ſhould be ſubmitted to nature, till the child be advanced ſo far, that the feet can be laid hold of and brought down. If the fore-parts of the child be already placed towards the ſacrum of the mother, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe is neceſſary but to ſupport the child till it advances ſo low, by the force of the natural pains, that the feet can be readily and ſafely brought down.</p>
                     <p>If the fore-parts of the child be placed anteriorly or laterally to the mother, when the child is ſo far advanced that it can be laid hold of and wrapped in a cloth, the mechanical turns muſt be made, and the delivery finiſhed, as directed in footling-caſes.</p>
                     <p>There is much leſs hazard, in general, in allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="277" facs="unknown:022551_0267_0FB943D6C6681F18"/>
the child to advance double, than in precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the extraction, by puſhing up to bring down the feet, before the parts have been ſufficiently dilated: a practice difficult and troubleſome to the operator; painful, and ſometimes dangerous to the mother; and by which the child is expoſed to the riſk of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation, from the retention of the head after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery of the body. If the child be ſmall, though doubled, it will eaſily paſs in that direction; if large, though the labour ſhould be painful, the natural throes are leſs violent and dangerous than the pain occaſioned, firſt, by introducing the hand with a view to turn; and, 2dly, by puſhing up the child in order to lay hold of the feet and bring them down. If the child advances naturally, it will be leſs expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſuffer; if it ſhould not advance, there is this advantage, that the parts of the mother will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly prepared, when the ſtrong pains are abated, for paſſing the hand into the pelvis, to raiſe up the breech, ſearch for the feet, bring down one or both, and deliver.</p>
                     <p>The propriety of this mode of treatment is ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the pains being often ſtronger in breech-caſes than in natural labour; but it cannot be followed when the mother is weak, and the pains are trifling; when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

is compreſſed between the thighs of the child, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the child and the pelvis, and cannot be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced above the preſenting part.</p>
                     <p>The prolapſus of the navel-ſtring generally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies that poſition of the breech, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>he child preſents with its fore-parts to the belly of the mother. Sometimes the chord can be reduced, and the child's life preſerved: but, if the breech be far advanced, and the pains ſtrong, it is not only difficult, but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous, to puſh up the child; who can ſeldom, in ſuch circumſtances, be preſerved. It is better, therefore, to let the child come as it will, if there are pains, rather than hazard the more important life of the mother by attempting to puſh up and turn it. But, in all doubtful and perplexing caſes, when there is time for it, the advice of a more ſkilful practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner ought to be taken.</p>
                     <p>When the breech is ſo far advanced, that a finger or two can be paſſed under the bended thigh, as far as the groin of the child, aſſiſtance may be given with advantage, by alternately pulling, firſt at one ſide, then at the other, in time of the pain. But great care ought to be taken not to miſtake the ſhoulder for the breech, and not to injure the child by violent pulling, or unequal preſſure. Such errors have often been commmitted, and the conſequences have been fatal.</p>
                     <p>In breech-caſes, the greateſt caution is neceſſary,
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:022551_0269_0FB943DA56C0C888"/>
when the genital parts preſent, leſt the child ſhould be injured by too frequent touching.</p>

                     <p>If a ſkilful practitioner hath the management of the labour from the beginning, the child may gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally be turned, in the worſt poſition, without much difficulty: but, when the waters have been for ſome time evacuated, and the uterus is ſtrongly contracted round the child's body, turning will be difficult and laborious to the operator; painful, and even dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, to the mother. For it ought to be conſidered, that the great difficulty and hazard of turning, are chiefly owing to the reſiſtance which the uterus gives; not ſo much to the poſition of the foetus. When the water, in whole, or in part, is retained, there is eaſy acceſs to reach the feet and bring them down; but, in proportion as the water is evacuated, the ute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine cavity becomes leſs ſpacious, and turning is
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:022551_0270_0FB943DB34481FF0"/>
rendered both troubleſome and dangerous. It was the old practice, in preternatural labours, to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make the head preſent; but, on account of its bulk, it could ſeldom be done, and the force em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in making the attempt was often attended with fatal conſequences. The method of delivering by the feet is the moſt important modern improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the practice of midwifery; an improvement to which many thouſands owe their lives.</p>
                     <p>When the child lies in a tranſverſe poſition, the management is very ſimple.

Though the beſt poſture for the operator, in general, as well as the patient, is the left ſide, with her breech placed over the edge of the bed, and her knees kept ſeparate with a folded pillow, it will be ſometimes neceſſary to turn her to her back; and in thoſe caſes where the child's feet are of difficult acceſs, or where they lie towards the fundus uteri, the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhould be placed on her knees and elbows.</p>

3. The orificium uteri ſhould be enlarged ſo much as to admit the hand to paſs freely; and the ſtrong pains ſhould be abated, before any attempt be made to deliver.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. It is of great conſequence to endeavour to learn the poſition of the child, and to attend to the ſhape and dimenſions of the pelvis, before attempting to make the delivery.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. In preternatural caſes, every poſſible means ought to be uſed to preſerve the membranes as long as poſſible. If they ſhould break before the hand is introduced, and the ſtate of the parts will admit of it, the hand ſhould be quickly after paſſed; part of the water being thus retained, the operation of turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will be greatly facilitated. But, if the waters be drained off, and the uterus rigidly contracted round the body of the child, warm oil ſhould be injected into the uterus, to leſſen the rigidity of the parts, and a full doſe of laudanum ſhould be exhibited, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to any attempt to procure delivery.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. The hand and arm of the operator muſt be lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricated with pomatum, before attempting to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it into the vagina; the fingers muſt be gathered together in a conical form, and the reſiſtance of the os externum be overcome by very ſlow and gradual degrees.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. In paſſing the hand into the uterus, it ought
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:022551_0272_0FB943DFB06BDBD8"/>
to be done in the gentleſt manner, but with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain degree of reſolution and courage. The paſſages ſhould be well lubricated with butter, or pomatum; the line of the vagina and pelvis carefully attended to; the movements of the operator muſt be ſlow and gradual; and thus, by giving time, the utmoſt rigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity in the ſoft parts may be overcome.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. The hand ought to be introduced only during the remiſſion of pain; when the pain comes, the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator ſhould ſtop, otherwiſe there is great hazard of puſhing the hand, or ſome part of the child through the ſubſtance of the uterus.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. The hand ſhould, if poſſible, be introduced by the fore parts of the child, as the feet are generally folded along the belly; and both feet, if eaſily come at, ſhould be laid hold of.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. In puſhing back any part of the body of the child to come at the feet, the palm of the hand, or broad expanded fingers, muſt be uſed. This part of the operation ſhould be performed always during the remiſſion of pain, which ſhould alſo be obſerved in bringing down the legs; but in making the extrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the body, when the legs are in the proper line of direction, the efforts of the artiſt ought always to co-operate with thoſe of nature.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. As the breech advances through the pelvis, the child, if not already in the proper poſition,
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:022551_0273_0FB943E146048AE8"/>
muſt be gradually turned with the fore-parts poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orly to the mother.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. Practitioners in midwifery ſhould be cautious of giving credit to any report of the child's death; for moſt of the ſymptoms are fallacious. Children are often born alive when there is little reaſon to expect it: Therefore, in puſhing up, bringing down the legs, or extracting the body, the child ſhould never be treated roughly, but handled with the greateſt delicacy.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. When the hand is within the pelvis, and there is a neceſſity for paſſing it pretty high in the uterus to ſearch for the child's feet, the proper direction is not preciſely in the line of the navel, as Dr SMEL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIE adviſes; but inclining it a little to one ſide, to avoid the prominent angle of the ſacrum, by which more room will be gained, and leſs pain given to the woman; for the womb preſſes ſtrongly there.</p>
                        <p n="14">14. When the hand is interrupted in paſſing, by the ſpaſmodic contraction of the uterus, we muſt deſiſt from further inſinuation, till the conſtriction of the uterus is ſomewhat abated.</p>

If the hand cannot paſs beyond the preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of the child to come at the feet, inſtead of thruſting back the preſenting part with violence, it ſhould be, as it were, firſt raiſed up in the pelvis, and then moved to the oppoſite ſide. By this means,
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:022551_0274_0FB943E305D9F490"/>

                        <p n="17">17. If the ſecond foot cannot readily be ſound or brought down, the child may be extracted with the utmoſt ſafety by one foot only, provided we proceed ſlowly in the operation.</p>

                        <p>The cauſes chiefly are, 1<hi>ſt,</hi> The putrid ſtate of the child's body in conſequence of its death; 2<hi>dly,</hi> The neglect of the operator to make the proper turns when extracting the body; 3<hi>dly,</hi> The narrowneſs of the pelvis, or bulk of the child's head.</p>
                        <p>To prevent it when the child's body is putrid; the operator ſhould never attempt to extract the head till two fingers be introduced into the mouth; and by pulling down the jaw, and preſſing on the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, while an aſſiſtant preſſes gently on the woman's belly, and the woman herſelf bears down in the time of a pain, the extraction may generally, unleſs when the pelvis is narrow, be effected.</p>

If the head ſhould be actually ſeparated and left behind in the womb, and cannot be extracted by introducing two fingers into the mouth and wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the aſſiſtance of pains, and the forceps ſhould fail, the crotchet muſt be uſed. The me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod is to keep the head ſteady by the preſſure of an aſſiſtant on the woman's belly, the head is opened with the ſciſſars, and extracted with the crotchet according to the rules already given.</p>
                        <p>By attending carefully to the above rules, lacera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the uterus, floodings, convulſions, inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,

and their conſequences, may be prevented, and the child's life often preſerved, even when it preſents in the moſt awkward poſition.</p>
                        <p>We proceed to conſider a few particular caſes</p>
                        <p>Caſe 1. <hi>The Arm preſenting.</hi>—This poſition occurs frequently. It is of ſome conſequence to form a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral notion how the child lies, before the operator ſits down to deliver. The right-hand, by a little at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, may be readily diſtinguiſhed from the left, if we lay hold of the child's hand, in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as in ſhaking hands.</p>
                        <p>It is often in the power of a ſkilful practitioner to prevent the hand from coming down, or to reduce it when it protrudes. But, if the arm be forced into the paſſage ſo low that the ſhoulder is locked in the pelvis, it is needleſs to give the woman the pain of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting the reduction, unleſs when the head can be made to preſent, as the hand of the operator can be paſſed into the uterus by the ſide of the child's arm, which will of courſe return into the uterus, when the feet are brought down into the vagina. As the head, in this caſe, cannot eaſily be made to preſent; in order, therefore, to make the delivery by turning the child, the hand and arm of the operator, well lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricated, muſt be conducted into the uterus by the ſide of the child's arm, along the breaſt and belly of the child, towards the oppoſite ſide of the pelvis, where the head lies. If any difficulty occurs in coming at
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:022551_0277_0FB943E72197E250"/>
the feet, the hand already introduced muſt be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn, and the other paſſed in its ſtead. If ſtill the hand cannot eaſily be puſhed beyond the child's ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and head, the preſenting part muſt be gently rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up, or cautiouſly ſhifted to a ſide, that one or both feet may be taken hold of, which muſt be brought as low as poſſible, puſhing up the head and ſhoulders, and pulling down the feet, alternately, till they advance into the vagina, or ſo low that a nooſe or fillet can be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied; and thus, by pulling with the one hand by means of the nooſe and puſhing with the other, the feet can be brought down, and the delivery finiſhed in the moſt complicated and difficult caſes.</p>
                        <p>The method of forming the nooſe is, by paſſing the two ends of a piece of tape or garter through the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle when doubled; or, if the garter be thick and clum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, by making an eye on one end, and paſſing the other extremity through it. This muſt be mounted on the points of the fingers and thumb of the hand of the operator, who muſt take hold of the child's foot, ſlip it over the foot and ankle, and ſecure it by pulling at the other extremity.</p>
                        <p>Caſe 2. <hi>The Shoulder.</hi>—Great care ought to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken that it may not be miſtaken for the buttock. The ſhoulder will feel harder and more bony than the full thick fleſhy hip; a mark which may be taken along with the others formerly mentioned in Breech-ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="288" facs="unknown:022551_0278_0FB943E8A2C4D160"/>
Tho' the child ſhould originally preſent with the ſhoulder, when the oriſicium uteri is dilated, the arm if not prevented, may readily be forced by the repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed efforts of the labour-throes into the paſſage. In proportion as the preſenting part advances, and the ſhoulder becomes lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ked in the pelvis, delivery by turning will be more difficult and hazardous.</p>
                        <p>Except the child be of a very ſmall ſize, and the hand preſſed cloſe to the ſide of the head, it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for the head and arm to paſs together; it is, therefore, cruel and barbarous to pull the arm in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to deliver the child in that way. The arm has been often torn from the body, and the mother has died in the attempt.</p>
                        <p>Caſe 3. <hi>The Side.</hi>—This is diſcovered by feeling the ribs.</p>
                        <p>Caſe 4. <hi>The Back.</hi>—This is diſcerned by feeling ſome part of the ſpine or back bone.</p>
                        <p>Caſe 5. <hi>The Belly.</hi>—It is known by the ſoft yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubſtance of the part, and by the falling down of ſome portion of the umbilical chord.</p>
                        <p>THESE three preſentations, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the <hi>ſide, back,</hi> and <hi>belly,</hi> more rarely occur, as the uterus will with dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty admit of ſuch poſitions.</p>
                        <p>When any of theſe parts do preſent, they ſeldom advance much beyond the brim of the pelvis, and the child is in general as eaſily turned as in other preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations which more frequently occur.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="289" facs="unknown:022551_0279_0FB943EAAFB12310"/>
The belly, from the difficulty with which the legs can be bended backwards, unleſs the child be flaccid, putrid, or before the time, will very ſeldom directly preſent; if it does, it will be early and eaſily diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the prolapſus of the chord, and there will be no difficulty to come at the feet, and deliver.</p>
                        <p>The rule in all theſe caſes is, to inſinuate the hand into the uterus, in the gentleſt manner poſſible, when the ſtate of the parts will admit of it, to ſearch for the feet, bring them down, and deliver, agreeably to the directions already given for that purpoſe.</p>

                     <p>When the arm protrudes in this manner, it ought, if poſſible, to be reduced, and the head brought down into the pelvis; for it is often equally difficult and dangerous to deliver by the feet, and ſometimes ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly impracticable.</p>

A ſkilful practitioner, having the management of the delivery from the beginning, will often be able to prevent the protruſion of the arm, which ought to be attempted as ſoon as poſſible after the rupture of the membranes. If he fails, and the arm ſhould be forced down, the earlieſt opportunity ſhould be taken to reduce it. If ſucceſsful, it will prevent much future trouble; it will be a happy circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance for the mother, and may be the means of preſerving both her life and that of the child. With this view, when the poſition of the woman is adjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the hand of the operator, well lubricated, muſt be inſinuated thro' the vagina into the uterus, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by the child's arm, till it reaches as far as the axilla or ſhoulder. The ſhoulder muſt then be raiſed up, and ſhifted, as it were, obliquely, to the ſide of the pelvis, oppoſite to that to which it inclines. By this means the poſition of the child will be ſome-what altered, and the arm drawn up within the vagina, ſo that it will be afterwards no difficult taſk to reduce it completely. But, ſhould this method fail, an attempt may be made to puſh up the fore-arm at the elbow; and, in bending it, great care muſt be taken to avoid over-ſtraining, or diſlocating the joint. Theſe attempts muſt only be made in the intervals of pain: when the pain recurs, the operator ought immediately to deſiſt; for, by puſhing in time of the pain, or in an improper di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:022551_0281_0FB943EE629F72F8"/>
the uterus may be torn, and the moſt fatal conſequences ſoon enſue.</p>
                     <p>In whatever manner the reduction of the child's arm ſhall be accompliſhed, if any method proves ſucceſsful, it muſt be retained in the uterus by the hand of the operator, till the child's head, by the force of the next pain, fills up the pelvis, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents its return; otherwiſe the arm will be protruded as often as it is reduced.</p>
                     <p>But, if the orificium uteri be not ſufficiently open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to admit of the reduction of the protruding arm with ſafety; if, as the arm advances, the head reclines to one ſide of the pelvis, the throes of labour are violent, and the intervals ſhort; it would then be as dangerous to the patient as difficult to the operator, to attempt delivery by manual exertions; for the ſpaſmodic contractions of the uterus coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teract every artificial effort; and if much mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal force be uſed, the uterus is in hazard of actual la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceration. In theſe circumſtances, regardleſs of the anxiety of the patient, or the importunities of the attendants, the operator ſhould deſiſt for ſome time from further efforts; a large doſe of liquid laudanum ſhould be given, as from 50 to 70 gutts; and when the parts are ſufficiently dilated, and the ſtrong for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing pains abated, his attempts ſhould then be renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, either to reduce the arm, or inſinuate his hand beyond it to come at the feet, bring them down,
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:022551_0282_0FB943F22C4ABAD8"/>
and deliver. If theſe attempts ſhould fail, he may endeavour to alter the poſition of the child, by fixing a nooſe on the arm, and pulling by it. More eaſy acceſs may be then obtained to the anterior parts of the child, by which the hand can be conducted to the feet. But, if every method ſhould prove ineffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual either to reduce the arm or bring down a foot, and the woman's life is in danger, the head of the child, if it can be reached, muſt be opened; after a proper interval, a crotchet introduced; and the extraction made by pulling at it and the protruded arm.</p>
                     <p>Should the head be without reach of the ſciſſars, the crotchet muſt be fixed on the trunk or thorax, with a view to bring down the breech or feet; by ſecuring a firm hold of the arm, and pulling by the cortchet, the delivery muſt, in that manner, be accompliſhed; a mode of practice which ſhould only be had recourſe to when the pelvis is faulty, or the patient's life in immediate danger.</p>
                     <p>IN the longitudinal contraction of the the uterus, when an arm preſents, and the ſhoulder is advanced in the paſſage, ſo that the feet cannot eaſily be come at, Dr DENMAN adviſes <q>to pull the body lower down by the arm, and the difficulty will be leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened or removed.</q> 
                        <q>There is, happily (he adds), no neceſſity of turning the child in theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; for it will be born by the effect of the
<pb n="293" facs="unknown:022551_0283_0FB943F552998920"/>
powers of nature only. In ſuch caſes the child does not come double, but the <hi>breech</hi> is the firſt part delivered, and the <hi>head</hi> the laſt, the body turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon its own axis.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>He adopts this opinion from four caſes which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred in his own practice, and ſeveral ſimilar hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories related by others; in all which, however, the child was dead.</p>
                     <p>He therefore infers, <q>That, in caſes in which children preſent with the arm, women would not neceſſarily die undelivered, tho' they were not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted by art.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>He concludes his obſervations with this important remark.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>The benefit we are to derive in practice from the knowledge of this fact is, that the cuſtom of turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and delivering by the feet, in preſentations of the arm, will remain neceſſary and proper in all caſes in which the operation can be performed with ſafety to the mother, and give a chance of preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the life of the child; but, when the child is dead, and when we have no other view, but merely to extract the child, to remove the danger thence ariſing to the mother, it is of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to know, that <hi>the child may be turned ſponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neouſly by the action of the uterus</hi>

Dr DENMAN's remark is new to me. In a caſe where the powers of nature have been uſually conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as deſperate, it is new, perhaps, only becauſe the practitioner has thought it uſeleſs to wait for them. But though curious, as it ſhows what nature in her ſtruggles can perform; and though ſurpriſing, as it apparently contradicts the laws of motion; it ſeems to me unneceſſary, as in the numerous arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations which I have attended, the child has for the moſt part been preſerved, and the woman has ſeldom ſuffered any material injury from the delivery. I have therefore continued to practiſe the method which I have juſt recommended; and, in the moſt intricate preſentations, have generally ſucceeded in making the delivery by fixing a fillet on the arm, and altering the poſition in the manner mentioned, when every other method had failed. I have never yet known a caſe to occur where the pelvis was tolerably proportioned, in which I could not either obtain acceſs to the feet to deliver by turning, or reduce the arm and bring down the head; and have, in ſeveral caſes, ſucceſsfully turned where the pelvis was conſiderably diſtorted<note n="*" place="bottom">
                           <p>In preſence of the Gentlemen who attended my Lectures laſt ſummer, I delivered a woman in the public lying-in ward, Royal Infirmary; the circumſtances of the caſe were as follows.</p>
                           <p>The arm of the child preſented, and had been in the paſſage, with the waters drained, from the preceding evening. The pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis was conſiderably diſtorted, and the crotchet had been uſed in her former deliveries. The woman is of an under-ſize, of a feeble conſtitution, and the paſſages were ſo tight as to cramp the hand when introduced into the pelvis. By gradual ſtretching, and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle inſinuation, I with ſome difficulty reached a foot, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed the delivery without the aſſiſtance of any inſtrument.</p>

It may be neceſſary, however, to ſtate the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of this operation, that we may be aware how far to truſt the unaſſiſted efforts of the conſtitution.</p>
                     <p>The longitudinal contraction of the uterus, is one of thoſe blind and indiſcriminate attempts which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſometimes makes to free herſelf from a burden. When her powers are exhauſted, theſe efforts are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed, and the uterus is relaxed. In theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, then, if we can fix the arm, the body will of itſelf turn as on an axis; and the <hi>heavier</hi> part, or the breech, will come downward and be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered: The arm is <hi>fixed</hi> by drawing down the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; but it will be obvious, that the natural falling down of the breech will immediately draw it back again<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

may ſeem to be preferable; but various cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances diminiſh its advantages. Dr DENMAN has very properly limited it to the delivery of a dead child, and we may add a well-proportioned pelvis: but, even there, we exhauſt the powers of nature, without an adequate advantage; eſpecially if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect, that, in this exhauſted ſtate, an inconſiderable increaſe of the uſual diſcharges may prove fatal.</p>
                     <p>Theſe facts may, however, teach us, not to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temp the extraction by turning too early; for by a little delay till the ſtrong pains are abated, it will be more practicable, and my ſucceſs has fully confirmed its ſafety.</p>

                     <p>WHEN the membranes remain entire till the ſoft parts of the mother are ſo much dilated, that the hand of the operator can readily find admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; or when the hand can be paſſed within the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terine cavity, immediately after the membranes break, ſo that great part of the water may be retained; the delivery may be accompliſhed, in the moſt unfavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able caſes, with eaſe and ſafety. But, when the waters have been long evacuated, and the uterus is rigidly contracted round the body of the child, the caſe will prove laborious to the operator, painful to the mother, and dangerous to her and the child.</p>
                     <p>When there is reaſon to ſuſpect a croſs-birth, which can often be known, either by feeling the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting part through the membranes or by ſome of the ſigns already mentioned, the woman ſhould be managed in ſuch a manner that the membranes may be preſerved as long as poſſible; for this purpoſe ſhe ſhould be kept quiet in bed, and placed in that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture leaſt favourable for ſtraining, or the exertion of force, in the time of a pain. She ſhould be touched
<pb n="298" facs="unknown:022551_0288_0FB943FCE3407D88"/>
as ſeldom as poſſible, till the orificium uteri be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently dilated. She ſhould then be placed in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per poſition for delivery, that the hand of the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor may be gently inſinuated in a conical form, with the fingers gathered together, through the vagina in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the uterus. The hand muſt be paſſed on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the membranes between and the uterus, in a direction towards the fundus. The membranes may then be broken, by pinching them between a finger and thumb, or by forcibly thruſting a finger againſt them in time of a pain. The hand muſt now be directed where the feet may reaſonably be expected to lie; one or both of which muſt be taken hold of, and brought down. If the membranes ſhould be rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured in the attempt, the hand muſt be paſſed up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the uterus as expeditiouſly as it can be done with ſafety. Part of the waters being thus retained by the introduced arm, the operation of turning will be greatly facilitated.</p>
                     <p>If the membranes ſhould be ruptured before the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rificium uteri be ſufficiently opened to allow the hand to paſs, even in theſe circumſtances, it is neceſſary that the woman be kept quiet in bed, and the ſame precautions ſhould be uſed as if the membranes were entire; for the retention of a ſmall quantity of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is of great conſequence in turning.</p>

                        <p>FLOODINGS, as already explained, proceed from a ſeparation of ſome portion of the placenta, or ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy chorion, from the internal ſurface of the uterus. But the moſt dangerous haemorrhagies ariſe from a ſeparation of the cake when attached to the cervix, or over the orificium uteri<note n="*" place="bottom">See the article <hi>Flooding</hi> in Pathology of Parturition.</note>.</p>
                        <p>Floodings, before the 7th month of geſtation, may be often checked by the management formerly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected; after which period, however, there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways conſiderable danger. And, as it is ſometimes neceſſary to deliver, even when no part of the placen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta can be reached with the finger, the conſtant atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the practitioner is requiſite, and the utmoſt judgment to catch the proper time of proceeding.</p>
                        <p>There is hazard in attempting delivery too ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, while the os uteri is cloſe and rigid. When the woman, from loſs of blood, is ſomewhat ſunk, the uterine orifice is more relaxed and dilatable. The time can only be determined by conſtantly ſtaying with the patient, and examining the ſtate of the os uteri occaſionally. In ſo critical a ſituation, the
<pb n="300" facs="unknown:022551_0290_0FB94401320E02B8"/>
neglect of half an hour, or leſs, may be fatal to the mother and child.</p>
                        <p>The beſt practice in this caſe is, firſt, to wait on; giving opiates at proper intervals, and keeping the woman quiet and cool. If poſſible, delivery ſhould never be attempted till pains occur, and the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes begin to protrude. Pains may be brought on, or increaſed, by gently irritating the os tincae. The membranes may then be broken by puſhing a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

We can now ſafely wait for ſix, twelve, or twenty-four hours, if neceſſary, till the pains recur, and then deliver according to the preſentation. But, if the flooding ſhould not then abate, or if the poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the foetus be unfavourable, the hand muſt be paſſed into the uterus, the feet of the child taken hold of and brought down. The uterus now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting, ſoon ſtops the flow of blood, or prevents an exceſſive diſcharge: therefore, after the feet are brought down, the body of the child ſhould be extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by very ſlow and gradual efforts; leſt, from too ſudden evacuation of the uterine contents, fatal faintings or convulſions might enſue.</p>
                        <p>Flooding, from the <hi>attachment of the placenta at the orificium uteri,</hi> will be ſufficiently indicated by its alarming appearance and rapid increaſe, and by the ſoft pappy feel of the cake to the touch; though,
<pb n="301" facs="unknown:022551_0291_0FB944030C1A7AF0"/>
when there is little dilatation of the os tincae, it will be neceſſary to introduce the whole hand into the vagina, in order, more certainly, to be able to feel the placenta with a finger introduced within the os internum.</p>
                        <p>In theſe unhappy caſes, there is no method of ſaving the woman, but by immediate delivery.</p>
                        <p>We are ſometimes obliged to paſs the hand at an opening made through the body of the placenta; but, if poſſible, the hand ſhould rather be inſinuated at the ſide of the cake, where the leaſt portion is attached, to go into the uterus, break the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes, ſearch for the child's feet, bring them down, and deliver.</p>
                        <p>In ſome inſtances, before the orificium uteri can be ſufficiently opened to admit the hand of the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator to paſs, the whole cake will actually be diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged and protruded; but the ſeparation and expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the placenta, previous to the birth of the child, is, for the moſt part, fatal to the mother.</p>
                        <p>Much of our ſucceſs, in theſe alarming caſes of flooding<note n="*" place="bottom">See Mr RIGBY's valuable Treatiſe on this Subject already referred to—See alſo Dr LEAK's obſervations on the nature and Treatment of Uterine Haemorrhagies before and after delivery.

to time: for, after ſhe is ſunk to a certain degree, the muſcular fibres of that organ loſe their contractile power, the flow of blood increaſes, and, if neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhe ſoon dies; ſo that the preſence of the operator can only ſave her.</p>
                        <p>In caſes ſo ſtrictly critical and hazardous, two practitioners ſhould therefore be called, for <hi>one</hi> ought to be in conſtant waiting.</p>

                           <hi>Prolapſed Funis</hi>—A preſſure on the umbilical cord, perhaps for ten minutes, by interrupting the circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, will be ſufficient to deſtroy the life of the child. A cooldneſs and want of pulſation in the cord, is the moſt infallible ſign of the child's death; therefore, if any portion of the former be protruded before any bulky part of the child, there is hazard of the loſs of the child, unleſs the labour be ſoon over. The danger can only be prevented by re-placing the cord, and retaining it above the preſenting part of the child, till it be ſo far protruded by the force of the pain, as to prevent the return of the cord; or, the child muſt be turned and delivered by the feet, (for the forceps cannot be uſed till the head be well advanced in the pelvis.) But it is often difficult to reduce the cord, and much more ſo to turn the child. For, if the pains be ſtrong and frequent, the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of ſuch attempts may be fatal to the mother.</p>
                        <p>If the child be of an ordinary, or ſmall ſize, and the pelvis be well formed; if the labour goes on quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="303" facs="unknown:022551_0293_0FB9440A668C7820"/>
and eſpecially if the woman had formerly good deliveries; the child may yet be born alive. If, on the contrary, the child exceeds the ordinary ſize, or the pelvis comes ſhort of its uſual dimenſions, turning would prove a dangerous operation to the mother, and there is little proſpect of ſaving the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant by it.</p>
                        <p>The beſt practice, therefore, is to take the earlieſt opportunity that the circumſtances of the caſe will admit of, to reduce the cord, by placing the woman in a proper poſition, ſo that the hand of the operator may be carried up, in the abſence of pain, into the pelvis, and the cord entirely reduced. If this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod ſails,—and it cannot be practiſed when the pains are ſtrong and frequent, or the head wedged in the pelvis, no farther attempts ſhould be made; and the child ſhould be allowed to be propelled by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural pains, or protruded ſo low that the forceps can be uſed.</p>

Caſes of twins often occur, of triplets ſeldom, of four children very rarely<note n="*" place="bottom">Three years ago I attended a woman in the Graſs Market, who brought forth <hi>four children</hi> at a birth between the 6th and 7th months. Three were born alive, and one was dead. This is the only inſtance of the kind ever known to have occurred in Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh.</note>; and there are few inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of five foetuſes at one birth, notwithſtanding the fabulous hiſtories which have been related by cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous authors.</p>
                     <p>It is very difficult to judge of the exiſtence of twins or triplets, from appearances previous to delivery; for all the ſigns enumerated are fallacious.</p>
                     <p>When there is reaſon to ſuſpect that there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther child, after the delivery of the firſt, it ought to be aſcertained by paſſing a finger within the os uteri; or, if that is inſufficient, by the introduction of the hand.</p>
                     <p>The ſymptoms chiefly to be truſted, after the birth of one child, are,
<list>
                           <item>1<hi>ſt,</hi> The diminutive ſize of the child, and the waters being diſproportioned to the diſtention of the gravid uterus.</item>
                           <item>2<hi>dly,</hi> The umbilical chord, after it is divided, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing to bleed beyond the uſual time.</item>
                           <item>3<hi>dly,</hi> The recurrence of regular labour-pains.</item>
                           <item>4<hi>thly,</hi> The retention of the placenta.</item>
                           <item>5<hi>thly,</hi> The abdominal tumor not ſenſibly dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed between the ſtomach and umbilicus.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="305" facs="unknown:022551_0295_0FB9440E20E0BF80"/>
All theſe ſymptoms are ſeldom united; and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of them are, by themſelves, fallacious: for the placentae of twins are often diſtant from each other in the uterus, and ſo looſely connected to it, that one may entirely ſeparate before the ſecond child be born; ſo that labour-pains will ſometimes ceaſe for two or three days, and there is the ſame interval between the births of the children.</p>
                     <p>It is neceſſary, therefore, to attend to the uſual diminution of the belly; and, in doubtful caſes, to introduce the hand into the uterus.</p>
                     <p>The poſition of twins or triplets is commonly that which is moſt commodiouſly adapted to the uterus, and which will occupy the leaſt room. One child often preſents naturally; the other, or others, by the feet or breech; ſometimes both, or all, preſent na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally: at other times, the poſition is croſs: ſo that the delivery muſt be regulated by the preſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>With regard to the management, oppoſite ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have been entertained.</p>
                     <p>In ſome inſtances, natural pains, after the delivery of the firſt child, ſoon come on. The membranes will then be quickly forced down, and the preſenting part of the child may be readily felt through them; but, if the preſentation of the child ſhould be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the touch, the practitioner ought immediately
<pb n="306" facs="unknown:022551_0296_0FB9441043FC2FF8"/>
to place the woman in a proper poſition, and gently inſinuate his hand, by the ſide of the membranes, into the uterus, and examine how the child lies. If the head or breech preſent, it is only neceſſary to break the membranes, withdraw the hand, and leave the child to be expelled by the natural pains. If the feet are felt through the membranes, let them be broken, the feet taken hold of, and brought into the paſſage. The delivery muſt be otherwiſe managed as directed in footling-caſes, carefully obſerving not to neglect the proper turns in extracting the body.</p>
                     <p>If any other part than the head, breech, or feet ſhould preſent, the latter muſt be ſearched for through the membranes, and brought down into the paſſage. The feet may, by a dexterous operator, in moſt caſes, be brought down without breaking the membranes; but, if they ſhould be ruptured in the attempt, the feet muſt then immediately be taken hold of, gently brought down, and the delivery finiſhed as formerly directed.</p>
                     <p>When the uterus is very much diſtended, it, in ſome degree, loſes its power of contraction. From this cauſe the pains are often leſs ſtrong and forcing, and the labour is more tedious, in twins and triplets, than when there is but one child; hence a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable length of time, as ſeveral days, in ſome inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, intervenes between the birth of the different children. In this interval, the woman is apt to ſuffer
<pb n="307" facs="unknown:022551_0297_0FB94411245BC510"/>
from impatience and anxiety. Floodings frequently come on; and the labour is more painful and hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous, in proportion as the time of delivery is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted. It may therefore be recommended to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners as a general rule, If labour-pains do not naturally recur ſoon after the birth of the firſt child, to place the woman in a proper poſition, gently paſs the hand into the uterus, break the membranes, and manage the delivery according to the preſentation.</p>
                     <p>As this ſubject has given riſe to a variety of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons among authors, we ſhall add, for the inſtruction of young practitioners, a few rules, which include the whole directions neceſſary for the management.</p>

practitioner for a ſecond ſet of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes: but the diſtinction may readily be made by moving the finger round and round the protruding bag; or, if it be ſtill doubtful, the hand muſt be paſſed into the uterus.</p>
                        <p>When it is aſcertained that there is any other child the accoucheur ſhould ſtay with his patient, as if wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for the ſeparation of the placenta, and carefully obſerve leſt a flooding ſhould occur.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. A gentle compreſſion ought to be made on the abdomen, which muſt be gradually tightened as the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terine tumor ſubſides.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. If pains ſoon come on, and the child preſents in a poſition in which it can advance without manual aſſiſtance, let it be expelled by the natural pains. If it comes double, or by the feet, when the breech is advanced as far as the os externum, let the proper turns be carefully attended to.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. If labour-pains do not occur within the ſpace of a few hours after the delivery of the firſt child, it will then be adviſable to place the woman in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient poſition for delivery, to paſs the hand into the uterus, break the membranes, and otherwiſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage the delivery as already directed. For if pains do not ſoon come on the woman may go on undelivered for ſeveral days, unleſs the membranes be broken. When the waters are evacuated, the uterus contracts and the child quickly advances.</p>

If the pains be trifling, and have little effect in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truding the child, the ſame management will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. If, from the very ſmall ſize of the firſt and ſecond child, there may be reaſon to ſuſpect that any other yet remains; after having waited about half an hour for the ſeparation of the placenta, without effect, let the hand be again paſſed into the uterus, and if a third ſet of membranes be diſcovered, let them be broken, and the delivery managed as already directed. If there be no other child, let the placentae be diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged and extracted. But if they adhere firmly, it is better to keep the hand in the uterus, till by its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction they are gradually ſeparated and diſengaged rather than to attempt it by force.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. The placentae of twins and triplets are often connected, and adhere at the edges, though each child has its diſtinct membranes and water.</p>

flooding, which might end fatally before the uterus could be emptied of its contents.</p>

            <head>APPENDIX.</head>
            <p>THE greateſt part of the preceeding work, in the former Edition, having been printed before Dr Oſburne's Treatiſe came into my hands, I then took the earlieſt opportunity to acknowledge the polite and reſpectful manner with which that gentleman ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed his ſentiments on ſome ſubjects in which we ſeem to have differed in opinion.</p>
            <p>The firſt attempt of an author, in the infancy of practice and touching, muſt be rude and imperfect: frequent reflection from reading and experience, ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble him to detect the errors of others, and to guide his own ſteps with caution and ſafety. The Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Midwifery were originally intended as a very ſhort ſyllabus for the uſe of the Author's ſtudents only. It was begun and carried on in a hurry, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been actually written and publiſhed in little more than two months. The ſupplement, deſigned to ſupply the omiſſions in the text, ſhows that the Author was ſenſible of the deficiency of the former part.</p>
            <p>As our opinions, at preſent, more nearly coincide, it is unneceſſary to trouble Dr Oſburne or the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic
<pb n="313" facs="unknown:022551_0303_0FB9459DD5D39DB0"/>
with any pompous, laboured reply: I ſhall, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, confine myſelf to a few obſervations on thoſe remarks in his publication, in which I myſelf, only, am concerned.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Dr Oſburne (page 69,) condemns the practice of fixing the crotched <hi>ſomewhere on the outſide of the ſkull.</hi> This, however, was the practice, even in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, when I atteded an eminent teacher not a great many years ago. It was the practice of Dr Smellie; and more lately of Dr Young; late profeſſor in this univerſity, an operator as ſkilful and ſucceſsful as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the former. The conſtruction of that inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, plainly ſhows, that it was originally <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to be fixed <hi>on the outſide of the ſkull chiefly.</hi> The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cavity of the blade is exactly adapted to the convex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of the child's head. But I have 'already obſerved, in this volume, that the crotchet ſhould be fixed in the <hi>baſis of the ſkull;</hi> though there are ſome caſes in which it may ſtill be proper ſometimes to fix it on the outſide. An experienced operator can, however, decide on this point, after he has maturely conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the circumſtances both of the preſentation and pelvis.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The calculation of the ſucceſsful caſes, in which the Cea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>arean operation was performed, were taken from old authors, excluſive of unfortunate ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in Britain; and the author candidly acknowledges the miſtake into which they had led him. He
<pb n="314" facs="unknown:022551_0304_0FB9459EAC2A88A8"/>
cannot avoid, however, expreſſing his ſurpriſe, that Dr Oſburne ſhould have ſo far miſunderſtood his meaning, as to inſinuate, that he would ever recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the operation to be performed on the living ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, except in thoſe rare caſes where it appeared ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely impoſſible to extract a child through the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perture of the pelvis<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>"When the hand of the operator cannot be introduced within the pelvis; or, in other words, when its largeſt diameter does not exceed one inch, or one inch and a half: this conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is perhaps the only one which renders the Caeſarean operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on abſolutely neceſſary. Happily, however, ſuch a ſtructure ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſeldom occurs in practice; and, when it does, the Accouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur will readily diſcover it by attending to the following circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and to the common marks of a narrow pelvis. Where the capacity of the pelvis is ſo ſtrait as not to admit any part of the child's head to enter, nor of two fingers of the Accouchcur's hand to conduct proper inſtruments to tear, break down, and extract the child piece-meal, in this caſe recourſe muſt he had to the Caeſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rean ſection; an expedient, though dreadful and hazardous, that will give the woman and child the only chance of life; and which, if timely and prudently conducted, notwithſtanding the many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances wherein it has failed, may be performed with great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of ſucceſs." Elements of Midwifery, p. 241.</p>
                  <p>And, leſt he had not formerly been ſufficiently explicit, the following caution is ſubjoined in the Supplement.</p>
                  <p>"The abſolute impracticability of extracting a child through the aperture of the pelvis, is perhaps the only circumſtance that juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the performance of the Caeſarean operation on the living ſubject; which ought never to be had recourſe to in caſes of diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, or original mal-conformation of the ſoft parts of generation, when there is no ſuſpicion of deformity of the bones." Elements of Midwifery, p. 292.</p>
               </note>: And to a deficiency of ſpace
<pb n="315" facs="unknown:022551_0305_0FB945A0225BCE90"/>
in the <hi>bony cavity alone,</hi> he expreſsly confines it; <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <q>where the tranſverſe diameter, at the brim, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures from one to, not exceeding, two inches.</q>
            </p>
            <p>His motives for mentioning the caſes in which the operation had been performed, were to ſhow from authentic records, that however formidable and hazardous, it is certainly practicable; and to regret the imperfection of an art which obliges us, <hi>ſometimes,</hi> to have recourſe to the dreadful alternative of witneſſing the unſucceſsful efforts of Nature in her laſt feeble ſtruggles; or by a deſperate effort of the limited powers of ſurgery, offer our aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>Dr Oſburne aſſerts, <q>that a child can be extracted by embryulcia, through a pelvis whoſe aperture from pubes to ſacrum meaſures only one inch and a half; dimenſions much leſs than what have invariably been ſuppoſed to require the Caeſarean operation, even in the lateſt and beſt books<note n="*" place="bottom">See Dr OS<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>URNE's Treatiſe on Laborious Parturition, p. 251.</note>.</q> And by this means he hopes to diminiſh, if not ſupercede, the neceſſity of the Caeſarean ſection, by ſubſtituting the crotchet in its ſtead. He goes further, and endeavours to prove, (p. 251 and 252.)
<pb n="316" facs="unknown:022551_0306_0FB945A1C3AF5430"/>
               <q>that the head of a mature foetus may be ſafely extracted with the crotchet, its volume having been previouſly leſſened, wherever there is a ſpace equal to one inch and a half from pubes to ſacrum:</q> And aſſerts, <q>that, in theſe circumſtances, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very may be <hi>always</hi> effected with ſafety to the mother.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The world is infinitely obliged to this author for the uncommon pains he hath taken to ſhow <q>what are the ſmalleſt poſſible dimenſions of the pelvis through which a child, with its head opened, can be extracted, with ſafety to the mother, by means of the crotchet.</q> I hope, and earneſtly wiſh, for the honour of the profeſſion, and the credit of Dr Oſburne, that his data may be well-grounded, and that the reſult may prove adequate to his expectations.</p>
            <p>But, though the dimenſions of the pelvis may be capable of menſuration with mathematical pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, yet the difference in the bulk and ſolidity of childrens heads cannot ſo eaſily be aſcertained; nor can I entirely agree with Dr Oſburne when he ſays, (p. 27,) <q>We are in poſſeſſion, however, of the means of determining it with exactneſs ſufficient to direct our practice in the ſafeſt and beſt manner.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The caſe of Elizabeth Sherwood, (p. 73.) ſhows the poſſibility of performing delivery with the crotch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et,
<pb n="317" facs="unknown:022551_0307_0FB945A6019B50E0"/>
in circumſtances hitherto deemed unfavoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and deſperate. But, in a pelvis of a ſimilar conſtruction, various cauſes may concur to diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point our views, and baffle our attempts; or, from the obſtacles that neceſſarily occur, delivery muſt always be precarious in the conſequences; and this will diminiſh the value of the advantages we might otherwiſe expect to derive from this important diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery.</p>
            <p>To conclude: Though we allow the whole of Dr Oſburne's poſtulata, it muſt ſtill be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edged, that caſes of narrowneſs from diſtortion ſometimes, though ſeldom, do occur, in which a dead child cannot be extracted by the ſciſſars and crotchet, even in the hands of the moſt ſkilful and dexterous practitioner.—Shall we, <hi>then,</hi> be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned ſpectators of the fatal event that muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue? Or, ſhall we dare to interfere; and, by an operation apparently cruel, and from its conſequences deſperate, make a laſt effort of that aſſiſtance which our limited art affords in behalf of our patient<note n="*" place="bottom">I have been juſt informed, on authority which I truſt, of a work lately publiſhed on the Continent, which contains many caſes of utility of the <hi>diviſion of the pubes,</hi> where "a conſiderable ſpace was gained by the operation."—The account of this pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication hath not yet appeared in any of the foreign Journals.</note>?</p>
