            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IN diſcourſing upon which, I ſhall offer ſome Conſiderations reſpecting the <hi>Nature, Cauſe,</hi> and <hi>Aſpect</hi> of <hi>Death,</hi> upon the preſent and future Life; tending to repeſent its Solemnity, and the Neceſſity and Importance of Preparation for it, and ſo proceed to the Improvement.</p>
            <p>DEATH is the <hi>Diſſolution</hi> of the <hi>Union</hi> between Soul and Body, upon which our animal Life depends, and tho' we have no Reaſon to conclude, that the Life of our Soul is hereby annihilated; yet if we conſider human Nature as compounded of Soul and Body, Death may be, in ſome Senſe, ſaid to be the viſible Deſtruction of it, becauſe it reduces all of Man, that is viſible, to deplorable Ruins! Reduces the active Creature full of anxious Thoughts, big

with great Projects and Deſigns, and laborious in the Purſuit of them, to a breathleſs Maſs, a ghaſtly Spectacle, devoid of Beauty and of Motion, which to prevent being offenſive, muſt ſoon be hid in the dark and ſilent Retreat of the Grave, and become the Prey of Worms.</p>
            <p>HOW this vital <hi>Union</hi> is diſſolved, we know no more than how it is formed; that Beings of ſo vaſtly different Natures as the Soul and Body are, ſhould be cloſely united is amazing, yet the Union appears to be as certain as it is aſtoniſhing, from their Sympathy with, and Influence upon each other.</p>
            <p>IN the mean Time this is apparent, that Death in its near Approaches, generally offers Violence to the Frame of Nature; tho' in ſome Inſtances, the Lamp of Life expires gently and gradually, like a Candle in the Socket; yet, in moſt, human Nature does not yield to the laſt Enemy without Reluctance, which as it manifeſts its deep Averſion to Death, ſo it proves Death to be the Shipwreck of Nature: Our vital Parts being torn by the Violence of Diſeaſes, as a Veſſel by the Rage of a Tempeſt, before it ſinks into the Abyſs of the Grave!</p>
            <p>BUT whence is it that Death puts a Period to our preſent Exiſtence, ſhall we aſcribe this entirely to the ſovereign Pleaſure of the ſupreme Being, which without any regard to our Demerit, has ſubjected our Nature to ſuch Mortality and Corruption? No! the ſacred Scriptures aſſert Death to be a <hi>penal Evil,</hi> iſſuing not from the meer Sovereignty, but the Juſtice and Righteouſneſs of God.</p>
            <p>THO' Immortality was no Privilege that innocent Man could claim, by the original Right of his Nature; yet it was graciouſly promiſed as the Reward of his Obedience: It is
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:009023_0005_1030749EC0DC69C8"/>
true, the human Body was formed of the Duſt, and that this is not ſo adapted to an immortal Life as the Soul, and therefore could only obtain and enjoy it by way of Gratuity, thro' the powerful Agency of a particular Providence.</p>
            <p>THE Almighty to excite Man to Obedience, promiſed this ſupernatural Privilege, and to deter him from the Contrary, threatened Death as the Puniſhment of Sin: Which neceſſarily ſuppoſes, that it would not have been his Lot, had he perſiſted in his Obedience to his Creator and Sovereign: And hence the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> aſſures us, that <hi>The Wages of Sin is Death;</hi> and elſewhere, that <hi>By one Man Sin entered into the World, and Death by Sin, and ſo Death paſſed upon all Men, for that all had SINNED:</hi> How? Virtually, in their federal Head the firſt <hi>Adam;</hi> it was therefore at this Door, that Death and all its preceeding Train of Diſeaſes and Miſeries, has broke in upon and entirely inundated this lower World, whereby it is rendered a Vale of Tears, a Scene of Woe: And indeed it is congruous both to Reaſon and Juſtice, that the Empire of Death and Miſery ſhould be parallel in Extent with the Dominion of Sin, the one as univerſal as the other.</p>
            <p>BUT what <hi>Aſpect</hi> has this penal Evil, Death, upon the preſent Life? I anſwer, It may be ſaid in general to be the End of it, it puts a final Period to the Drama of Life, whereby its ſhifting Scenes are quite ſhut up, and the Actors hurried off the Stage into a State of Inactivity and Darkneſs, juſt as in the dead of the Night, an entire ſtop is put to all the Buſineſs of the preceeding Day, and every Place of public Concourſe wrapt up in ſolemn Silence and Obſcurity!</p>
            <p>BUT in particular, Death puts a Period to all our worldly <hi>Schemes</hi> and <hi>Labours,</hi> as well as to our <hi>ſecular</hi> State of <hi>Proſperity</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:009023_0006_103074A245E22A20"/>
and <hi>Adverſity,</hi> together with the Seaſons of <hi>Grace,</hi> and Opportunities of <hi>Service.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHAT is ſaid of <hi>Princes</hi> may be applied to <hi>Peaſants,</hi> that <hi>Their Breath goeth out, and in that very Day their Thoughts periſh:</hi> While the <hi>Stateſman</hi> is forming grand Projects, and imagines he has near compaſſed his Deſigns; Death, which conſtantly lies in Ambuſh, frequently, and ſuddenly cruſhes his Schemes, diſappoints his Expectations, and blaſts his Succeſs: Death carries all off from the Theatre of Action, to the Priſon of the Grave, where thoſe, that a little while before, made a great Noiſe and Buſtle, are locked up in a profound Sleep, out of which Nothing can awake them, but the loud Blaſt of the Archangel's Trumpet.</p>
            <p>DEATH likewiſe puts a Period to our outward State, whether proſperous or afflicted; it concludes Proſperity by deſtroying Life, the Foundation of it, and hurries the grandeſt Potentates, from the Pomp of a Throne, to the Obſcurity of the Grave, where no Traces of their former Grandeur appear, in the ghaſtly Remains of their Mortality, and the Places that knew them on Earth ſhall know them no more.</p>
            <p>ON the other Hand, Death concludes all the Evils of an afflicted State, this gives the Child of God a happy Diſcharge from all the Hardſhips of the Chriſtian Warfare, and brings to a Period the Cruelty of Enemies, whoſe Rage can purſue us no further than the Grave, <hi>There the Wicked ceaſe from troubling, and the Weary are at Reſt:</hi> In a Word, Death is a ſecure Retreat from all the Calamities of Life, under the Preſſure of which the whole Creation groans and travels, and is therefore on this Account as acceptable to many, as the Darkneſs of the Night to the wearied Hireling!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:009023_0007_103074A4064047E0"/>BUT this is not all, Death likewiſe puts a final Period to all our Opportunities of Service; we have now many Advantages to do Good, and muſt account for our Diligence and Fidelity in the Improvement of them; but theſe will ſoon be over. Death will, in a little Time, bring every one of us that awful Meſſage, <hi>Give an Account of thy Stewardſhip, for thou mayest be no longer Steward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT I proceed to conſider the Aſpect that Death has upon a <hi>future Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HERE obſerve, That by Death our Souls are brought to live in a State of Separation from our Bodies, tho' <hi>the Dust returns to</hi> its original <hi>Earth,</hi> yet our <hi>Spirits return to God who gave them.</hi> They become, by quitting theſe Manſions, unembodied Spirits, and enter upon a new Scene of Life, in which they have no Uſe for the Organs of Senſe and Motion; Death liberates our Souls from the Incumbrance of elementary Bodies, and thereby awakes their noble Powers to greater Vigor and Sublimity in their Operations; it frees our Spirits from their Dependance on animal Bodies, and from the Impreſſions made on them by ſenſible Objects, ſo that the Pleaſures thence iſſuing for ever terminate, and are now derived from Objects better ſuited to the immaterial Nature of the Soul. Further,</p>
            <p>BY Death our Souls enter into an unſeen World, and change their Place as well as their Mode of living, we paſs by Death into the vaſt HADES, or inviſible World; to us an undiſcovered and untried Country, which neither our Senſes can give us any Notice of, or our Reaſon comprehend; and in which we ſhall meet with new Society, and ſuch a vaſt Variety of new Objects and Entertainments, either in themſelves, or in Reſpect
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:009023_0008_103074AA7136F7F0"/>
of our <hi>Apprehenſion</hi> of them; (then immediate and perfect) as will furniſh a ſufficient Fund for everlaſting Wonder, Love, and Praiſe! When our Spirits paſs out of the narrow Current of Time, they leave this minute Point of Earth on which we tread, and take their Flight into thoſe immenſe Territories, over which he preſides who has the Keys of Hell and Death.</p>
            <p>FURTHER, our Souls paſs from a State of Tryal to a State of Rewards and Puniſhments, as incomprehenſible as excellent, ſatisfactory, eternal; Rewards which the human Mind in its ſublimeſt Flights cannot graſp, and which all Language and Images fail adequately to expreſs.</p>
            <p>THO' the general Judgment be deferred till the Reſurrection, yet the Soul undergoes a particular Judgment, immediately after its Departure from the Body, or ſomething analogous to it, which is previouſly neceſſary to its being fixed in a State of Bliſs or Miſery; and this the ſacred Scriptures aſſure us is the Caſe of all that depart this Life, as appears by the Parable of <hi>Dives</hi> and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> the Promiſe of Chriſt to the Thief on the Croſs, and the Deſire of the Apoſtle to be diſſolved, that he might be with Jeſus.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Improvement</hi> of this Subject now calls for your Attention.</p>
            <p>DOES DEATH bring ſuch viſible Ruin upon our Nature, and is it the penal Fruit of Sin? Then what Reaſon has any Man living to be proud, who conſtantly carries about with him ſuch poignant Incentives to Humility, in the Mortality of his very Frame, which has in it the Seeds of innumerable Diſeaſes, and of Death: Should he boaſt of his Deſcent who muſt <hi>ſay of Corruption thou art my Father, and to the Worm thou art my Mother and my Sister.</hi>—Shall we glory in our Strength

which is cruſhed before the Moth?—Or in our Beauty, whoſe Features ſhall put on a ghaſtly Pale, and be ſtained with Putrefaction?—Shall we be puffed up with Wealth and Honor who muſt ſo ſoon leave them, and ſink in undiſtinguiſhed Duſt and deep Oblivion?—And ſeeing Sin has intailed this Curſe of Mortality upon us, we may thence infer its great Malignity, and ſhould be thereby enduced to behave towards it accordingly, as the moſt odious Deformity and fatal Source of all our Woes!</p>
            <p>IS the Empire of Death abſolute and univerſal? Then how little is Man to be truſted in, whoſe Breath is in his Noſtrils, continually expoſed to innumerable Accidents? <hi>Surely Men of low Condition are Vanity, and Men of high Degree a Lye:</hi> Who may by corrupt Biaſes, inconſtant Reſolutions, or by ſudden Death, diſappoint our Expectations from them; if any deſerved our Confidence, it would be the great and powerful, but even thoſe we are cautioned againſt a Dependance on: <hi>Trust not in Princes, nor in the Son of Man, in whom there is no Help, his Breath goeth out, he returns to his Earth; in that very Day his Thoughts periſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>DOES Death put a Period to all our ſecular Affairs, then how moderate ſhould we be in the Proſecution of them, inviolably obſerving the rational and excellent Medium between Extreams, preſcribed by the Apoſtle, <hi>Sorrowing as tho' we ſorrowed not, and rejoicing as tho' we rejoiced not, becauſe the Faſhion of this World paſſeth away.</hi> Death ſtrips the World of its deceitful Charms, and repreſents it in its native Dreſs of Emptineſs and Vanity; The Grave ſets before our Eyes in a ſtrong Point of Light, of how little Significancy human Greatneſs and Proſperity are, to thoſe who muſt in a ſhort Space leave them all behind, and go as naked out of the World

as they came into it: Certainly covetous Perſons that make a great Noiſe and Buſtle about their Projects and Deſigns, <hi>Spend their Money for that which is not Bread, walk in a vain Shew, and vex themſelves in vain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WILL Death put a final Period to all the Sufferings of this Life and that to come, with Reſpect to ſuch as fear God and work Righteouſneſs? Then let us endure them with Patience and Fortitude, for they are <hi>light, and but for a Moment, and therefore not worthy to be compared with the exceeding great and eternal Weight of Glory before us!</hi> Death will ſend our pained Bodies to the Dormitory of the Grave, and in Caſe we truely repent of Sin, and believe in Jeſus, tranſlate our afflicted Souls to the Reſt of God, where all Tears ſhall be wiped away, and we ſhall enjoy a Felicity, large as our Deſires, and laſting as our Souls.</p>
            <p>AND ſeeing Death concludes our gracious Seaſons, and Opportunities of Service, let us <hi>awake out of Sleep,</hi> and <hi>work while the Day lasts, for the Night cometh in which no Man can work.</hi>

            <p>BUT I proceed to ſpeak a little on the melancholy Occaſion of this Diſcourſe, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Death</hi> of our late gracious <hi>Soverign, King GEORGE</hi> the <hi>Second,</hi> of happy Memory; a Prince who may be in Juſtice denominated, the <hi>Father</hi> of his People: A Prince who thro' the whole Courſe of his Reign aimed at no deſpotic tyrannical Sway, but on the Contrary expreſſed due Reſpect to the repreſentative Body of the Nation, and made its Laws and Conſtitution the invariable Rule of his Conduct: As he wronged no Man of his private <hi>Property,</hi> ſo he granted to all that religious <hi>Liberty;</hi> which, as it is the Birth-right of all, ſo it is the greateſt Support and Ornament
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:009023_0011_103074B014D69C28"/>
of real Chriſtianity, which is a reaſonable Service, founded on Argument, the Iſſue of impartial Enquiry and free Choice: But the Reverſe hereof, is built on the Ruins of every Thing that is valuable in human Nature, and directly tends to deſtroy the Religion of Jeſus entirely, by ſetting up other Kings in his ſpiritual Kingdom, and claiming Allegiance to them in Oppoſition to his Authority: In brief, it oppoſes Humanity and enſlaves Mankind.</p>
            <p>HERE give me Leave tranſiently to obſerve, That there was a memorable Reſemblance or Analogy between the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Monarch <hi>David,</hi> and our deceaſed Sovereign, in Reſpect of his heroic military Character, as appears particularly from the intrepid Bravery of the latter at the famous Battle of DETTINGEN, the Iſſue of which reflected as great Glory on the Arms of <hi>Britain,</hi> as it did Scandal on thoſe of <hi>France!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AS the Proſperity of his People was the principal Object of his Attention, ſo he was anxious and unwearied in the Proſecution of it to the laſt Moments of his Life; and hence the Nation's Eſteem and Love encreaſed with his growing Years, which is not only evident from their public Declarations, but likewiſe by their extraordinary <hi>Union</hi> among themſelves; and, that even under the prodigious Load of an expenſive War, the great Variety of their Denominations, religious Principles, and Party Views notwithſtanding.</p>
            <p>IN Conſequence of the aforeſaid <hi>Union,</hi> it pleaſed that divine Providence, by which Kings reign, and Princes decree Juſtice, to crown the latter Part of the Adminiſtration of our deceaſed Sovereign with ſuch an aſtoniſhing Train of memorable Victories by Land and Sea, as will be the Wonder of Poſterity,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:009023_0012_103074B32144C8E0"/>
and brighten the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Annals in all future Time: As this illuſtrious Aera reflects great Honor on the King, his Councils, and Arms, ſo if rightly improved, it opens, under Providence, a Proſpect of EMPIRE for the Nation, beyond what the moſt ſanguine Hopes would have ſometime ſince dared to dictate; an Empire that will give her vaſtly more Weight in the Scale of <hi>Europe,</hi> if not (in a Courſe of Time) conſtitute her the Arbitreſs of it.</p>
            <p>BUT in the midſt of this ſurprizing Series of the moſt important Events, in this critical Conjuncture of a War with numerous and potent Nations, combined in an unjuſt, extraordinary and formidable Confederacy, to ruin entirely a Proteſtant Prince, and one of the moſt renowned, intrepid, and invincible <hi>Heroes</hi> that the preſent or any paſt Age has produced; I mean his <hi>Pruſſian Majesty:</hi> In this Situation of Things our ſucceſsful Monarch dies, dies ſuddenly, while beloved and revered, dies the Deſire and Delight of his People; while <hi>France,</hi> our artful implacable Enemy, who has ſo long inſulted the Honor, enſnared the Councils, and meditated the Ruin of our Nation: I ſay, while this arogant Rival-Power is exceedingly humbled, and almoſt brought to Reaſon, while <hi>France</hi> is ſtripped of many Fortreſſes and vaſt Domains in divers Parts of the World, eſpecially in <hi>America</hi> and the <hi>East-Indies;</hi> her Fleet broken, and her Trade deſtroyed, our beloved Sovereign dies, and leaves his great and good Deſigns, in Reſpect of War and Peace, on which his Heart was ſo much ſet, unfiniſhed: A melancholy Providence this! which ſhould be laid to Heart, and rightly improved; let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore humble ourſelves under the mighty Hand of God, that he may exalt us in due Time; let us implore Heaven that this Event may be over-ruled to the Good of our NATION in particular, and of ZION in general: Let us be hereby ſtirred

up to prepare for our own Diſſolution, which how near it is, and how ſudden it may be, we know not; as <hi>Horace</hi> juſtly obſerves, Death makes no Diſtinction between the Cottages of Peaſants and the Palaces of Princes:—And from hence let us likewiſe learn the extreme Vanity of all human Greatneſs and Dignity, which cannot ſcreen their Poſſeſſors from the Stroke of a ſudden Death.</p>
            <p>IN the mean Time give me Leave to obſerve, that thro' divine Goodneſs, there are ſome Circumſtances attending this <hi>Gloom</hi> of Providence, which may allay our Griefs and animate our Hopes, eſpecially theſe following, <hi>viz.</hi> The MODE (or Circumſtances) of our late Sovereign's Exit, the Qualifications of his MINISTRY, the promiſing Endowments of his SUCCESSOR, and the late famous VICTORY of the King of <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> over the <hi>Austrian</hi> Army.</p>
            <p>THE Circumſtances of our late Sovereign's Exit were reſpectable, ſimilar to thoſe of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Hero in our Text, particularly, he died in a good old Age, full of Days, being arrived to his Seventy-ſeventh Year, after a Reign of Thirty-three, very near the ſame Space that <hi>David</hi> reigned over <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> it is but a ſmall Number of Mankind of any Order that live to ſuch an Age, and very few Princes in any Part of the World reign ſo long a Space. Certainly, my Brethren, we have great Reaſon to adore the bleſſed God, with the moſt ardent Gratitude, that ſo mild and equitable an Adminiſtration was continued with us ſo long; which if compared with the arbitrary, popiſh, oppreſſive Reigns of the Male Line of the STEWART Family, may in Reaſon accent the Gratitude of all ſincere Proteſtants, for ſo very valuable a Mercy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:009023_0014_103074BA63483A00"/>BUT to proceed, our late Sovereign likewiſe died full of Riches and Honor, the Legacies mentioned in his laſt Will prove the former, and the numerous Addreſſes of the Nation confirm the latter, and both of them are valuable Benefits, promiſed by the Almighty, to excite the Creatures Obedience.</p>
            <p>IT is likewiſe an encouraging Circumſtance, that our deceaſed Sovereign left ſo able, faithful, and reſolute a <hi>Ministry</hi> at the Helm of the Nation; among which the truly Honorable Mr. PITT ſhines with diſtinguiſhed Luſtre, a PATRIOT of ſuch ſurprizing Capacity, ſuch extraordinary Diſintereſtedneſs, and unſhaken Firmneſs, as no Artifice could elude, no Oppoſition intimidate, or Bribe ſeduce, from his inviolable Adherence to ſuch Meaſures as were neceſſary to promote the Honor and Intereſt of the Nation; a Patriot this, who is, in very Deed, the Guardian, Joy, and Glory of his Country: It is he who has rouſed the ſleeping Genius of the Nation from a State of inglorious Eaſe, ſordid Puſillanimity, and ſorry Congreſſes, to War and Arms, to aſſert its juſt Rights by numerous Acts of heroic Bravery, whereby the Honor of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> FLAG and Land Forces is retrieved, vindicated from Contempt, made reſpectable in the Eſteem of all Nations, made the Joy of its Friends, and the Terror of its Enemies: Theſe glorious Deſigns were ſo far from being compaſſed by the ſpecious pacific Schemes and trifling Treaties, (with a Court inured to Artifice and Chicane) which were propoſed and purſued by a former Miniſtry, that the Honor and Intereſt of the Nation were betrayed, its Poſſeſſions, Trade, and Influence, by Degrees ſo impaired, that it was brought to the very Brink of Ruin, a Plan to complete it was as artfully as confidently concerted, and almoſt fully prepared for the fatal Execution: O dreadful, deplorable Situation! <hi>(Quis talia fando, temperet a Lachrymis;)</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:009023_0015_103074BFF697B158"/>
But bleſſed be God, thro' the favorable Smiles of Providence upon the Conduct of a ſkilful, faithful PILOT, the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Veſſel almoſt ſhipwrecked, now emerges above the threatning Waves, reſumes its ancient Empire, and commands the Ocean.</p>
            <p>'TIS He that has directed the Nation to its true and moſt important Intereſt, as well as to the moſt probable and leaſt expenſive Meaſures to obtain and preſerve it, by annexing to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Crown, thro' a proper Exertion of its chief natural Strength (its ſuperior naval Force) this Weſtern EMPIRE, of vaſt, yea, unknown Extent, and of immenſe Value.</p>
            <p>AND it muſt needs give ſenſible Pleaſure to every generous Mind, to ſee the extraordinary Merit of this Gentleman, ſo publicly, ſo juſtly, and generally acknowledged by the Nation, in Sentiments and Expreſſions of the moſt paſſionate and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent Gratitude, hereby nobly laboring to make the Memory of his valuable Services as laſting as Time itſelf, as durable as they are diffuſive and truly noble: A Reward, which tho' it be moſt reaſonable and equitable, yet becauſe of the prodigious Degeneracy of human Nature, is not always the Attendant of the moſt noble Actions, the moſt diſtinguiſhed Merit, witneſs famous MARLBOROUGH, juſtly for ſome Time the Darling and Pride of the Nation, the Wonder of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> and the Scourge of <hi>France,</hi> yet afterwards, as unjuſtly as ungratefully, reproached, rejected, and contemned: O La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable! may that unhappy Fate be graciouſly prevented in the preſent Caſe, by that Providence that preſides over all!</p>
            <p>BUT that which is ſtill more animating in our preſent Situation, is the amiable <hi>Character</hi> we have received of his preſent Majeſty, <hi>King</hi> GEORGE <hi>the Third,</hi> the Grandſon of
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:009023_0016_103074C2CBCE1070"/>
our deceaſed Sovereign, <hi>who now reigns in his Stead,</hi> a <hi>Character</hi> which his early Inſtruction in the Principles of LIBERTY, enforced by the amiable Examples of his famous Predeceſſors and Relatives, ſince the ever memorable <hi>Revolution,</hi> under pious <hi>King William,</hi> of glorious Memory; King WILLIAM, who in the midſt of much Labor, eminent Hazard, and great Diſcouragements, nobly laid, with a maſterly Hand, the very Foundations of all that is dear to us, as Men, as Chriſtians, and as Proteſtants; LAID the Baſis of all our preſent ineſtimable Privileges of every Kind, Privileges that ſhould form ſuch indelible Impreſſions of Gratitude upon our Minds, as no artful Colorings of deſigning Men, or length of Time, ſhould ever be able to extinguiſh.</p>
            <p>BUT to return from this Digreſſion, what has been ſaid concerning the reigning Prince, conſidered in Connection with his religious and virtuous EDUCATION in Proteſtant Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, enforced by good Practice <note n="*" place="bottom">Precepta docent, Exempla cogunt.</note> (under the Tuition of a Nobleman of diſtinguiſhed Piety, a Preceptor of ſuperior Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius) and recommended by the Influence of his religious and illuſtrious Parent, the PRINCESS DOWAGER of WALES, renders the aforeſaid <hi>Character</hi> highly probable, and gives us Reaſon to hope, that his tender opening Mind has been early imbued with thoſe noble and humane Sentiments, early impreſſed with thoſe devout Affections, which when habitual and prevalent, are the true Genius and diſtinguiſhing Glory of vital Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, as neceſſary, as ornamental, neceſſary both to private and public Life, for every Step of Elevation in the Scale of Offices, Dignity and Dominion, from the loweſt to the higheſt of them (from the Nadir to the Zenith) to make them comfortable, honorable, and uſeful here, and to make us meet for a future glorious State!</p>

               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:009023_0017_103074C58F3599B8"/>I MAY add, that the preceeding CHARACTER of his preſent Majeſty is confirmed by the Beginnings of his Adminiſtration, eſpecially by the PROCLAMATION for the Encouragement of Virtue and Piety, and for preventing and puniſhing Vice, Prophaneſs and Immorality; a PROCLAMA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION worthy of the greateſt and beſt of Princes; a PROCLA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MATION as neceſſary in theſe Times of Degeneracy and Corruption, to promote the Safety and Weal of the Nation, as it is excellent in Reſpect of its Matter, and elegant in Regard of its Form; the ſtrong Terms in which it is expreſſed, together with the Order to read it publicly in Courts and Churches ſeveral Times a Year, have an excellent Tendency, a pious and promiſing Aſpect on the Church and Nation, and are an encouraging OMEN of Good to come.</p>

The civil and religious Rights of my loving Subjects are equally dear to me, with the moſt valuable Prerogatives of my Crown; and as the ſureſt Foundation of the whole, and the beſt Means to draw down the divine Favor on my Reign, it is my fixed Purpoſe to countenance and encourage the Practice of true Religion and <hi>Virtue.</hi>

                  <p>THE Eyes of all <hi>Europe</hi> are upon you, from your Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, the Proteſtant Intereſt hopes for Protection.—</p>

which promiſes ſo great Good to the Church and State: O may the gracious God make us deeply ſenſible of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable Moment of our preſent Advantages, both religious and civil, and enable us to teſtify our Gratitude to God and Man for them, by a conſcientious Improvement; <hi>giving to Caeſar the Things that are Caeſar's, and to God the Things that are God's;</hi> and may our gracious Sovereign, who begins his Reign with ſuch amiable Auſpices of MODESTY, PRUDENCE, and PIETY, live long a Comfort to himſelf, a Bleſſing to the Kingdoms, over which he governs in particular, and to the Proteſtant Church in general; may he be in Fact, what by his Royal Dignity he is in Title, <hi>a Defender of the Faith,</hi> and this I verily hope will be the honorable and happy Attendant of his Reign; <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>THE great Influence of <hi>Authority</hi> properly exerted, and enforced by good <hi>Example</hi> from the THRONE, to promote national REFORMATION, and the Power of the Contrary to corrupt and deprave Communities, appear in Contraſt with ſufficient Light and Evidence from the Narrative given in the ſacred Pages reſpecting the KINGS of JUDAH and ISRAEL.</p>
                  <p>AND the Neceſſity of a national REFORMATION to ſecure and perpetuate national Proſperity and Glory, appears not only from expreſs and repeated <hi>Promiſes</hi> thereof in this Situation of Things, and as explicite <hi>Threatnings</hi> of the Contrary in Caſe of a general Corruption of Manners; (<hi>See Jer.</hi> xviii. 7—11—) but alſo from the Series of God's dealings with the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and other Nations in Conformity thereto.—This divine Conduct Reaſon itſelf approves, for ſeeing it is but right, juſt, and condecent, ſuitable to the divine Character, ſuitable to the very Nature of Things, and neceſſary to anſwer the Ends of Government; that the moral Governor of the World ſhould diſcountenance Vice, and encourage Virtue, by proper Puniſhments and Rewards: And ſeeing Communities, as ſuch, terminate with the preſent Life, of Conſequence the Members that compoſe them can only be treated as Individuals in a future State, it is therefore neceſſary that BODIES POLITIC, he rewarded or puniſhed here according to their public MORAL CHARACTER.— Some Peculiarities of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> State (under a Theocracy) in juridicial Matters, adapted to their ſingular Circumſtances, do not in any Meaſure militate againſt, or enervate Arguments deduced from Reaſon and Equity, which equally affect all Nations in all Caſes that are ſimilar and parallel; and hence the abſolute Neceſſity of a general REFORMATION of Manners, to promote national Weal and Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and prevent Deſolation and Ruin, is conſpicuous and apparent: Without this, no political PENETRATION, no martial FORTITUDE, however neceſſary and amiable, no SUCCESSES, tho' numerous and glorious, no NAVAL ARMAMENTS and <hi>Land Forces,</hi> however grand and formidable, no OPPULENCE, however immenſe, can ſecure guilty Nations from Miſery and Ruin, denounced by incenſed Omnipotence, any more than dry Stubble can defend itſelf in Conteſt with devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Flames!</p>

            <p>IN fine, when the State of the War in <hi>Germany</hi> very lately took an unpromiſing Turn, by the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> and <hi>Austrian</hi> Armies taking the <hi>Capital</hi> of <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> and by the Defeat of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Brunſwick</hi> by the <hi>French,</hi> and every Thing looked dark and diſtreſſing; then did divine Providence, when all was put to the Riſque, ſeaſonably and graciouſly interpoſe in our Favor, by giving a complete and deciſive Victory over the Grand <hi>Austrian</hi> Army, under the Direction of Marſhal DAUN, to the brave, but oppreſſed and invironed KING of PRUSSIA.</p>
            <p>THIS Victory appears the more marvellous, affecting, and important, when we conſider the Superiority of the <hi>Austrian</hi> Army, in Reſpect of their Numbers, the Freſhneſs of their Troops, their Advantage in Reſpect of Situation, and the great Experience, Skill, and Caution of their General, another

FABIUS MAXIMUS, <note n="*" place="bottom">The <hi>Roman</hi> General who conquered HANNIBAL, the <hi>Carthaginian,</hi> by Delays.</note> who having great Reſources, has long ſought by Delays to ruin his <hi>Pruſſian</hi> Majeſty, and had got conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Advantage againſt him in two preceeding Battles, ſome Time ago, which muſt give freſh Spirit to his Forces; and on the other Hand, when we at the ſame Time view our brave Allie under very diſcouraging Circumſtances, his Troops fatigued, deprived of many of his experienced gallant Generals, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Veteran Soldiers, in former bloody Battles, who in Firmneſs equaled the <hi>Macedonian</hi> PHALANX, himſelf oppreſſed with the Weight of an unequal War, at a Loſs which Way to bend his Courſe, or which of his numerous and potent Enemies to fight firſt; add to this that the End of the Campaign was near, and that he had no Reſource (no ſufficient one) in Caſe of a total Defeat, from hence I preſume it appears, that his Fate and ours turned in ſome Meaſure on the Iſſue of this BATTLE; there was a Danger either of his loſing his Crown, or our looſing our late Acquiſitions to preſerve it: How great then is the Goodneſs of God in crowning the Scene thus far by this ſurprizing Succeſs, when there was a Neceſſity of putting all to the Fortune of War upon ſuch unequal Terms, to prevent a ſure but lingring Death: Surely this gives Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to expect the Continuance of the divine Favors, in Caſe we faithfully improve, by Repentance and Reformation, the Mercies we have already received, and reſolutely proſecute the ſame political and martial Meaſures (to which many ſincere Friends of the Nation, heartily wiſh the Addition of another Allie at leaſt, to aſſiſt in the Land War, in Caſe the Peace is not concluded this Winter) which have been hitherto favored by Providence, which may the good God grant for Jeſus Chriſt his Sake. <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>
