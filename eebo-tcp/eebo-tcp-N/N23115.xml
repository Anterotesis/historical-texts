         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE remarkable change which has lately took place in the circumſtances of a noted defender of Britiſh enormities, occaſioned the writing of the following letter, and the reader will pleaſe obſerve, that it was wrote ſolely for the information of a friend, and without the leaſt expectation that it would ever find its way into a printing-office.</p>
            <p>The perſon whom we are led to ſuppoſe the writer means, has been four years in this country. He came to it in a clandeſtine manner, without a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and has lived here, <hi>ſeemingly</hi> in the midſt of plenty, without any <hi>known</hi> means of procuring ſubſiſtance.</p>
            <p>Lately, he has commenced buſineſs in a line which would require a conſiderable capital:—Whether Britiſh guineas or Tory dollars have, or have not, been the reward of his ſcurrility—his abuſe of the immortal heroes of the American revolution, and of the friends of liberty in Europe—and his unwearied attempts to involve the United States in war with their republican allies, is worthy of examination by the friends of the happineſs and
proſperity of America. Be that as it may, he deſerves the reprobation of all good men, by his profound devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="unknown:030553_0005_0FE7C96A15664198"/>to that monſter whoſe ſattelites have, in the moſt barbarous monſter, ravaged the United States, end whom, every man poſſeſſed of the common feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of humanity muſt <hi>deteſt</hi> and <hi>abhor</hi>!</p>
            <p>Much has been lately wrote in this city reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>occupation</hi> of the perſon alluded to, in Europe and America; and ſome have even hinted, that the thefts, housſe and ſhop-breakings, &amp;c. which have been ſo numerous lately in and about Philadelphia, has enabled him to emerge!</p>
            <p>The editors, on ſeeing the letter, earneſtly ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited permiſſion to tranſcribe it for the preſs, which its author could ſcarcely be prevailed on to conſent to.—It is printed verbatim from the original.</p>
            <p>The "Poſtſcript to Peter Porcupine" expoſes only the moſt glaring of the falſehoods, abſurdities, contradictions, and inconſiſtencies, with which the pamphlet of his "Life and Adventures" abounds; but which muſt at once ſtrip it of every particle of credit for authenticity which it may have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from the ſuperficial reader.</p>

               <salute>MY DEAR FRIEND,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AT your reiterated ſolicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions I have attempted to procure you a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful narrative of the life and tranſactions of that mercenary incendiary who for ſome time paſt has been, by <hi>foreign</hi> aſſiſtance, <hi>forcing</hi> himſelf into notice, on the theatre of American poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics. After a moſt vigilant ſearch, I have procured, beſides other authentic documents, a rough ſketch of his life, drawn up by himſelf in a paroxyſm of deſpair, when the gallows ſtared him in the face; but, as he eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped puniſhment at that time, he has been as careful to prevent its publication as "<hi>exiſting circumſtances</hi>" would permit. The gentleman
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:030553_0007_0FE7C97184B3EF08"/>from whom I have procured that manuſcript, got poſſeſſion of it at a time when its wretched author had not wherewithal to procure him a hiding-place from the ſtorm. He wiſhed my friend to digeſt it for publication, expecting by that means to procure a little money, but before it could be got ready for preſs, its owner requeſted its ſuppreſſion; nor would I at this time have procured the loan of it, had not the brazen-faced Porcupine declared in my friend's company, when he mentioned it in a jocular manner, that he never gave it him, and that not a word contained therein was true, with reſpect to him: The falſity of this declaration, I am convinced, will appear as obvious to you as it did to my friend, when you are informed, that it was written and dated in Ipſwich jail; at a period when he could have no inducement for making <hi>his crimes</hi> appear more hideous than they really were.</p>
            <p>By the aſſiſtance of this, and other informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I have traced him through the compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated viciſſitudes of a life abandoned to every ſpecies of wickedneſs, and recorded the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal actions of his life as accurately, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering my ſources of information, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from the various ſcences, could poſſibly be done, theſe conſidered, I will have no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to apologiſe for the errors which may unavoidably have place in any part of this letters.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="unknown:030553_0008_0FE7C97447F72F40"/>
            <p>HE was born (whether above or below ground I know not) on the eſtate of that ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated Engliſh peer <note n="*" place="bottom">Lord Lanſdale</note> whom Peter Pindar lately recommended to the Royal Academy of London, as a ſuitable repreſentation of the <hi>Devil,</hi> if they wiſhed to procure <hi>a ſtriking like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of the "<hi>Sovereign Lord and King</hi>" of the internal regions. This <hi>effigy</hi> of his Satanic Majeſty became the Porcupine's maſter; for by the law which at that period exiſted in England, the children of miners became the property of the perſon to whom their parents belonged. From this ſtate of bondage, the deceaſe of the father before the 14th year of the child's exiſtence could only releaſe it, for as the women on the death of their huſband's were declared <hi>free,</hi> immemorial cuſtom had conſidered the offspring as the mother's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, if it had not attained the above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned age. Theſe children were generally received into the pariſh workhouſe, but ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation ſtared the mother in the face, and ſhe had no alternative but that of returning to her ſubterraneous employment.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately for the Porcupine, ere he had attained the eighth year of his age his <hi>reputed</hi> father departed this life, in conſequence of a bruiſe he received by the falling of a huge rock of coal; and in the year 1774 the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupine emerged from the coal-pit, which, for ſucceffive generations, had contained the cradle
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:030553_0009_0FE7C97A2A5591F8"/>and the death-bed of his anceſtors—Unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately for the Porcupine, I ſay, was this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mature death of his father, for had it not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, he might have paſſed from the womb to "that bourne from whence no traveller re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns," in oblivion; but for this fatal accident, the "political pilots of America" would have been under the neceſſity of ſteering their veſſel without the aid and guidance of a "<hi>bloody buoy,</hi>" and an Engliſh whipping-poſt would not have been <hi>graced</hi> with the carcaſe of the Porcupine; but for it, the Executive of the United States would never have been puffed with the <hi>flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing panegyrics</hi> of this diſhoneſt hypocritical wretch, nor would an Engliſh judge have been under the neceſſity of paſſing on him a ſentence of death; but for it, the light-fingered tribe would have lacked a ſkilful aſſociate, and his Britannic Majeſty an <hi>able</hi> agent.</p>
            <p>The Porcupine, on his arrival <hi>above</hi> ground, was admitted into the pariſh work-houſe, thro' the influence of a very cha itable lady in the neighbourhood; and his mother having ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted the hand of another <hi>pit-mate,</hi> returned to her former ſlavery. The Porcupine had not been long in the work-houſe, until that covetuous diſpoſition, which has accompanied him in an <hi>eminent</hi> degree through life, began to appear, but for a while it was confined to the toys, &amp;c. of his companions. During the firſt two years he was in the work-houſe, he made a very rapid progreſs in his education;
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:030553_0010_0FE7C97BB56D0C38"/>but as he advanced in years, he advanced likewiſe in roguery, he had been often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed of petty thefts, yet his inſinuating ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, and progreſs in learning counterbalanced his bad actions with his too-credulous teachers, and he often eſcaped the puniſhment his crimes deſerved.</p>
            <p>He had been nearly four years in the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe when he commenced his depradations on its proyerty, and on that of its officers: Our hero has, throughout his whole life, been poſſeſſed of an unconquerable propenſity for ſtealing, and drinking ſtrong liquors—Several ſmall articles had from time to time diſappeared from the work-houſe, and the Porcupine had frequently been obſerved to be in liquor. Once, in particular, having found means to convey a braſs goblet from the governor's kitchen, by the aſſiſtance of one of thoſe monſters who are to be found in all the towns in England, whoſe whoſe buſineſs is to purchaſe ſtolen goods, and to encourage youth to ſteal, he converted the goblet into caſh, and part of that into gin, with which he got drunk; and returning to the work-houſe, yet intoxicated, he went directly to the governor's kitchen, and told the cook that he obſerved one of the boys on the road to town with a goblet under his arm; <hi>inquiring</hi> if it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the work-houſe. The goblet being, in conſequence, immediately miſſed, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation thereof given to the governor, he ordered the boy charged with the crime to be
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:030553_0011_0FE7C98182A9F9F0"/>brought before him, when low! it appeared that he had not been without the gates of the gates of the work-houſe that day: The Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupine was conſequently caught in the ſnare he had laid for another—the charge of theft reverted to him, who was brought before the governor, but the gin having commenced its operation, he was ſpeechleſs, in a ſtate of ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briation, diſgraceful at any age, but more ſo at his. Next day, the treble crimes of theft, drunkenneſs, and lying, procured him a moſt ſevere chaſtiſement: his credit in the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe was at an end; and from that day he formed the deſign of leaving it the firſt favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable opportunity.</p>
            <p>Some time in the ſpring of 1780, the year in which he commenced pocket-picking, he found means to extract from a countryman's pocket, who had come to town to attend a fair, a few ſhillings. Conſcious of detection if he did not leave the work-houſe immediately, and already ſufficiently tired of its confinement, he determined to depart as ſoon after ſupper as he conveniently could, for, by ſo doing, he would have a night's travelling before his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off would be known.</p>
            <p>His memory was at this time pretty reten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive—his late ſevere flogging he had not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got—he had likewiſe perfect remembrance of another recent diſgrace, which, though not ſo <hi>corporeally</hi> painful, got him the hootings, hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings and contemptuous jeerings of all his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions;
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:030553_0012_0FE7C9839C5D7D68"/>theſe, had he not been poſſeſſed of a heart ſo naturally prone to thieving, <hi>might</hi> have ſuperinduced a repriſal, before his <hi>final</hi> leave on the body of the object of his ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance; but the property, rather than the body, of the perſon who, when fulfilling his duty, he ſuppoſed had injured him, was his object; and as he had neither clothes nor money to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burden him when travelling, a little addition to the production of his firſt <hi>public</hi> eſſay, he was determined to attempt procuring; with this view, he employed the evening in ſchem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and while the governor, teachers, &amp;c. were ſuping, he put his ſchemes in execution; the governeſs's chamber was the firſt object of his examination—in it he could diſcover no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worth carrying off, ſave an antique re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating watch, which was immediately ſecured —the governor's was next in courſe, and after ſtrict examination, a ſolitary <hi>Queen Ann's</hi> half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinea, which its owner had long kept as an object of curioſity, was the only thing he could find worthy of capture:—The rooms of the teachers came next under review, but none of the precious metals were to be found in them; however, he determined they ſhould not fare better for that: In one room he thought a change from the work-houſe dreſs would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent his being ſtopped when travelling, and in the other, a determination to deſtroy, as he could not carry off, entered his malicious mind. The beſt ſuit belonging to the junior teacher
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:030553_0013_0FE7C989659A8E70"/>he cut in pieces with a pen-knife he found in the room, and from that of the ſenior he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried off a black cloth coat, a pair of black ſattin breeches, and a three-cocked hat, with theſe under his arm he ſallied forth from the work-houſe, and continued walking, nor dared to look behind him, till he was at leaſt a mile diſtant from his late home. Here he ſtoped for the purpoſe of ſhifting—you may eaſily conceive what a ridiculous figure a youth of his years would make in ſuch a dreſs.</p>
            <p>The teacher's poſteriors were equal in ſize to thoſe of any man in this city, and his coat would have been too large for Mr. Sedgwick; not with ſtanding which, this offspring of a coal-pit union determined to change his dreſs, and having thrown into an adjoining meadow-drain the principal part of his work-houſe uniform, he equipped himſelf in the clothes he had ſtole, and, in that ridiculous dreſs, he ſet off for Bir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingham. On the road he committed ſeveral petty acts of theft; the people ſuppoſing he had eſcaped from ſome mad-houſe, were not very watchful of their property when he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered their dwellings.</p>
            <p>He arrived at that town about eight o'clock in the morning, in the ſame ludicrous dreſs, which arreſted the attention of every eye: A huge old-faſhioned very fine cocked hat, and a pair of wooden-ſoaled work-houſe manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured, ſhoes—a ſuperfine very large black cloth coat, and a coarſe grey cloth work-houſe jacket
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:030553_0014_0FE7C98B8FAB7980"/>—a pair of very large and fine ſattin breeches, and a pair of the coarſeſt grey work-houſe ſtockings—a very rich antique watch-chain dangling on his thigh, and a great notty oak-branch in his hand, were contraſts ſo truly ſtriking, as to have a very viſible effect on the viſible faculties of every beholder.</p>
            <p>A member of a gang of thieves, who had for ſome time infeſted Birmingham, accoſted our young hero, and very ſoon diſcovered him to be of "<hi>the ſort;</hi>" he therefore carried him before their ſcheming committee, by the una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous voice of whom, he was admitted a member of their aſſociation, and from whom he received a complete change of dreſs. What became of the repeater he never knew, and its loſs he has often lamented. Under the tuition of theſe <hi>light-fingered gentlemen,</hi> however, he ſoon became a proficient in the <hi>art</hi> of pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing locks and every ſpecies of thieving. He continued in this place near twelve months; during which he aſſiſted them in robbing the ſtores, &amp;c. of ſeveral capital merchants, and always ſhared equal in the booty. Early in the year 1781, an end was put to this aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by ſome of the gang being ſeized in the act of breaking open the cellar of an inn, and the rogues not having confidence in one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for perſonal ſafety a retreat was unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. He, therefore, with a companion of the trade, left Birmingham the morning after ſaid detection, determining to carry on on their own
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:030553_0015_0FE7C990DDA34BA8"/>account, and took the road to Oxford. Near Coventry, they fell in with a chaiſe and four, containing a young lady and her inamorato, on their way to Gretna Green, and having ſtopped the carriage, the loving couple, alarmed at the appearance of a ruſty piſtol without a lock, delivered to the robbers, all their caſh, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of nearly 200 guineas; how the lovers were to proceed, or whether the Caledonian <hi>horſe-ſhoeing</hi> divine would unite them in the holy bands of matrimony without the <hi>appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> of a purſe, were objects which never ſtruck the minds of either of theſe hard-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed followers of Phorbas. They ſlept that night, and breakfaſted next morning, in the houſe of of a poor, but honeſt and induſtrious, country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, from which, not with ſtanding, they took care not to depart without a prize. The la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious man being up at the dawn of day to his work, when the unſuſpecting woman was empleyed preparing breakfaſt, a ſit opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity offered, and the monſters, callous to every feeling of humanity, picked the locks of an ancient bureau, and extracted therefrom one guinea and three half-crown pieces, which were carefully wrapped up in rags, and depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited in a corner of one the drawers, undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly a part of the hard earnings which the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious couple had collected for the purpoſes of paying their rent and the teacher's quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly bills for the education of their children: they departed unſuſpected, after paying the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:030553_0016_0FE7C99300FB0D88"/>good woman he moderate charge, and receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her hearty thanks; this day they dined at a tavern, from which they carried off a ſilver pot. They arrived at Oxford that ſame night, in which city they reſided ſome time: during which they broke open, a variety of haber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daſhers, mens mercers, hardware and jewellery ſhops, &amp;c. the products of which they eaſily diſpoſed of, as our hero takes notice, in the manuſcript already mentioned, that "he never was in any town two days without diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome place for the diſpoſal of ſtolen goods."</p>
            <p>The accomplices in villainy had not been in <hi>partnerſhip</hi> ſix months, when, in conſequence of a difference reſpecting the diviſion of ſome booty, they determined to ſeparate, but not before each had ſolemnly ſwore never to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come volunteer evidence againſt the other. It was the Poroupine's lot to leave Oxford; he therefore ſet off with the intention of going to London, but having ſtopped a few days at Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury fair, he picked ſeveral pockets, ſtole two or three pieces of cloth, ſeveral pairs of gloves, ſtockings, &amp;c. which occaſioned his return to Oxford to diſpoſe of them. During his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, a reward of 50 guineas had been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſed for the diſcovery of the perſons guilty of a late daring robbery, and if one of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents made the diſcovery, he was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive pardon as well as the reward. It was the laſt robbery that the Porcupine and his companion had been jointly guilty of, and the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:030553_0017_0FE7C9984FFC6458"/>promiſe of pardon and reward induced him to break his ſolemn engagement by making diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of his companion in iniquity. As the the aſſizes were ſitting the trial ſpeedily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced, but, <hi>unfortunately</hi> for the Porcupine, he could not reſtrain his hands even in the court; when retiring from giving his evidence, he was caught in the act of picking a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's pocket—he was accordingly committed to jail; his trial came on before the aſſize roſe, and he and his companion were found guilty; the latter, on account of the magnitude of his crime, death—and the former, on account of his youth, got off with a ſentence of impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment "for ſix months, and receiving on the firſt Friday of the firſt, third, and fifth months, 100 laſhes on his naked back, by the hands of the common hangman." This puniſhment had no other effect on the Porcupine than that of hardening him in iniquity. The period of his confinement had no ſooner expired, than he ſet off again for London; when he arrived there, he had in poſſeſſion, in addition to what he carried from Oxford, about 20 yards printed calicoe, I piece book muſlin, 4 large ſhawls, a quantity of ribbons, gloves, ſtockings, &amp;c. a ſilver watch, two ſilver table-ſpoons, one ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver porter-mug, beſides ſome caſh, all of which he picked up at the different houſes he halted at on the road. The goods he very ſoon diſpoſed of, and he continued, as uſual, <hi>drunk</hi> and <hi>honeſt</hi> till his purſe was reduced to
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:030553_0018_0FE7C99B0E542EB0"/>its original emptineſs: He then recommenced his depradations on his neighbour's property, and, being well known to all thieves in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and its vicinity, in the courſe of a few months he aſſiſted in the commiſſion of many capital and daring robberies. Shortly after his arrival in that city, he became, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued during his ſtay, the <hi>protector</hi> of one of the fair dames of St. Giles's, who ſupplied him very liberally with drink and money; but he and a companion being on a foot-pad expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in the neighbourhood of London, one evening, they ſtoped a carriage, and demanded the money of a gentleman who was in it, which he having refuſed, the companion of the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupine fired in at one door, which miſſing the gentleman, wounded our hero at the other, who was immediately apprehended and conducted to priſon. Next court he was tried, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſentence to be ſlogged at the cart's tail, and impriſoned three months in Tothilfields Bridewell. On his liberation he ſet off for Canterbury, on the road to which picked up ſeveral ſmall articles of value, and by his cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning addreſs, prevailed on the daughter of a farmer, at whoſe houſe he tarried one night, to ſleep with him, and in the morning carried off her father's watch and two guineas, which had been careleſsly left in the parlour over night. [In the manuſcript mentioned at the beginning of this letter, he ſays, he had a cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of travelling croſs-roads.]</p>
            <pb n="18" facs="unknown:030553_0019_0FE7C9A040BEFE88"/>
            <p>Having arrived at Canterbury, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced his old trade, and was pretty ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but a ſearch being ſet on foot, his narrow eſcape from the officers of juſtice, induced him to enter in the ſervice of "<hi>The Defender of the Faith,</hi>" by inliſting in one of his regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of infantry, which was ſhortly after commanded to prepare for a voyage to Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica; before the time fixed for their departure, however, the negociations for peace com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced, the order for embarkation was coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termanded, and the regiment ordered to Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtor, where he continued ſome time; when being ordered to Leiceſtor on a recruiting party he began again to ſteal. The day of their arrival, he and other two of the party took a trunk from behind a carriage, in the vicinity of that town, which contained ſeveral articles of great value. In this place they reſided ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral months, during which he married a daughter of the tavern-keeper on whom he was billetted.</p>
            <p>The party being ordered to join the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, on their return through Birmingham, he ſelt in with ſome of his old acquaintances, in whoſe company the night he was there was ſpent in the commiſſion of ſeveral petty acts of theft. He had no ſooner joined the regiment than, by ſaying ſhe was a w—e who followed him, he prevailed on the miſtreſs of the houſe in which he was billeted, to turn his wife out of doors, and on his fellow-ſoldiers to mob her out of town.</p>
            <pb n="19" facs="unknown:030553_0020_0FE7C9A25D799BC8"/>
            <p>Shortly after this, having met one night in the ſtreets with one of his officers in a ſtate of intoxication, he, being <hi>as uſual</hi> diſguiſed, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked and robbed him of his watch and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; he then left him, went for his uniform, and returning to the officer led him home. This unfortunate man's property again temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the rapacious villain, and he took off a few ſhirts, &amp;c. which he found in the room. Theſe he was careful to diſpoſe of that night, but he thought himſelf ſafe enough with the watch; he was however miſtaken: the officer had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect recollection which ſoldier it was who ſaw him home, and upon miſſing his ſhirts, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered a ſtrict ſearch to be made at the Porcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine's lodging—his ſhirts could not be found, but his watch unexpectedly was: The unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate wretch was immediately took under guard, and ſhortly after tried by a court-mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, who ſentenced him to receive, which he actually did, 500 laſhes. He deſerted imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after his recovery, and went directly to Derby. The ſame night that he arrived there he ſtole from a ſhop a vaſt number of ſilk handkerchiefs, and next night, from another ſhop he took ſome bundles of ſtockings, ſome dozen pair of gloves, and other ſmall articles; with theſe he travelled the country as a haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, and ſtealing whenever an opportunity of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered. In the courſe of this journey, he fell in with a fellow rogue, who adviſed him to commence coiner; the two accordingly ſet to
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:030553_0021_0FE7C9A7A3DA63F8"/>work, and having finiſhed a quantity of money they ſeparated. The hero, of this letter was ſoon after this apprehended at Notingham for paſſing bad money, but the magiſtrates, not knowing he was a deſerter, agreed not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute him if he would enliſt in the army; this he conſented to, and immediatly joined a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment then in town. He had not been long in this regiment until he was ſent on a recruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing party into the county of Stafford; he had no ſooner, however, been ſeperated from the main body than he determined to deſert. He picked the lock of a trunk belonging to the owner of the firſt houſe he was billeted in, and exchanged his regimentals for a ſuit of his land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord's; this done, he ſet off for Birmingham; when he arrived there, hearing of the fatal end of a number of his companions, and recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting his own hair-breadth eſcapes, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to follow thieving no longer: With this view he ſought out for a footman's place in ſome gentleman's family. He was of a good appearance, which by the aſſiſtance of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged certificate of good character, got him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſervice of a young gentleman who was going to make the tour of Europe, and they ecordingly ſet off for France. His not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the French language was a great incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience to his maſter, who, therefore deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to be at the expence of teaching him. They ſpent a long time in viſiting the different towns in the north of France; but the wretch
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:030553_0022_0FE7C9A930519160"/>had no ſooner acquired a knowledge of the language, which was highly pleaſing to his maſter, than he determined to return to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. Since he had been in this gentleman's ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, he conducted himſelf honeſtly, or at leaſt if he did ſteal, it was not diſcovered, this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt diſpoſition, however, did not long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue —his maſter having gone out with ſome companions on a party of pleaſure for two days, he, being an unſuſpicious man, left him the charge of his clothes and money, but he had no ſooner gone, than having put the money and moſt valuable part of his maſter's wardrobe into one trunk, he took it with him and ſet off immediately for Calais, from thence to Dover, and from Dover to Bath, without ſtopping a a longer time than was neceſſary at any place on the road. His going to Bath, he ſays in the before-mentioned manuſcript, was for the purpoſe of making his fortune, by marrying an heireſs! Had this happened, he adds, he would really have lived <hi>honeſt</hi> and <hi>ſober</hi> ever after; but fortunately for the ladies, he could not reſtrain his hands from ſtealing when there.</p>
            <p>In conſequence of a conſtant attendance at the card-room, a ſhow of caſh, a vaſt ſtock of impudence, and a ſmattering of French, he got intimate with ſeveral young gentlemen, one of whom having loſt very conſiderably at play, was enabled by a preſent of the Porcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine's to continue, and in the end came off gainer; this <hi>generoſity,</hi> as the young gentleman
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:030553_0023_0FE7C9AF02CEE710"/>thought it, induced him to invite our hero to his father's houſe next night to tea, which was complied with, and the viſits often repeated, in the conrſe of which, he pretended to be deeply ſmitten with the charms of the young gentleman's ſiſter, and made her ſeveral rich preſents. His endeavours were ſucceſsful—ugly as he is, he ſays he won her heart, and had he deſiſted from robbery for two weeks, he might have been in poſſeſſion of an amiable and accompliſhed lady with a handſome for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; but being apprehended attempting to rob the ſtage between Bath and Cricklade, an end was put to the affair.</p>
            <p>On examination, one of his accomplices ſerved him juſt as he did his old companion at Oxford, by turning evidence for the crown, in conſequence of which, three indictments for capital crimes were found againſt him. That for robbing the ſtage was firſt tried, and the evidence being clear, he was found guilty, and ſentenced to be <hi>banged!</hi> but the diſturbance between England and Spain, reſpecting Nootka Sound, breaking out at this time, he received a pardon on condition of joining one of the regiments ordered for Gibraltar; this he gladly conſented to. He was kept confined till they were ready to embark, at which he and ſeveral others were marched under a ſtrong guard for Portſmouth to be put aboard the tranſports which were lying at that place; but on the way, the Porcupine found means to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:030553_0024_0FE7C9B12A2805D0"/>from his guard, and went to London, from whence fear of diſcovery made him take immediate ſhipping for Dublin. He arrived in that city with an empty purſe, but not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forgot his old trade, he the evening of his arrival, picked a gentleman's pocket of about ſeventy pounds in caſh and bank-notes, and continued his depradations during his ſtay in that town. By his attendance at the places of public amuſement, he got acquaint with ſeveral genteel families, in particular, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came intimate in the family of a reſpectable citizen, the eldeſt daughter of whom he paid the cloſeft attention, and ſoon prevailed upon her to conſent to marriage, although her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had refuſed his conſent. He took lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for her in Parliament ſtreet, and lived in the midſt of plenty and pleaſure for ſome time; notwithſtanding which, he was no leſs aſſidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in his attention to another young lady, in the out-ſkirts of the city, with whoſe parents he paſſed for the ſon of an Engliſh gentleman of fortune. He made her ſeveral very valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able preſents, and ſhe received him in a favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable manner; but, when the young lady was on the point of yielding to his ſolicitations, her father having aſſented to the plan, which was to ſet off on the morning of their marriage, to <hi>his father's eſtate</hi> in England, an accident hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, which, though it ſtoped the marriage, ruined the lady. In one of their walks in her father's garden, when drawing out his hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:030553_0025_0FE7C9B65E687838"/>he dropped a letter from one of his old companions, then under ſentence of death in England. She took no notice of it, and he not obſerving it, it lay till ſhe had an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of picking it up and peruſing its contents, which made her acquaint with his true character.</p>
            <p>At his next interview ſhe laid the letter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him—in vain did he invent a variety of excuſes, ſuch as finding it, &amp;c. it was directed to him, ſhe remarked, and ſhe concluded by telling him, ſhe was determined never to ſee him again—it would have been well for her, if ſhe had continued firm in her determination. He now reſolved to leave Ireland without the knowledge of his <hi>wife</hi>; before which, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he wiſhed to ſee the young lady who had found the letter, and that he might accompliſh this, he wrote her a letter, requeſting her to meet him that evening at nine o'clock, near her father's gate (for he durſt not go within it now), that he might <hi>explain</hi> what had happened. This ſhe unfortunately complied with: he tied his horſe to a tree, and they walked on a little way; he endeavoured to reconcile matters, but to no purpoſe. He then threw her down, and having ſtuffed his handkerchief in her mouth, raviſhed, and afterwards robbed her—left her almoſt ſenſeleſs, and never ſaw her more.</p>
            <p>He then made for his horſe, which having mounted, he rode off directly for Donaghadee, at which place he embarked for Port-Patrick,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:030553_0026_0FE7C9BA398FCB48"/>from whence he ſet off for Carliſle, at which place he continued ſome time purſuing his old trade, and continuing his old licentious way of life. He ſeduced a ſervant maid, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards induced her to live with him; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding which, he paid his addreſſes to a young lady in the neighbourhood, but finding her father prejudiced againſt his very appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and reſolved to have no connection what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever with him, he changed his deſign, and prevailed on the young lady to ſubmit to his luſtful deſires. Her father, irritated at her diſobedience, determined to put an effectual ſtop to any future interviews, and had her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to her chamber. She however contrived to correſpond with him, by the aſſiſtance of a female ſervant, and in her letters earneſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him to form ſome plan to convey her from her priſon; but as he was not haſty in diſcovering one, ſhe requeſted him, by letter, as her window-ſhutters were faſtened, to come at midnight with a rope, mount to the top of the houſe, and let the rope down the chimney of her chamber, to which ſhe promiſed to tie her clothes and money, after that was drawn up, and the rope again let down, ſhe was to faſten herſelf. He repaired to the houſe at the hour appointed, which he very eaſily mounted by a peat-ſtack and a ſtable which were raiſed at one of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> gables; having hoiſted her money and clothes, he let the rope down again, not with intention of carrying off miſs, for as he
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:030553_0027_0FE7C9BFF5660F28"/>could not procure her eſtate, ſhe had no more charms for him; however, not ſuſpecting his intention, ſhe faſtened herſelf to the rope, and he having hoiſted her about half-way up, he faſtened it round the chimney-top, and went off with her clothes and money, leaving her in that ſooty ſituation to reftect on her credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. By this treacherous nocturnal expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he acquired clothes, ornaments, a watch, &amp;c. of nearly 150l. value, and in caſh about 53 guineas, with which, to avoid another whipping-poſt exhibition, he took a moon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light leave of Carliſle; taking care, however, to carry likewiſe with him, from his own lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings, whatever could conveniently be done, without giving his Cumberland dear "<hi>in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion</hi>" cauſe to ſuſpect his intention of elope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. At Brampton he diſpofed of the goods. He continued in this place about 10 days, ſtealing whenever an opportunity occurred. Having entered the houſe of an aged widow woman one night, he demanded of her where her money lay, the woman told him ſhe had none; however, he obſerved a watch, which when attempting to take, ſhe laid hold of him by the arm, beſeeching him not to take it—it had been her huſband's before ſhe knew him, ſhe ſaid, and ſhe had kept it with the greateſt care ſince his death—it was an agreeable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion in her hours of ſolitude, ſhe added, and begged him to leave it. The callous monſter irritated at her holding him, ſtruck her with a
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:030553_0028_0FE7C9C1850D80B8"/>ſhort bludgeon which he always carried with him, and laid her lifeleſs at his ſeet. He then took the watch, and even riffled the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate woman's pockets. Having locked the door, he made off for Litchfield, where falling in with a branch of the grand aſſociation, they carried on the buſineſs on an extenſive plan for three months; churches, dwelling-houſes, ſhops, cellars, &amp;c. all were examined in turn by this band of ruſſians. Their attack on the country-houſe of an extenſive wholeſale mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant is particularly worthy of notice: it was ſituated about three miles from Litchfield, and as nobody was left to take care of the houſe during winter, the rogues had an opportunity to empty it of almoſt every thing it contained; they took a cart with them, and having picked the locks, rumaged the houſe, and loaded their cart with the moſt valuable articles they could find, which they immediately took to town. Next day, while two of the gang were obſerving whether any of the family went to the houſe, the others were employed diſpoſing of what they had ſtole. At night they paid the houſe another viſit, and carried off another cart-load of the moſt valuable and portable articles which it then contained. For three weeks this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary robbery remained undiſcovered, and even then the perpetrators were not known. In the mean time, theſe villains had broke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two of the pariſh churches and a diſſenting meeting houſe, from each of which the carried
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:030553_0029_0FE7C9C6AF0D49C0"/>off the communion-cups, &amp;c. ſtripped the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits and covered pews, and took from one of the churches a large folio bible full of notes, which they burnt. The veſt number of houſe and ſhop-breakings, and other daring robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries lately committed in this town, occaſioned a ſtrict ſearch to be ſet on foot, particularly amongſt ſtrangers, in conſequence of which, two of the gang were apprehended, but our hero and the other eſcaped; he did not, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, leave town, he was doomed to grace the Litchfield whipping-poſt. On the next mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket day, obſerving a countryman with a purſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of guineas, he determined to attempt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing it, and following him till an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity occurred, he decoyed the ſimple fellow into an alley, then knocked him down, and robbed him of his all; but he had not left him long when the dreadful cries of the unfortunate man alarmed ſome people in the adjoining houſes; a purfuit was accordingly made, and the Porcupine was ſeized and committed to jail; before he was apprehended, however, he had diſpoſed of the purſe ſome way. He was ſoon after tried, and found guilty—he was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced to three months impriſonment, and to receive 50 laſhes under the gallows. It was a fortunate circumſtance for him, that nothing tranſpired in the courſe of the trial, reſpecting the late robberies—had he been convicted of them he would undoubtedly have met with that ſate he has ſo long deſerved.</p>
            <pb n="29" facs="unknown:030553_0030_0FE7C9C8DF718F80"/>
            <p>Afraid of a diſcovery which would put an effectual ſtop to his career, he petitioned to be allowed to enliſt, which being granted, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered with a company then in town, belonging to a regiment lying at Ipſwich, to which he was immediately ſent with ſome other recruits. At a fair they halted one day trying to procure more recruits, and our hero prevailed on his guard to take off his hand cuffs, which being done, he went to the fair, at which he picked a farmer's pocket of about 20 guineas, 6 of which he gave to his comrades. Having ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at Ipſwich, and being reſtored to the <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> of a <hi>Britiſh ſoldier,</hi> he began again to ſteal. It would require a volume to contain a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular account of the crimes he committed du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his ſtay in this town. Shortly after he arrived, he married a ſervant girl; this wretch, who has been guilty of ſo many enormities, made no ſeruple to break through the holy bands of matrimony whenever it ſuited his purpoſes. At this time he had wives in various parts of England, and one in Ireland; beſides which, he had ruined a number of young wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who never had the honour of being united to him by wedlock's ſacred ties.</p>
            <p>The Porcupine having with ſeveral of his fellow-foldiers, broke into the ſtore of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive wholeſale merchant, and carried off a quantity of goods, caſh, bills, &amp;c. to a very conſiderable amount. The Porcupine knew this could not remain long undiſcovered, and
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:030553_0031_0FE7C9CEA8C1BF10"/>being more provident than his companions, he arranged matters ſo as to procure his ſhare in caſh, and with the addition of a watch, a few guineas, and a complete change of dreſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the owner of the houſe in which he was billeted, he made off directly for New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>market, at which place the races were to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence the next week.</p>
            <p>This daring robbery was the occaſion of a very ſtrict ſearch, and a few of the Porcupine's companions were among thoſe apprehended on ſuſpicion. Some of the goods being found in their poſſeſſion, and one of their accomplices having become king's evidence, a full diſclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure was made. A reward was offered for ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending our hero, by the military as well as civil authority, and he was arreſted and dragged out of an aſſembly, at which he had promiſed himſelf the beſt crops he had yet reaped, and ſent to priſon. He was ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſent under a military guard to Ipſwich, and lodged in jail. It was while lying there, under the horrors of a guilty conſcience, and expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the gallows as the reward of his crimes, that he wrote the manuſcript I mentioned at the begianing of this letter.</p>
            <p>He had not lain long there when he and his companions were tried by a court-martial, and he and another was ſentenced to receive 1000 laſhes each, to be drummed out of the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to be delivered over to the civil law. They ſtood 700 the firſt time, and as ſoon as
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:030553_0032_0FE7A75DF0B2B490"/>they were able, they got the remainder, were drummed out of the regiment, and again com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to jail; but the humane gentlemen who fuſtained the principal loſs wiſhing to decline any further proſecution, they had their choice whether to ſtand trial, or to join the Queen's Rangers, Botany Bay, or the Royal Americans, Nova Scotia, in either of which latter caſes, they were never to return to Great-Britain. The Porcupine made choice of Nova Scotia, and his companion of Botany Bay. After our hero arrived at the place of his choice, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted his talents to procure a little caſh, with the intention of making off for the United States as ſoon as poſſible. In them he arrived in the year 1792, and has lived ever ſince without any <hi>viſivle</hi> means of procuring an <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt livelihood!</hi> it is evident, that he muſt either have ſtole or been the <hi>ſecret</hi> agent of the king his maſter; I am inclined to believe the latter is his employment, for the wretch hardened in iniquity, who could go to the gallows with compoſure, ſhudders as the thought of many year's confinement.</p>
            <p>I am the more inclined to believe it, as he has ſuddenly emerged from his late ſtate of poverty and miſe y, and has opened a ſhop in this city in <hi>one</hi> of his names; this, however, I have been informed from the beſt authority, is only a temporary ſcheme of the <hi>ſervants</hi> of our late "<hi>moſt excellent king,</hi>" to <hi>try the pulſe</hi> of the American people!</p>
            <pb n="32" facs="unknown:030553_0033_0FE7C9D608851378"/>
            <p>The variety of names he went under, I have not taken notice of, and one-half the innum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berable quantity of crimes he committed, could not be <hi>enumerated</hi> in the circumſcribed bounds of a letter.</p>
            <p>Having peruſed the preceding pages I know how you feel—I know how every <hi>honeſt</hi> man muſt ſeel at ſeeing this abandoned wretch, this outcaſt of ſociety, daring to interſere in the politics of your country, and a<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

               <salute>PETER,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HAD the pamphlet which you call your "Life and Adventures," not contained ſuch a multiplicity of falſehoods, which might deceive thoſe who know nothing. of England, although they muſt be evident to thoſe who have reſided there, I would have taken no notice of it. Should you explain the abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities and reconcile the contradictions hereafter noticed, you may yer redeem character.</p>
            <p>After expoſing the wretched hovel and the indigence in which your grandfather dwelt, and ſaying, that all he left behind him was his ſcythe, his reap-hoop, and his flail, you have the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to tell us that your father was a farmer; and a very ſubſtantial one he muſt have been too, for you ſay that he had dealings with the. London hop-merchants, and mentions his tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nip crops, his wheat, his barley, his peas, &amp;c. moreover, your father was <hi>a very learned man</hi> for his rank (a farmer); he was perfect in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral branches of the mathematics; he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood land ſurveying well, and poſſeſſed <hi>expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience</hi> and <hi>underſtanding.</hi> Theſe ſtories will not do, Peter, for inſtead of raiſing you, as you wiſh, in the eſtimation of the public, they muſt have an effect the very reverſe, becauſe it is
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:030553_0035_0FE7C9DD55127478"/>pretty well known, that farms are not ſo eaſily acquired in England, and to ſtock ſuch a one as you ſay he had would require ſeveral hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds ſterling, conſequently, you muſt have publiſhed a lie, unleſs your father pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured the caſh ſufficient to teach him what you ſay he knew, and ſtock the farm which you ſay he had, by ſome means which you have thought proper to hide from the public.</p>
            <p>You ſay your father worked for <hi>two-pence</hi> a-day, when a boy; now ſuppoſing the did ſo for 8 years, that is, from 8 to 16 years of age, and ſpent nothing during that time, neither on eating nor drinking, clothing nor lodging, at the end he would have had neatly 24l. 4s.</p>
            <p>Having arrived at the age of 16 (which is at leaſt two years before farmer's ſervants receive full wages) I ſhall ſuppoſe he got man's wages, or 6d. a-day, and that he worked at that rate for 8 years more, or till he was aged 24, which, if he lived as I have ſuppoſed he did the firſt 8 years, would amount to 72l. 16s. Thus your father, if he lived the 16 years he was at work <hi>without eating, went naked, and ſlept without other covering than the canopy of Heaven,</hi> would be in poſſeſſion of the ſum of 97l. ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, not one quarter ſufficient to place him in the ſituation you ſay he was; beſides you ſay he ſpent part of his earnings at an evening ſchool, when he attended it he muſt have had a few rags on; to purchaſe them, pay the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's bills, buy books, &amp;c. would require almoſt
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:030553_0036_0FE7C9DEE1BCAC48"/>all his earnings. Now, as your grandfather left nothing of value behind him, how did your father get poſſeſſion of this farm and ſtock; or if he had them not, what did you mean by publiſhing here that he really had them? was you foolith enough to think any one would believe that in England, however cheap things are, a man could acquire ſuch a conſiderable property <hi>honeſtly,</hi> whoſe annual income never amounted, on an average, to <hi>twenty-ſeven dollars.</hi> No, Peter, this is an age of excessive creduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but not juſt ſo bad as you imagine yet.</p>
            <p>"How much better would it have been to have told the naked truth," you ſay your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had property, but how he acquired it you do not mention; your beſt friends muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain ſuſpicions, when they read that part of your hiſtory. If your father, in the early part of his life <hi>made free</hi> with his neighbour's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, till he procured ſufficient to eſtabliſh himſelf as a farmer, you might have mentioned it, it would nor affect <hi>your</hi> character—chieving is not the ſin which the Almighty threatens to viſit the third and fourth generation for; and there is little danger to be apprehended for your relations in England, if you have any, ſeeing you have been ſo faithful to your ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Lord and King.</p>
            <p>You had three brothers you ſay; the eld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt was a <hi>ſoop-keeper</hi>—the ſecond a <hi>farmer,</hi> and the third a ſoldier in the Eaſt-India com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany's ſervice—If you really had a brother a
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:030553_0037_0FE7C9E410D09C78"/>ſhopkeeper, why did you not mention in what town or county he reſided, or what fort of a ſhop he kept.—And your farming brother, where did he reſide; did he occupy your father's farm or not? Had you mentioned theſe things, they would have at leaſt given this ſtory the <hi>appearance</hi> of truth.</p>
            <p>But there is no end to your inconſiſtencies: You ſay your religion was that of the Church of England, to which you have ever remained attached. Now, what is attachment to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion? Is it only <hi>ſaying</hi> you are of that reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or is it a firm adherence to its creed; if it is the latter why do you ſay in another place, that at a particular time you would not have liſted your pen although your <hi>ſalvation had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on it!</hi> or why do you ſay the <hi>name</hi> it bears has attached you to it; if it is the <hi>name</hi> it cannot be the <hi>religion,</hi> for if Unitarianiſm, was to receive that name, by your own words we muſt believe you would become of that religion, and remain firmly attached to it while it was called by that name, although at preſent you affect to execrate its adherents.</p>
            <p>You ſay your <hi>anceſtors</hi> were <hi>never</hi> perſecuted for their religious opinions, and conſequently had not an oportanity of giving ſuch a ſingular proof of their faith as Dr. Franklin's grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, and yet you tell us at the ſame time that you <hi>never heard of any of your anceſtors</hi> prior to your grandfather—ſure in his day there was no perſecution againſt people of his religious
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:030553_0038_0FE7C9E64C171F90"/>opinions in England; but what reliance can we place on any thing you advance in your "Life and Adventures," no man can ſuppoſe you have wrote the <hi>truth,</hi> when they read at its beginning, that, had you been Dr. Franklin, you would not have mentioned ſomething that he has done, becauſe it appears <hi>to you</hi> ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.</p>
            <p>I now come to that place where you men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion your attempts to become ſailor: Here your falſehoods appear really evident; you ſay, that having gone aboard the Pegaſus, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to its captain for leave to remain in the fleet, then lying at Spithead, you was denied; that you afterwards applied to the Port-Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, but could not prevail with him either. When you was writing this account of your life, you ought to have recollected, that the time you mention was near the concluſion of the American war, that it is pretty well known here, that at that time the navy was in greater want of hands than they have been this war; and yet we well know what ſhifts they have been put to to man their fleets—we well know that their preſs-gangs have invaded the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful dwellings of many happy families, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried off their huſbands, fathers, and ſupporters, leaving the mothers and their little ones to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh! —who can then ſuppoſe they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe an able-bodied volunteer. Have they not ſet every ſnare which has been invented to catch the unwary?—I myſelf have ſeen bills
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:030553_0039_0FE7C9EAE5E5C458"/>which called upon youths who were tired of their teacher's or parents' authority—upon apprentices who were tired of their maſters— upon young men, who, <hi>from whatever cauſe,</hi> were tired of their then ſituation—upon debt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors who were dunned by their creditors—or huſbands who had ſcolding wives, to appear at the rendezvous and they ſhould receive great bounties.—Has not every county in Great Britain been obliged to furniſh a certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men both for the army and navy—Nay, have not theſe dregs of ſociety, who command the piratical veſſels of Britain, dragged Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican ſailors from aboard American veſſels to man theſe royal ſlaughter-houſes, forcing them to fight againſt men whom they love, and againſt principles which they adore—Would they then refuſe an able-bodied Engliſh volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teer? —No, Porcupine, had Berkley or Evans, the officers you ſay you applied to, done ſo, they would no longer have held commiſſions under the royal lunatic of England; and if you inſerted this, as an evidence of the <hi>humanity</hi> of Britiſh officers, you have likewiſe miſſed your aim—monuments of their humanity are to be ſeen throughout the United States, and it is the theme of converſation from New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire to Georgia!</p>
            <p>I ſhall paſs over the time you ſay you was a <hi>lawyer,</hi> and meet you a ſecond time, through ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of loyalty, making an attempt to get into the ſervice of your king; and, indeed, it ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:030553_0040_0FE7C9ED96D43918"/>me a good deal to read in your hiſtory, that his Majeſty's officers refuſed you admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion into the ſervice in the time of war, and accepting you immediately on the arrival of peace; I declare it ſtruck me on reading the account, that you may have <hi>wiſhed</hi> to be in your king's ſervice, though <hi>cowardice prevented your entering during the war!</hi> I am juſtified in this ſuppoſition, for the pamphlet of your "Life and Adventures" ſays, you entered into the army, <hi>immediately after peace was declared!</hi> and left it <hi>on the appearance of a war with Spain!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You have, throughout the account of your life and adventures, many touches of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velous —the way you ſay you ſpent your time in Chatham barracks is not the leaſt ſo—you acted differently from any Britiſh ſoldier I ever heard of. Writing a fair hand, you ſay, procured you the <hi>honour</hi> of being copyeſt to Colonel Debieg, but pray how came the commandant of the garriſon to know you wrote a fair hand, or that you could write at all—What, not in all Chatham barracks could be found one, from ſerjeant to fifer, but William Cobbet, who could write a fair hand—a pretty picture, indeed, of the Britiſh army—the commandant of Chatham was obliged to make a young man, whom no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body knew, who had come to the place and enliſted, no one knowing for what reaſon, his confident and his copyeſt. You might have eſcaped the gallows, you might have been the greateſt villain in England, for what Col. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bieg knew. <hi>No, my lad, ſuch ſtories won't do.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="40" facs="unknown:030553_0041_0FE7C9F22F0AF800"/>
            <p>Talking of an affair between the Duke of Richmond and Col. Debieg, you ſay, "it end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the good and gallant colonel being <hi>ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped</hi> of the reward beſtowed on him for his long and meritorious ſervices," and next page tells us, when ſpeaking of the Britiſh army, that "there is no ſituation where merit is ſo ſure to meet with reward." Happy ſituation, indeed, ſo, in the Britiſh' army, merit is rewarded by raiſing the object to a higher ſituation than he could expect, and immediately after <hi>ſtripping him of his reward!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having gone with your regiment to Nova Scotia, continued there 7 years, and returned without any adventure worth noticing, you ſay, at your own requeſt, you was diſcharged; but, good God, of all the wonderful wonders which appear in the courſe of your life, there is none calculated to excite ſo hearty a laugh as the concluding clauſe of a piece you have inſerted in it as your diſcharge from the army: it ſays, "he, in conſideration of <hi>his good beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hior</hi> and the <hi>ſervices</hi> he has rendered the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>is hereby diſcharged!!!</hi>" This is indeed a ſtrange reward for ſervices rendered—Why was you not promoted—"promotion (you ſay) is the reward of merit in the Britiſh army."— No man in his ſober ſenſes would, for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſuppoſe that a diſcharge would be the conſequence of good behavior—No, no, Peter, no man will believe that diſcharge to be au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentic, unleſs they ſee the original, with Lord
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:030553_0042_0FE7C9F473AD0CB8"/>Fitzgerald's ſeal; I would therefore recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to you, for the ſatisfaction of thoſe who <hi>doubt</hi> your veracity, but would be <hi>aſhamed</hi> to be ſeen going into your ſhop, to expoſe the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal in your window.</p>
            <p>How fooliſhly you triumph after producing what you call a copy of your diſcharge—you aſſert that your character was good, and hope it will be looked upon as ſuch, down to 1792, that you <hi>never was whipt for ſtealing!</hi> and calls upon your readers to recollect that the Aurora has ſaid <hi>you wast.</hi> Had you poſſeſſed the leaſt knowledge or penetration, you would have known, that to deny an aſſertion will not prove the negative, and that man is prone to believe an aſſertion the truth of which is barely denied. Not one rogue in a hundred but pleads not guilty, yet his ſaying he is not guilty never ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quits him. Your readers will undoubtedly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue thus, that they know B. F. Bache, who is a reſpectable citizen, and who has publiſhed that Peter Porcupine <hi>was fogged for ſtealing</hi>— that William Cobbet, a man of a very doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful character, who fled from England to France, and there took ſhipping for America, although he could have got it more convenient and much cheaper in his native country, and who ſays he is Peter Porcupine, has denied it—now, which of the two are we to believe, the runnaway ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant-major, whom nobody knows, or Mr. Bache, whom we well know—undoubtedly the latter. But you, Peter, are poſſeſſed of more
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:030553_0043_0FE7C9F9A77A00B8"/>inconteſtible proofs than Mr. Bache can be, if you have been flogged, your back will bear witneſs againſt you, if not, againſt Mr. Bache. I would, therefore, recommend to you, for your character's ſake, to make public exhibition of your naked back, for two market days, on the balcony at the Old Court-houſe; after which no one can doubt, as you will give every one an opportunity to have occular demonſtration of the truth or falſity of Mr. Bache's aſſertion.</p>
            <p>But, having returned to Old England after ſeven year's abſence, and having left the army, ſuch a dutiful child as you were, who has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented your firſt diſobedience from that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to this, ought to have gone to ſee your aged parents or your beloved brothers; but you had forgot them at that time I ſuppoſe— had your 8 year's ſervice in the army really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reft you of every filial feeling. What you ſaid reſpecting your brothers, I ſuppoſed all along was falſe, and that you only inſerted it for the purpoſe of making your family <hi>appear</hi> a little more reſpectable, therefore I am not ſurprized at their being no mention of them on your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. However, being now from the army, where it would be impoſſible to amaſs a ſingle farthing, I would like to know how you was able to procure a change from your regimentals, or to obtain a livelihood—theſe principal things you have omitted—ſhould you ever have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to print a ſecond edition of your life and adventures, but I am much afraid you never
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:030553_0044_0FE7C9FBC5A7F7B0"/>will, do, for your own credit, pay a little at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to theſe remarks.</p>
            <p>To free you from the imputations of <hi>garret-ſcribbling</hi> and <hi>night-work,</hi> you appeal to the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies if you had time, for in the courſe of theſe three months you got married; ſure that would not ſtop you, I have heard often of ſoldiers procuring wives in one night's time.</p>
            <p>After living three months in England on <hi>nothing,</hi> or rather procuring ſubſiſtence for yourſelf and family during that time in an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known manner,</hi> (for you have not aſſurance to ſay you either ſaved money in the army, or married a lady of forturne,) you went to France, and continued ther upwards of ſix months more without doing any thing, which you have <hi>thought proper to publiſh</hi>—pray, did the amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>ſhe-porcupine</hi> accompany you?</p>
            <p>You ſay that <hi>excepting</hi> thoſe who were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready blaſted with the principles of the <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed revolution,</hi> you found the people in in France honeſt, pious, and kind to exceſs; but how can you reconcile this with what almoſt immediately follows, where you ſay that your coming to this country was in conſequence of your having imbibed principles of republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caniſm, and an ambition to become a citizen of theſe free ſtates—You had imbibed notions of republicaniſm ſo early as 1791, yet you called the revolution in France <hi>accurſed,</hi> which at that period, had no other object in view, than ſecuring to the people all the liberty that
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:030553_0045_0FE7CA00EDC4D7B8"/>can be expected under a <hi>limited</hi> monarch. At the period you was in France, and could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeve the change that had took place among the people, in conſequence of their attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the principles of the <hi>accurſea</hi> revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the perſon of the <hi>purjured</hi> Louis was held more ſacred, than that of your beloved ſove-George is at preſent by your beloved country-men—You left England to come to America becauſe the people here enjoyed more liberty than thoſe in Old England, and yet, ſince you have been here, thoſe whoſe wiſdom and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage procured that liberty to America, and thoſe who have attempted to perpetuate it, have been the conſtant objects of your malice and your railery, while the ſame men and ſame government, whoſe every effort was uſed to prevent the independence of theſe ſtates have been the ſubjects of your admiration. Thus we muſt ſuppoſe either that you lied when you ſaid you had imbibed principles of republicaniſm, or that you do not write from principle but for guineas: What, had the Scare-Crow frightened you? Did you expect that a deſerved puniſhment was likely to fall on your <hi>guillotine worthy</hi> head, that you hurried out a pamphlet to ſtop the axe, by publiſhing abroad that "you had imbibed principled of republicaniſm."</p>
            <p>Again you ſay, your determination to ſettle in the United States was formed before you left the army, and as you left the army imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:030553_0046_0FE7CA030F6C5D40"/>on its arrival in England, it muſt have been formed when in Nova-Scotia: Now as you was diſcharged, you ſay, at your <hi>own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,</hi> I ſhould ſuppoſe it would have ſaved you a good deal of money to have <hi>requeſted</hi> your diſcharge in America; it was a curious road to go from Nova-Scotia to the United States by England and France—Had you gone to England for the purpoſe of ſeeing your parents, brothers, or other relations which you ſay you had there, it would have been praiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy; but inſtead of that you make no more mention of them, in this part of your account of your life than if you had never known them. Can I call it an overſight? No, for you have been very careful to mention things which were not of ſuch moment; I muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuppoſe that the account at the beginning of your life was falſe, and that you know not where you was brought up.</p>
            <p>You leſt England becauſe you <hi>heard</hi> the king was dethroned—a tyrant who had been guilty of ſpilling the blood of thouſands, and who had broke the moſt ſolemn engagements; this is unacountable in one who, before that had imbibed the principles of republicaniſm, but tis more unaccountable to hear you who fied from your native country becauſe it was not ſo free as this—who fled from under the protection of the "<hi>beſt of governments,</hi>" from the <hi>limited government</hi> of that ſovereign <hi>madman</hi> whoſe mental "abilities would not fit him for
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:030553_0047_0FE7CA08EF45DA38"/>the office of pariſh conſlable," becauſe you was ambitious of becoming a citizen of this republic, telling that another nation never can be happy but under an abſolute monarchical government.</p>
            <p>Before I leave you, I would juſt wiſh to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what you did in France, Holland, &amp;c. for ſo long a time, and why you did not go to England to take ſhipping, when you deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to leave Europe. Your native country was ſo near, the paſſage ſo much cheaper, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſels for America always ſailing from its various ports, and to have the pleaſure of ſpending a few days amongſt ones country men and friends, would be objects of the firſt magnitude with any one who <hi>durſt</hi> be ſeen in their native land. I therefore am of opinion, that your leaving England <hi>was not a matter of chuce!</hi> but to prevent an interview with certain Bow-ſtreet runners—to return would conſequently be imprudent.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, by your own account, you knew knothing of your anceſtors prior to your grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, who was a day-labonrer, and died as poor as he lived—your father was <hi>a very learned man,</hi> and poſſeſſed an extenſive farm, yet you run off from him to ſerve your king—one of your brothers was a merchant, and one a ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier in the Eaſt India Company's ſervice!— another a farmer, and you a ſoldier in the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh army! from whence you was diſcharged on account of <hi>your ſervices</hi> and <hi>good behaviour!</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="unknown:030553_0048_0FE7CA0B400543A8"/>and then you became as fortunate as your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>, for you got plenty of money <hi>ſecretly.</hi> You yet repent your firſt diſobedience, but did not think proper to viſit your honoured aged parents <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

               </gap>thers, after ſo long an abſence from your native country! After being three months in England, you went to France, continued there ſix months, and then came to America, where you have been four years more, without being employed in any way by which could acquire more than a daily ſubſiſiſience, and yet you have paid 1200 dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars in advance for houſe-rent, and furniſhed your houſe and ſhops, which would at leaſt amount to double that ſum!</p>
            <p>Theſe are ſtrange and unaccountable things, which every man who reads muſt notice.</p>
