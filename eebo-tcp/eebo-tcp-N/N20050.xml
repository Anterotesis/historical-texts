            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>WHEN GOD gave his law to the children of Iſrael at mount Sinai, the ſcene was truly terrible. He deſcended upon the mount in awful pomp and terrible majeſty; with thunders, lightnings and a thick cloud, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; ſo that all the people in the camp trembled, and mount Sinai was altogether on a ſmoke, becauſe the Lord deſcended upon it in fire—and the ſmoke thereof aſcended as the ſmoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly. This is the account Moſes gave of this ſolemn and terrible ſcene, Exod. 19th. The people terrified at the ſight, requeſted that Moſes might be the mouth

of GOD to them for the future, to declare his will; and promiſe obedience, verſe 27 of the context. Go thou near, and hear all that the Lord our GOD ſhall ſay; and ſpeak thou unto us all that the Lord our GOD ſhall ſpeak unto thee, and we will hear it and do it. GOD heard and approved of their propoſal, as is declared verſe 28, I have heard the voice of the words of this people which they have ſpoken unto thee, they have well ſaid all that they have ſpoken.</p>
            <p>BUT he foreſaw the ſaid propenſity of his people to backſlide; and ſeems to lament over them as a people who would revolt to their ruin. But in the text expreſſeth an ardent and pathetic wiſh, that they would be as good as their word, that they would hear and do all that GOD by Moſes ſhould enjoin upon them.—O that there were ſuch an heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, that it might be well with them, and with their children forever.</p>
            <p>FROM the text this truth is obvious—viz—That it is the will of GOD and pleaſing to him, that we earneſtly, diligently and conſtantly ſeek happineſs, by a conſcientious conformity to his requirements. My deſign in attending to this ſubject, is that I may endeavor to vindicate the divine character, againſt the aſperſions of ſuch as ſuggeſt that notwithſtanding the proviſion made for the ſalvation of fallen man, GOD ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

deſigned or deſired the ſalvation of many of them, that a few choſen ones will at all events be ſaved, and the reſt muſt neceſſarily periſh; GOD has from eternity decreed their everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſtruction, and there is no eſcaping—that three fourths of the human race are the objects of this dreadful decree—that Chriſt died only for a few, viz. the elect, and they only can be ſaved; and the reſidue muſt remain objects of divine wrath—That every event that takes place is the conſequence of an abſolute decree, and muſt neceſſarily come to paſs, even all the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed actions of wicked men, as well as the virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and religious actions of good men. What worſe idea can we poſſibly form of any being, than to ſuppoſe an all-powerful creator, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into exiſtence millions of rational agents only to render them miſerable; deſigning that they ſhould be wicked, that he might have the pleaſure of terribly deſtroying them. Let us my brethren never harbour ſuch a thought of an infinitely wiſe, juſt, merciful and good, as well as powerful GOD. That he does not, cannot deſign his rational agents for ſin and miſery, but for holineſs and happineſs, I truſt will preſently be rendered evident.—That a great propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mankind will finally periſh there is great reaſon to fear. That few comparatively attend to the great, the all-important buſineſs of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is a melancholy truth—but this is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is not ſufficient proviſion made for their ſalvation—not becauſe Chriſt did not die
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:026266_0005_0FD0064776130C50"/>
for them—not becauſe Heaven has decreed that they ſhould be wicked perſons, and live in the neglect of GOD and religion; but becauſe they will not comply with the divine propoſals.—Poſſibly it may be objected, it is the decree of Heaven that men ſhould act as they do, and it cannot be otherwiſe—It appears to me ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly blaſphemous thus to make a pure and holy GOD the author of ſin, by ſuggeſting that he can require his creatures to perſue <hi>ſuch</hi> a mode of conduct, and yet by an abſolute decree lay them under a fatal neceſſity of diſobeying him, and then terribly puniſh them for ſuch diſobedience—Shocking thought! That the people of GOD are a choſen people, will not be diſputed—they are frequently called ſo in ſcripture—I ſhall mention but one text out of many that might be quoted to this purpoſe, 1 Peter, ii, 9. But ye are a choſen generation, a royal prieſthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people, that ye ſhould ſhew forth the praiſes of him who hath called you out of darkneſs into his marvellous light. The doctrine of election is often mentioned in ſcripture, and therefore ſhould be conſidered as a doctrine of chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: but the preciſe ſenſe in which it is to be underſtood, has been always matter of doubt and diſpute among the greateſt and beſt men; and perhaps, the higheſt angel in heaven, does not fully comprehend the ſubject—On a matter ſo nice and intricate, it ſurely becomes ſuch ſhort-ſighted creatures as we are, to think and ſeek
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:026266_0006_0FD006485F8CD3F8"/>
ſpeak modeſtly and with great caution—and ever cultivate great charity toward ſuch as think differently from us, on a matter which none of us can decide—and whatever ſcheme we adopt, ſurely we ſhould ever guard againſt one that ſhall imply any imperfection in the great and glorious GOD—And there can be no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty in concluding that that is wrong which repreſents him as an hard maſter, an unjuſt and cruel being, requiring impoſſibilities of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and puniſhing them eternally for not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming them—This is a character of him ſo contrary to reaſon, and that given of him in the ſacred writings; that we ought to reject that ſcheme which implies it. It is rational to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a perfect being, poſſeſt of every thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable and excellent, every thing to render him lovely in the eyes of his rational agents; and in the moſt endearing light do the ſcriptures ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit the character of the glorious GOD; as an infinitely wiſe, holy, juſt, good, kind, compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate being—conſulting the good of his ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal creatures like a tender father; yea, with a compaſſion infinitely greater than the moſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der earthly parents exerciſe toward their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
            <p>THAT ſcheme of divinity therefore which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents this gloriouſly compaſſionate being, as rendering the ruin of his creatures neceſſary cannot be of GOD, and ought to be rejected with abhorrence?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:026266_0007_0FD00649C92B5DC8"/>THE doctrine of the decrees, I think ſhould be numbered among thoſe things which the Apoſtle Peter mentions in his 2d Epiſtle 3 chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at the 16th verſe—as contained in Paul's E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles, hard to be underſtood, which they that are unlearned and unſtable wreſt unto their own deſtruction. Concerning things which are hard to be underſtood, it muſt be improper to aſſert dogmatically.</p>
            <p>THE doctrine of Election has been ſadly abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the diſhonor of GOD, and the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury of mankind; rendering ſome ſecure and throwing others into great diſtreſs. When the man who has no reliſh for the great buſineſs of religion, is called upon to attend to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of the ſoul, to quiet his conſcience while he indulgeth himſelf in iniquity, he will object and ſay, it is doubtful whether I am elected or not; if I am elected I ſhall certainly be ſaved, I need not give myſelf any concern about the matter. If I am not elected, I ſhall inevitably be damned; and it will be to no purpoſe, to make any attempt to obtain ſalvation. This is a ſubtil wile of the Devil to keep men ſecure in his ſervice, and in this way they ſometimes rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon themſelves out of religion—becauſe they have no heart to engage in it. On the other hand, it is ſometimes the caſe that thoſe who are earneſtly and diligently ſeeking the face and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of GOD, are greatly diſtreſſed through fear that they are not of the number of GOD's elect
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:026266_0008_0FD0064B4DED79B8"/>
—and therefore ſhall finally periſh. Thus Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan worries thoſe whom he cannot deſtroy.</p>
            <p>THE man who lives a life of rebellion againſt GOD has certainly no claim to happineſs; no reaſon to look upon himſelf one of GOD's cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen ones—but he who lives like a chriſtian, a life of faith and obedience to our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, has no reaſon to fear that he ſhall miſs of ſalvation. We need not worry ourſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout election if we are poſſeſſed of the character and temper of chriſtians, he that is holy will be happy. Let me obſerve farther, reaſon and religion dictate that GOD governs the world agreeable to ſome wiſe and good plan; and it is equally evident that he has made us rational agents. Our buſineſs is, not to inquire into the ſecret counſels of heaven; but to labour to know and do the revealed will of heaven; in this way ſhall we make our calling and election ſure, this is what is pleaſing to GOD, and this is the way to ſecure our own eternal happineſs.</p>
            <p>THIS is the truth ſuggeſted in the text, and which I ſhall endeavor to eſtabliſh you in the belief of, viz. that it is the will of GOD and pleaſing to him that his rational creatures dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently and conſtantly ſeek happineſs by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with his propoſals. GOD has made us capable of happineſs; has given us ſtrong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires after it. Thoſe deſires are therefore law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: and he has amply provided for ſatisfying them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:026266_0009_0FD0064D332B9C00"/>IF it be inquired on what terms we may be happy, I anſwer, by a conſcientious compliance with the goſpel, by faith in and obedience to the dear redeemer, this is what GOD requires of all who enjoy goſpel light and privileges—this he has made the condition on which we may and ſurely ſhall be happy—and it certainly is his will and pleaſing to him that we ſeek and ſerve him in this way. The words of the text if du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attended to muſt put the matter out of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute—<q>O that there were ſuch an heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments always; that it might be well with them, and with their children forever.</q>
            </p>
            <p>ARE theſe the words of him who by a fatal decree has made the wickedneſs and ruin of mankind neceſſary? Would he as it were la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that his people would be miſerable through their own folly; and expreſs an ardent wiſh that they would do as they had ſaid; would be in all things obedient, that it might be well with them? Thoſe words were ſpoken by the great GOD himſelf, who muſt mean as he ſaid—It would be blaſphemous to doubt of his ſincerity.</p>
            <p>HE is a GOD who cannot lie, and is under no poſſible temptation to ſay one thing while he means another. Therefore when he expreſſeth his wiſh that his people would be virtuous and religious, that they might be happy; there can be no reaſonable doubt that it is his ſincere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire

fire that they comply with his will; that they may ſecure to themſelves the bleſſings of this life, and that to come. And it muſt be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, wicked and blaſphemous to ſuggeſt that he has by a decree rendered it neceſſary for them to purſue a contrary mode of conduct.</p>
            <p>THAT GOD wills the happineſs of his ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al agents is probable by a great variety of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.—This may be argued,</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. FROM the goodneſs and benevolence of his nature. He is the fountain of goodneſs—goodneſs in the abſtract. We have all poſſible e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence that GOD is good, not only from the character he has given of himſelf; but from daily and hourly experience, it is his glory that he is unboundedly good. When Moſes put up this petition, I beſeech thee ſhew me thy glory. The Lord anſwered, I will cauſe all my good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to paſs before thee; and proclaimed his name the Lord, the Lord GOD merciful and gracious, forgiving iniquity, tranſgreſſion and ſin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We are all witneſſes for GOD, that he is good. He diſpenſeth his ſavors liberally and promiſeuouſly to the wicked and prophane as well as to the virtuous and holy; cauſeth his fun to riſe and ſhine on the evil and on the good. And ſendeth rain on the unjuſt as well as on the juſt. Surely this infinitely good being who is kind to the evil and unthankful, cannot will the miſeries of his creatures without great and juſt cauſe; it is contrary to his nature to be cruel or unkind.

Therefore he never can by a decree render the wickedneſs and miſery of mankind neceſſary— but his goodneſs muſt incline and diſpoſe him to promote the proſperity and happineſs of his rational agents in all proper ways. Therefore it is pleaſing to him when we take a proper care of ourſelves by purſuing the road leading to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2d. THIS is evident becauſe his glory is in a ſenſe connected with the happineſs of his intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent creatures—we do him the greateſt honor, when we purſue ſuch a mode of conduct as tends moſt to our comfort and felicity. It is a ſelf-evident truth, that GOD made man to honor and ſerve him; and this qualifies him for hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in the enjoyment of him; is he not pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when men make it their care to anſwer the end for which he gave them being? Is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble but he ſhould be diſpleaſed when they do what in them lies, to fruſtrate his deſigns?</p>
            <p n="3">3d. SUCH a mode of conduct as infinite wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom dictates as honorary to GOD and happy for man is infinitely wiſe and good in itſelf, the law of GOD is holy, and the commandment ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and juſt and good, a conſciencious conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to it therefore as it is happy for man, ſo it muſt be pleaſing to GOD.</p>
            <p n="4">4th. THAT GOD wills the ſalvation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and is pleaſed when we ſeek happineſs by
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:026266_0012_0FD0065BDA9A8430"/>
complying with his divine propoſals is evident, from a conſideration of the ample proviſion he has made for our ſalvation. He made man up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right and completely happy. Withheld no good thing from him, but the uſe of one tree, this he prohibited his meddling with for a trial of his obedience, threatned death if he diſobeyed. But alas! this did not reſtrain him; he finned and introduced into the world miſery and death.—Now my brethren, had GOD delighted in the death of ſinners, he would have ſuddenly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed thoſe revolters from his government; would ſuddenly have involved them in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction which is the juſt demerit of ſin: But ſaid mercy how ſhall I give him up! accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly a gracious plan was revealed, for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery. This did not imply any change of mind in the great GOD: but was agreeable to the plan which lay in the divine mind, from all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, on foreſight of the fall of man; nor does it imply the leaſt abatement of his deteſtation of ſin, or mitigation of the puniſhment threatened: for though the offender eſcaped the immediate effects of divine vengeance; yet ſin was not pardoned without a ſatisfaction; and it was ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly puniſhed in the perſon of the glorious ſon of GOD, who appeared as ſurety for ſinful man, our glorious Lord laid down his life to ranſom man from deſtruction. Now is it rational to ſuppoſe that GOD would give his dear ſon to die for ſinners, and not be pleaſed to have them receive him as their ſavior, truſting in him for
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:026266_0013_0FD0065EDA482258"/>
pardon and eternal life? But the objector will ſay (perhaps) Chriſt died only for the elect, a ſmall proportion of mankind, but is this the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of ſcripture? It has been often ſaid. It is certainly worth while to inquire whether ſuch a doctrine is contained in the ſacred writings. I confeſs I know no paſſage of ſcripture which repreſents our bleſſed Lord as having died only for a few: but many which declare the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry—He has indeed ſaid, Matthew vii—14. ſtrait is the gate, and narrow is the way leading unto life; and few there be that find it. That many are called but few choſen, Matthew xx, 16. But it by no means follows from hence that he did not die to render ſalvation poſſible to all—But theſe paſſages intimate how awfully prone man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind are to abuſe the riches of divine goodneſs: neglect the things which belong to their ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting peace.</p>
            <p>THE Apoſtle repreſents our Lord as having taſted death for every man—Heb. ii, 9. we ſee Jeſus who was made a little lower than the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels for the ſuffering of death crowned with glory and honor, that he by the grace of GOD ſhould taſte death for every man.</p>
            <p>1 JOHN ii, 2. AND he is the propitiation for our ſins, and not for ours only, but alſo for the ſins of the whole world—The Apoſtle Paul fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently mentions his dying for all. II Cor. v, 14. We thus judge, if one died for all (which is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for granted) then were all dead, I Tim. ii, 6,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:026266_0014_0FD0066041B5AEE0"/>
Who gave himſelf a ranſom for all. And in the 5th to the Romans, the Apoſtle repreſents the recovery by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as extenſive as the ruin by Adam, verſe 18, as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men unto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation: even ſo by the righteouſneſs of one the free gift came upon all men unto juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of life. It is exceeding unnatural to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that by the firſt all men are meant, all the deſcendants from Adam, and by the latter only a few of them both muſt be underſtood preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the ſame ſenſe, to mean the whole human race ruined in Adam and recovered by Chriſt. Can any thing be more arbitrary than to ſay he taſted death for every man of the elect. He died for all men of the elect. Is not this an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth unnatural and forced conſtruction of theſe ſcriptures?</p>
            <p>I SEE no neceſſity of concluding from thoſe texts with the UNIVERSALISTS, that all men will be finally happy. I am far from this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, nor, do I believe that the Apoſtles deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to convey this idea; but that our Lord by his death brought all mankind into a ſalvable ſtate, and that any miſs of happineſs will be their own fault, and not becauſe Chriſt did not die for them—ſeeing GOD has made this proviſion for the ſalvation of all men it muſt be his will that we accept of his ſon: and it muſt be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd indeed to ſuppoſe he ſhould by a fatal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree prevent it.</p>

            <p>THESE gracious words of the GOD of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael give us the ſulleſt aſſurance that this glorious and compaſſionate being delights not in the ſin and ruin of his rational creatures; much leſs has he made ſin and miſery neceſſary by a fatal decree. And yet this is the doctrine of ſome.

But a merciful GOD has revealed his kind purpoſe of ſalvation to fallen man, and has aſſured us in the text and elſewhere, that it is highly pleaſing to him that his rational agents comply with his propoſals, and thus ſecure their own happineſs.

            <p n="5">5th. HE tenders ſalvation to all where the goſpel comes—makes a general offer of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of the new covenant, viz. pardon of ſin, ſanctifying grace, every thing that is beſt in this world and eternal glory hereaſter—ſee Iſaiah 55, beginning, Ho! every one that thirſteth come ye to the waters; and he that hath no money, come ye buy and eat; yea come, buy wine and milk without money and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out price. Wherefore do ye ſpend your money for that which is not bread, and your labor for that which ſatisfieth not? Hearken diligently unto me, and cat ye that which is good, and let
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:026266_0018_0FD0066CA69D8B38"/>
your ſoul delight itſelf in fatneſs, incline your car and come unto me; hear and your ſoul ſhall live, and I will make an everlaſting covenant with you, even the ſure mercies of David, verſes 6 and 7, ſeek ye the Lord while he may be found—call ye upon him while he is near, let the wicked forſake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him return unto the Lord and he will have mercy upon him: and to our GOD, for he will abundantly pardon.</p>
            <p>Is the great and glorious GOD ſincere in this gracious invitation, or is all pretence and mockery of miſerable ſinners expoſed to rain? O let us ſtart at the blaſphemous thought, that an infinitely perfect being can be capable of ſuch ſolemn trifling. And yet we muſt believe him capable of this, if we can ſuppoſe that he would give this general invitation to ſinners to come to him and be happy; would urge them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain and again, reaſon the caſe with them, expoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate with them on the folly of trifling with the moſt important concerns, and make ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to them of pardon and bleſſedneſs if they would fulfil the condition, when he in fact de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned no ſuch thing with reſpect to many, but it was his original plan that they ſhould be wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked &amp; periſh forever. Let us never harbour ſuch a thought of the greateſt, the wiſeſt, the kindeſt and the beſt of beings; who has declared that he does not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children

of men—Execution of judgments upon his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies is called his ſtrange work.—Iſaiah 28, 21.</p>
            <p>I SHALL mention one more general invitation to ſinners to return to GOD that they might be happy, which proves beyond all contradiction, that none are cut off from this great privilege, a chance for ſalvation by a decree of heaven.— Revelation xxii, 17, The ſpirit and the bride ſay come, and let him that heareth ſay come; and let him that is athirſt come, and whoſoever will let him take of the water of life freely.—As GOD cannot be deceived and will not be mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſo he will not deceive and mock his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures—as he has therefore made ſuch proviſion for the happineſs of mankind, and ſo kindly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited them to accept of it; it muſt be pleaſing to him when we comply with his kind and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious propoſals; earneſtly, diligently and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſeek the Lord while he may be found, and call upon him while he is near; while it is an accepted time and day of ſalvation.—Beſide,</p>
            <p n="6">6th. HE has commanded all men every where <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> repent. Is it poſſible but he ſhould be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with obedience to his requirements? The Apoſtle Peter declares 2d Peter, iii, 9—that the Lord is long ſuffering, not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Was Peter miſtaken? Did he under the influence of the holy ghoſt commit a groſs
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:026266_0020_0FD006745CE8AE38"/>
error to writing? if not, GOD is pleaſed when any of his rational agents devote themſelves to his fear and ſervice, and thus ſecure his favor, which is life, and his loving kindneſs which is better than life.</p>
            <p n="7">7th. HE ſent his miniſters to proclaim ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to the world, and invite ſinners in his name to accept it on his terms—go teach all nations, preach the goſpel to every creature, teaching them to obſerve all things whatſoever I have commanded you—this was the purport of the commiſſion given the apoſtles by their divine Lord. Was it a matter of indifference in his view, whether the hearers of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel embraced it or not—he has given us all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible evidence to the contrary. He has by the moſt gracious promiſes endeavored to allure ſinners to embrace chriſtianity and live as it teaches—promiſes a great, a compleat ſalvation to him that believeth; but paints in moſt ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing colours the danger of neglecting ſo great ſalvation—he that believeth not ſhall be damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhall be baniſhed forever from the preſence of the Lord into a lake of fire and brimſtone, prepared for the devil and his angels. Where is the equity of this, if Chriſt died but for very few, and the reſt are cut off from all poſſibility of complying with the goſpel and obtaining e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life, by a dreadful decree of reprobation?</p>

the ruin of ſinners ſimply conſidered, Ezek. 33, 11, ſay unto them, as I live faith the LORD GOD (becauſe he could ſwear by none greater, than himſelf) as I live, I have no pleaſure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live—and adds this gracious exhortation and expoſtulation; turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways, why will ye die O houſe of Iſrael? ſhall we diſpute the word and the oath of GOD? ſhall we have the effrontory to ſay contrary to what he has ſolemnly ſworn? that he does delight in the death of the wicked; that he has made their impenitency and ruin the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful effect of an abſolute decree.</p>
            <p n="9">9th. HE is uſing all proper means with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to influence them to religion, and prevent their deſtruction, exhorting, warning, counſell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them; yea, by his miniſters beſeeching them to repent and turn to him, that their ſouls may live.

Our Lord lamented the blindneſs, obſtinacy and impenitency of Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, Luke 13, 34—O Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem, which killeſt the prophets and ſtoneſt them that are ſent unto thee; how often would I have ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered thy children together as a hen doth ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther her brood under her wings and ye would not; behold your houſe is left unto you deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late. Chap. 19, 41-42—when he was come near he beheld the city and wept over it, ſaying, if thou hadſt known, even thou, at leaſt in this thy day, the things which belong to thy peace! but now they are hidden from thine eyes. All this ſhews that he delighteth not in the death of ſinners—that their deſtruction is not owing to any want of due care in the great GOD to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it, much leſs is it the neceſſary conſequence of his decree; but of their own careleſs, ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful negligence, horrid propenſity to iniquity, and ſad abuſe of moſt important privileges. I ſhall only add</p>
            <p n="10">10th. That it is the will of GOD and pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him we ſeek happineſs, by a compliance with his gracious propoſals—and that he has put no bar in the way to our obtaining the great end of religion, the ſalvation of our ſouls—but
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:026266_0023_0FD0067A8612A448"/>
deſires us to improve well the price in our hands to get wiſdom. </p>
            <p>ALL this is evident from this conſideration, viz. That thoſe who finally miſs of happineſs will be conſidered forever inexcuſeable—every mouth will be ſtopped—they will have no plea to make in bar of the execution of divine ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance—but be expoſed to aggravated punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in proportion as they have enjoyed and miſimproved great privileges. But how can this be juſt, if it is a fact that all who are finally impenitent are ſo in conſequence of a divine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree: if the great governor of the world deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to be eternal monuments of his ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, and created them for this end—if this is the caſe, then Chriſt did not die for them: no proviſion has been made for their happineſs; they have not miſimproved great privileges, for they never enjoyed any—and may, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accuſed of impudently replying againſt GOD, offer this plea, viz. that they had no chance for ſalvation, that Chriſt did not die to ſave them—that GOD did not deſign nor deſire them to be virtuous and happy—that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be juſtly accuſed of, and puniſhed for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting a Saviour, when none was provided for them—that the means of grace were never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for their uſe, and there was no poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that they ſhould be benefited by them—for it was from eternity decreed that that they ſhould be wicked and miſerable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:026266_0024_0FD0067D8DA6FEC0"/>BUT my brethren this is a doctrine contrary to godlineſs—We have from the ſacred writings every aſſurance, that a gracious GOD pitied ruined man and provided amply for his reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. To this end ſent his ſon to die, not for a few only, but for the whole human race; to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſalvation poſſible to every ſon and daughter of Adam, if they could be prevailed with to act like rational agents, and though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny will be ſo unhappy as to neglect and miſs of this great ſalvation, and ſink into aggravated and moſt dreadful deſtruction for ſuch neglect: yet it will not be becauſe GOD has decreed their ſin and miſery; nor becauſe he is oppoſed to their happineſs. For we have the fulleſt proof that he is the Lord GOD, merciful and gracious, ſlow to anger, forgiving iniquity, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion and ſin. So good a GOD never could create and deſign ſo noble a rank of beings for ſin and miſery, but for holineſs and happineſs— muſt be pleaſed with the virtuous and holy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they bear his image—and becauſe they purſue a mode of conduct good and fit in itſelf. In his word he has given us the fulleſt aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his willingneſs to ſave ſinners—In that he has provided himſelf a lamb, his dear ſon to take away the ſins of the world, by a ſacrifice of himſelf; who has done and ſuffered every thing neceſſary to this important end. He has propogated his goſpel at one time or another through the world; nothing can be more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral than the offer it makes of ſalvation by our
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:026266_0025_0FD006838B00B238"/>
Lord Jeſus Chriſt. The invitation which is given in theſe general terms, Whoſover will, let him come, and him that cometh (ſaid our Lord) I will in no wiſe caſt out.</p>
            <p>HE hath commanded all men every where to repent; yea beſeeches them to be reconciled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to GOD.</p>
            <p>HE has declared and ſworn that he is not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to repentance. That he has no pleaſure in the death of the wicked, but that he turn from his way and live; and to effect this uſes a variety of means and arguments to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with men to comply with his gracious ſcheme—laments over fallen men that they are ſo little influenced by ſuch motives, but chooſe the road to death. Ruſh down to deſtruction through the arms of mercy—calls after them, urges them to flee for their lives—reaſons the caſe with them—why will ye die?—Wherefore do ye ſpend your money for that which is not bread? Why will you purſue vanity and trifles, and neglect the moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant concerns? Commands, promiſeth, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens, all to the ſame end to prevail with men to adopt his ſcheme—that they may be happy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, in the enjoyment of him. But I need not dwell longer on a ſubject ſo plain—I think every impartial inquirer muſt be ſatisfied that it is the will of GOD and pleaſing to him, that we ſeek happineſs in the way he has pointed out
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:026266_0026_0FCF4B2CA8C0C8F8"/>
—viz. by conſcientious compliance with the goſpel? That it muſt be unreaſonable to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that a gracious GOD would make ſuch proviſion at infinite expenſe for the ſalvation of mankind, and have no deſign, no deſire that they ſhould generally adopt his gracious plan, and obtain an intereſt in the purchaſed ſalvation—yea deſign and decree the contrary—and yet at the ſame time declare that he takes no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the death of the wicked, but that they turn and live, and lament that they will fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly turn a deaf ear to his calls and ruſh down to deſtruction. What an idea does ſuch a ſcheme give us of the great GOD, as a moſt deceitful and trifling being imaginable.</p>
            <p>O MY brethren, let us reject with abhorrence a ſcheme ſo diſhonorary to GOD, and injurious to men, and believe a GOD of truth when he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures us that he is not willing that any ſhould periſh, but all ſhould come to repentance.</p>
            <p>BUT it may be objected, many will finally pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, notwithſtanding all the care GOD has ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for their ſalvation; is this agreeable to his plan? Or is he fruſtrated in his deſigns, deſires and expectations? I know of no way to evade or obviate this objection, but to conſider that GOD has made and deals with men as free a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents—He made man though he foreſaw that he would ſin againſt him and deſtroy himſelf— But this opened the way for an aſtoniſhing and
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:026266_0027_0FD0068582FD1748"/>
glorious diſplay of the divine perfections, in the plan of redemption by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt— hence mercy and truth have met together, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and peace have kiſſed each other.</p>
            <p>HE thus provided for the ſalvation of his creatures, though he foreknew that multitudes would act an unreaſonable and wicked part; would ſin againſt light, would reject the ſavior, and neglect his religion; would abuſe the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of divine goodneſs, and treaſure up unto themſelves wrath againſt the day of wrath, and the revelation of the righteous judgment of GOD. It cannot be doubted that he foreknew all this and probably determined not to prevent it. But this by no means implies any compliance upon the creature, much leſs any decree, making ſuch a wicked conduct neceſſary. This is ſo inconſiſtant with the divine character, that ſuch a thought ſhould never be indulged—nor does the the divine fore-knowledge of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable part mankind would act imply that it was not his will that they ſhould do better; ſhould be virtuous and happy. The truth is, he ever deals with mankind as what they are, not mere machines but moral agents, rational and accountable creatures, and this neceſſarily implies freedom. No man can be accountable for an action which he is compelled to do, GOD (as we have ſeen) provided for the ſalvation of the children of men, revealed in his word, his kind and gracious deſign, propoſed the terms of

reconciliation! furniſhed us with all neceſſary means, promiſed all neceſſary aids to thoſe that aſk them—urges us by every motive to come up to his terms—and having thus ſet before us life and death, leaves it to our choice, whether we will be virtuous and happy, or wicked and miſerable—But expreſſes his ardent wiſh that we would chooſe wiſely. O that there were ſuch an heart &amp;c. But though ſinners will fruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate his kind purpoſes reſpecting themſelves, his perfect fore-knowledge of events prevents all diſappointment, and he who is ſelf-exiſtent and independant, who is happy, compleatly and eternally happy in and of himſelf, can not be made unhappy by the folly and wickedneſs and miſery of his creatures. On the whole, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doubt my hearers, if you have duly attended to the declarations in ſcripture, that GOD is ready to pardon, juſtify and ſave ſinners, that he takes no pleaſure in their death, &amp;c. That they amount to a demonſtration in your minds that a good GOD wills your ſalvation, if you can be made willing to accept it on the moſt eaſy and reaſonable terms poſſible; and is it not ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that any ſhould be unwilling? Surely you all deſire happineſs, no man can deliberately conſent to be miſerable, have you any doubt whether there is ſufficient proviſion made for your ſpiritual and eternal well-being? What could GOD have done more, to ſecure your fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity conſiſtently with dealing with you as men, than he has done. The purchaſe is made, a

mighty ſavior who ſaves to the uttermoſt all that come to GOD by him, tenders a great, a compleat ſalvation to you, and urges it upon you. Indulges you with his word, his ſabbaths his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances; calls upon you by conſcience, by his word, his miniſters, his providences, ſtrives with you by his ſpirit; does not ſuddenly cut ſinners down as cumberers of the ground when they contradict and rebel, and treat him with neglect and contempt, waits to be gracious, ſeems loth to deſtroy them, ſurely, ſinners the queſtion may be put to you with emphaſis. Why will ye die? What reaſon can you aſſign why you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect GOD and religion. The word of GOD declares that he is not willing that any ſhould periſh, it is evident that nothing is wanting on his part. The fault then muſt be our own, if we miſs of ſalvation. Are his terms unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? Is it unreaſonable that we ſhould forſake our ſins, which our conſciences condemn; and live a virtuous and holy life, purſue ſuch a mode of conduct as heaven and earth will approve of? Is it unreaſonable that the glorious ſon of GOD who yielded to death to ranſom us from deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhould be the object of our love, truſt and obedience? O that there might ever be ſuch an heart in us that we might not be anxious about thoſe ſecret things which belong to GOD, but believe and practice thoſe which he has revealed—always cultivate ſuch an holy fear of him as ſhall influence us to keep his commandments, that it may be well with us and our children forever.</p>
