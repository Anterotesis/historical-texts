            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb n="4" facs="unknown:007193_0003_102B360633B7E9F8"/>this Text. The Words are <hi>Solomon's,</hi> who was not only an indefatigable Student of Nature, but an accurate Obſerver of divine Providence, of the Conduct of Men, and the ſeveral Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of Actions, divine and human. He here tells us the Reſult of his Reſearches reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe. As to <hi>Providence,</hi> that though God has a ſpecial Regard to the Holy and Good; yet in external Things he makes no Difference; but <hi>all Things come alike to all.</hi> As to <hi>Mankind,</hi> that they take Occaſion from theſe promiſcuous Diſpenſations to commit Wickedneſs without Reſerve: <hi>Their Heart is full of Evil:</hi> for they obſerve, that <hi>ſuch as work Wickedneſs are ſet up, and they who tempt God are even delivered.</hi> Mal. iii. 15. This has ſometimes been puzzling to the Pious, but has ſtruck the Ungodly with Madneſs. Hence it comes that <hi>Madneſs is in their Heart while they live.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Madneſs</hi> is a State of Irregularity and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſure. The Perſon affected with it, is not fixed in his Purpoſe; is not influenced in his Conduct by the moſt engaging Motives; pays no Regard to the Dictates of right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; nor is careful about what is decorous, profitable, diſadvantageous, or dangerous.</p>
            <p>Now we are aſſured, by unerring Truth, that this is the State of the <hi>Sons of Men.</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:007193_0004_102B362461034B40"/>'Tis true, they make high Pretences to Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and have a Shew of it; but <hi>the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of this World is Fooliſhneſs with God.</hi> 1. Cor. iii. 19. If Madneſs were concealed in the Heart we could not diſcover it: But <hi>out of the Abundance of the Heart the Mouth ſpeaketh;</hi> Matth. xii. 34. and ſo by Men's Words and Actions we come to know what is in their Hearts. Hence, a Courſe of Life, contrary to right Reaſon, and juſt Rules of Conduct, will evidence Heart-Madneſs.</p>
            <p>In treating this Subject, I am naturally led to ſhew wherein the Madneſs of human Hearts diſcovers itſelf. This cannot be done, but by mentioning particular Inſtances of human Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.</p>
            <p>And as I apprehend, that the Method of ſuch a Narration is in a great Meaſure arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, I ſhall not attempt a nice Arrangement of the general Heads in natural Order; but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them as they occur. And,</p>
            <p n="1">I. Precipitant Concluſions concerning Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Things, or Opinions, formed without Evidence, and often in Defiance of Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration to the contrary, diſcover a Degree of Madneſs. The Croud of Mankind determine the moſt important Points, without weighing
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:007193_0005_102B3607D137AB48"/>the Reaſons on both Sides of the Queſtion. In their own Imagination they quickly pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate Matters, which to the more Judicious are abſtruſe and intricate. If they embrace Truth, it is by Accident. They contend not for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, becauſe they ſee its proper Evidence; but becauſe they have been accuſtomed to it: And thus they may be orthodox and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Chriſtians, from no better Principles than thoſe from which the <hi>Turks</hi> are <hi>Mahometans,</hi> Nay, they form their Judgment of Religion, the higheſt Concern of all, with more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference than of the ſmall Affairs of this Life. From hence ariſe the many ſottiſh Opinions, wild Reveries, and deſtructive Hereſies, that paſs for pure Religion with their reſpective Votaries, divide the chriſtianized World into ſo many oppoſite Parties, are contended for with a Peremptorineſs that knows not to yield to Argument, and promoted frequently with a bitter, ſometimes with a bloody, Zeal. What intelligent Chriſtian is there, who, without a Mixture of Pity and Contempt, can obſerve the <hi>Profeſſors of Wiſdom become Fools?</hi> Rom. i. 22. Hear the Dictates of eternal Wiſdom pronounced Folly, with a ſupercilious Air? and fanciful Chimeras ſubſtituted in its Room? It would ſeem as though the Faculty of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning was, to many, given in vain; while one aſſerts the <hi>Uſeleſneſs</hi> of it in Religion,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:007193_0006_102B3625ECCA08B0"/>another its <hi>Sufficiency,</hi> in our lapſed State. This denies the Neceſſity of any divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation; that aſſerts, every Circumſtance muſt be immediately revealed. One thinks Saving Grace conſiſts in moral Honeſty, another places it in the Obſervation of invented Forms. One is a Libertine, who fancies he ſerves GOD while he gratifies his Luſts; another is ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious, and thinks to pleaſe <hi>him</hi> by monkiſh Auſterities. One is content with a dead Faith, which neither <hi>purifies the Heart,</hi> nor <hi>works by Love;</hi> another is perſuaded he ſhall be ſaved by his good Works, though imperfect, without Faith in the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt. This lays the whole Streſs on orthodox Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; that thinks it indifferent what we believe. Some doubt not their Safety, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are of ſuch a particular religious Denomination; others are of Opinion, that all Denominations ſtand alike fair for Salvation. Here is a Bigot who eſteems every Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in Religion to be eſſential, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he believes to be right and true muſt be a Term of Communion; there is a Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinarian whoſe Religion has little or nothing in it that is important, or worthy to be ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly contended for. Here unaffecting Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation is triumphant; there Ignorance is the Mother of Devotion. Here Religion is dreſſed in gaudy Attire, with <hi>Jewiſh</hi> worldly Pomp,

                   rendition="simple:additions"/>inſomuch that its firſt Inſtitution is hardly at all diſcernable; there the pure external Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of God himſelf are rejected with Scorn, from a ſwoln Conceit of Spirituality. Now all theſe contradictory Parties will be equally ſtiff and poſitive in their Notions; yet are all equally extravagant and monſtrous: all oppoſite to divine Revelation, and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Things. And are all theſe, O my Soul! are <hi>all theſe</hi> the rational Sons of Men! Are all theſe <hi>ſure</hi> they are wiſe! Can Truth, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Truth, be a Syſtem—a <hi>Syſtem</hi> did I ſay? a <hi>Heap</hi> of Dotages! Can Reaſon, ſtrict Reaſon, approve Contradictions! or rather, muſt we not aſſuredly conclude, that <hi>Madneſs is in their Heart while they live?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor ſhall we find more Wiſdom in their Judgment of Men than of Things. They conclude of Characters in the Lump: can hardly ſee any thing amiable and good where ſome Things diſpleaſe; nor are Blemiſhes apt to be diſguſtful where ſome good Qualities ſhine. Superficial Defects hide ſubſtantial Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies from the vulgar Eye; whilſt the Abſence of all valuable Accompliſhments is eaſily ſuppoſed by meer Sound, and empty Show. Wiſdom and Virtue, meanly cloathed, are deſpiſed; whilſt Ignorance and Vice, dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in Purple, are honoured. An eaſy Air and genteel Addreſs, often recommend Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe,

Even learned Criticks do ſometimes defend the very Abſurdities of a favourite Author; and cenſure what is truly ſublime in another. Whole Communities, nay, whole Nations, like under the Cenſure which belongs only to a Part, and, perhaps, a ſmall Part of them.

            <p n="3">III. Many appear to have falſe Views of what is advantageous, or hurtful; and draw falſe Inferences from Actions and Event. In how ſtrange a Light do they look on ſtrict Piety, who diſdain it as mean, or avoid it as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant; and how come the Paths of Sin to appear honourable and bliſsful? Religious Perſons, and ſpiritual Converſation, are by many ſhunned as though they were dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, while the Looſe and Profane are choſen for Companions, as though they were moſt ſafe. They are not afraid to violate the Laws of God; yet they dread his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Vengeance. Hell is their Terror, Sin their Sport and Entertainment. They tremble at the Effect, yet delight in its proper
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:007193_0011_102B360EC9700FB8"/>Cauſe. But how abſurd is it, mentally to ſeparate Miſery from Sin, when they can never be ſeparated in Fact? The eternal Reaſon of Things has made their Connexion inviolable.</p>
            <p>What falſe Apprehenſions have many of their own Caſes? The Aged and Infirm think of Years to come, and hence defer their intended Preparation for Death. The Drunkard never knows his Capacity, but thinks he may ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly venture to take the other Glaſs: nor does the covetous Miſer ever judge truly of his Neceſſity; and therefore lives poor in the Midſt of Plenty.</p>
            <p>Every Occurrence is perverted. The Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of GOD, which would ſeem ſufficient to me<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

If he gives to ſome Abundance of worldly Wealth, they uſe it as though it were a Licence given them to indulge Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs, Exceſs of Riot, Luxury, and all thoſe ſenſual Pleaſures, which to others are forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. If Honour and Power are conferred on them, they act as though they were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced above a ſcrupulous Regard to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Commands. They ſeem to ſay, <hi>Who is the Lord, that we ſhould obey him?</hi> Exod. v. 2. Becauſe the Wicked proſper, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude

They ſee Men deſpiſe Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and even ſit in the Scorner's Chair, yet no viſible Evil befals them; hence ſome are tempted to think divine Threats are but Bug-bears, and Religion but a Fancy. On the contrary, pious People are diſtreſſed, often ſeverely reproached and run down, and no viſible Regard manifeſted for all their Care to pleaſe God: Upon this others readily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, that <hi>it is vain to ſerve him.</hi> Mal. iii. 14. Some, who made a plauſible Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of ſtrict Religion, fall away, and prove themſelves, by their After-conduct, to have been but Hypocrites: Therefore, others care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully avoid every Appearance of Piety, that they may avoid Hypocriſy: They expect to be counted honeſt and upright, when they are openly wicked, and glory in their Shame.</p>

Has it a Multitude to patronize it? then 'tis no Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter though it cannot ſtand the Teſt of Scripture; no, nor of common Senſe. The Croud, like a Torrent, carries theſe along, and they loſe themſelves in it. Their weak Minds are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed with the Tumult, and made <hi>giddy with the Glare of worldly Pomp.</hi> Sedate Thought and calm Reaſon, by Means of numberleſs airy Vanities, loſe their Weight, and are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved into Fume and Vapour. In this Plight, it is no Wonder that they eſteem thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptibly weak who chuſe rather to expoſe themſelves to the Cenſure of the World, than to offend God. They judge Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion itſelf by the Faſhion. By that they determine which of the divine Commands it is proper to obey; and which of them, for the ſake of Decency, is to be laid aſide. If religious Diſcourſe is reckoned unpolite, a ſerious Expreſſion will ſhock a gay Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and a few would go near to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſe them. Though it is the Will of God, that Sin ſhould be reproved, and the Sinner made aſhamed; yet we would offend againſt
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:007193_0014_102B362EC0CE9E88"/>modern Politeneſs, ſhould we diſcover even a calm Diſapprobation of what is wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpoken or acted in Company. They who would be quite acceptable to this World, muſt, <hi>at leaſt ſeem,</hi> to approve what GOD condemns, that ſo none may ever be made uneaſy by their Preſence. They muſt <hi>ſay to every one that deſpiſes the LORD,</hi> and <hi>that walks after the Imagination of his Heart, ye ſhall have Peace, and no Evil ſhall come upon you.</hi> Jer. xxiii. 17. But ſurely, <hi>the Friendſhip of the World is Enmity with God.</hi> Jam. iv. 4.</p>
            <p>But let us proceed further, and take a View of Men who miſtake not their Duty; who acknowledge the Things <hi>that are excellent, being inſtructed out of the Law;</hi> and we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but conclude that they exceed in Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. For,</p>
            <p n="5">V. Multitudes continually counteract their Judgment and Conſcience, when rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. They own the Soul to be more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent than the Body, yet are moſt anxious to provide for the latter. They ſpare not Coſt and Pains to cure a bodily Diſtemper, while the immortal Spirit, all diſordered, is quite neglected. Remedies are carefully ſought for an Head-ach; but none for an hard Heart. A Fever is deplored; irregular and diſtorted
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:007193_0015_102B36132527BFD0"/>Paſſions are indulged. The Body is gorgeous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cloathed, and delicately fed, while the Soul is naked, without Righteouſneſs, and no Bread of Life ſought after for its Nouriſhment. It is of more Value than the <hi>the whole World,</hi> yet is bartered away for a very ſmall Part of it; for Vanity, for Songs, for Triffles. That Heaven is infinitely preferable to this Earth, eternal Glory to temporal Felicity, is not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted; yet Sinners chuſe to live here always. They are conſcious to themſelves, that they would deſire no other Kind of Bleſſedneſs that this World affords, could they but <hi>ſtill</hi> enjoy it, and enjoy it <hi>fully;</hi> and hence graſp the Preſent, regardleſs of the Future. They acknowledge, that they ſhould make it the very Buſineſs of their Life to pleaſe God, and that his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour is more valuable than the Favour of all Mankind; yet they gratify their Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites and Humours, when they know they diſpleaſe him in ſo doing: and if they ſtand fair in the Opinion of Men, are quite care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs about his Approbation. They commend Virtue, but practiſe Vice; and while they own, that Wickedneſs is the Way to Hell, walk boldly on in that Way at all Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>They confeſs, that Reaſon ſhould guide, and the Paſſions ſhould be governed by its
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:007193_0016_102B2315749E5A28"/>Dictates; yet when their Paſſions become clamorous, the Voice of Reaſon is drowned, and its loudeſt Remonſtrations no more heard. The covetous Man is drawn into Abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties by the Love of Money, the Voluptious harries on in Purſuit of ruining Pleaſures, and Thirſt of Praiſe carries the Ambitious headlong.</p>
            <p>They make no ſuitable Improvement of their own Experiences, nor correct paſt Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies by After-obſervation. The World and its evil Cuſtoms are infectious; they have been often caught in the ſame Snare, yet never learn to be guarded and circumſpect. The Review of paſt Scenes of guilty Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures gives griping Remorſe; the preſent do not ſatisfy, yet many Trials convince them not that the future will ſurely diſappoint them. After drinking to Exceſs, the Heart is thirſty; and Hunger ſucceeds the moſt plenteous Repaſt. <hi>In the midſt of Laughter the Heart is ſorrowful, and the End of that Mirth is Heavineſs.</hi> Prov. xiv. 13. For often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Reaſon is debauched, the Conſcience feared, the Paſſions inflamed, the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion broken, Eſtate ruined, and the Perſon deſpiſed. Guilt is contracted, Time waſted, and the Spirits flag by means of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate Elevation. Senſual Joys cloy and
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:007193_0017_102B361527B72510"/>ſurfeit, but do not content: they gratify the Brute, but ſtarve the Man, and frequently ruin the Chriſtian. Yet, ſee Multitudes of Mortals eagerly fluttering to graſp Joys, which, like airy Phantoms, ſtill elude their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces; and are hardly the Shadows of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities!—diſappointed, they nevertheleſs ſtill purſue, ſtill go the tireſome Round, and tread the ſame beaten Path, in vain!

Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Deſpair, the fearful Ends of wretched Offenders, deter them not; nor are they perſuaded to be religious by the Death-bed Joys of pure and living Piety. Let their deareſt Friends, and the moſt learned and godly Miniſters, convince and beſeech them, yet will they not <hi>yield themſelves to God.</hi> SOLOMON with all his Wiſdom, the royal Authority, joined with the ſublimeſt Strains, of the <hi>ſweet Singer of</hi> ISRAEL, the perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Oratory of APOLLOS, with <hi>Peter's</hi> burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Zeal, could not turn Sinners from their Courſe. Let Miracles be wrought, the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains removed, the Dead raiſed, the Deaf made to hear, and the Blind to ſee; even theſe Things will not have the Force of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument with them. <hi>Uncover Deſtruction, and make Hell naked</hi> before them, with open Eyes they ruſh into thoſe Flames. Let Angels come from Heaven, and Fiends from the Infernals; let eternal Raptures, and endleſs Horrors, be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented lively to their View, they will hardly ſo much as make a Pauſe. Tell them, nay ſhew them, how ſottiſh and fooliſh their Way is, yet they will not be aſhamed. Conſcience ſpeaks, but is not heard; commands, but is not obeyed. What ſhall I ſay more?—They

They cannot ſucceſsfully contend, nor is it poſſible to eſape, yet they will not ſubmit;—will be broken rather than bow, and <hi>daſhed in Pieces like a Potter's Veſſel,</hi> Pſalm ii. 9. rather than comply with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly righteous Will of God. They are told, that eternal Damnation cannot be avoided, nor eternal Glory obtained, but only by the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of JESUS CHRIST; yet many, (could it have been thought!) many <hi>make light even of a Saviour!</hi> deſpiſe the Redeemer! moſt horrid, moſt deſperate Thought! His exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Agonies, his exceedingly ſorrowful Soul, his bloody Sweat, the Soldiers Scourges, the Crown of Thorns, the cruel Mockings, the painful and accurſed Death he endured for Sin, inſtead of affecting them with Reverence and Love to his Perſon, are the Matter of their Scorn; or, at beſt, received with the coldeſt Indifference. <hi>O my Soul! come not thou into their Secret; unto their Aſſembly, mine Honour, be not thou united!</hi> Gen. xlix. 6. — <hi>Be aſtoniſhed, O ye Heavens,</hi> at the Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the daring Impiety, of guilty Mortals!

            <p>Some hope to obtain Heaven without Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; to <hi>he glorious in the Eyes of the Lord,</hi> Iſai. xlix. 5. though quite unlike Him; to dwell with Pleaſure for ever in his Preſence, though <hi>Enemies in their Minds by wicked Works;</hi> Col. i. 21. and to enjoy ſpiritual Bleſſedneſs, while they carnalize their Affections, and more and more indiſpoſe themſelves to reliſh it.

World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Proſperity, perverted from its Uſe by human Depravity, makes their Paſſions impetuous, their Impatience violent, and their Judgment weak. This being the Character, though <hi>not of all,</hi> yet of the <hi>greater Part</hi> of thoſe who glory in <hi>high Life,</hi> what can follow from it but a wild Inconſtancy!—O my Soul! how evanid are human Thoughts, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Things!

Who fears their Frowns, trembles at their Threats, or courts their Favour, in the Houſe of Silence? And what do their Triumphs and Spoils avail them now?

They are ſummoned to appear before the auguſt, the impartial, and ſovereign Judge; they ſtand at his Bar, and hear an irrevocable Doom. What Doom? Can we bear to contemplate the State of thoſe, who madly provoked their Judge, and perſiſted impenitent? Does not the Heart recoil, the Imagination ſtartle, at the direful Thought of an horrible Gloom,—Regions of eternal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair,—the Steam of Sulphur mixed with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable Fire,—the torturing Gripes, the relentleſs Laſhes of a guilty Conſcience, that gnawing, never-dying Vulture,—the inſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Impreſſions of almighty Wrath,—and the hideous Shrieks of damned Souls? Are the bare Thoughts of theſe Things ſhocking? what then will it be to endure them?

All thoughtleſs, all volatile, hating ſerious Things, and Lectures of Death, which therefore ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes them, finds them unprovided, hurries them away, and puſhes them reluctant down the dreadful Precipice,—from Time into Eternity. O the hardy Adventure! to take a <hi>Leap in the Dark</hi> into an endleſs, unalterable State! Merry Company, Balls, Aſſemblies, and Plays, amuſe them ſo, that they forget they are mortal, till they die; and ſee not their Danger, till they are beyond Relief. They live in Jeſt, <hi>and after that they go to the Dead</hi> in Earneſt. What Degree of Folly is it, to catch a Feather, and let go a Crown! to gain a Toy, and loſe a Kingdom! for a Morſel to barter a Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right! and for a Moment's Pleaſure to part with everlaſting Joys, and ſuffer eternal Woes! And are theſe your <hi>Men of Senſe,</hi> who look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignant on thoſe who are ſo weak as to be deeply concerned about ſuch important Affairs? <hi>Vain Man,</hi> forſooth, <hi>would be wiſe, though he is born like the wild Aſſe's Colt.</hi> Job xi. 12. It is an inexpreſſible Abſurdity, that temporal Things,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:007193_0027_102B361F651AB010"/>whether Riches, Honour, or Pleaſures, ſhould ingroſs the intenſeſt Thoughts of Beings bound for Eternity: And it is an eternal Soleciſm in Religion, to be engaged about the Concerns of it in a cold and indifferent Manner. <hi>The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven ſuffereth Violence, and the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent take it by Force.</hi> Matth. xi. 12.</p>
            <p>After conſidering all theſe Things, will it ſeem an Abuſe of Mankind, if I compare this World to a great <hi>Bedlam,</hi> filled with Perſons ſtrangely and variouſly diſtracted? Some are ſo deſperate, as to refuſe all ſalutary Medicines; and the Habit ſo inveterate, as to non-plus the Phyſician's Skill, and make him almoſt deſpair of their Cure: Some appear hopeful for a while, but relapſe, and their Caſe is more dangerous than before: And ſome are actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recovered in a leſs, ſome in a greater De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; but not ſo much as one perfectly well. My Text will warrant the Compariſon: and I may not flatter Mankind by ſoothing Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, when their Caſe requires plain Dealing; nor be ſo polite as not to learn of God how to ſpeak, when I deliver his Meſſage.</p>
            <p>From the Whole we are taught,</p>
            <p n="1">1. How little Reaſon any one has to be puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed up with popular Applauſe, or disſpirited
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:007193_0028_102B363DE063E2A8"/>when he does not obtain it. For, conſider who are the Judges? Are they all Perſons of ſound Minds, whoſe Concluſions are according to Truth? Far from it. It is true, all fancy themſelves mighty good Judges of Merit: but I ſpeak charitably, when I ſay, perhaps one in an Hundred can diſtinguiſh. That Soul, therefore, is lighter than Vanity, that is toſſed hither and thither, according to the ebbing and flowing Tides of inconſtant Affections. The favourable Opinion of Mankind is chiefly to be valued as it gives an Opportunity to ſerve their beſt Intereſts more ſucceſsfully.</p>
            <p n="2">2. How much Reaſon there is in that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Exhortation, <hi>Be not conformed to this World.</hi> Rom. xii. 2. Do not act upon its Principles, nor accommodate yourſelves to its evil Cuſtoms and Modes. For this World is at Variance with God, and <hi>no Man can ſerve two Maſters.</hi> Matth. vi. 24. It is here modiſh to make light of Religion, and treat it, if treated at all, with an Air of the moſt abſolute Indifference, and Unconcern.—Nay, with many it is polite, to ſneer at ſolemn Devotion, and <hi>make a Mock of Sin.</hi> He appears big, who dares trample on ſacred and inviolable Authority, and laugh at divine Threatnings; and wiſe, who can ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule the Myſteries of the Goſpel. He who is <hi>a Companion of</hi> ſuch <hi>Fools, ſhall be deſtroyed.</hi> Prov. xiii. 20.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:007193_0029_102B36218EDCD328"/>
Laſtly, Let the Follies of others be a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to engage your more earneſt Purſuit of ſaving Wiſdom. <hi>Seek her as Silver, ſearch for her as for hidden Treaſure.</hi> Prov. ii. iv. <hi>Happy is the Man that finds her; for ſhe is more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious than Silver, than fine Gold and Rubies.— Her Ways are Ways of Pleaſantneſs, and all her Paths are Peace.</hi> chap. iii. ver. 13, 14, 15, and 17. If any of you <hi>lack</hi> this ſpiritual <hi>Wiſdom, ask it of GOD, who gives liberally, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braids not:</hi> and let it ever be a ſmall Matter with you, to be judged weak and fooliſh by a mad World, provided always that you are <hi>wiſe to Salvation.</hi>
