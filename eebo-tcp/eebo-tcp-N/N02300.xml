            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

What by the <hi>Hands</hi> of the <hi>living God</hi>? 2. What it is to <hi>fall</hi> into the hands of the living God? 4.

            <p n="1">1. WHAT is the Import and meaning of this Title, the <hi>living God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is the glorious and <hi>proper</hi> Name of the <hi>true</hi> God, and many times given him in his Word. Jer. 10.10. <hi>The Lord is the true God, he is the living God.</hi> Mat. 16.16. <hi>Thou art Chriſt, the ſon of the living God.</hi> Now</p>
            <p n="1">1. THE <hi>living</hi> God means the <hi>Eternal</hi> God. <hi>The Lord, the Everlaſting God.</hi> He is the <hi>living One</hi> who ever was, is and will be, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning or end. Jer. 10.10. <hi>The living God and the Everlaſting King.</hi> Pſal. 90.2. <hi>From Everlaſting to Everlaſting Thou art God.</hi>

THE <hi>living</hi> God ſpeaks his <hi>Self exiſtence.</hi> Eternal exiſtence neceſſarily implies <hi>this.</hi> John 5.26. <hi>The Father hath life in himſelf.</hi> "God's life is his own: It is originated in Himſelf <note n="‖" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Willard</hi> on the <hi>Catechiſm.</hi>

            <p n="3">3. THE <hi>living</hi> God ſpeaks a life always the <hi>ſame.</hi> The immutability and unchangeableneſs of God is plainly contained in this <hi>Title.</hi> Dan. 6.26. <hi>The living God, and stedfast for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>GOD's Name is — <hi>I am that I am.</hi> This is to <hi>live,</hi> and to be the <hi>living One.</hi> I am the Lord, <hi>I change not.</hi> He who is <hi>the ſame yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, to day and for ever, with whom is no varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs nor ſhadow of turning,</hi> He it is that <hi>liveth.</hi>

            <p n="4">4. THE <hi>living</hi> God means the <hi>Fountain of life</hi> to all Creatures. Pſal 36.9. <hi>For with thee is the fountain of life.

            </p>
            <p n="5">5. THE <hi>living</hi> God is in oppoſition to <hi>falſe</hi> Gods, Idols &amp; Images, which are <hi>dead</hi> things. The <hi>Stocks</hi> and the graven Images which ſtupid men have called <hi>Gods,</hi> were lifeleſs things; and the <hi>Heroes</hi> whom the Nations have ignorantly dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and worſhipp'd were dying or dead men. <hi>The molten Image is falſhood,</hi> becauſe there is no <hi>breath</hi> in it. <hi>The portion of Jacob</hi> is not like it; He is <hi>Jehovah, Him that liveth.</hi> Life and death are juſt in that contradiction the one to the other that the true God is to all falſe ones. Act. 14.15. <hi>We preach to you that you ſhould turn from theſe vanities to the living God.</hi> 1 Theſ. 1 9. <hi>Ye turned to God from Idols, to ſerve the living and true GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE <hi>reproach</hi> of Idols and of Idolaters is <hi>that the living ſeek to the dead.</hi> Iſai. 8.19. And it ſhould be <hi>hateful</hi> to a living Soul to worſhip <hi>the deaf, the blind &amp; the dumb.</hi> 2 Sam. 5.8. <hi>The hated of David's ſoul.</hi> He means the Idol, the <hi>Palladium,</hi> of the <hi>Jebuſites,</hi> in which they fot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhly truſted.</p>
            <p n="6">6. THE <hi>living</hi> God may mean the <hi>activity</hi> of the life of God beyond that of all Creatures. God is the <hi>moſt active life.</hi> His infinite wiſdom, power and goodneſs in everlaſting activity, this is <hi>life.</hi> In Him is life, and the life is the light of all worlds, of all creatures in them that have life.</p>

of <hi>living ſpirits,</hi> and <hi>moving creatures</hi> that have life, has the <hi>living God</hi> produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and continually preſerves? The life of Angels and Men, beaſts and all cattle, creeping things and flying fowl, and whatſoever paſſeth thro' the paths of the Sea, is communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated from him daily, and upheld by him. What an <hi>Active</hi> life is this? which <hi>worketh hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, &amp; yet works</hi> inceſſantly, in the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect eaſe, thro' all worlds, thro' all time!</p>
            <p>THIS <hi>Agency</hi> and activity is plainly intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in my <hi>text,</hi> which ſpeaks of the <hi>hands</hi> of of the living God, and of <hi>falling</hi> into them. The <hi>Hand</hi> is for <hi>working,</hi> and for <hi>ſtriking</hi> if need be; for expedite and lively working, and for terrible ſtriking. In both reſpects it intimates a life the moſt <hi>active</hi> imaginable.</p>
            <p>BUT I come to the <hi>Second</hi> Enquiry,</p>
            <p n="2">II. WHAT are the <hi>Hands</hi> of the living GOD?</p>
            <p>TO be ſure nothing like <hi>mens</hi> hands, and much leſs the lifeleſs carved hands of an Image. God has no hands nor bodily parts, is not fleſh and blood as we are; but He is an <hi>Infinite Eſſence,</hi> the <hi>Immenſe Spirit,</hi> filling heaven and earth. When he ſhewed his Glory to the Elders of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they ſaw no ſimilitude. And when he gave his Commandments from <hi>Sinai,</hi> the <hi>ſecond</hi> of them was— <hi>Thou ſhalt not make unto thee any likeneſs of any thing that is in Heaven above, or

on the earth beneath.</hi> But in condeſcention to our weakneſs, and to help us in our ideas and conceptions of God in his works of Providence and Grace, He has pleas'd to ſpeak to us of his eyes and hands and feet; to let us know that he ever ſees us and concerns himſelf for us, in ways both of mercy &amp; of judgment, as it ſeems good to his wiſdom and holineſs. And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly by the <hi>hands</hi> of the living God we muſt underſtand,</p>

            <p>BUT this for the meaning of God's <hi>hand</hi> in the <hi>Text.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. WHAT is it to <hi>fall</hi> into the hands of the living God?</p>
            <p>IT cannot mean or ſuppoſe that we are ever <hi>out</hi> of his hand. No, we are always in it; both Saints and Sinners are ſo. <hi>All his Saints are in his hand,</hi> the hand of his Mercy, power and grace; and all his <hi>enemies</hi> are in the ſtrong hand of his Juſtice. <hi>Whither can we go from his Spirit? and whither can we flee from
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:002737_0011_0FE61BA5E35578A0"/>
his preſence? If we take the wings of the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and dwell in the uttermoſt parts of the ſea, even there ſhall his hand lead us, and his right hand ſhall hold us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THERE is indeed a falling into the <hi>hands</hi> of Divine wiſdom and <hi>goodneſs,</hi> grace and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; a <hi>caſting</hi> our ſelves into them, and God's <hi>taking</hi> us into them. 1 Sam. 24.14. <hi>Let us fall now into the hand of the Lord, for his mercies are great.</hi> We muſt look to the helping and ſaving hand of God, and ſay, <hi>Hold thou me up and I ſhall be ſafe! Into thy hand I commit my Spirit!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT ſinners fall into the hand of Divine <hi>juſtice,</hi> when it lays hold of them to puniſh them for their iniquities; when it falls upon them as it were to ſlay them. When God judges ſinners in his righteous and terrible Providence, or when his wrath falls upon their Conſciences, or when Death arreſts them to carry them in their impenitence to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeat of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and to the place of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting torments; then, then do they fall into hand of the living God. When God ſays to evil angels, or to death, or to the tormentors after death, as <hi>David</hi> did to the young man, Go fall upon this <hi>Amalekite; And he ſmote him that he died.</hi> It is as when one falls into the hand of a powerful <hi>Enemy</hi>; or rather as when a <hi>Criminal</hi> falls into the hand of Juſtice, and it is arreſted, arraigned, convicted, condemned to die and executed. All impenitent ſinners are
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:002737_0012_0FE61BA78C7A5DD0"/>
always in the hand of God's <hi>Juſtice,</hi> under his wrath and curſe, under the Sentence of eternal death. And not ſeldom they fall into the hand of his <hi>Judgments</hi> here in this life, both as to ſoul and body. But it is eſpecially at <hi>Death</hi> and in the day of <hi>Judgment,</hi> that they fall into the hand of the living God. Then it is laid upon them, lays hold of them, holds them faſt, and falls upon them. This is the <hi>Second death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. <hi>WHY</hi> is it ſo <hi>fearful</hi> a thing to fall into the hand of the living God? I anſwer, 1. Becauſe the power and wrath of God is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite and inſupportable. 2. Becauſe it is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and everlaſting.</p>
            <p n="1">1. BECAUSE the power and wrath of God is <hi>infinite,</hi> intolerable, and inſupportable. Pſa. 90.11. <hi>Who knoweth the power of thine anger? even according to thy fear ſo is thy wrath.</hi> It is infinitely beyond all that we can fear or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend. Pſalm 76.7. <hi>Thou, even Thou art to be feared, and who may ſtand in thy ſight when once thou art angry?</hi> Nahum 1.5, 6. <hi>The mountains quake at Him, and the hills melt, and the earth is burnt up at his preſence; yea the world and all that dwell therein: Who can ſtand before his indignation? and who can abide in the fierceneſs of his anger? his fury is poured out like fire, and the rocks are thrown down by him.</hi> Say now if it be not a <hi>fearful</hi> thing to fall into
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002737_0013_0FE61BA7964C09D0"/>
the wrathful hand of this Infinite power! The wrath of an earthly <hi>King</hi> is as the roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a <hi>lion</hi>; but to what can we compare the wrath of the Infinite God? How terrible was the wrath of the King, which the three <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies</hi> among the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> feared not, tho' it raged againſt them? Dan. 3.19. <hi>Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his viſage was changed againſt Shadrach, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhach and Abednego; therefore he ſpake and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that they ſhould heat the furnace one ſeven times more than it was wont to be heat; And he commanded the moſt mighty men that were in his army to bind and caſt them into the burning fiery furnace.</hi> This is but a little image of the fierceneſs of the wrath of God, which will caſt ſinners into <hi>the pit that burneth with fire and brimſtone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. THE wrath and vengeance of the living God is <hi>Eternal</hi> and <hi>Everlaſting</hi>; and this it is that renders it ſo <hi>fearful</hi> a thing to fall into his hand. The <hi>living</hi> God lives for ever to puniſh. He can and will inflict wrath for ever and ever. He lives to uphold the Soul under everlaſting Sufferings.</p>
            <p>IT is true that he could annihilate the Soul, and bring it to nothing: But he has made it immortal, made it for immortality, and it cannot die, it ſhall live for ever, tho' in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable torments.</p>
            <p>GOD is unchangeable Truth, and inflexible Holineſs. He has ſworn and will not repent.
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:002737_0014_0FE61BB1706918D0"/>
He lives for ever and his hand takes hold of Judgment. — Yea his life and being is the moſt <hi>active</hi> imaginable, both as to puniſhing and rewarding. The living God is not like <hi>indolent</hi> Idols. He has hands and <hi>uſes</hi> them. And all his power and anger is in <hi>everlaſting activity</hi> againſt the wicked. Pſalm 7.12. <hi>He will what his ſword, he hath bent his bow and made it ready; he hath alſo prepared for him the inſtruments of death.</hi> Pſalm 11.6. <hi>Upon the wicked he ſhall rain ſnares, fire and brimſtone, and an horrible tempeſt; this ſhall be the portion of their cup.</hi> — But the terribleneſs of this active vengeance is, that it is <hi>Eternal</hi>; the vengeance of <hi>everlaſting fire.</hi> Jude ver. 7.</p>
            <p>THE living God inflicts eternal death on thoſe whom he damns. The eternal damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the wicked proceeds from eternal life in Him. The <hi>Sentence</hi> therefore runs thus; Mat. 25.41. <hi>Depart from Me ye curſed into everlasting fire.</hi> The living God paſſes this Sentence, and he lives for ever to ſee it exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting, through all the ages of Eternity. 2 Theſſ. 1.9. <hi>Who ſhall be puniſhed with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting destruction from the preſence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE damned after the Day of Judgment will be as much in the wrathful hands of the living God as they were before. The hand that caſts them into hell will hold them down therein. <hi>Hell is naked before him and deſtruction hath no covering.</hi> Once in thoſe living hands
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002737_0015_0FE61BB1B019B0B0"/>
and there for ever. O eternal horror! how fearful a thing to think of!</p>
            <q>
               <l>For ever? fatal word! for ever? who</l>
               <l>Can bear the doom of Everlaſting woe <note n="‖" place="bottom">Sir <hi>Richard Blackmore.</hi>
                  </note>?</l>
            </q>
            <p>THIS deſtruction from the Almighty ſhould be indeed a terror to us. It is revealed to us for this end, in ſo many fearful and terrifying deſcriptions. Mark 3.29. <hi>In danger of Eternal damnation.</hi> O what a danger, what a hazard is that? what a fearful condition for a poor Soul to be in? Mat. 3.5. <hi>He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.</hi> The chaff is ſuch dry ſtuff that though it yield a vehement and fierce flame, yet it is preſently over and out. But though ſinners are no better than chaff, and the fire in their Conſciences will be a moſt vehement flame, yet it will never abate and much leſs go out, but rage on for ever &amp; ever. There's oil eno' in guilt, ſuch as it is, to feed the flames for ever. Mark 9.44. <hi>Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.</hi> Here is miſery in extremity, both in reſpect of the degree and of the duration thereof. It is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out intermiſſion, diminution or end. O the fearfulneſs of this ſtate of miſery! Well might our <hi>Lord</hi> ſay, Luke 12.5. <hi>I will forewarn you whom you ſhall fear; fear him who after he has killed hath power to caſt into hell; yea I ſay unto
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002737_0016_0FE61BB30E1A32F0"/>
you fear him.</hi> The death of the <hi>Body</hi> is ſoon over, yea though it were to be burnt to death; the flames ſoon ſuffocate it or bring it to aſhes: But the <hi>Soul</hi> can ly in flaming torments for ever and ever, and yet exiſt and ſubſiſt: And the bodies of wicked ſouls will be raiſed in ſuch power and incorruption, as to endure the everlaſting burnings of hell with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſecond diſſolution. Revel. 14.10, 11. <hi>The ſame ſhall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he ſhall be tormented with fire and brimſtone in the preſence of the holy Angels and in the preſence of the Lamb: And the ſmoke of their torment aſcendeth for ever and ever.</hi> See alſo <hi>Chap.</hi> 20. the <hi>ſix</hi> laſt verſes.</p>
            <p>THUS <hi>fearful</hi> a thing it is to <hi>fall</hi> into the <hi>hand</hi> of the <hi>living</hi> God, which is <hi>infinite</hi> power and <hi>everlaſting</hi> wrath. Iſai. 33.14. <hi>Who among us ſhall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us ſhall dwell with everlaſting burnings?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE <hi>USE</hi> is, <hi>Let Sinners fear</hi>: fear the <hi>living</hi> God, fear his <hi>power,</hi> fear his <hi>anger</hi>; fear to fall into his <hi>hand,</hi> and under his wraths As <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpeaks, Job 36.17, 18. <hi>Juſtice and judgment take hold on thee; becauſe there is wrath beware leſt he take thee away with his ſtroke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FEAR and <hi>repent</hi>: fear and <hi>flee</hi> from the wrath to come: fear and <hi>cry</hi> earneſtly to God that thou periſh not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fear and make haſte to

the <hi>City of refuge</hi> for thy poor Soul, to lay hold on the <hi>Hope</hi> ſet before thee; <hi>JESUS who delivereth from the wrath to come.</hi> Fearing and <hi>trembling</hi> go to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> believing in him as able and willing to ſave thee. Get under his ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wings, put thy ſelf into his merciful hands; lay hold on his righteouſneſs and ſtrength, thy only ſecurity. As <hi>Noah</hi> moved with fear pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared an <hi>Ark</hi> for the ſaving of his houſe; ſo <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the Ark of Salvation for periſhing Souls from the <hi>flood</hi> of Divine wrath.</p>
            <p>LET Sinners realize the Great GOD in his eternal Being, Power, Providence and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; Juſtice and Holineſs. Let them ever remember their own Immortality, the eternal exiſtence of their precious Souls. And let them never forget the fearful and amazing threatnings of an everlaſting puniſhment for all workers of iniquity. And then let them <hi>ſtand in awe and not ſin</hi>; but <hi>commune with their own heart and be ſtill</hi>; ſeriouſly conſidering with themſelves,</p>
            <p n="1">1. WHAT a <hi>fearful</hi> ſtate and condition, a ſtate of <hi>ſin</hi> is: a ſtate of nature which is a <hi>ſtate of wrath,</hi> and a ſtate of multiplied and aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated guilts which ſhall receive <hi>greater dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi>

            <p>GOD is the Author and giver of Life. Death is an odious thing in his eyes. Therefore it is made the puniſhment of Sin.

and deſtruction as a whirlwind; diſtreſs and anguiſh will come upon thee:</hi> Then <hi>terrors will purſue thy</hi> fluttering <hi>ſoul as the wind, and thy welfare will paſs away as a cloud, and thy ſoul ſhall be poured out upon thee:</hi> Then comes the <hi>fearful looking for of judgment, and of fiery indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to devour</hi> thee.— But the horrors of that dreadful day can by no means be conceived of or repreſented. A little image or ſhadow of it you have, Rev. 6.12—17. <hi>And the ſun became black as ſackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood, and the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, and the heaven departed as a ſcrowl, and every mountain and iſland were moved out of their places; And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bond man, and every free man hid themſelves in the dens, and in the rocks of the mountains; and ſaid to the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and rocks, fall on us and hide us from the face of Him that ſitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb: For the great day of his wrath is come, and who ſhall be able to ſtand?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>LET ſinners therefore <hi>fear</hi> the living God, and conſider</p>
            <p n="1">1. HOW <hi>ſoon,</hi> how <hi>ſuddenly</hi> they may fall into his hands. <hi>This night their ſouls may be required,</hi> and <hi>in hell they may lift up their eyes in torments.</hi> When they ly down to ſleep, their eyes may be cloſed in eternal death. Pſalm 58.9. <hi>He ſhall take them away as in a whirlwind, both living and in his wrath.</hi>

               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:002737_0023_0FE61BCD81C798D0"/>2. YOU can <hi>never,</hi> never get out of thoſe living hands, when you are once fallen into them.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>GOD's hand</hi> it is that hath delivered you up to die.

            <p>
               <hi>IT is a faithful ſaying and worthy of all accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, that Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave the chief of ſinners.</hi> He ſays even to <hi>ſuch, Look unto me and be ye ſaved!

            <p>THE <hi>Captain</hi> of the Pirates, <hi>William Fly,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to come into publick.

            <p>THE <hi>Story</hi> of theſe wretched men is ſhort and tragical. They ſail'd from <hi>Jamaica</hi> on board a <hi>Snoe, John Green</hi> Commander, bound to <hi>Guinea.</hi> They had not been long at Sea be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they conſpired to ſeize the <hi>Captain</hi> and <hi>Mate,</hi> and then go a <hi>pirating.</hi> On the 27th of <hi>May</hi> 1726. they put in execution their wicked deſign, in a moſt cruel and barbarous manner. About one a clock in the morning, <hi>William Fly</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:002737_0032_0FE61BE9F32B8490"/>
then <hi>Boatſwain</hi> of the <hi>Snoe Elizabeth,</hi> after he had been ſome time forward with ſeveral of the <hi>Sailors,</hi> came aft with <hi>Alexander Mitchel</hi> and others, and ſaid to <hi>Morrice Cunden (Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> of the Ship) then at helm,
<q>D—n you, you dog, if you ſtir hand or foot, or ſpeak a word, I'll blow your brains out.</q>
And im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately thereupon he went into the <hi>Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin</hi> where <hi>Captain Green</hi> was in bed, and <hi>Alexander Mitchel</hi> follow'd him; and while they were there <hi>Morrice Cunden</hi> heard the <hi>Captain</hi> cry out, <hi>What's the matter</hi>? But they ſoon hawl'd him upon deck, and were about to throw him into the Sea; when the poor man begg'd of them to ſpare his life, ſaying, <q>
                  <hi>For God's ſake</hi> Boatſwain <hi>don't throw me over board, for if you do I ſhall go to hell.</hi>
               </q> But though in the anguiſh and amazement of his ſoul he thus pleaded with them, that they would not ſend him down quick into hell, for that he was not fit to die; yet his plea made no impreſſion at all upon their hardned hearts. <hi>Fly</hi> bid him ſay after him theſe words, <q>
                  <hi>Lord have mercy upon my ſoul</hi>;</q> and away they hurried the poor ſurpris'd and aſtoniſh'd man overboard. It is affirmed that he caught hold of a rope and held for his life, which when one of the wretches ſaw he cut off his hand with an ax; and ſo he dropt into Eternity.</p>
            <p>AT the ſame time ſome others of this <hi>bloody crew</hi> ſurpris'd the <hi>Mate</hi> of the Ship, <hi>Thomas
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:002737_0033_0FE61BEA08B293E8"/>
Jenkins.</hi> And <hi>Thomas Streaton</hi> (the <hi>Carpenter</hi> of the Ship) depoſed that he heard <hi>Samuel Cole</hi> ſay to <hi>Jenkins,</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>Come out of your Cabbin, you dog!</hi>
               </q> and preſently he was hawl'd out, and told <q>
                  <hi>that he ſhould go overboard after his Captain.</hi>
               </q> When he was in the Sea he was heard calling earneſtly to the <hi>Doctor</hi> to hand him a rope. But the <hi>Doctor</hi> was by this time himſelf putting into Irons.</p>
            <p>THUS <hi>bloodily</hi> theſe inhumane Creatures began their <hi>Piracy,</hi> but Vengeance follow'd them and ſuffer'd them not to live.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>William Fly,</hi> the chief and worſt (we may ſuppoſe) of theſe barbarous rogues, took on him the Command, and named the <hi>Snoe</hi> the <hi>Fames Revenge.</hi> They were well ſtored with <hi>Powder,</hi> and <hi>Rum</hi> and <hi>Proviſions,</hi> but wanted a better <hi>Veſſel</hi>; and in queſt of this it is likely they bent their courſe firſt to <hi>Carolina</hi> and from thence to <hi>New England.</hi> On the <hi>third</hi> of <hi>June</hi> they took a <hi>Sloop</hi> at Anchor off <hi>North-Carolina,</hi> on board of which was Mr. <hi>William Atkinſon</hi> a Paſſenger; who was afterwards the happy Inſtrument in the hand of God for their deſtruction. They very much needed one ſo well skill'd as <hi>Atkinſon</hi> was both as a <hi>Mariner</hi> and <hi>Pilot,</hi> and <hi>Fly</hi> treated him well on that account, but kept a ſtrict eye upon him, forbidding him to have any converſation
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:002737_0034_0FE61BFAB6278680"/>
with the forc'd men; and leſt he ſhould he had a hammock given him in the <hi>Cabbin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THEY commanded him to carry them to <hi>Martha's Vineyard</hi> in order to wood and water there, and in hopes to meet with ſome Sloop ſitting for their purpoſe <note n="‖" place="bottom">This is Mr. <hi>Atkinſon</hi>'s own Account of things.</note>: But he reſolved to run the venture of carrying them paſt the <hi>Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,</hi> and run them up into or near the <hi>Bay</hi> before they were aware of it. When they perceiv'd it they began to look upon him with an evil eye, &amp; ſpake of throwing him overboard. But as <hi>Fly</hi> was uttering his rage at him the next morning on this account, and telling him what death he ſhould die if any thing ill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell them thro' his conduct, a <hi>Schooner</hi> came in ſight which put an end to <hi>Fly</hi>'s rage, for the joy of a good Prize. They found it a <hi>Schooner</hi> of <hi>Marblehead, George Girdler</hi> Maſter.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Atkinſon</hi> had ſome time before this meditated the ſeizing on <hi>Fly</hi> and Company, and found means ſecretly to communicate his mind to ſome on board, whom he thought he might truſt; particularly to <hi>Samuel Walker,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Streaton</hi>; and <hi>Walker</hi> had ſpoken of it to <hi>James Benbrook</hi>; who all conſented if a fair opportunity ſhould offer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:002737_0035_0FE61BFAC25215F0"/>IT was very neceſſary to his deſign to <hi>ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate</hi> himſelf, as far as he honeſtly and with a good conſcience could, with <hi>Fly</hi> and his Pirates. Yet in doing this he ran a <hi>riſque</hi> both of his innocence and his life: Of his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence,</hi> for <hi>with a furious man thou ſhalt not go, leſt thou learn his ways and get a ſnare to thy ſoul</hi>; And of his <hi>Life,</hi> for as ſome of the <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates,</hi> the <hi>Captain</hi> eſpecially, began to think friendly of him and to hearken to his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; (they all depending on him to navigate the Ship) ſo if a <hi>Ship of War</hi> had taken them it is to be feared that he had in vain pleaded his innocence and good intentions. But the good God who preſerv'd, has alſo pleaded his innocence. And we ought to praiſe his virtue, conduct and courage, and give God the glory of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fly</hi> had no ſooner taken the <hi>Schooner</hi> of <hi>Marblehead,</hi> but they diſcovered another at a diſtance from them. Whereupon he put <hi>three</hi> men on board the <hi>Schooner,</hi> and purpoſed to bear down on the new <hi>Sail</hi> with both his Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels. But Mr. <hi>Atkinſon</hi> with a ready thought adviſed him to put <hi>ſix</hi> men into the <hi>Schooner</hi> and ſend her down on the fiſhing Veſſels, being her ſelf one of their company but a day before, and ſo there would be no likelyhood of their flying from her: but (ſaid he) if the <hi>Snoe</hi> and the <hi>Schooner</hi> now bear down together they'll take you for what you are, and make away
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:002737_0036_0FE61BFBCBF036A0"/>
from you. <hi>Fly</hi> came into his advice and put three men more into the <hi>Schooner,</hi> and parted with her, ſtanding a courſe wide from her.</p>
            <p>NOW <hi>Atkinſon</hi>'s thoughts were hard at work how to draw <hi>Fly</hi> away from his <hi>Arms</hi> on the quarter-deck. For there he kept alone, nor would ſuffer <hi>Atkinſon</hi> to ſtep up, ſo much as to ſet down the <hi>Bowl</hi> of punch after he had drank to him. And probably a Meſſage which he receiv'd from a chief <hi>Pirate</hi> on board the <hi>Schooner,</hi> by the boat, <q>
                  <hi>To have a ſpecial care of his Friend,</hi>
               </q> did increaſe his jealouſie; tho' he ſeem'd only to laugh at it.</p>
            <p>WITHIN a little while <hi>Atkinſon</hi> ſpied a <hi>Sail</hi> a head to the <hi>Leward,</hi> and informed <hi>Fly</hi> of it. And preſently after he pretended to diſcover two or three more ſail, and told him he would have a <hi>fleet</hi> of prizes. But <hi>Fly</hi> with his glaſs could ſee but <hi>one.</hi> Why ſaid <hi>Atkinſon,</hi> If you were but here, Sir, with your glaſs, a-head, you would eaſily ſee them all. On a ſudden <hi>Fly</hi> forgat his caution, and comes off the quarter-deck, where his arms lay, and ſets him down a-head to ſpy the Sails ſpoken of. Then <hi>Atkinſon</hi> gave the ſign to his friends, and <hi>Walker</hi> follow'd by <hi>Benbrook</hi> came up, pretending at firſt to direct the <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> to look a point or two on ſuch a ſide, while <hi>Atkinſon</hi> (a ſpare and ſlender man) paſs'd aft toward the <hi>Arms,</hi> and in the inſtant
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:002737_0037_0FE61BFBD4BF91B8"/>
that <hi>Walker</hi> laid hold of <hi>Fly</hi> he took the fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arms, and returned pointing the gun to the <hi>Pirate's</hi> breaſt, and telling him
<q>He was a dead man if he did not immediately ſubmit himſelf his priſoner.</q>
The wicked <hi>Fly</hi> earneſtly <hi>begg'd</hi> for his life, and now found that <hi>mercy</hi> which he had ſo barbarouſly denied to his <hi>innocent Captain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN the midſt of this ſtruggle the Pirate <hi>Greenvil</hi> put up his head from between decks: for there as Providence order'd it He and <hi>Condick</hi> were at this inſtant; and as for the pirate <hi>Cole</hi> he had been in <hi>Irons</hi> for two days before, by <hi>Fly</hi>'s order, for ſome mutiny he had made. This it was that render'd the ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them ſo eaſy to <hi>Atkinſon</hi> and his three Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions: for now <hi>Streaton</hi> had fallen in, and guarded one place, while <hi>Atkinſon</hi> did the other, keeping the Pirates down. The Action was ſo ſurpriſing to the other <hi>Forc'd Men,</hi> that for a time they ſtood aſtonied and like Men amazed, not capable of acting for their own deliverance; altho' vehemently call'd upon and threatned by <hi>Atkinſon.</hi> But in a little time they came to themſelves and joyfully fell in with their <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHEN <hi>Fly</hi> found himſelf chain'd down and effectually ſecur'd, he fell at times into the moſt deſperate <hi>ragings,</hi> curſing himſelf and her that bare him, and the Day wherein he was born;
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:002737_0038_0FE61C124E946818"/>
curſing the very heavens &amp; in effect the <hi>God</hi> that judged him; Curſing all <hi>rovers</hi> that ſhould ever give quarter again to an <hi>Engliſhman</hi>; and wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the devils of hell would come and fly away with the Ship: The ſame <hi>Blaſphemer</hi> now in his furious <hi>deſpair,</hi> or worſe than he ever was before in his <hi>jollity</hi> and pride; when he wou'd ſometimes even dare to ridicule the noiſe of Gods <hi>Thunder,</hi> as it rattled over him, Saying, <q>
                  <hi>That they were playing bowls in the Air,</hi>
               </q> &amp;c. and as the <hi>Lightnings</hi> ſometimes flaſh'd upon them, he would ſay — <q>
                  <hi>Who fires now? Stand by,</hi>
               </q> &amp;c. — So he dar'd the dreadful Vengeance, which perſu'd him ſwift as the <hi>Lightnings</hi> and ſuddenly ſtruck him.</p>
            <p>BUT Capt. <hi>Atkinſon</hi> and his brave <hi>Mates</hi> are much to be prais'd, that they dealt ſo <hi>merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully</hi> with theſe <hi>bloody Men</hi>; and neither <hi>blew their brains out</hi> (their own phraſe) nor threw them overboard. <hi>Bleſſed be God that kept them that day from ſhedding blood, and from avenging themſelves with their own hands.</hi> It was much better to reſerve the <hi>Murderers</hi> to the Judgment of the <hi>Law,</hi> in the proper courſe of it. Hereby the guilty <hi>Miſerables</hi> had a ſpace granted them for <hi>repentance,</hi> and were bro't under the happy <hi>means</hi> of it; Means <hi>happy</hi> we hope to two of them, namely <hi>Greenvil</hi> and <hi>Cole.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Capt <hi>Atkinſon</hi> and Company now made the beſt of their way for the Port of <hi>Boston.</hi> The

Pirate <hi>Schooner</hi> made after them till night part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when they altered their courſe and loſt her. On the 29 of <hi>June</hi> they arriv'd at <hi>Boston,</hi> and Surrender'd themſelves, their Priſoners and the <hi>Snoe</hi> into the hands of the <hi>Government.</hi> On <hi>Monday</hi> the <hi>fourth</hi> of <hi>July</hi> a <hi>Special Court of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty</hi> was held at the <hi>Court houſe</hi> in <hi>Boſton,</hi> where Mr. <hi>Atkinſon</hi> and Eleven more paſs'd their <hi>Trial</hi> and were <hi>acquitted: Fly, Cole, Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> and <hi>Condick</hi> were found <hi>guilty,</hi> and Sentenc'd to <hi>die.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fly</hi> at his trial, as well as before and after it, behav'd boldly and impenitently. <hi>Cole</hi> and <hi>Greenvil</hi> more modeſtly, humbly, penitently; like Men greatly concern'd for their Souls, and diſtreſſed for their Sins. And this continu'd to the day and hour of their death. As for <hi>George Condick</hi> he appear'd ignorant, ſtupid and inſenſible; was acquitted by the <hi>Court</hi> of the <hi>Murder,</hi> and was afterward <hi>repriev'd</hi> at the place of Execution.</p>
            <p>ON <hi>Tueſday,</hi> July 12. their <hi>Execution</hi> came on, and <hi>Fly</hi> briskly and in a way of bravery jumpt up into the <hi>Cart,</hi> with a noſe gay in his hand, bowing with much unconcern to the Spectators as he paſs'd along, and at the <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows</hi> he behaved ſtill obſtinately and boldly till his face was covered for death; but <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill</hi> and <hi>Cole</hi> behaved piouſly and penitently in a judgment of charity. — <hi>Fly</hi> was the
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:002737_0040_0FE61C168B95C260"/>
greateſt Inſtance of <hi>obduracy</hi> that has yet been ſeen among all the <hi>Malefactors</hi> who have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd in theſe parts.</p>
            <p>THE Reverend <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Town</hi> viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them often, diſcours'd them ſeriouſly and affectionately, prayed with them frequently and fervently, and preached to 'em both in private and in publick.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Samuel Cole</hi> in the morning before his Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution delivered a <hi>Paper,</hi> wherein he confeſs'd and bewail'd
<q>his giving himſelf in his youth to the ſin of <hi>drinking</hi>; and that while a boy he learn'd and addicted himſelf unto the too common ſin of <hi>Swearing</hi> and blaſpheming the great and fearful Name of God: Alſo his early defrauding his Maſter by <hi>stealing Liquors</hi> for wicked men, who entic'd and encourag'd him to do it: Alſo that when he arriv'd to Manhood he conſulted nothing but ſinful <hi>pleaſures,</hi> drinking, whoring, danc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c. He deſired all <hi>Sea-faring men</hi> to take warning by his ſhameful and ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous death; which he was now come to by liſtning to the wicked words and actions of horrible men. He confeſs'd himſelf to be juſtly condemned, and gave abundance of thanks for the aſſiſtance of many good <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,</hi> their kind Exhortations and good Doctrine to him; He ask'd their continued prayers, and the prayers of all good people,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:002737_0041_0FE61C16933ED588"/>
for his poor ſoul to the laſt hour of his life; and expreſs'd his hope, thro' the blood of his dear Redeemer <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> his Lord, of entring into the Kingdom of heaven.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THIS <hi>paper</hi> he earneſtly deſired might be publiſhed to the world. The other <hi>Priſoners</hi> ſaid little, but warn'd all <hi>Maſters</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders</hi> againſt ſeverity and barbarity to their Men, which (they ſaid) they were perſuaded is the reaſon of ſo many turning <hi>Pirates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AFTER the Execution, the <hi>three dead Bodies</hi> were carried to a ſmall <hi>Iſland,</hi> about two leagues from the <hi>Town</hi>; where the body of <hi>Fly</hi> is hung up in <hi>Irons,</hi> as a Spectacle for warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to others; and the two other bodies were buried there.</p>
