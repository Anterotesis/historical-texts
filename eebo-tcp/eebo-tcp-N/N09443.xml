            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>BEFORE we can undertake to determine the proper uſe and improvement of the principles of Natural Religion, we muſt know what Natural Religion is, and what thoſe principles are, which we are to uſe and improve.</p>
            <p>It was juſtly obſerved by one <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. GAY</note> who hath gone before me on this ſubject, that "the belief of God's exiſtence is moſt eſſentially fundamental to all religion."—If we could ſuppoſe an intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent creature to do every thing that we call right, and to forbear what we call evil; yet, if he did not act from a ſenſe of the Being and Perfections of God, we ſhould not pronounce this religion, whatever elſe we might call it.</p>
            <p>It is the opinion of many great and good men, that there is an eſſential and immutable difference between moral good and evil; and
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:012033_0004_0F8971840DB75E28"/>that this difference ariſes from the very nature of things, ſo as to be entirely independent on the will of God. I ſhall not determine whether theſe ſentiments are true or falſe but allowing that they are true, and that ſome ſuperior minds are influenced by this abſtract and unalterable fitneſs of things to act agreable to it, without any other conſideration; we may call them wiſe and virtuous; but if there is no regard to a Deity, they cannot be denominated religious, becauſe a reſpect to a Deity is neceſſarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in the very notion of Religion—If there is no God, there is, there can be no Religion— The ſacred writings lay this down as a funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental principle, "He that cometh to God muſt believe that He is"—This is the foundation of all Religion both Natural and Revealed.</p>
            <p>THE firſt thing therefore in diſcourſing on Natural Religion is to eſtabliſh this great, this fundamental, this eſſential truth—That there is a God.</p>
            <p>ALLOWING the Being and Perfections of God, we are next to prove that there is ſuch a thing as Religion.</p>
            <p>IN the laſt place we ſhall ſhow in what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects this Religion may be called Natural or the Religion of Nature.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vii" facs="unknown:012033_0005_0F897184C823E490"/>
THE firſt thing before us is, to prove the Being of a God, or that there is a Deity of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite perfection—I ſhall not take up much of your time upon this head, as I am not able to offer any arguments, but ſuch as will eaſily occur to your minds without any help of mine.</p>
            <p>"The high priori road" is, I fear, too intricate for men of common underſtanding, either when they attempt to find it out themſelves, or to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel in it when diſcovered by others—Theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted reaſonings become men of ſuch prodigious reach of thought as the late Dr. Clark, but even with the help of this clear and conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Reaſoner, the moſt are rather puzzled and confounded, than enlightned and eſtabliſhed by ſuch abſtract ſpeculations—"The argument a poſteriori", ſays that very great man, "is indeed by far the moſt generally uſeful argument, moſt eaſy to be underſtood, and in ſome degree ſuited to all capacities".</p>
            <p>THAT every Effect muſt have ſome cauſe is as plain and undeniable a truth as any axiom in Euclid. That the whole ſenſible univerſe is an Effect, we have all the evidence that the nature of the thing will admit. If it is not the effect of ſome cauſe, it muſt exiſt from Eternity: Now, ſays Dr. Clark, "whatever exiſts from Eternity and
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:012033_0006_0F89718574EE6658"/>without any external cauſe, is ſelf-exiſtent: What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is ſelf-exiſtent, muſt exiſt neceſſarily, by an abſolute neceſſity in the nature of the thing itſelf. It follows evidently, that unleſs the material world exiſts neceſſarily, by an abſolute neceſſity in its own nature, ſo as that it muſt be an expreſs contradiction to ſuppoſe it not to exiſt; it cannot be independent, and of itſelf eternal. Now that the materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al world doth not exiſt thus neceſſarily, is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry evident. For abſolute neceſſity of exiſting, and a poſſibility of not exiſting, being contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory ideas; it is manifeſt the material world can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not exiſt neceſſarily, if without a contradiction we can conceive it either not to be, or to be in any reſpect, otherwiſe than it now is. Than which, nothing is more eaſy. Every thing in it, both the whole and every one of its parts, their ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and motion, the form and alſo the matter, are the moſt arbitrary and dependent things, and fartheſt removed from neceſſity, that can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be imagined". We rationally conclude therefore that the univerſe is the effect of ſome powerful cauſe.</p>
            <p>THE ſtructure and conſtitution of the world, the accurate adjuſtment of its various parts, and the uſes and ends to which they are mutually adapted, prove this cauſe to be intelligent, wiſe and good.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="ix" facs="unknown:012033_0007_0F89718639004130"/>
THE two firſt of theſe attributes, I conclude, will readily be allowed. Poſſibly ſome may diſpute, whether the Goodneſs of God can be juſtly argued from the ſtate of things in this world, where there is ſuch a mixture of ſorrow, diſtreſs and miſery. But there is certainly a large ſhare of good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, enough to preponderate the evil there is in the univerſe, ſo far as it is known to us, and even if we leave out all conſideration of a future ſtate. The moſt enjoy a great degree of comfort, and would enjoy much more, were it not for their own irregular paſſions, and the faults and follies which are the conſequence of them. As bad as things are, there are very few, who are reduced to ſuch a ſtate of extreme miſery, as to be willing to exchange it for a ſtate of non-exiſtence, if this were in their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Who then can reaſonably diſpute the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God? eſpecially when we conſider, that ſo great and wiſe a Being as God is, hath with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt a large and extenſive plan; and poſſibly, at the winding up of the drama, thoſe things which are at preſent dark, may have a quite contrary aſpect.</p>
            <p>IT would not be difficult to prove the other moral perfections of the Deity, by arguments fetched from thoſe we have mentioned; or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, though we are obliged to think and ſpeak
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:012033_0008_0F897186F627F3E0"/>of them as diſtinct attributes in God, there is but one principle of action in him; all may be reduced to boundleſs intelligence or wiſdom; or, as Mr. Wollaſton calls it, "Divine Reaſon, which, as it exerts itſelf upon this or that occaſion, is by us variouſly denominated" Juſtice, Mercy, Truth, or whatever elſe goes to conſtitute moral perfection, or perfect moral conduct. An infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely pure Being muſt always propoſe to himſelf the beſt end in acting, and muſt know what are the beſt means to accompliſh that end; He can have no temptation to act contrary to what his wiſdom dictates; He cannot be under any undue influence, either from prejudice within, or deceit without; and if this allwiſe Being is alſo infinite in power, He muſt be an object of the higheſt confidence, or the greateſt fear; according as we have reaſon to think, He is our friend or our enemy; engaged to promote our happineſs, or determined to make us miſerable.</p>
            <p>To ſay that God has exerted his power or his wiſdom, ad ultimum poſſe, ſo that He can proceed no farther, is to ſay a great deal too much: But we may with reaſon aſſert, that he has diſcovered infinite wiſdom and infinite pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; or in other words, that none but a Being poſſeſſed of theſe perfections in the higheſt poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:012033_0009_0F897187B620DF60"/>degree could have created this ſtupendous univerſe. <note n="*" place="bottom">"The arrangement neceſſary, for the production of the ſmalleſt plant, requires in the cauſe a degree of power, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence and wiſdom, which infinitely tranſcends the ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt exertions of human ability. What then ſhall we ſay of the chuſe that produces an animal, a rational ſoul, a world, a ſyſtem of worlds, an univerſe? ſhall we ſay, that infinite pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and wiſdom are not neceſſary attributes, of that univerſal cauſe, though they be neceſſary attributes of the cauſe that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces a plant"? Profeſſor Beattie's eſſay on thenature and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutability of truth in oppoſition to for hiſtry and ſcepticiſm.</note>
            </p>
            <p>THAT we do not diſcern more wiſdom, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and goodneſs in the works of God, is not owing to any defect in them, but in us. The more we ſtudy and know of them, the more do we ſee of theſe perfections in their production. This is true not only of men whoſe capacities are weak, and who have but ſmall advantages to ſearch out the works of God, it is equally true of men of the moſt ſublime genius, who have the beſt opportunities to look into nature and to inquire after truth. The effect of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries is, a deeper ſenſe of their own igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and a more exalted thought of the Divine Excellence. This would be the caſe, if we ſhould contemplate the works of God through numberleſs ages, even to eternity. The reaſon we do not diſcern Infinite Perfection in the works of God, is, becauſe we cannot comprehend In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity.
<pb n="xii" facs="unknown:012033_0010_0F897188755CC828"/>The Apoſtle ſpeaking of the heathen ſays, <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Rom. 20.</note> "The inviſible things of God from," or ever ſince, "the creation of the world, are clearly ſeen, being underſtood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and godhead, ſo that they are without excuſe". His eternal power and godhead are underſtood by the things that are made, ſo far as they are underſtood; men are capable of underſtanding, of forming right conceptions of the nature and perfections of God from the things which He has made, if they duly conſider and attend to them. But though we might form right conceptions of Him by an attentive conſideration of his works, yet this great and glorious being can never be comprehended by a finite mind.</p>
            <p>THE evidence of the Being and Perfections of God from his works, is not only concluſive, but clear and level to the meaneſt capacity. It ſtrikes the mind with conviction, almoſt as ſoon as it is propoſed. The rudeſt barbarian, is no ſooner put upon thinking and reflecting, than he feels the abſurdity of ſuppoſing, that he himſelf and evey thing around him, were produced by chance, that is by nothing, a mere non-entity, that they were effects without a cauſe. He aſſents to the exiſtence of ſome powerful and
<pb n="xiii" facs="unknown:012033_0011_0F8971893441F9B8"/>deſigning mind, who made and preſerveth all things; and the more he looks into himſelf, contemplates the curious workmanſhip of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, the nature of the human ſoul, and the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing union which ſubſiſts between theſe two very different ſubſtances, ſo much the more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied he is that the concluſion is juſt. While he looks abroad and ſurveys the univerſe, wonders of wiſdom and power multiply upon him, and his faith continually gathers ſtrength. Evident marks of theſe Divine Perfections are to be ſeen in the adjuſtment of thoſe vaſt heavenly bodies, which preſent themſelves to the wondring ſight. With what exact order, harmony and beauty do they perform their ſeveral revolutions, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge their appointed functions! Or if we only traverſe the globe on which we dwell, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, how it is variegated with hills, valleys, plains, rivers, ſeas, which all have their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar uſe; the tribes of different animals with which it is ſtocked; the ſurprizing variety of trees, plants, and vegetables with which every part abounds, new ſcenes perpetually opening to the enquiring mind, it is impoſſible to doubt, the coucluſion is irreſiſtible, that there is One, and only One, great and adequate cauſe of all, and that this cauſe is God. There needs only common ſenſe and underſtanding to make this deduction—But there is this peculiar advantage
<pb n="xiv" facs="unknown:012033_0012_0F897189F3E66850"/>attending this argument, that the more cloſely we examine the conſtitution of the univerſe, and the greater diſcoveries we make of the works and laws of nature, the reaſoning from them grows ſtronger and approaches nearer to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration—A ſure evidence that it is founded in truth.</p>
            <p>THE Being and Perfections of God being once eſtabliſhed, it is not hard to prove that there is ſuch a thing as Religion—when I ſay there is ſuch a thing as Religion, I intend, that there are duties incumbent on man towards the Deity, which God hath a right to require of us, and which we are under obligations to perform. I obſerved in the beginning of the diſcourſe, that the very notion of Religion implies a regard to God: If we ſhould allow that moral good and evil do not depend on the will of God, yet there is nothing of religion in the beſt action, unleſs we have reſpect to God in doing it, unleſs we do it becauſe it is conformable to his will. God is a Being of infinite excellency, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of underſtanding and wiſdom; all creatures, received their being from Him, and depend con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly upon Him; they derive from his goodneſs all the benefits of which they partake, and it is He only that can ſupply their wants, or ſatisfy their deſires. On theſe accounts He has an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
<pb n="xv" facs="unknown:012033_0013_0F89718B7B068CC8"/>right of government, and it is the duty of the whole intelligent world to obey, ſerve and honor Him.</p>
            <p>GOD, having given us our reſpective capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and placed us in ſuch particular circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and relations, has hereby intimated to us, that it is his will we ſhould act agreably to them. A wiſe and good Being would not have confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red theſe capacities, and conſtituted theſe relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, without ſome wiſe and good deſign; and what deſign could He have, but to point out to them that method of conduct, which would be proper for them, and agreable to Him? And what makes it quite evident, that this was his deſign, is, that while we act agreably to the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in which He hath placed us, we promote our own felicity, whereas a contrary conduct tends to bring miſery on our ſelves, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce diſorder into the world. This therefore is the conſtitution of nature, or rather of the God of nature, from whence ariſes fitneſs and obligation.</p>
            <p>IT is fit and right that we ſhould act in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the will of an all perfect Being, whoſe will is rectitude itſelf, and who requires nothing of us, but what tends to make us like himſelf, who is the ſtandard of excellence. And to act other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is wrong.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xvi" facs="unknown:012033_0014_0F89718C7070A668"/>
IF it be aſked; what is it that makes this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity a duty? may we not as well enquire why two and two make four? why one quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity is greater than another? The underſtanding determines both. If men are ſceptical in theſe points, arguments will not cure them. A long ſeries of reaſoning will not make it clearer, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all, the mind is no more ſatisfied, and we are obliged often to return to the point from whence we firſt ſet out. Right in this caſe is a kind of ſimple perception. Reaſon and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence dictate that God is to be obeyed—We feel their authority. To renounce it is to offer vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to our underſtanding—"Right implies duty in its idea. To perceive that an action is right, is to ſee a reaſon for doing it. Now, this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, this acknowledged rectitude in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is the very eſſence of obligation; that which commands the approbation and choice, and binds the conſcience of every rational be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing". A creature to whom his Creator has grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the powers of reaſon and reflection, if he doth not improve theſe powers, or act agreably to the dictates of reaſon, doth not act as the being he is; he rebels againſt his Sovereign and Lord, and doth what he can, to defeat the deſign of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in bringing him into exiſtence.</p>
            <p>THERE are a variety of ways in which God may make known his will to us; whatever way He
<pb n="xvii" facs="unknown:012033_0015_0F89718CF4B73188"/>chooſes, the obligation is the ſame, it is our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to act in conformity to it. He who made us and conferred ſo many benefits upon us, hath an unlimited right to our homage and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; as it is quite certain, that a Being of ſuch abſolute rectitude can never require any thing, which is not agreable to his own perfect nature, or in other words, which is not right and fit.</p>
            <p>IT cannot be indifferent to this All-perfect Mind, whether his creatures act agreably to his will or not. "The righteous Lord loveth righteouſneſs". The ſame rectitude, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences his will and directs his requirements from his creatures, neceſſarily cauſes Him to be pleaſed when they do right, and diſpleaſed when they do wrong. And being poſſeſſed of uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolable power, it is reaſonable to conclude, that He will evidence his approbation and diſlike, by rewarding thoſe who do his will, and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe who do it not. This is what we call his moral government, which is his rendering to men according to their actions, whether they be good or evil. Something of this we ſee in this life, in the tendency which moral piety hath to produce happineſs; and in the evils which are often conſequent on our acting contrary to the nature and will of God. 'Tis true, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate, this diſtinction is not uniformly and
<pb n="xviii" facs="unknown:012033_0016_0F89718DB525D5C0"/>conſtantly maintained, according to men's moral or religious conduct. There is frequently a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuous diſpenſation of things, without any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent regard to the merit or demerit of charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Virtue and goodneſs fail of their proper ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine effect; while vice and wickedneſs not only eſcape the puniſhment, which the general nature and diſpoſition of things would lead us to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, but ſeem to triumph and proſper. From this view of things, it is a juſt and unavoidable concluſion, that there will be a future ſtate, when the perfection of God's moral government will be diſplayed; all the preſent inequalities will be ſet to rights; and He will appear to be holy, wiſe and good, beyond all diſpute and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
            <p>THE whole of this reaſoning is founded on the ſuppoſition that man acts freely; and upon any other ſuppoſition, it is idle to talk of moral go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, of rewards and puniſhments, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of religion or virtue. "That", ſays Mr. Wollaſton, "which hath not the opportunity or liberty of chuſing for itſelf, and acting accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, from an internal principle, acts, if it acts at all, under a neceſſity incumbent ab extra. But that, which acts thus, is in reality only an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument in the hand of ſomething which impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the neceſſity; and cannot properly be ſaid
<pb n="xix" facs="unknown:012033_0017_0F89718E76F07BD0"/>to act, but to be acted. The act muſt be the act of an agent, therefore not of his inſtrument. A Being under the above-mentioned inabilities is, as to the morality of its acts, in the ſtate of inert and paſſive matter, and can be but a machine; to which no language or philoſophy ever aſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed morals". <note n="*" place="bottom">"What is moral agency, and what is implied in it? This at leaſt muſt be implied in it, that we ought to do ſome things, and not to do others. But if every intention and action of my life is fixed by eternal laws, which I can neither elude nor alter, it is as abſurd to ſay to me, you ought to be honeſt to morrow, as to ſay, you ought to ſtop the nature of the planets to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. Unleſs ſome events depend on my determination, ought, and ought not, have no meaning when applied to me. Moral agency further implies, that we are accountable for our conduct, and that if we do what we ought not to do, we deſerve blame and puniſhment. My conſcience tells me, that I am accountable for thoſe actions only that are in my own power; and neither blames nor approves, in myſelf and in others, that conduct which is the effect, not of choice, but of neceſſity. Convince me that all my actions are equally neceſſary, and you ſilence my conſcience for ever, or at leaſt prove it to be a fallacious and impertinent monitor: You will then convince me that all circumſpection is unneceſſary, and all remorſe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd." Profeſſor BEATTIL's eſſay on truth.</note> The ſcheme of neceſſity in the actions of an intelligent being, or that all our volitions, determinations and actions proceed from God, as infruſtrable effects from their proper cauſe, hath hitherto been embraced by a very few, except inſidels, and thoſe of the moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant claſs, who have very conſiſtently given up the doctrine of future puniſhment. In this they
<pb n="xx" facs="unknown:012033_0018_0F89718F35E16178"/>diſcover that they have more juſt and honorary thoughts of God, than thoſe Chriſtians, who firſt make God the author of ſin, and then repreſent him as inflicting eternal puniſhment on men for it; for that which is originally, and in ſtrict conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion his own act. Mr. Howe calls it, "a black conception of God, that He ſhould be ſuppoſed irreſiſtibly to determine the will of man to the hatred of his own moſt bleſſed ſelf, and then to exact the ſevereſt puniſhments for the offence done. "We ſhould rather chuſe", ſays he, "to have our ſight, hearing, and motive power, or what not beſides, diſputed or even torn away from us, than ever ſuffer ourſelves to be diſputed in to a belief, that the holy and good God ſhould irreſiſtibly determine the wills of men to, and puniſh the ſame thing".</p>
            <p>IT is a concluſive argument againſt ſuch a fatal neceſſity as ſome men plead for, that it is contrary to the perceptions of the human mind,—we have a conſciouſneſs of liberty, we perceive no external influence, we have a moral ſenſe, we paſs a judgment on our own actions, approve or diſapprove our ſelves and others. It ſhows the difficulty, to which a very ſenſible writer <note n="*" place="bottom">Eſſays on the principles of morality and natural religion.</note> of the preſent day is reduced, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows this inward perception, that we are neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
<pb n="xxi" facs="unknown:012033_0019_0F89718FF5F57618"/>to think ourſelves and others free; and yet denies the reality of liberty. God has, according to him implanted a deluſive ſenſe in us, our feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is deceitful, the God of truth doth continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by a poſitive influence deceive and delude us. What ſtrange notions have ſome men of that glorious Being, all whoſe ways are truth, and who is righteous altogether! Is it not better to ſet limits to our enquiries, and to ſuppoſe there may be a miſtake in ſome curious ſpeculations, than to entertain ſentiments ſo diſhonorable to God, and ſo intirely ſubverſive of all moral go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment? I admire the modeſty, as well as goodneſs of heart, diſcovered by the great Mr. Locke, in one of his Letters to Mr. Molineux, "I freely own" ſays he, "the weakneſs of my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, that though it be unqueſtionable, that there is Omnipotence and Omniſcience in God our Maker, and I cannot have a clearer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of any thing, than that I am free; yet I cannot make freedom in man conſiſtent with Omnipotence and Omniſcience in God, though I am as fully perſuaded of both, as of any truths I moſt firmly aſſent to, and therefore I have long ſince left off the conſideration of the queſtion". <note n="*" place="bottom">Lock's works Vol 3. page 527.</note>
            </p>
            <p>IF ſome of our modern reaſoners, who have not a tenth part of his underſtanding, had a little more of his humility, the world would be free
<pb n="xxii" facs="unknown:012033_0020_0F897190B5920128"/>from thoſe angry diſputes about fate and free-will, liberty and neceſſity, which puzzle the heads, but ſeldom mend the hearts, of thoſe who engage in them.</p>
            <p>I have ſaid—There is a God—That there is Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion—I am now to conſider in what ſenſe this Religion is called Natural. And it is thus denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, not becauſe men diſcover it in the ſole exerciſe of their natural faculties and powers; but becauſe it hath its foundation in the Perfections of God, and in that conſtitution of nature which he has eſtabliſhed, or which ariſes from the mutual relation between God and His creature Man. God having made us the beings we are, intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent rational creatures, and having fixed our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſituation, there ariſe certain fitneſſes and obligations, which conſtitute the law of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. This is the law of Him who is the author of our being; to act agreable to that, is therefore to obey God, which conſtitutes it Religion. And to obey a law, which reſults, not from the poſitive will of God, but from the nature He hath given to man, is to him natural religion. This religion is immutably the ſame, the law of our nature can never ceaſe to oblige, nor can it ever be right to act in contradiction to it. "The nature of God is unchangeable, the original relations wherein we ſtand in to Him are alſo unchangeable, and the
<pb n="xxiii" facs="unknown:012033_0021_0F8971917493DE90"/>duties thence reſulting are ſtill owing to Him, and ever will be. Man muſt ever be bound to own his glorious perfections, to pay Him venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion love and praiſe, on account of them, and to endeavor after a reſemblance to Him in his moral excellencies". Having received our being from God, and entirely depending upon Him, we are bound to own Him as Maker, Preſerver; Lord and Ruler; to make the utmoſt returns of gratitude and love; to pray to Him for what we want, to praiſe Him for what we enjoy; to commit ourſelves and our affairs to his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal; to be reſigned to his will, ſubmit to His government, and yield obedience to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, whenever, and however, He is pleaſed to ſignify his mind to us. Theſe duties ariſe from the neceſſary relations between a Creator and a creature; between a being who is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually conferring benefits, and one who is as conſtantly receiving them.</p>
            <p>THE Religion of Nature, doth not depend on the conceptions we may form of God, or the apprehenſions we have of our duty to Him. Men may have very falſe and unworthy notions of a Deity, they may make many miſtakes in religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or about the duties which God requires of them. But the miſtakes they make do not alter he nature of things. God is the ſame, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="xxiv" facs="unknown:012033_0022_0F897192361B6120"/>we conceive aright of Him or not: Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is the ſame, whether we form juſt notions of it or not: The obligations we are under to obey God are the ſame, whether we obey Him or not.</p>
            <p>THE Chriſtian Religion is contained in the book we call the Bible; it remains the ſame whether men attend to it or not, whether they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it or not, whether they act agreably to it or not. The Bible is the ſtandard; the rule to which Chriſtians are to appeal, in all differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of opinion and practice. In like manner, the religion of nature is written in the book of nature, in the works of God; man may read there the being and perfections of God. "The heavens declare the glory of God; and the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament ſheweth his handy work; day unto day uttereth ſpeech; and night unto night ſheweth knowlege; there is no ſpeech nor language where their voice is not heard". The truths which the heavens declare are always the ſame, the religion they teach doth not alter and change according to our apprehenſions and prejudices; it is quite independent of our notions and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions; and remains ſteady and permanent, whether we attend to it or not. Indeed, every thing in religion, which approves itſelf to the unprejudiced reaſon of man, is undoubtedly a part
<pb n="xxv" facs="unknown:012033_0023_0F897192F3EE1140"/>of natural religion; but there is ſuch a thing as truth and duty, whether they are diſcovered to us or not, whether our reaſon is exerciſed about them or not. This religion, which is taught by the natural order and conſtitution of things, all men are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable in ſome degree of knowing, of embrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and practicing. "The Gentiles which have not the law, are a law unto themſelves, which ſhew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conſcience alſo bearing witneſs, and their thoughts the mean while accuſing or elſe excuſing one another". <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Rom. 14, 15.</note> What the apoſtle Paul evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intends, is, that all intelligent creatures are ſubjects of law; that reaſon implies duty; that man hath a capacity to diſtinguiſh between good and evil; and is conſcious that he is bound to practice the one, and to avoid the other. "What is intended," ſays the pious Mr. Hallyburton, "may be reduced to theſe two aſſertions, viz. That men are born with ſuch faculties, which cannot, after they are capable of exerciſing them, but admit the obligation and binding force of ſome, at leaſt, of the laws of nature, when they are fairly offered to their thoughts. And that man is ſo ſtated, that he cannot miſs occaſions of thinking of, or coming to the knowledge of thoſe laws of nature. The Gentiles, all of them, do
<pb n="xxvi" facs="unknown:012033_0024_0F897193B5D82A18"/>by nature thoſe things, that is, the material part of thoſe duties, which the law of nature enjoins; which ſhews the work of the law, or ſome part of it, at leaſt, to be written in their hearts, ſince they do ſome things it enjoins: I do not think that this writing of the law imports innate ideas, or innate actual knowledge; neither the apoſtle's ſcope nor words oblige us to this". nor doth it imply, that the will of God in it's full extent is immediately clear and evident to men.</p>
            <p>ONE would imagine by the exalted terms in which ſome men ſpeak of the light of nature, that the whole ſyſtem of moral truth aroſe ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneouſly in the mind of man, without any help at all; that he had need only to open his eyes, in order to have a right diſcernment of the perfections of God, and a compleat view of all the duty we owe him.</p>
            <p>IT is doubtful, whether the original progenitors of the human race, however perfect in their kind they are repreſented, had ſuch an intire acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with moral truth, as to need no inſtruction from their Maker. It is hardly probable, that they had ſuch exalted powers, and ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive view of divine truth, as ſome have aſcribed to them. There is no accounting for their ſo eaſy defection from their original ſtate, if we ſuppoſe this to be the caſe. Perhaps we
<pb n="xxvii" facs="unknown:012033_0025_0F897194C1FD8580"/>ſhall carry our thoughts of human nature, in it's firſt conſtitution, as high as the ſcripture warrants; if we ſuppoſe, that the underſtanding and other powers were adjuſted to the law, under which man was placed. He had the ſame paſſions and appetites that men have now; but being free from all moral blemiſhes and defects, he was able to reſtrain and govern them, and to make them conducive to the enjoyment of greater good. His reaſon was ſufficient, with the helps he might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from his Creator, to direct his moral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and to raiſe him to that exalted happineſs, which his rank in the ſcale of beings qualified him for. But he was to come to the perfection of his nature by degrees; and had he ſtood the trial appointed by his Maker, he would have conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly improved, in the knowlege of God and of the divine law; and have made continual approaches to that glorious Being, who is the ſtandard of perfection.</p>
            <p>MAN is evidently at preſent in a ſtate of degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, we ſee only the ruins of an excellent and noble creature. If we had no help from revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it would be a rational deduction from the ſtate in which we find ourſelves, that human nature is not in all reſpects the ſame it once was; that mankind are in a fallen, as they certainly are in a weak and depraved ſtate. Man is ſtill an intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
<pb n="xxviii" facs="unknown:012033_0026_0F89719655198510"/>creature, he is capable of thinking and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting, of judging of truth and falſhood, of diſtinguiſhing between right and wrong; but the candle of the Lord gives but a dim and feeble light. Man, through inattention and corruption, or ſome other cauſe, if left to himſelf, would certainly attain to very little knowlege of God or his duty. Reaſon is blinded by a thouſand paſſions, and we often act in direct contradiction to it. Yea, ſo great is the darkneſs which has overſpread the human mind, that we ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times "call evil good, and good evil".</p>
            <p>THOSE men, who talk in ſuch high ſtrains of the light of nature, and who affirm with ſo much confidence, that all, "even the moſt ignorant and illiterate of the human race, have naturally and neceſſarily a clear and intimate perception of the whole of religion and their duty", <note n="*" place="bottom">Chriſtianity as old as the Creation.</note> forget that they were once children, and by what gradual ſteps they arrived to the degree of knowlege, to which they have attained, and of which they are ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to boaſt. The moſt acute Philoſopher at his firſt entrance into life, had ſcarce any ideas or conſciouſneſs at all. He who afterwards makes the moſt diſtinguiſhed figure among the great and wiſe men of the earth, is, when born, as much an infant in knowlege and underſtanding, as in
<pb n="xxix" facs="unknown:012033_0027_0F897196B4D42F68"/>ſtature and in ſpeech. He knows not the uſe of the various parts of his body, is incapable of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the objects around him, or of providing for his own neceſſities; much leſs is he capable of contemplating the works of God, of forming any conceptions of his Being and Perfections. Moſt of the knowlege he gets is by the help of others, and from the tuition and inſtruction he receives in ſociety. Many truths, which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated by others, and which we ſee to be quite agreable to reaſon, we might never have thought of, if we had been left wholly to our ſelves, and had received no aſſiſtance or inſtruction from abroad. We neceſſarily aſſent to mathematical truths, when we ſee them demonſtrated; and yet we have not any innate knowledge of them, they do not ariſe ſpontaneouſly in our minds, and only a very few have any acquaintance at all with them.</p>
            <p>THE great truths of Religion are founded in the reaſon and nature of things. Man hath na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural powers capable of ſeeing and approving theſe truths; by a diligent uſe and improvement of theſe powers, he may make great proficiency in knowlege, not only of the things of nature, but of the things of God and Religion. The powers of human nature have never been carried to their higheſt pitch: It is very poſſible it may arrive to
<pb n="xxx" facs="unknown:012033_0028_0F8971977B2DAC68"/>higher degrees of perfection, than any meer man hath ever attained to. But whatever men's natural powers are, or whatever they are capable of attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to, if they do not exerciſe theſe powers, and have no aſſiſtance from thoſe about them, their knowlege will be confined within a very narrow compaſs. We may be ignorant of ſelf-evident truths, if we do not attend to them; much more may we be ignorant of the truths of Natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, if we do not exerciſe our minds about them. If we are of our ſelves capable of diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering theſe truths in their full extent, a point not ſo clear as ſome think it, they muſt be diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not by intuition, but by cloſe application and a courſe of reaſoning. Men are bound, by dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent ſtudy and enquiry, to endeavor to know what God requires of them, and to practice the whole of their duty. They ought alſo to improve all thoſe aſſiſtances and helps which are afforded them. A neglect, which proceeds from voluntary ignorance, is as really a crime, as if we had known our Lord's will and did it not.</p>
            <p>BUT whatever powers man is poſſeſſed of, and how agreable ſoever the truths of religion are to pure and unprejudiced reaſon, it is impoſſible to determine, how much or how little acquaintance man would have had with moral truths, by his own natural light, without inſtruction. Certainly
<pb n="xxxi" facs="unknown:012033_0029_0F89719843F8BD28"/>many of the heathen loſt ſome which we eſteem among the firſt principles of Religion. "They changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and four-footed beaſts, and creeping things". <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Rom. 23.</note>
            </p>
            <p>IT is by no means fair to conclude, that man would, by the meer ſtrength of reaſon, have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigated all that we can now prove to be ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. Nor doth it follow, becauſe we are capable of finding out a truth, that therefore we ſhould cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly have found it out. The corruptions of the human heart often, where they have the aſcendant, make them indolent with reſpect to the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their minds; at leaſt, they might have kept us from ſearching out ſuch truths as would be diſagreable and unpleaſant to us; or if we had, by the exerciſe of our reaſoning powers, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered ſomething of the nature of moral virtue, if we were brought to ſee the difference between right and wrong; it is likely they would have been meer ſpeculations. Reaſon alone could ſcarce have ſet moral truths before us, in ſo ſtrong and amiable a light, as to have captivated our ſouls with its charms, overcome our corruptions, and brought us to a univerſal conformity to the nature and will of God. Mere conjectural diſcoveries, or ſurmiſes built on ſubtle ſpeculations, are not
<pb n="xxxii" facs="unknown:012033_0030_0F897198F64BE700"/>firm enough to eſtabliſh ſuch a perſuaſion of truth as would influence the mind to univerſal and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant holineſs, in oppoſition to its own corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the enticements and temptations of an evil world. It muſt be a full ſatisfying and abiding conviction of the truth, that hath ſuch powerful effects; a conviction too clear to be produced by unaſſiſted reaſon however impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
            <p>BUT if we ſuppoſe, that we might, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of reaſon, arrive at the cleareſt view of the moral beauty there is in right action, or the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs there is in the practice of virtue, yet I much queſtion, whether according to the preſent conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of our natures, any abſtract ideas of the fitneſs or unfitneſs of things would produce a right moral conduct. A ſenſe of moral beauty, or of the excellency of holineſs, is of great uſe to a good mind; but it never was deſigned to be our only principle of action, in this ſtate of trial. I own our natures would be more excellent, if a love of goodneſs were alone a ſufficient incitement to do right; it is likely this is the caſe with ſome of the creatures above us; and poſſibly our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures may riſe to this. We are capable now of diſcerning the intrinſic fitneſs of things, and of being moved by it; this capacity may gradually increaſe, till it ſwallow up all other motives. The more we ſee of God, and converſe with him, the more we
<pb n="xxxiii" facs="unknown:012033_0031_0F897199B5804618"/>ſhall become like Him in his holineſs and his happineſs. At preſent, our nature is very much conſtituted of appetites and paſſions, which move us to action. So it was at firſt, "The woman ſaw", ſays the ſacred Hiſtorian, ſpeaking of Eve, "that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleaſant to the eyes". The motives to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, which God ſaw fit to propoſe to Adam, were addreſſed to his hopes and fears. "In the day thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely die". The threatning implied a promiſe, that if he did not eat, he ſhould live—and certainly we do not need ſuch arguments leſs in our preſent ſtate, than man did in a ſtate of innocence.</p>
            <p>IF man was ſo conſtituted in his primaeval ſtate, as to be influenced by his hopes and fears, we are not to ſuppoſe he will be governed by higher motives now; at leaſt not by higher mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives only. But if we take man without a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular revelation from God, what is there to excite his hopes?—Let us allow, that by the ſtrength of his own powers, and without any communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations from above, he hath conceived juſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God and of his law; for if his notions are not juſt, all inferences from them are but idle imaginations; but if his notions are juſt, the leaſt reflection will convince him, that he hath in many inſtances tranſgreſſed the law of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="xxxiv" facs="unknown:012033_0032_0F89719A745771D0"/>which is the law of God; that he hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed himſelf to the juſt diſpleaſure of a Being, whoſe arm none can reſiſt. And what reaſon hath he to think God will paſs by his offence and receive him into favor?</p>
            <p>IF from the promiſcuous diſpenſation of things in the preſent ſtate, he infers that there will be a future ſtate of retribution, wherein a difference will be made according to men's moral conduct, yet reaſon alone could not make it certain, that God would reward any obedience which man now yields; as he yields none, that is not mingled with a great deal of imperfection and ſin. All are ſinners, all may therefore expect to be treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as ſinners; they who have ſinned more than others, may juſtly expect greater puniſhment. But how any can upon the principles of reaſon be certain of a reward, becauſe they have not been ſo bad as ſome others, I cannot ſee. The light of nature cannot aſſure us, that God will forgive a ſinner upon his repentance; of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence he hath no encouragement to repent; and if he hath no encouragement to repent, there is no reaſon to ſuppoſe he will repent. It is more likely, that, if he reflects on his ſtate, he will ſink under a ſenſe of his guilt, and an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of puniſhment. Such would probably be the caſe, if men had juſt ſentiments of God
<pb n="xxxv" facs="unknown:012033_0033_0F89719B36596808"/>and his law, without any intimation from Him, that He would pardon their tranſgreſſions and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore them to favor.</p>
            <p>You will ſay perhaps, that the Heathen have had ſome perſuaſion of a future ſtate of rewards and puniſhments; but I fear, if the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will afford no better evidence of future re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards than the Heathen have had, moral virtue or religion will receive but little aſſiſtance from it. Alas! what dark and confuſed notions have they entertained! how groſs and ſenſual their repreſentations of future happineſs! ſuch as we evidently ſee to be unworthy of God, and no way calculated to convey reſt to the mind of man. Their good men after this life, remember their griefs, and are afflicted with the enmities they contracted here; their exerciſes and enjoyments are ſuited to a bodily ſtate, rather than to a ſtate of pure ſpirits.</p>
            <p>If here and there an eminent Philoſopher had more rational conceptions of theſe things, yet no one acquainted with the hiſtory of the world, even of the politer nations, will pretend, that this was the caſe with the body of the people. Even their wiſeſt Philoſophers had rather a ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, than a full perſuaſion of a future ſtate; and "yet ſtedfaſtneſs ſeems of abſolute neceſſity in
<pb n="xxxvi" facs="unknown:012033_0034_0F89719BF6789868"/>this caſe, ſince a reſpect to the recompence of the reward muſt be always prevalent, in order to influence to a ſteady purſuit". Agreably you ſeldom find their beſt and wiſeſt men fetching any conſolation from the ſtate of reſt which remaineth for good men; their exhortations to virtue are not enforced by this; if they believed the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of future rewards themſelves, yet they did not think it worth while to perſuade others into a belief of it. For want of this argument, how fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid and jejune are all their exhortations to virtue! Even the diſcourſes of a Seneca or a Cicero have not a tendency to warm our hearts, like the una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned addreſſes of a plain unlettered Chriſtian, who is acquainted with the ſacred ſcriptures, and the powerful motives of the Goſpel. How much better notions of morality hath a common Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, who at all attends to the precepts of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, or even a modern Deiſt, who is acquainted with the Bible, than the wiſeſt ſages of antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty! How much clearer his views of a future ſtate! The Goſpel makes that certain, which, without it, is but a dark conjecture.</p>
            <p>BESIDES, the revelation with which God hath favored us, teaches how He can be juſt and yet juſtify the ſinner; it opens the myſteries of redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing love and grace; it contains the moſt graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous declarations of God's readineſs to pardon the
<pb n="xxxvii" facs="unknown:012033_0035_0F89719D9404B5C8"/>penitent believer; it offers the moſt gracious aſſiſtance, and promiſes the moſt glorious rewards. By the help of this, we know many truths, which unaſſiſted reaſon never would have taught us; and we underſtand the truths of natural religion, much better than we could have underſtood them without this help. By means of revelation, we are capable of making a much better uſe of reaſon, than we could have made without it.</p>
            <p>THERE is nothing in Chriſtianity that is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to reaſon. God never did, He never can, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize a religion oppoſite to it, becauſe this would be to contradict himſelf. The Goſpel is not deſigned to abrogate the Religion of Nature, it always ſuppoſes an eternal rule of righteouſneſs, from which man had deviated, and by which he was condemned. Man had rebelled againſt his Maker and Lord; had renounced his dependence on God, and ſet himſelf up in oppoſition to Him; in all which he acted contrary to the Religion of Nature. The deſign of the Goſpel was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him to a right ſtate, to bring him to live on God, to ſubmit to his authority, to reſign to his will, and to rely upon him for every good thing.</p>
            <p>UNDER this diſpenſation God appears in a new character, in a new relation, as the God and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="xxxviii" facs="unknown:012033_0036_0F89719E94A22290"/>of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as a God pardoning iniquity tranſgreſſion and ſin. This was a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter in which the Deity could not appear, till man had ſinned, it was a diſcovery of ſomething in his nature, which neither Men nor Angels had before any conception of. From this new cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, or new relation, ariſe new obligations, and new duties; duties which there could be no place for, while man was in a ſtate of innocence, but which are perfectly adapted to his ſtate as a ſinner. This is by no means contrary to the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of Nature. It is perfectly agreable to it, that we ſhould conform to every new diſcovery which God makes of himſelf, and attend to every new intimation of his will.</p>
            <p>To give credit to a divine teſtimony; to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to a meſſenger ſent by God; to accept of pardon in his way, which is moſt wiſe and good, and approves itſelf to the reaſon of man, all this is perfectly agreable to every principle of Natural Religion. Nothing is more contrary to truth, than to repreſent faith and repentance as poſitive duties, they are founded in reaſon, they are the reſult of that relation in which we ſtand to God and Jeſus Chriſt, and are exactly ſuited to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent apoſtate ſtate.</p>
            <p>THE Religion of Nature then, is the ſame it
<pb n="xxxix" facs="unknown:012033_0037_0F89719EF567D060"/>ever was, and "Chriſtianity is this very Religion, with ſome wiſe and merciful additions, accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated to the ſtate of mankind as ſinners". The Goſpel adopts the whole law of nature, it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains it, enjoins conformity to it, adds new obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to obedience; and at the ſame time pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides and offers the kindeſt helps, to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of what it requires.</p>
            <p>SOME may poſſibly object, that I am diſcourſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Revealed Religion, when my buſineſs was to treat of that which is Natural. But how is it poſſible to give you any tolerable view of Natural Religion, without recurring to Revelation? "Who is there, ſays Mr. Locke, that ever did or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to give the law of nature to us all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, as a law, no more, nor no leſs, than what is contained in, and had the obligation of, that law? who ever made out all the parts of it, put them together, and ſhewed the world their obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations? where was there any ſuch Code, that mankind might have recourſe to, as their unerring rule, before our Savior's time". <note n="*" place="bottom">Locke's reaſonableneſs of the Chriſtian Religion.</note>
            </p>
            <p>BESIDES, what is "the proper uſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of Natural Religion", the ſubject ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly appointed for this Lecture by the pious Founder, but to lead you to that which is Reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
<pb n="xl" facs="unknown:012033_0038_0F89719FB5A9DAA0"/>To what purpoſe ſhould we diſcourſe of the obligations of Natural Law, if we could not lead you to the merciful diſcoveries of the Goſpel? this would be to throw diſcouragements in your way. He that reaſons juſtly upon the principles of Natural Religion, and goes no further, I will not ſay, muſt deſpair, but muſt have many doubts and ſuſpicions of ever obtaining the divine favor. In this reſpect "the law is our ſchool-maſter to bring us to Chriſt". The doctrine of the atonement and of juſtification by the merits and righteouſneſs of Chriſt, not only ſees the divine character in the cleareſt light; but gives the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt encouragement to repentance and obedience. "If thou, Lord, ſhouldeſt mark iniquity, O Lord, who ſhall ſtand? but there is forgiveneſs with thee, that thou mayeſt be feared." <note n="*" place="bottom">130 Pſal. 3, 4.</note>
            </p>
            <p>FURTHER, If Natural Religion is no more than has been found out by the natural powers of man, if we are not to include any thing that hath come to us by revelation, who is able to draw the line, and to ſhew exactly which truths have been diſcovered by reaſon, or the mere light of nature, and which have come to us by revelation? It is probable at leaſt, that God firſt inſtructed men in the principles of religion, or taught them the law by which they were to be governed;
<pb n="xli" facs="unknown:012033_0039_0F8971A079889B70"/>and that their deſcendants, in all parts of the world, have received by tradition and education, ſome degree of that light and knowlege, which was communicated to their progenitors from the Deity himſelf. And if this was the caſe, and no one can determine it was not, then we muſt ſay, that there is no natural religion at all, or that its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing revealed doth not make it ceaſe to be natural. If a law is founded in nature; and God, inſtead of leaving us to find it out by ſtudy and applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is pleaſed kindly to make it known to us by revelation, will that make it ceaſe to be a law of nature? if we may call that natural religion, which we receive by inſtruction from our parents and others; why may we not call that natural reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which we are taught by our Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? <note n="*" place="bottom">"Nature is nothing but the ſettled Divine conſtitution, fixing the way in, and the means by which He conveys his grace, or which is the ſame thing in which He exerts his creating and ſupporting power, and whatever order He ſees fit to eſtabliſh for this purpoſe is nature, and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution is the Law of Nature".
<p>A view of the Law of Nature, written, it is ſaid, by Dr. Ricaltoun.</p>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>HOWEVER Chriſtianity comes to us; or how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſupernatural the way in which it was origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally communicated; it ſo far coincides with the Religion of Nature, that it is founded in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of God, and is perfectly conſonant to the reaſon of man.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xlii" facs="unknown:012033_0040_0F8971A135AF6C68"/>
I KNOW it is ſaid, that "were we not capable of diſtinguiſhing good from evil, or knowing from the conſideration of the invariable perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God, what the divine goodneſs could command or forbid his creatures, antecedently to any external revelation, we could not diſtinguiſh the true inſtituted religion from the many falſe ones". <note n="†" place="bottom">Chriſtianity as old as the Creation.</note> But this reaſoning is founded upon a miſtake, it ſuppoſes that when men have once corrupted religion, they are left intirely without remedy. The capacity of thinking and reaſoning, with which God hath diſtinguiſhed man, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it hath been neglected or perverted, will, whenever he is led to make a proper uſe of it, enable him to diſtinguiſh between true and falſe religion. There is no neceſſity of ſuch a previous comprehenſive knowlege of God, or of good and evil. It is not of ſo great importance, whether men have antecedently reaſoned juſtly or not, or indeed whether they have reaſoned at all. If they are awakened to attend to a religion propoſed to them, and to examine it with impartiality and care, they are capable of diſtinguiſhing between right and wrong, and of perceiving whether this religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is worthy of God. A revelation from God may ſet many truths and duties before them, which
<pb n="xliii" facs="unknown:012033_0041_0F8971A1F5F9FA58"/>were before unknown, and yet when preſented to their minds, may appear perfectly agreable to their reaſon and underſtanding; otherwiſe when men have once formed wrong notions of religion, it is impoſſible they ſhould correct their errors, and reaſon becomes for ever unprofitable.</p>
            <p>BUT what ſhall we ſay of the Heathen, who have no written revelation? By what rule will they be judged? and what will be their ſtate after this life? ſuch inquiries are too bold and preſumptuous, "ſecret things belong unto the Lord our God, but thoſe things which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed belong unto us and to our children". It is certain the moſt ignorant have ſome rule, however they came by it, and they will be judged by the rule which they have, and not by that which they have not. It is evident that the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then have ſome notion of expiation and forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as well as ſome knowlege of God, and of the diſtinction between virtue and vice; both are imperfect, and it may be ſaid of them, that "they hold the truth in unrighteouſneſs", and with ſuch a mixture of ignorance and uncertainty, as that it can afford but little reſt to their minds. But we may aſſure ourſelves that the Judge of all the earth will do right; and that He will ſo order things, that none of mankind will have any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="xliv" facs="unknown:012033_0042_0F8971A2B5A8B1C0"/>to complain. If the Heathen have no hope of the ſalvation, which the Goſpel promiſes; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are they expoſed to that damnation, which it threatens to thoſe who deſpiſe and reject it. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of puzzling our ſelves with ſuch curious inquiries, let us fear leſt this ſhould be our "con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, that light is come into the world, but we have loved darkneſs rather than light, becauſe our deeds have been evil".</p>
            <p>WE, in this favored land, are lift up to Heaven, with reſpect to our ſpiritual privileges; we have many and great advantages to know our Maſter's will; we have the ſcriptures which are able to make us wiſe unto ſalvation; we have ſingular helps to underſtand them; we have line upon line, and precept upon precept. As to means nothing is wanting. We ought often to think of that moſt equitable rule, by which our Savior aſſures us the Great God will conduct himſelf. <note n="*" place="bottom">12 Luke 48.</note> "Unto whomſoever much is given, of him ſhall be much required".</p>
            <p>You, my Young Friends, who are ſo happy, as to have your education in this Seat of Learning, have a moſt valuable price put into your hands, an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity

We take pleaſure in your literary accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, theſe things are well worthy your atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and diligent application.
