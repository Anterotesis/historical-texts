            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

recovered from the Ruins of the Apoſtacy, and re-admitted into the Family of Heaven, it is by ſlow Degrees that we attain to a State of Felicity and Glory. We muſt paſs through a tedious Pilgrimage, before we arrive at our deſtin'd Home: We muſt endure many ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings upon Earth, before we enter into celeſtial Joy.</p>
            <p>THIS is the Appointment of God, and found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Nature of Men, for the beſt of Saints upon Earth, are <hi>ſanctified but in part:</hi> Upon this Account their Happineſs is far from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete: Theſe Tabernacles of Clay muſt ſuffer a Diſſolution, before we ſhall be prepared for the Viſion and Enjoyment of an holy God. When we take Farewel of Sin, we ſhall bid an eternal Adieu to Sorrow.</p>
            <p>IN the mean Time, the moſt extenſive Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals of Salvation are made to Mankind: Thoſe who cordially accept of this Salvation, are made partakers of its important Bleſſings: Theſe are the intereſting Truths contain'd in that Paſſage of Scripture, which has now been read unto you, and which by <hi>Divine Permiſſion,</hi> will be the Subject of ſeveral Diſcourſes.— The Deſign of my preſent Diſcourſe, is to explain the Nature of that Salvation which is revealed in the Goſpel—and the whole will be comprehended under the following Heads.—</p>

               <head>FIRST, It implies, that thoſe who are made Partakers of this Salvation, were in a State of Guilt and Miſery.</head>
               <p>TO ſave, in ſtrict Propriety of Speech, is to reſcue a Perſon from a Danger to which he is expoſed; or deliver him from a Calamity in which he is involved —Upon this Account the Eternal SON OF GOD, when He appeared upon Earth in the <hi>Faſhion of a Man,</hi> aſſumed the Character of a SAVIOUR—<hi>His Name was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi> JESUS, <hi>becauſe He come to ſave His People from their Sins</hi> —He aſſures us the Deſign of his Miſſion, was, <hi>ſo ſeek and ſave them that were loſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ANGELS are perfectly happy, but never men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned among the Number of the ſaved; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they never violated the Purity of their Nature, but always maintained their primitive Innocence.

Danger; but taſte unmingled Felicity and Joy. —But Man is fallen from his original Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and plunged into an Abyſs of Miſery. Having departed from God, he is deprived of the amiable Image of the Deity; and become a Prey to the moſt infamous Appetites. A deluded Underſtanding leads him into endleſs Mazes of Error and Folly: He purſues a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing Shadow, and deſpiſes the true Felicity of his Nature: Captivated with the Charms of Senſe, he neglects the Purity and Perfection of his immortal Spirit: Dazzled with a gav Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, he follows every glittering Phantom: Corrupted in his moral Taſte, he ruſhes into the Embraces of the moſt polluting Pleaſures: Unmindful of his heavenly Birth, his Affections are chained down to the Enjoyments of this inferior Earth: Seduced by flattering Dreams, he ſleeps on ſecurely, till the Light of Eternity diſcovers the fatal Miſtake—So ſtrong is the Deception while Men remain under the Power of depraved Nature, that we imagine ourſelves free, even when we are the moſt paſſive Slaves. We hug our Chains, as if they were the nobleſt Ornaments. With thoughtleſs Gaiety, we tread the beaten Road that leads to Death and Hell. —To finiſh our Unhappineſs, our Maker is offended; <hi>his Wrath is revealed from Heaven againſt</hi> us; the Sentence of his righteous Law condemns us to eternal Death.—To what Sanctuary ſhall we fly in this loſt and deſperate State?—Can we bribe inexorable Juſtice—Can

               <p>IN this melancholy Situation, a Reprieve muſt be acknowledged a Favor; a Mitigation of our Puniſhment an unmerited Mercy; but the glad Tidings of Deliverance, one would think, muſt be received with Tranſports of Gratitude.—To publiſh this Good News is the Deſign of the Goſpel; and the whole Number of the ſaved attend to the conſolatory Meſſage with an humble Faith.—As a neceſſary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of this—</p>

               <p>BUT how can this be?—Do not true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers inhabit a World of Sorrow? Are they not defiled with innumerable Corruptions? Is not Satan continually diſturbing their Peace? Does not the World with it's treacherous Smiles, frequently betray Men into Sin? Do they not groan under the Burden of various Afflictions? Muſt they not ſubmit to the Empire of Death? Are not their Bodies, the Workmanſhip of the Almighty, by an irrevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Decree, condemned to become the <hi>Food of Worms?</hi>—Are theſe the Advantages which the Son of God hath purchaſed for his favorite People?—Is this the Salvation deſcribed with ſuch Pomp and Magnificence in the Goſpel?—</p>
               <p>I GRANT, my Brethren, upon Earth we do not receive our perfect Conſummation in Bliſs. This Event will not take Place till the Day of Chriſt's ſecond Appearance, in the Glory and Grandeur of an incarnate God; in the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Univerſal Judge of Angels and Men. —Then our adorable Redeemer will manifeſt the Fulneſs of his ſaving Power, compleat the Deſigns of his almighty Love, and eſtabliſh his People in a State of immutable Felicity and Glory.—But, upon Earth, we receive the firſt

               <p>THE faithful Diſciples of Chriſt, were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to this Salvation, in the eternal Counſels of God. <hi>In the Fulneſs of Time.</hi> JESUS the Saviour paid the Price of their Redemption to <hi>the uttermoſt Farthing.</hi> By his all ſufficient Merits, he purchaſed for them the Honor and Happineſs of the Sons of God.

Vain Man would be wiſer than God and attempts to regain his forfeited Felicity by his own Strength. Inſtead of acknowledging his Dependance on ſovereign Grace, he ſeeks for Something in Himſelf, that ſhall placate his offended Maker.

            <div n="1" type="part">
               <head>FIRST. WHAT is intended by GRACE.</head>
               <p>GRACE ſignifies a free Favor, not granted to Merit—not founded on ſuperior Excellence —but flowing from unpurchaſed Benevolence. That Angels are adorned with the noble Perfections of their Nature, placed in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Sanctuary, preſerved in their primitive Integrity, and made the favorite Miniſters of

Divine Providence, muſt be aſcribed to unme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited Grace. No Creature can challenge any Thing of the Creator: All their Excellencies flow from his diſintereſted Goodneſs.</p>
               <p>ADAM was made an Inhabitant of Paradiſe, advanced to the Government of this lower World, by the ſame free Favor. All the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of his Nature, and the Advantages of his Situation, were the Effects of pure Goodneſs. —But when Man loſt the Glory of his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and became a guilty Criminal—then the Triumphs of Grace appeared in the moſt illuſtrious Point of Light.—Innocent Man had nothing to claim from his Maker, but what flow'd from his gracious Promiſe—and ſinful Man had every Thing to fea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> from his offended Sovereign, whoſe Favors he had abuſed.— When, therefore, God delivers us from the Puniſhment we had deſerved, and reſtores us to the Privileges we had forfeited, it is not <hi>only Grace,</hi> but <hi>the Riches of Grace.</hi> He beſtows his Favors on thoſe who are ſo far from having any Excellency to recommend them, that their Guilt juſtly expoſes them to his ſevereſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure.</p>
               <p>THIS is that GRACE, which the Apoſtle celebrates in the Words of my Text—This reſcues us from the Tyranny of Satan—the Dominion of Sin—the Puniſhment of Death.— This reſtores guilty Criminals to the Favor of

If therefore Almighty Grace had not contrived a Way to anſwer the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Juſtice, every Sinner of the human Race muſt have fallen a Sacrifice to it's righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Claims.—That Juſtice which expelled the apoſtate Angels from the Happineſs of Heaven, would have condemned rebellious Man to the Torments of Hell—Angels and Men united to reject the Authority of the Great God, and deſerved the ſame Puniſhment.—That Men are Priſoners of Hope, and fallen Angels delivered over to final Deſpair, is not the Claim of Juſtice, but the Work of diſtinguiſhing Grace.—This pities Criminals condemned to Death, freely forgives their Offences, and reſtores them to Favor.</p>

                  <p>FOR Human Nature in it's preſent degenerate State is deeply and univerſally corrupted: Not only averſe to that which is ſpiritually good, but fatally inclined to that which is evil —When God deſcended from Heaven to ſurvey the State of the moral World—This is the melancholy Report—<hi>The Thoughts and Imaginations of Mens Hearts are evil, only evil, and that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually.</hi>—In conformity to this divine Teſtimony <hi>St. Paul,</hi> who learnt his Divinity in the School of Heaven, declares that of ourſelves we are

                     <hi>inſufficient for ſo much as a good Thought</hi>— If inſufficient to think a good Thought, then certainly incapable to perform a good Action. Our BLESSED SAVIOR aſſures us, that <hi>a bad Tree cannot bring forth good Fruit;</hi> nor a corrupt <hi>Fountain</hi> ſend forth ſalutary <hi>Streams.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>UPON this Plan the moſt inlightned Teachers of the Chriſtian Church have always maintained, that the Performances of unregenerate Sinners don't recommend them to the eſpecial Favor of God, nor give them a Claim to the ſaving Gifts of his Holy Spirit. A diligent Cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our rational Powers—a Life conducted by the Precepts of moral Virtue, adorn the Characters of Men and render them Bleſſings to Civil Society: But they cannot be accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God, when they flow from <hi>a carnal Mind,</hi> which an inſpired Apoſtle declares <hi>is Enmity to God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>MEN who are favored with divine Revelation certainly enjoy Advantages ſuperior to thoſe who have no other Inſtructor than the Light of Nature;—but theſe will be ineffectual to our Salvation, if not accompanied with the internal Operations of the Spirit. The Word of God may ſound in our Ears, and not penetrate our Hearts.—Let the Law proclaim it's formidable Curſes, we ſhall be deaf to it's alarming Voice —Let the Goſpel publiſh it's gracious Invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, we ſhall be unaffected with it's delightful

Sound—Let the <hi>Miniſters of</hi> CHRIST <hi>lift up their Voices like Trumpets,</hi> and addreſs their Hearers with all the Charms of Coeleſtial Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, <hi>they labor in vain, and ſpend their Strength for nought,</hi> if theſe Means are not attended with a divine Influence. It is the Prerogative of Omnipotent Grace to open the Eyes of the Blind, unſtop the Ears of the Deaf —communicate a Principle of Life to thoſe who are <hi>dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins,</hi> and incline them to walk in the Way that leads to eternal Salvation.</p>
                  <p>WITHOUT this, the Light of Nature with all it's Improvements; the Law with all it's Precepts; the Goſpel with all it's tranſporting Diſcoveries; will be a <hi>Savor of Death unto Death:</hi> We ſhall remain under the Dominion of Sin: The Advantages we enjoy will only ſerve to increaſe our Guilt and render us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable at the Tribunal of Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>IF the Improvement of our natural Powers, or the Advantages of external Revelation were ſufficient for our Salvation—why was the Spirit ſent down to inlighten the Minds of Men, and ſanctify their Souls?—We muſt then certainly conclude, the Powers of human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are too weak, and all external Advantages inſufficient, to produce any ſaving Effect.

                  <head>III. WE are not made Partakers of this Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation as the Reward of our good Works.</head>
                  <p>MANY profeſs an high Eſteem for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired Scriptures, and acknowledge that Grace is a neceſſary Aſſiſtant to frail and fallible Man: But they depend on the Sincerity of their Hearts, the Purity of their Intentions, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity of their Lives, to recommend them to this important Bleſſing. They compliment God as the Author of their Salvation; but think their own virtuous Diſpoſitions are eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Qualifications to prepare them for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of ſo great a Good.—Thus they form a Scheme plauſible to human Reaſon— ſoothing to the natural Vanity of our Minds— but ſubverſive of the eſtabliſhed Order of Salvation.</p>
                  <p>IT is univerſally allowed, that all who are ſaved, <hi>are created anew in</hi> CHRIST JESUS <hi>unto good Works,</hi> and diligently endeavor to walk in the Practice of them.—But then this is a certain Conſequence, not a previous Condition, of an Intereſt in the Salvation of the Goſpel. We muſt be delivered from the Dominion of Sin, before we can perform the Duties of acceptable Obedience. Jeſus ſaves us from the Hands of Sin and Satan, our ſpiritual Enemies, that we may be qualified <hi>to ſerve God in Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Righteouſneſs.</hi> The Giver of all Good will not alter his Plan, to gratify the Pride of
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:013514_0028_0F90F0962E357BA8"/>
unhumbled Nature, and accommodate Himſelf to the Schemes of human Invention.—The only Queſtion to be decided is this—Is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Chriſt and his Salvation freely given— or conferred as the Reward of ſome antecedent Goodneſs?—Our Maſter has determined the Poin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This we are aſſured is a requiſite Preparation <hi>to our bringing forth Fruit,</hi> or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming any good Work. If it were needful to add any thing further, I might adduce the expreſs Teſtimony of <hi>St. Paul, Not by Works of Righteouſneſs which we have done, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Mercy he ſaved us, by the Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Regeneration and the Renewing of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>

               <p>WHAT we have heard affords us a Teſt, by which we may examine the Truth of the Doctrines we receive—It alſo gives us a Rule, by which we may determine the Value of the Duties we practice—It points out to us the only Way to ſecure our future Welfare.</p>

                  <head>I. WE have a Teſt by which we may examine the Truth of the Doctrines we receive.</head>
                  <p>THE great Deſign of God, in the Salvation of Sinners, is to diſplay the Glory of his Grace. <hi>He hath made us to ſit down together in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Places in Chriſt Jeſus, that He might ſhew the exceeding Riches of his Grace in his Kindneſs towards us through Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> To diminiſh this Grace, is to darken the Glory of the Goſpel, and deprive the bleſſed God of that Tribute of Praiſe He expects from all his redeemed People.</p>
                  <p>EVERY Opinion which exalts the Powers of human Nature in it's preſent degenerate State, undermines the Foundation of the Chriſtian Faith, and prevents us from that Reſignation to divine Sovereignty, which becomes the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of apoſtate Creatures. That Doctrine which aſcribes the entire Glory of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God bears the Stamp of Divinity, and will ever recommend itſelf to thoſe who have been taught in the School of a crucified Savior.</p>
                  <p>IT has always been the Stratagem of Satan, to employ the Powers of Wit and Learning, to ſupport the Fabrick of human Pride and render Men vain in their own Imaginations: But it is the conſtant Work of the Spirit to humble the Sinner in the Duſt; convince him that he is abſolutely loſt; that there is no Poſſibility of his Recovery, but by a Grace to which he has no Claim, which he has forfeited

a thouſand Ways.—Unilluminated Minds may approach the Throne of God with a long Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of their good Works: But thoſe who are acquainted with their own true Character, will come before the Divine Majeſty with no other Plea than that of the penitent <hi>Publican—God be merciful to me a Sinner.</hi>—This is the only Method to glorify God, and conſult our own Safety.</p>
                  <p>IF this Doctrine which teaches us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all Dependance upon our ſelves, in every Form—to place our entire Truſt on ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign and unmerited Grace, is a Miſtake, it is a perfectly innocent one.—It can't be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with any dangerous Conſequences— it will not be diſpleaſing to that Being who aſſures us <hi>He giveth Grace to the Humble.</hi>— What is my Crime?—It can only be this— I entertain too mean an Opinion of myſelf; I degrade apoſtate Nature too low; I form too favorable Sentiments of the Riches of divine Grace, when I ſuppoſe God beſtows Salvation as a free Gift, and that He confers his choiceſt Favors <hi>without Money and without Price.</hi>— Is this my Error?—Is this the Fault I am charged with?—I am perſwaded I ſhall not be aſhamed of it at the Supreme Tribunal, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I may be reproached by the polite Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners of the Day: I ſhall not repent of it in Heaven, whatever Inconveniencies I may ſuffer upon Earth: Men may ridicule my Weakneſs, but God will approve of every Attempt to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the Honor of his Grace.</p>

Among many who make a more plauſible Profeſſion of Religion, a Fear of the divine Diſpleaſure, a Dread of future Puniſhment, is the only Motive of Obedience.—But if <hi>by Grace we are ſaved,</hi> then it is a Diſcovery of this Grace that encourages us to engage in the Service of God; a Dependance on it's conſtant Aſſiſtance, that animates us in all the Duties of the Chriſtian Life.</p>
                  <p>To ſerve God only from a Principle of Fear, is not the Diſpoſition of his Children, but the Character of a Slave. In this Frame of Mind all our Performances are conſtrained; we ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from Sin with Reluctance: We ſhould indulge every vicious Appetite with Pleaſure if we were not afraid of eternal Miſery. Theſe Services therefore, tho' performed to the greateſt exactneſs, can't be acceptable to God: For He demands the Obedience of the Heart, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives none but a <hi>willing People:</hi> All his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants are convinced of the Excellency and Glory of his Character, they are captivated with the Diſcoveries of his free Grace which is ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to the greateſt of Sinners: They admire that Wiſdom and Love which hath provided Salvation for thoſe who have no recommending Qualities to eſtabliſh a Claim to this Bleſſing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They therefore bow down the Head and adore this diſintereſted Goodneſs—with Tranſports of Joy, they accept of the Gift of a SAVIOR. —Looking up to Him for <hi>Wiſdom, Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Sanctification,</hi> and <hi>eternal Redemption.</hi>

                  <p>THIS Way, though appointed by infinite Wiſdom, is often eſteemed Fooliſhneſs by Men—though revealed in almoſt every Page of the Goſpel, is ridiculed by the <hi>Diſputers of this World</hi>—But all <hi>that are taught of God</hi> are made to renounce every Claim, and receive

Salvation in it's Beginning, Progreſs, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion, as the free Gift of God through Jeſus Chriſt. If we reject this there is no ſure Foundation, on which we can build our Hopes of eternal Happineſs.

                  <p>WHATEVER vain Men may pretend, the Teſtimony of their own Hearts convinces them that they have ſinned againſt that God with whom <hi>is terrible Majeſty;</hi> that they have no Righteouſneſs which can ſtand the critical Examination of the ſupreme Tribunal:—They may put on a gay Appearance in the Days of their Health, and ſilence the Reproaches of their own Minds, when ſurrounded with the Smiles and Flatteries of the World—But when the <hi>King of Terrors</hi> approaches, and a mortal Diſtemper ſummons them to appear before their Almighty Judge—When the Skill of Phyſicians fails, and their Friends ſtand round their dying Beds, with an unavailing Pity— When the immortal Spirit is juſt ready to take it's Flight into the inviſible World—When a few Moments muſt determine their eternal Deſtiny—If now they have no Hope, but what ariſes from the Purity of their Hearts, and the Righteouſneſs of their Lives—What Viſions of Wrath will preſent themſelves to their guilty Minds!—What Fears of future Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance diſturb and diſtract the departing Hour!</p>

                  <p>I am ſenſible, this is a Doctine hard to be believed; and when believed is perpetually oppoſed by the Pride and Prejudices of human Nature.—Though it forms the brighteſt Glory of the Goſpel and gives the greateſt Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to indigent and periſhing Sinners.— Though it contains a Truth, ſufficient to make

We cannot think we have a Right to truſt in Chriſt for Privileges ſo incomparably excellent; which will make us happy in Time and Eternity, till we are poſſeſſed of ſome previous Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs to ſecure us a welcome Reception.</p>

            <p>THERE is in many Reſpects a ſurpriſing Correſpondence, between the Means by which we were betrayed into Ruin, and the Methods which infinite Wiſdom em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys for our Recovery.—By the Rebellion of the <hi>firſt Adam,</hi> we are made Sinners; by the Obedience of the <hi>ſecond,</hi> we are conſtituted Righteous—In conſequence of our Relation to the primitive Tranſgreſſor, our Natures are univerſally corrupted and defiled; by an Union to our divine Redeemer, we are <hi>ſanctified in Spirit, Soul and Body</hi>—We loſt the Glory of our Innocence by hearkening to the <hi>Father of Lies;</hi> we are reſtored to the Favor and Image of God, by giving Credit <hi>to the Word of Truth</hi>

—By truſting to Satan we became miſerable; by believing in Him who came <hi>to deſtroy the Works of the Devil,</hi> we recover our forfeited Happineſs—This is that ſublime Truth which is taught us in the Words of my Text— <hi>By Grace are ye ſaved through Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN my following Diſcourſe I ſhall endeavor to explain the Nature of that FAITH by which we are ſaved—and conclude with ſome IMPROVEMENT.</p>
            <p>THERE is a Faith which is common to the Children of God and the Servants of Sin. Faith is often mentioned as the diſtinguiſhing Character of the Saints, and ſometimes is aſcribed to the worſt of Beings. It formed the brighteſt Glory of Abraham the <hi>Friend of God</hi>—and inſpires the apoſtate Spirits <hi>with Fear and Trembling.</hi> There muſt then, be an eſſential Difference between that Faith by which we are ſaved and that which may accompany us to eternal Damnation.</p>
            <p>FAITH conſidered in a religious Senſe is an Aſſurance of thoſe Truths, which are revealed in the inſpired Scriptures—It is founded, not on the Conjectures of human Reaſon, but on the Authority of God the Revealer. Every Thing which God has revealed or promiſed; every Thing which is contained in the Volumes of the Old and New Teſtament; is the proper Object of Faith. But the eſpecial Object of
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:013514_0040_0F90F5BE058A07A0"/>
that Faith, which is the diſtinguiſhing Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſtic of the real Chriſtian, is JESUS CHRIST —the eternal SON OF GOD—the appointed SAVIOR of a revolted World —He offered up himſelf a Sacrifice to divine Juſtice, that we might not be condemned at it's awful Bar—He ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled all Righteouſneſs, that we might have a valid Title to the Reward of Life eternal — He is propoſed in the Goſpel in all the Glories of an allſufficient and condeſcending SAVIOR, to be received as <hi>the Gift of God,</hi> to be truſted in by all thoſe who are ſenſible of their Guilt and Miſery, and deſire to obtain the Bleſſings of Salvation.—Faith is a Perſwaſion, that it is the ſole Prerogative of this adorable Perſon to reſtore our lapſed Race to the Favor of God;— or to expreſs myſelf in the Language of Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Neither is there Salvation in any other, for there is no other Name under Heaven given a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Men whereby we muſt be ſaved.</hi> Acts iv. 12.</p>
            <p>THIS Faith is often deſcribed in the Goſpel to be a firm Belief—THAT JESUS IS THE SON OF GOD—the promiſed MESSIAH.— Conſequently, that his Doctrine is divine—His Promiſes certain—which ſhall infallibly be accompliſhed in their appointed Order.—We believe what the ſacred Hiſtorians have recorded of His miraculous Birth—His unſpotted Life— His wonderful Works—His meritorious Death —His glorious Reſurrection—His triumphant Aſcenſion into Heaven—His prevalent Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion at <hi>the Right Hand of the Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="unknown:013514_0041_0F90F5BF78426B88"/>THESE Truths are received as <hi>faithful Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> not becauſe they could be diſcovered by human Reaſon, but becauſe they are authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by a divine Teſtimony.</p>
            <p>WHEN <hi>the Son of God</hi> commands us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Him as a Meſſenger from Heaven, He gives the moſt unqueſtionable Evidences of the Divinity of his Miſſion. He declares that He is <hi>a Teacher ſent from God,</hi> and diſcovers his Claim to this Character by the <hi>Demonſtration of the Spirit, and by Power</hi>—He practiſed the moſt heroic Virtues in every Period of his Reſidence among Men—He confirmed his Doctrine by Miracles which could only be performed by an omnipotent Arm—He appears to be the <hi>Prince of Life,</hi> when expiring in the Agonies of Death —He diſpoſes of the Joys of Paradiſe, when ſuffering as a condemned Malefactor.</p>
            <p>IN this critical Moment, Nature through all her Works declares his Dignity and Glory;— even the Inhabitants of the Grave ariſe to do Honor to Him who has <hi>the Keys of the invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible World</hi>—He entered the Grave, not by Neceſſity of Nature, but voluntary Conſent.— He triumphed over the <hi>King of Terrors</hi> in his own Dominions, and aſcended like an invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Conqueror to immortal Life.—This ſet the Seal of Heaven to the Truth of his Miſſion, juſtified his higheſt Pretenſions, and in the moſt ſolemn Manner declared that He was exalted to be a PRINCE and a SAVIOR.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:013514_0042_0F90F5BFB60B6F18"/>THEY who yield an unfeigned Aſſent to theſe Truths are frequently ſaid to <hi>Believe.</hi> But when this Faith only floats in the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and does not deſcend into the Heart, captivate the Affections and regulate the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Mankind, it will not evidence that we are true Diſciples of Chriſt, or ſecure us a Title to the Privileges which he has purchaſed for his People. <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was made a Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyte by the Preaching of <hi>Philip</hi>—he was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized into the Faith of the Goſpel, and it is ſaid that <hi>he alſo believed.</hi>—Yet we have the Teſtimony of an inſpired Apoſtle, <hi>that his Heart was not right with God: He was in the Gall of Bitterneſs and Bonds of Iniquity.</hi> Daily Experience teaches us, that Mens Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may be convinced, and the Will remain obſtinate and perverſe. We may give Credit to the Truth of a Doctrine, and our Heart riſe up in Oppoſition againſt it.</p>
            <p>BUT this Faith, inſtead of being acceptable to God, increaſes His Diſpleaſure—So far from being beneficial to Men it adds to their Guilt and Miſery. A profeſſed Infidel is not ſo odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a Character as a perfidious Traitor.—It therefore neceſſarily follows, that the Faith which is the diſtinguiſhing Character of the Children of God, muſt be of a more excellent Kind than that which we have now been deſcribing.</p>

               <p>MEN who have been educated in the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the Chriſtian Faith, often receive them as true, without any Heſitation. When con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of their Guilt, they acknowledge the Neceſſity of an Intereſt in Chriſt to deliver them from the Puniſhment they have deſerved. Animated with a Dread of future Miſery, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired with the Hope of heavenly Happineſs, they attempt to give up themſelves to Jeſus Chriſt. But all is forced—their only Motive is to remove the Grounds of their preſent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietude—when their Diſtreſs vaniſhes they ſoon return to their former Sins, or ſatisfy themſelves with a Round of religious Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, and a Converſation outwardly inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and regular. The Name of <hi>Jeſus</hi> is heard with Indifference.—Perſons of this Character often prove the greateſt Oppoſers of the unadul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated Doctrines of Grace.</p>

We view it not only as divinely true but ſupremely good.—This conquers our Prejudices, captivates our Hearts, produces a chearful Acquieſcence in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of redeeming Love.—We admire this Method of Salvation, as the Contrivance of infinite Wiſdom, the Product of amazing Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence.—We behold the Character of the Deity diſplayed in it's brighteſt Glory, and the richeſt Grace diſcovered to periſhing Sinners. —Awful Juſtice maintains the Authority of the Law; and Mercy triumphs in the Recovery of a lapſed World.—Sin is ſeverely puniſhed, and the Sinner received to Favor—Our Surety dies to fulfil the Penalty of the Law—and in his Obedience unto Death accompliſhes a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Righteouſneſs in behalf of his People.</p>
               <p>IN Compliance with this marvellous Plan, the glad Tidings of a Savior are preached to rebellious Men, and all Nations are invited to accept Salvation through his Merits and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.—When this is clearly diſcovered to the Mind, it puts a final Period to all our former Contrivances to recommend ourſelves to the Favor of God: We come to a fixed Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to ſeek for Happineſs only through the Grace and Righteouſneſs of our adorable

<q>This is a Scheme which ſecures the Honor of the Supreme Governor of the Univerſe, and provides for the Safety of ſelf-deſtroyed Man—God appears encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed with the moſt awful and amiable Glory—the Pride of all Fleſh is humbled in the Duſt—the Believer is reſcued from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved Miſery and raiſed to immortal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.—This reveals a Savior, exactly adapted to the Circumſtances of deſtitute condemned MalefactorS, who have no good Qualities to recommend them; who have Nothing but the moſt abject Wretchedneſs to move the divine Compaſſions.</q>

               <p>EVERY Man muſt be juſtified <hi>by Law,</hi> or ſaved <hi>by Grace</hi>—or periſh forever.—If I expect to be juſtified by Law, my Obedience muſt be perfect, without the ſmalleſt Blemiſh;—uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, without the leaſt Exception;—perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering without a Moment's Interruption. We appear before the Throne of infinite Purity, and challenge impartial Juſtice to find any thing in us worthy of Condemnation and Death.</p>

                  <pb n="56" facs="unknown:013514_0059_0F90F5D0635D8B08"/>BUT the Man who expects to be <hi>ſaved by Grace</hi> acknowledges himſelf a guilty Criminal, worthy of the ſevereſt Puniſhment:—He is ſenſible that his beſt Performances, if examined according to the Purity and Extent of the Law, muſt be turned into Articles of Indictment againſt him:—He therefore appeals from the Bar of Juſtice to the Throne of Grace; hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly confeſſing that <hi>if God ſhould be ſtrict to mark Iniquity,</hi> he muſt be eternally condemned: —He pleads the pardoning Mercy of God through the Mediation of Jeſus Chriſt:—The only Foundation of his Hope is—that the Supreme Lawgiver will not deal with him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his perſonal Demerits, but conſider him as united to his dear SON, whom he cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially accepts as his SAVIOR and LORD:— Through Him—though condemned by the <hi>Law,</hi> he expects to be relieved by the <hi>Goſpel</hi>— though deſerving the Miſeries of Hell, he hopes to enjoy the Felicities of the Kingdom of Heaven. <hi>Chriſt</hi> and He only hath purchaſed our Salvation, by his infinite Merits;—in his Righteouſneſs we muſt appear, if we are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted at the Tribunal of God. If Chriſt <hi>had not died for our Offences, and riſen again for our Juſtification,</hi> in vain ſhould we bewail our Sins, reform our Lives, employ our moſt aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous Endeavors to recover our Innocence and Happineſs. Every well inſtructed Mind will therefore ſay with <hi>St. Paul, God forbid that I ſhould glory, ſave in the Croſs of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="unknown:013514_0060_0F90F5D3F4EF8B50"/>Of Conſequence, when we are ſaid to be <hi>ſaved through Faith,</hi> it cannot intend that Faith merits our Salvation; or that God gives us eternal Happineſs to reward the Excellency and Goodneſs of our Faith: But it is the appointed Method, in which we are made Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the Bleſſings which Chriſt hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed with his Blood—In this Senſe, and no other, is Faith the Condition of our Salvation. This the Goſpel teſtifies through all its inſpired Pages.—<hi>If thou ſhalt confeſs with thy Mouth</hi> (ſaith St. Paul) <hi>the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and ſhalt believe in thy Heart, that God hath raiſed Him from the Dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> —When the awakened Jailor makes the ſolemn Enquiry—<hi>What ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi> —This is the Anſwer given by the Ambaſſadors of Heaven—<hi>Believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and thou ſhalt be ſaved</hi>—Nor have the Refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of later Ages found a directer Entrance into the <hi>Kingdom of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>FAITH is that Grace which unites us to the SON OF GOD, the SAVIOR OF THE WORLD: By this Union, we become Partakers of all his Benefits. "Our Guilt is transferred to Him.—His Righteouſneſs is imputed to us." —To expreſs myſelf in Language dictated by the HOLY GHOST, <hi>He was made to be Sin for us, who knew no Sin, that we might be made the Righteouſneſs of God in Him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="unknown:013514_0061_0F90F5D568158D08"/>LET us place this Truth in another Point of Light, and make it as intelligible as may be to the meaneſt Underſtanding. Salvation is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently repreſented as <hi>the Gift of God:</hi> Now we all know, that there is a wide Diſtinction between that which is beſtowed as a free Gift, and that which is obtained as the Reward of Services performed: To eſtabliſh our Claim to the promiſed Reward, we muſt accompliſh our Taſk—finiſh the appointed Work, and punctually comply with all the Articles ſpecified in the Agreement:—But to enjoy a Gift, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is requiſite, but to realize the Kindneſs of our Benefactor, and receive his generous Offer with Gratitude.</p>
               <p>THE Difference is as great, as between a Workman who is employed on Wages, and an indigent Beggar who lives upon Charity: The Labourer has no Title to the ſtipulated Wages, till he has completed the Service expreſſed in the Contract; but the poor Mendicant only receives the Alms which are generouſly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to him.—The Bounty of the Donor authoriſes his Claim—his grateful Acceptance puts him in Poſſeſſion of the Benefit.</p>
               <p>THIS gives us a perſpicuous View of the Method, in which we are made Partakers of the Salvation revealed in the Goſpel.—Salvation is not beſtowed upon us as the Reward of our good Services:—We cannot challenge it as a
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:013514_0062_0F90F09B6CF8F468"/>
Debt from the Hand of Juſtice;—it is the Gift of unpurchaſed Bounty:—Our only Part is to accept the Goodwill of our heavenly Father, and aſcribe all our Happineſs to the Riches of redeeming Love.</p>
               <p>THUS we <hi>are ſaved by Faith</hi>—Faith accepts the condeſcending Offers of a Savior, and gives God the Glory of that Grace, which He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to magnify in the Recovery of an apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate World.—What is it to believe?—To give Credit to the Report of the Goſpel;—to receive that Savior who is freely tendered to us;—to depend on his Righteouſneſs, to give us a Title to the Favor of God;—to reſign ourſelves to his Spirit, to prepare us for the Enjoyment of Life eternal.</p>
               <p>UPON this Foundation, all Pretences to Merit are deſtroyed; all Claims eſtabliſhed on perſonal Worthineſs are diſallowed. God gives —and Faith receives a Title to the Dignity and Privileges of <hi>the Sons of God.</hi> There is no Merit in receiving a Gift, though it be neceſſary to enjoying the Good which is tendered to me. —Thus Faith does not give me an Intereſt in Chriſt, on the Foot of Deſert; but by Virtue of a Divine Conſtitution. The Wiſdom of the Deity did not ſee ſit, that thoſe ſhould have a Title to this Salvation, who were inſenſible of their Want of it, or unwilling to receive it:— They are forever excluded, by an irreverſible

            <div n="2" type="part">
               <head>SECONDLY, To enquire into the Reaſons of this Divine Conſtitution.</head>
               <p>THE Deſign of Man's Redemption flowed from the eternal Counſels of Heaven. Before this Univerſe exiſted, the Deity foreſaw, that many of the free Intelligences He deſigned to create, would violate the eſtabliſhed Orders of his Government and fall from their original Dignity.—His unbounded Benevolence inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Him to deviſe a Method of Recovery, for many of his rebellious Subjects.—The ſinning Angels, the firſt Tranſgreſſors, are excluded all Hopes of Mercy;—while the ſinful Poſterity of Adam are appointed to be the Objects of diſtinguiſhing Favors.</p>
               <p>INFINITE Wiſdom determined, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out vindicating the Honor of the Law, there ſhould be no Remiſſion of Sin—This the Son of God undertook, and voluntarily engaged to ſave a guilty World.—He exhibits Himſelf in the Goſpel in the Character of a Savior, and gives us the higheſt Aſſurance, that all who believe in Him ſhall experience the bleſſed Effects of his Power and Grace.—But if Men wilfully refuſe the kind Hand that is extended for their Deliverance, there is Nothing remains but that they periſh in their Sins.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="unknown:013514_0064_0F90F5D6A94F0320"/>THIS is the immutable Appointment, not only of the Sovereignty but Wiſdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven—Faith is the appropriated Way to Life— becauſe it brings nothing with it, but receives all from the Fulneſs of Chriſt—It pleads guilty before God, and implores a free Pardon—It acknowledges the Sinner's Inability to all ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Good, and ſupplicates that Grace which muſt <hi>perform all our Works in us.</hi>—Thus God alone is exalted, and human Vanity proſtrate in the Duſt: All Self-dependance is renounced and Holineſs and Happineſs received as a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication from Chriſt: The Crown is placed upon the Head of our <hi>incarnate God,</hi> and the entire Glory of our Salvation is aſcribed to free Grace.—This forms the Excellency of Faith, and diſcovers it to be a fit Method to ſave thoſe who are utterly ruined in themſelves. Upon this Account <hi>St. Paul</hi> having declared that we are <hi>ſaved through Faith,</hi> in the next Verſe excludes <hi>Works,</hi> and gives this Reaſon— <hi>leſt any Man ſhould boaſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>METHINKS I hear ſome ſay—How can Works be excluded; are they not neceſſary to Salvation?—I acknowledge the Faith that ſaves us is a vital Principle of univerſal Holineſs. Faith is eſſentially defective, if it does not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce good Works.—I further acknowledge, that, Purity of Heart and an uniform Obedience to the divine Commandments, are neceſſary Ingredients in the Character of thoſe, who
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:013514_0065_0F90F5D743B762B0"/>
ſhall be finally ſaved.—It is the irrevocable Conſtitution of Heaven, that <hi>without Holineſs no Man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE only Controverſy between us and thoſe that in this Article differ from us is this— Whether good Works are the Conſequences of our Union with Chriſt and an Intereſt in his Salvation; or whether they are antecedent Conditions of our obtaining this invaluable Bleſſing?—We aſſert the firſt; and think we are ſupported, not only by the Authority of <hi>St. Paul,</hi> in the Words of my Text, but by the uniform Tenor of the inſpired Writings. <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Works</hi> are frequently put in a direct and formal Oppoſition to each other:—That Purity of Heart—that Sanctity of Life—that Victory of Corruption—that unreſerved De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votedneſs to God—which are the grand Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials of the Chriſtian Life, are not Virtues we bring with us in our firſt Approaches to the Savior; but Bleſſings He beſtows on them that come to Him by an humble Faith.</p>
               <p>THIS will be uncontroulably evident, if we conſider—That our moſt ſpecious Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, before we are brought into this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Union, are corrupt and vicious—With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Faith, ſays the Author to the Hebrews, <hi>it is impoſſible to pleaſe God.</hi>—Without me, ſays the <hi>Faithful and True Witneſs, ye <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="63" facs="unknown:013514_0066_0F90F5D8B0FCE4C0"/>By Faith then are <hi>we ſaved and not by Works</hi> —For this Salvation is begun, before we can perform any Works that may be truly denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated Good. We receive Jeſus the Savior— We become Members of his myſtical Body— By virtue of this—His Righteouſneſs is imputed to us—His Spirit reſides in us—This leads us into all Truth—inclines us to all Good— enables us to walk in the Way that will finally conduct us to conſummate Purity and Bleſſedneſs.</p>

                  <p>THE Law demands perfect and perpetual Obedience, as the Condition of Life; the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel requires humble Faith, as the appointed Means of Safety and Happineſs: According to the Tenor of the Law, we muſt have a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete and perſonal Righteouſneſs, to eſcape its damnatory Sentence; according to the conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending Terms of the Goſpel, the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our Surety delivers us from Death, and gives us a Title to Life Eternal.—This is the unalterable Voice of the Law, <hi>do theſe Things and thou ſhalt live:</hi>—This the alluring Language of the Goſpel, <hi>believe and thou ſhall be ſaved.</hi>

The Law was delivered to Man when in a State of unblemiſhed Innocence, in all the Perfection of his Nature, when he had Strength to perform his entire Duty, without Defect or Deviation: But the Goſpel conſiders Man as fallen from his primitive Integrity, deſtitute of Ability or Inclination to do that which is Good. It is appointed for his Reſcue from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of the Law and the tyrannical Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of Sin—Therefore it does not call him to purchaſe Life by his Obedience; but to receive that Grace which alone can enable him <hi>to will and to do:</hi>—Not to expect Happineſs from his own Virtue and Goodneſs, but by an humble Affiance in the Grace and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of an all ſufficient Savior.</p>
                  <p>EVERY one who does not ſubmit to the <hi>Law of Faith,</hi> muſt ſtand or fall by <hi>the Law of Works.</hi> This infallibly condemns all the Poſterity of <hi>Adam</hi> without Diſtinction, whether <hi>Gentile, Jew,</hi> or <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> All have vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated it's righteous Precepts and incurred it's dreadful Penalty.—How terrible is that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation to an awakened Mind, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces <hi>Indignation and Wrath, Tribulation and Anguiſh on every Soul that doeth Evil!</hi>— How admirable that Grace, which reveals JESUS <hi>the Wiſdom and Power of God, to the Salvation of every one that believeth!</hi>—How

The Faith ſo highly recommended in the Oracles of God, is always attended with the Influences of the Holy Spirit: This Divine Agent reſides in the Heart of the true Believer, diſſolves his Attachment to every Sin, cauſes him to <hi>delight in the Law of God after the inward Man: The Fruits of the Spirit are Love,</hi> and the various Graces which conſtitute the Chriſtian Life. <hi>They who have not this Spirit of Chriſt,</hi> are poſitively declared to be none of His.</p>

Winds and Sea obey His Voice—the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate Diſeaſes fly at His Approach—His Commands are heard in the awful Manſions of the Dead, the Inhabitants of the Grave, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to His Call, and riſe to Life and Vigor.— He Dies—the <hi>Heavens</hi> are <hi>darkned,</hi> the <hi>Earth trembles,</hi> the <hi>Rocks are rent.</hi>—He raiſes Himſelf from the Dead; Angels deſcend from Heaven to pay Him Homage, His timorous Diſciples acknowledge their <hi>Maſter</hi> and <hi>Lord.</hi> —At length He takes Farewel of this Earth, aſcends up to Heaven in the public View of his Followers, the Spirit deſcends on His Apoſtles in viſible Forms; they are immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately endowed with the Supernatural <hi>Gift of Tongues</hi>—they alſo perform illuſtrious Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, in the Name of their aſcended Maſter.</p>
                  <p>THESE were public and viſible Facts—ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by the incredulous Jews, allowed by the moſt inveterate Enemies of the Chriſtian Faith, in the early Days of the Church—Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſed by theſe divine Credentials, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles propagated the Religion of JESUS, with ſurpriſing Succeſs.—Without Power to awe— without Wealth to bribe—without Eloquence to perſwade—They triumphed over the Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices of the Vulgar, the Reaſonings of the Philoſophers, the long eſtabliſhed Idolatry of all Nations. Though the Princes of the Roman Empire endeavored to ſtop the Progreſs of the Goſpel:—Though Prieſts and Politicians made

                  <p>WAS ever a Doctrine confirmed with ſuch illuſtrious Atteſtations? What could ſupport it, amidſt ſo many Dangers; but the Divine Protection? What further Evidence can Men deſire, that the Goſpel is a Revelation from Heaven, and conſequently, that Salvation may be obtained by Faith.</p>
                  <p>IF Men continue in Unbelief, it is to be aſcribed to the corrupt Diſpoſition of their Hearts, a fond Attachment to their criminal Delights.—A perpetual Engagement in the Buſineſs and Amuſements of Life, prevents their receiving the <hi>Truth in the Love of it. If our Goſpel be hid, it is hid to them that are loſt, in whom the God of this World hath blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Minds of them that believe not, leſt the Light of the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt, who is the Image of God ſhould ſhine unto them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>FROM this moſt terrible of all Judgments may God of his infinite Mercy deliver us.— To Him be Glory forever and ever. AMEN.</p>

Boſom of the Deep; the fluid Element con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the eſtabliſhed Laws of Nature, was a Defence to them, and proved the Deſtruction of their Aſſailants:—When they travelled for forty Years in an unhoſpitable Deſart, they did not cultivate the Earth, or gather in a Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt; they were fed with <hi>the Bread of Angels; Manna</hi> deſcended <hi>daily around their Camp, and the Rock poured out Water for</hi> their Refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:—When to puniſh their Murmuring, God ſent <hi>fiery Serpents</hi> among them, their deadly Wounds were healed, not by the Skill of Phyſicians, or the Virtue of Antidotes; a <hi>brazen Serpent</hi> was erected by divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; they look to the appointed Signal, and the Camp was reſtored to Health and Vigor: —When they croſſed the River <hi>Jordan,</hi> they had no Conveniencies to ſecure their Paſſage; the myſterious <hi>Ark,</hi> the Symbol of the Divine Preſence, arreſted the Waters in their Courſe, the numerous Hoſt paſſed over on dry Ground, and entered the Borders of the promiſed <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan.</hi>—When they obtained the peaceable Poſſeſſion of that happy Land, it was not by <hi>their own Swords and Bows;</hi> but the <hi>Captain of the Lord's Hoſt</hi> fought their Battles for them, inſpired them with Conduct and Courage, and crowned them with Victory and Succeſs.</p>
            <p>THIS is a lively Repreſentation of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Heaven towards his <hi>ſpiritual Iſrael,</hi> in all Ages of the Church.—As God's ancient
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:013514_0078_0F90F5E48EFCE230"/>
People could not aſcribe their Triumphs to the Number of their Armies, the Greatneſs of their Exploits, or their own Policy and Power: but to an Almighty Arm, which cauſed all Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to fall before them:—So the Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the New-Teſtament Saints from the Slavery of Satan, cannot be attributed to the Powers of Nature, the Succeſs of their own Endeavors; but to the Aids of ſupernatural Grace, which ſubdues the Strength of their ghoſtly Adverſaries, and leads them on from <hi>conquering to conquer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THEREFORE, the Apoſtle having aſſerted, <hi>that by Grace we are ſaved through Faith,</hi> to remove all Ground of Boaſting tells us in the Words now read—that this <hi>Faith is not of ourſelves, it is the Gift of God.</hi> I am ſenſible theſe Words are referred by ſome to Salvation in general; which they acknowledge <hi>is not of ourſelves but the Gift of God:</hi> But I think it is plainly the Deſign of the Apoſtle to apply theſe Words particularly to Faith. He had before eſtabliſhed the Honor of divine Grace, in giving Salvation to Mankind, and declared that Faith was the Means of obtaining an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in it.—Now, to deſtroy all Pretentions to Pride, he teaches us, that this Faith is not a Grace that grows in the Garden of Nature, but is the Production of God.—This is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently the Doctrine of Religion.—A Divine Power <hi>opened the Heart of Lydia,</hi> to believe
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:013514_0079_0F90F5E778EF39D0"/>
the Preaching of <hi>St. Paul.</hi> When <hi>St. Peter</hi> acknowledges <hi>Jeſus</hi> to be the SON OF GOD, our Lord immediately replies, <hi>Bleſſed art thou, Simon Bar-jona, for Fleſh and Blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in Heaven.</hi> Theſe Texts, with many others which might be mentioned, eſtabliſh beyond Diſpute the Doctrine I am conſidering—<hi>That Faith is the Gift of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN my following Diſcourſe I ſhall ſhow— in what Senſe Faith is the Gift of God—and then mention a few Particulars which illuſtrate and confirm this important Truth.</p>
            <div n="1" type="part">
               <head>FIRST, I AM to ſhow in what Senſe Faith is the Gift of God.</head>
               <p>MANY profeſs their Aſſent to this Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition—that <hi>Faith is the Gift of God</hi>—but mean no more, than that God gives a general and ſufficient Grace to all Mankind, by virtue of which they may believe if they pleaſe, but are equally free to remain in Unbelief and Rebellion. According to this Scheme, Ability to believe comes from God, but actual Faith is properly to be aſcribed to Man. After all the Influences with which he is favored, he determines himſelf with a ſovereign and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent Freedom. This deſtroys the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity of <hi>St. Paul,</hi> and ſupports the Fabric of human Pride: It makes Man, after all the

Compliments paid to Grace, the final Architect of his own Happineſs.—But thoſe who are taught in the School of Chriſt are inſpired with different Sentiments. They are convinced that not only the Ability, but the inclination to believe, is one of <hi>thoſe good Gifts which deſcend from the Father of Lights.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BY the ſecret Illuminations of His Spirit, He diſcovers to us the Excellency and Beauty of a Savior, the Value and Importance of the Bleſſings He propoſes to our Choice; by a gentle but effectual Influence He diſpoſes us to accept the condeſcending Offer — If this were not the Caſe, with what Propriety could the Apoſtle propoſe that Queſtion, <hi>who maketh thee to differ from another? What haſt thou that that thou didſt not receive?</hi>—The Believer might anſwer, with the ſtricteſt Propriety;— I have made the Difference; the good Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I have made of my Free Will, hath diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed me from the perverſe and incredulous Part of Mankind.—"I adore the Moſt High God as the Father of my Spirit; I render Him my devout Acknowledgments that He made me a free Intelligence; I give Thanks to his Name<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that He has favored me with the Light of the Goſpel, and the kind Aſſiſtances of his Spirit —But theſe are common Favors, equally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed by all the Profeſſors of the Goſpel; they do not diſtinguiſh me from the hardned Sinner —That I believe—while others reject <hi>the Word

               <p>WHOSE Heart would not tremble! What Tongue would not faulter to utter this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous Language!

               <p>TO illuſtrate and confirm this Truth is what I propoſed in the</p>
               <p>SECOND Part of my Diſcourſe.—To this End, let us conſider—Our natural Inability to that which is Good—The Reſiſtance Men generally make to the Operations of the Spirit —The Stratagems which Satan employs to keep them from Believing <hi>to the ſaving of their Souls.</hi>

                  <p>THIS is declared in Scripture in the moſt expreſſive Terms, in a Variety of Forms. The God of Truth declares, <hi>that the Thoughts and Imaginations of the Heart of Man, are Evil, only Evil, and that continually.</hi> An inſpired Pen
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:013514_0082_0F90F5EA7061D958"/>
informs us, <hi>that the carnal</hi> (i. e.) <hi>the unrenewed Mind, is not ſubject to the Law of God, nor can be: That the natural Man receiveth not the Things of the Spirit of God; for they are Fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſs unto him; neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE ſame mortifying Truth is taught by Metaphors, that it may be the more deeply engraven on our Minds:—Not to diſcourage, but humble us, with a View of our Wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:—Not to fill us with imaginary Terrors, but alarm us ſollicitouſly to ſeek a Cure.— We are repreſented as <hi>blind</hi> to divine Truths, till a celeſtial Ray ſhines upon our benighted Minds, and diſcovers to us their Excellency and Importance.—We are <hi>deaf</hi> to the Voice of incarnate Love, till a mighty Power remove the Obſtructions, and incline our Ears to attend to the inviting Sound:—Our Hearts are like obdurate <hi>Rocks,</hi> impenetrable to every religious Impreſſion, till victorious Grace ſoftens them into <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and makes them receptive of ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Impreſſions.—We are <hi>dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins,</hi> till that irreſiſtible Command, which muſt ſhortly awake the Inhabitants of the Grave, cauſes us to <hi>ariſe</hi> and <hi>live.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THESE metaphorical Expreſſions are not the Flights of Fancy, but they convey a ſolemn Truth. No Language can be contrived, better adapted to repreſent our Inability, by any inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent

Power of our own, to do any Thing which is ſpiritually Good.—I am ſenſible that Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors ought not to be preſſed into a Service, for which they were not originally deſigned;— at the ſame Time, I am ſure they ought not to be explained away, till all their Senſe, Propriety and Beauty is loſt. If this Variety of Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors, ſo often repeated, does not teach us our ſpiritual Impotence to the Acts and Exerciſes of the divine Life, they ſignify Nothing,— They can be eſteemed no better than extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Hyperboles—which I am perſwaded no ſerious Mind will impute to an inſpired Author<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Man, the Lord of this viſible Creation, became an infamous Slave; the Favorite of his Maker a Captive of Hell: The Heavens were armed with Thunder, the Earth expoſed to a laſting Curſe: Every Thing conſpired to make the ungrateful Rebel mortal and miſerable.</p>

Aſk that ye may receive,</hi> was the Direction given by the ſame divine Teacher to the Multitude who attended on his Miniſtry.—This is the Voice of Reaſon, as well as the Command of God.—When ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with diſtreſſing Dangers; when all created Help fails; when human Policy and Power diſcovers no Way of Eſcape; is it not natural?—is it not rational?—to proſtrate our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Duſt, lift up our Eyes to Heaven, and implore thoſe Almighty Aids which God takes Pleaſure to communicate to the humble Supplicant. If our Hearts are too haughty— if our Knees are too ſtubborn—to bow at the Footſtool of ſovereign Grace, and aſk the Life of our immortal Souls, ſurely our Damnation is of ourſelves. It is Preſumption to expect that God will vouchſafe to grant his choiceſt

Favors to thoſe who proudly neglect to ſeek Him in the Ways of his own Inſtitution. Has He erected a Throne of Grace in our revolted World? Does He command us by Prayer and Supplication to make known our Requeſts? and ſhall we live in the Neglect of ſo plain, poſitive and reaſonable a Duty?—<hi>Should not a People ſeek unto their God?</hi>—a God who is the ſupreme Diſpenſer of Happineſs and Miſery—upon whoſe Goodwill depends our eternal Deſtiny. Does not the Honor of the Deity require that we look up continually to Him from whom <hi>alone our Help muſt come,</hi> and ardently implore that Mercy, without which we are the eternal Victims of inexora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Juſtice?</p>
                  <p>ASK thoſe, who <hi>live the Life of Faith</hi>—By what Methods were you introduced into this State?—They will anſwer with one Voice—"I was awakened to a ſolemn Concern for my eternal Welfare: <hi>I daily waited at Wiſdom's Gates, and watched at the Poſts of her Doors:</hi> I was convinced of the deep and univerſal Corruption of my Nature; I found that I was <hi>dead in Trepaſſes and Sins,</hi> that Nothing ſhort of an Almighty Arm, could ſubdue my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctant Heart, and induce me to a chearful Compliance with the Preſcriptions of ſovereign Mercy: I proſtrated myſelf at the Feet of the ſupreme Diſpoſer of Life and Death; I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, I had forfeited every Favor, and that if He frowned me from his Preſence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:013514_0091_0F90F5F2B346DC90"/>
Juſtice muſt approve the Conduct; I had no Ground to complain that He treated me with undeſerved Severity:—But I ardently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored that Grace I had no Right to challenge, and earneſtly deprecated the Execution of that Sentence which was the juſt Puniſhment of my Crimes.—He viewed me with a compaſſionate Eye, He hearkened to the Cries of my Diſtreſs, and ſtretched out his Arm to deliver me from the Depths of Miſery.—He revealed unto me his gracious Nature, which revived my deſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Heart:—He directed me by his Word and Spirit, to an All ſufficient Savior provided for the greateſt of Sinners:—He captivated me by the Charms of his Love, to reſign myſelf to be his Servant forever."</p>
                  <p>IT is in this Way <hi>the Father of Mercies</hi> generally manifeſts Himſelf to the Sinners of human Race.—Thus <hi>he turns them from Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to Light, from the Power of Sin and Satan unto God</hi>—Their Succeſs ſhould encourage us to walk in the ſame Way: Their Example ſhould inſpire us with unfainting Diligence to purſue the ſame Methods: Never ſhould we deſiſt, till we experience that <hi>Power from on High,</hi> which alone can form us into the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and entitle us to the Privileges of <hi>the Sons of God.</hi>

IT was a pure Favor that brought us into Exiſtence; but it is greater Kindneſs that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows upon us Faith. Redeeming Love de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands an higher Song of Praiſe than creating Goodneſs.—How ſhould we adore the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that Power, which not only made us at firſt—but deſigns to make us happy forever!— When we look up to JESUS <hi>who is the Author and Finiſher of our Faith,</hi> our Hearts ſhould overflow with Love, and our Tongues be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually employed in thankful <hi>Hallelujahs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>WHEN God delivered his People from <hi>Egypt,</hi> this Inſtance of the Divine Favor was to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorated in every ſucceeding Age: A Feſtival was appointed to perpetuate the Remembrance of it to the moſt diſtant Poſterity.</p>
                  <p>BUT the Believer has a nobler Deliverance to commemorate.—God hath ſaved us not from a temporal Bondage, but an eternal Priſon:—He gives us his Laws, not inſcribed on <hi>Tables of Stone,</hi> but on the <hi>living Tables</hi> of our Hearts.—He directed the Marches of his ancient People, through an unhoſpitable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart by <hi>a Pillar of Fire:</hi> He conducts his Saints in the preſent Day, by the Illuminations of his Spirit, who brings them ſafely, not to <hi>in earthly, but the celeſtial Canaan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>LET us follow our divine Leader, with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted Courage, with chearful Perſeverance. <hi>It is God that worketh in us to will and to do</hi>

This, inſtead of incouraging Indolence, ſhould animate our Zeal and Diligence.—The Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the divine Spirit ſhew us the Path of Holineſs and incline us to walk in it.—The Allurements of Grace captivate our Hearts, and give us Life and Spirit to run the Way that leads to the <hi>Kingdom of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>TO animate us in this bleſſed Courſe, we are aſſured, that He who has begun a good Work in us, will <hi>carry it on to the Day of the Lord:</hi> He that hath given us Faith will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and perpetuate it.—He will revive our diſcouraged Hearts, and ſupport our tottering Steps:—Though weak in ourſelves, we ſhall be ſtrong in <hi>the Power of his Might:</hi>—His Grace will be victorious in the midſt of the fierceſt Oppoſition.</p>

            <head>SERMON VI. The Salvation we receive by Faith, UNSPEAKABLY GREAT.</head>

               <bibl>HEBREWS II. 3.</bibl>
               <q>How ſhall we eſcape, if we neglect ſo <hi>GREAT</hi> Salvation?</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IT is a juſt Reproach to Human Nature, that Men are ſo ſollicitous to ſecure the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of the preſent Life, and ſo uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for their Happineſs in a future World. With what Art and Addreſs do they purſue their temporal Affairs! What Zeal and Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence do they employ to accompliſh their Deſigns! New Plans are continually formed, to encreaſe their Eſtates and aggrandize their Families. If they fail of Succeſs, it is not for Want of Inclination but Power.</p>
            <p>WOULD to God, my Brethren, we were equally zealous in the Things which concern our immortal Welfare. But alas! to the eternal
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:013514_0095_0F90F5F5AD6D97C8"/>
Infamy of a great Part of Mankind, the Body engroſſes all their Thoughts, their nobler Spirits are treated with aſtoniſhing Indifference; tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory Vanities confine their Views, eternal Realities are comparatively deſpiſed. This un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Conduct degrades the Dignity of a reaſonable Creature, and makes us reſemble the Inferior Animals, who are under the entire Dominion of Senſe.—We wonder not, that thoſe Beings, who are only governed by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct; have no Views beyond the preſent Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: But that Men, to whom the Almighty hath given Underſtanding, and deſigned for a future Exiſtence, ſhould be wiſe only for this periſhing World, and diſregard the ſupreme Happineſs of their Nature—this is truly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing, and could not be believed, did not conſtant Experience evidence it to be a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly Truth.</p>
            <p>THIS Conduct of Mankind is highly crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, becauſe it is voluntary and choſen; and it is as fooliſh as criminal, becauſe it is attended with the moſt fatal Conſequences: If not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, it inevitably involves us in extreme and eternal Miſery. A Fool is generally eſteemed one of the moſt contemptible Characters; but when it is involuntary it does not merit any Puniſhment.—But fooliſhly to neglect the ultimate End of our Being, that we may gratify our inferior Paſſions; of Choice to ſacrifice our immortal Happineſs to a few tranſitory

Advantages, involves us in aggravated Guilt, and expoſes us to the ſevereſt Puniſhment.</p>
            <p>THIS is that awful Truth, which is taught by <hi>St. Paul,</hi> in the Words of my Text— <hi>How ſhall we eſcape, if we neglect ſo great Salvation?</hi>
            </p>

               <div n="1" type="section">
                  <head>FIRST, The Plan of this Salvation was formed in the eternal Counſels of Heaven.</head>
                  <p>MAN was originally the Favorite of his Almighty Creator: He gave him the firſt Place of Dignity in this viſible World: He united Heaven and Earth, Matter and Spirit, in the Compoſition of human Nature: He introduced our firſt Parents into Being, in the moſt agreeable Circumſtances, and bountifully provided for their Happineſs in a State of Innocence.—But the All-ſeeing Eye of God, which penetrates into the moſt diſtant Futurities, beheld the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful Apoſtacy of Man, and formed the Deſign of his Recovery.—He determined that Satan ſhould not triumph in his Succeſs, nor the human Race be irrecoverably ruined.— Though perfectly happy in the Enjoyment of Himſelf, He did not behold with Indifference the Miſery of Man. Though Millions of
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:013514_0098_0F90F5F8A8FDB6A0"/>
Worlds muſt have ſtarted into Being at his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative Command, yet He looked with Compaſſion on this revolted Earth, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to diſappoint the Devices of the Devil.</p>
                  <p>BUT the ſublimeſt Spirits in Heaven would have been eternally at a Loſs to find a Way, in which this benevolent Deſign could be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, and the Honor of the Deity preſerved. —The Demands of Juſtice muſt be anſwered, that Mercy may triumph in the Salvation of the Guilty—The Threatning of the Law muſt be fulfilled, that the Tranſgreſſor of it's righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Precepts may be pardoned.—The Dignity of the divine Government muſt be maintained, that condemned Rebels may be reſtored to Favor.—The righteous Governor of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe will evidence his Abhorrence of the Crime, while He receives the Criminal to the Embraces of his Love.</p>
                  <p>INFINITE Wiſdom hath reconciled theſe Difficulties, and formed a Plan, which gives the brighteſt Diſcovery of all the Perfections of the Deity, ſacredly maintains the Majeſty of his Government, and diſplays the Riches of his Grace to his apoſtate Creatures.—In Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to this Plan, the Son of God deſcends upon Earth in a human Form, fulfils the Law which we had violated, ſubmits to bear the Puniſhment of our Crimes; and thus prepares the Way for our Approach unto God, as a
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:013514_0099_0F90F56749764978"/>
compaſſionate and reconciled Father.—Here we have the moſt admirable Diſplay of divine Love, and the cleareſt Evidence of his Hatred to Sin: The Tranſgreſſion of the Law is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with awful Severity, and the Tranſgreſſor graciouſly forgiven. This is that mighty Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, which is the Aſtoniſhment of Angels, and the Joy of the Redeemed.

               <div n="2" type="section">
                  <head>SECONDLY, It was purchaſed by the Blood of the Son of God.</head>
                  <p>IN all Ages, God has done great Things in Favor of his choſen People: For their Sakes, He exerciſes his Patience to a revolted World, and delays that important Period, when this viſible Creation ſhall be conſumed by Fire: For their Sakes, He hath counteracted the eſtabliſhed Laws of Nature, and performed ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendous Miracles, in the Sight of Angels and Men: For their Sakes He will ſhortly <hi>deſcend from Heaven with a Shout, with the Voice of the Arch-Angel and the Trump of God:</hi> From his radiant Throne He will publickly pronounce them his Friends and Favorites, and receive them to a <hi>Kingdom prepared for them from before the Foundation of the World.</hi> But that which raiſes the Value of all theſe ſignal Favors, is the ineſtimable Price, with which they are purchaſed. I know Nothing ſo
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:013514_0100_0F90F568B6937368"/>
incomprehenſible to human Reaſon, as the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Son of God for a guilty World. If this Myſtery of divine Love had not been predicted by a Succeſſion of inſpired Prophets, confirmed by numerous and unqueſtionable Miracles, atteſted by Heaven and Earth, by Angels and Men—it could never be received as a Truth by any impartial Enquirer. It is difficult to conceive, that God would do ſo much for miſerable Man. But ſince He has given us this ſurpriſing Diſcovery of his Love, we may juſtly infer the Greatneſs of that Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs which He deſigns for his redeemed People.</p>
                  <p>ELEVATE your Thoughts, my Brethren, above theſe Regions of Senſe, aſcend in your devout Contemplations to the Throne of the Eternal Deity; behold THE SON OF GOD <hi>ſhining in the Brightneſs of his Father's Glory,</hi> ſurrounded with Myriads of adoring Angels.— Then view Him, deſcending upon Earth, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with Wounds, bathed in Blood, nailed to the Croſs, expiring in Death:—From the Dignity of his Perſon, learn the Value of his Sacrifice:—From the Severity of his Sufferings, learn the Greatneſs of his Purchaſe.—<hi>For us Men, and our Salvation,</hi> He appeared upon Earth <hi>in the Form of a Servant,</hi> paſſed through the Miſeries of Life, and ſubmitted to the Pains of Death. That Salvation, then, muſt be pronounced Great, which was procured at ſo

great a Price. Our bleſſed Lord would not have forſaken the Pleaſures of his Father's Boſom, parted with his heavenly Glory, and paſſed through this dark and diſtreſſing Scene of Sufferings, were it not to anſwer the moſt important Deſigns. He knew the juſt Value of Things, and eſteemed the Happineſs of his People an Equivalent for all the Sorrows of his Life and the Agonies of his Death.— Therefore we are aſſured that He ſhall <hi>ſee the Travail of his Soul and be ſatisfied.</hi> But fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to confirm this Point, we may conſider,</p>

               <div n="3" type="section">
                  <head>THIRDLY, The Miſſion of the Holy Ghoſt is deſigned to make us Partakers of this Salvation.</head>
                  <p>WHEN our bleſſed Lord finiſhed his Work upon Earth and aſcended to the Court of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, according to his Promiſe, He ſent down his Holy Spirit, to convince the World of Sin, to deliver them from it's fatal Dominion, and form them to a Meetneſs for the Kingdom of Glory. Every faithful Subject of our adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Redeemer is <hi>juſtified in the Name of Jeſus and ſanctified by the Spirit of our God.</hi> This divine Agent not only favors the Church with an external Revelation, but ſecretly influences the Minds of Men to attend to the Truths delivered in the inſpired Scriptures. He awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens them to a Senſe of their Danger while they continue in a State of Sin, animates them
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:013514_0102_0F90F56BDEF32050"/>
with a ſalutary Concern to <hi>fly from the Wrath to come</hi> —Though inconſiderate Sinners often reſiſt his ſacred Operations, and though a fond Attachment to their Luſts, reject the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent Methods of divine Grace, he does not immediately abandon his Work, but waits upon them with admirable Patience, repeats his faithful Warnings, continues his friendly Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ſtrives with them, from Day to Day, from Year to Year.</p>
                  <p>THIS is his general Conduct to Mankind, under the Diſpenſation of the Goſpel. Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, for their ungrateful Oppoſition to the Agency of the divine Spirit, are at laſt rejected of God, and left <hi>to conſume away in their Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities.</hi> But with reſpect to the <hi>Elect,</hi> He continues his Influences, ceaſes not to ſtrive with them, till their rebellious Hearts are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered <hi>in the Day of his Power,</hi> and they are made the Triumphs of divine Love, the Heirs of immortal Glory—Having produced this happy Change, He watches over them with affectionate Care, enlightens them in Darkneſs, ſupports them in Weakneſs, recovers them from their Relapſes, defends them in Dangers, and finally makes them victorious over all their ſpiritual Enemies. The Work which He has begun He will never forſake:—The Seed of Grace which He has implanted in their Hearts, He will cheriſh and encreaſe, till it produces the Fruits of Immortality and Glory.
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:013514_0103_0F90F56D53AAE980"/>
—Who can imagine the Holy Spirit would be ſo ſedulouſly employed to ſecure the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Mankind, were it not an Affair of the greateſt Importance. That muſt be of ineſtimable Value, which is accompliſhed at ſuch an infinite Expence. It is diſhonourable to ſuppoſe, that God ſhould ſend his Son from the Regions of Glory; that the Son ſhould humble himſelf to the Duſt of Death, that the Spirit ſhould employ his Almighty Energy, and not have in view the nobleſt Deſigns.</p>

                  <p>THESE benevolent Spirits, with a diſinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted Joy, congratulated the firſt Appearance of a Savior in this lower World; they attended Him through all the Sorrows of Life; they comforted Him at the Approaches of Death; they appeared in Robes of celeſtial Glory to adorn the Triumphs of his Reſurrection; they accompanied Him with joyful Acclamations in his Aſcent to the Kingdom of his Father.— Though they are illuſtrious Courtiers of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, they do not think the Inhabitants of this Earth beneath their Notice: Though they are the moſt exalted Part of the Creation, they diſdain not to maintain an Intercourſe with Worms of the Duſt:—When <hi>a Sinner is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted

from the Error of his Ways,</hi> the glad Tidings are propagated through the heavenly Manſions: <hi>There is Joy in the Preſence of the Angels of God,</hi> that an Addition is made to the happy Society above: They chearfully forſake their Thrones of Glory, to become <hi>miniſtring Spirits to thoſe who are appointed Heirs of Salvation:</hi> They <hi>encamp about the Dwellings of</hi> the Saints, deliver them from numberleſs Dangers, and by a Thouſand Offices of Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſupport and encourage them in their Paſſage through the Wilderneſs of this World. When the People of God have finiſhed their Work upon Earth, they ſurround their dying Beds, receive their departing Spirits, guard them from the malignant Powers of Darkneſs, conduct them through the Regions of the Air, and ſafely introduce them into the <hi>Paradiſe of God.</hi>—Thus the Soul of the deſpiſed <hi>Lazarus</hi> was <hi>carried by Angels into Abraham's Boſom.</hi> —Thus the Soul of every faithful Servant of Chriſt, when delivered from the Body, becomes the Charge of theſe heavenly Miniſters.—Nor do they deſiſt from their Care, till they have fixed it in theſe happy Abodes, where it is ſecure from every Danger.—Surely that Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation muſt be great, which theſe exalted Beings ſo affectionately deſire to promote: They would not willingly leave the rapturous Employments of Heaven, to ſecure a trifling Advantage. Inconſiderate Mortals may deſpiſe this Salvation, but it is highly eſteemed by
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:013514_0105_0F90F570094D5130"/>
thoſe wiſe and holy Beings, who live in the Light of the Divine Countenance, and cannot be miſtaken in the true Value of Things.</p>

                  <p>THE Devil is always repreſented as the Enemy of God and Goodneſs. Having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted his exalted Station, he envies the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Mankind. Condemned to the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of eternal Death, he ſeeks with inceſſant Malice to involve others in the ſame irremedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Ruin.—To accompliſh this accurſed De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, he employs every Art, and exerciſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable Diligence.—While Men go on ſecurely in the Ways of Sin, he flatters them with Hopes of Impunity, rocks them aſleep by a thouſand deceitful Suggeſtions, that they may be inſenſible of their Miſery and Danger. —If at any Time their guilty Fears are alarmed, he hurries them into the Buſineſs and Amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Life; that they may divert their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy Thoughts.

Adieu to every pleaſant Enjoyment, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn themſelves to perpetual Melancholy.— If all theſe Attempts are in vain, and we are effectually perſwaded to give up ourſelves to our compaſſionate Savior, even then he does not abandon his malicious Deſigns. When he cannot prevent our Happineſs, he endeavours to diſturb our Peace: When he cannot regain the Empire of our Hearts, he induſtriouſly ſtrives to pollute our Perſons and Performances: He follows us to <hi>the Altar of God,</hi> and by a Variety of Temptations, interrupts our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Heaven: He purſues us to the Gates of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> and never ceaſes to diſtreſs us, till we enter that bleſſed World from which he is forever excluded.—Now, what is it that animates Satan and his confederate Hoſts to employ all their Power and Policy to deſtroy Mankind?—They envy us the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that Heaven from which they are righteouſly baniſhed: Their Malice is ſo great, that it increaſes their Torment to behold others rejoicing in the Favor of God, when they are condemned to an eternal Departure from Him.</p>
                  <p>THUS I have endeavoured to give you ſome View of the Greatneſs of that Salvation which is revealed in the Goſpel.—It is great in the Judgment of Heaven and Hell.—The Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God and the Malice of Satan—<hi>the Angels of Light</hi> and the Miniſters of <hi>Darkneſs</hi> —all conſpire to proclaim it's Excellency and Value.</p>

                  <p>I. IS it not then aſtoniſhing Madneſs, to forfeit this Salvation for the meaneſt Trifles? And yet, O my Brethren, to the Diſgrace of the Chriſtian Name, this is a common Practice. We daily behold Souls capable of the extatic Joys of Heaven, confining their Purſuits to the defiling Pleaſures of this degenerate Earth. We daily behold Souls formed for the Society of Angels deſerting the Throne of Reaſon, and transformed into the Likeneſs of ſavage Brutes. They renounce the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for which they were originally deſigned, and think and act, as if they were made for no higher an End—than to delight their Eyes with ſplendid Proſpects—to gratify their Ears with the Harmony of Sounds—To pleaſe their Taſte with the Flavor of Meats and Drinks— and after having ſpent a few Years in theſe ſenſual Pleaſures, to retire off the Stage and be inſenſible forever.</p>
                  <p>IS this to act agreeable to the Character of Man, whom God appointed Lord of this lower Creation; who was formed after the Image of the Deity; who was placed upon Earth to glorify his Maker, and be eternally happy in the Enjoyment of his Love?—Are we capable of the Joys of Angels, and ſhall we aſſociate with the Beaſts that periſh?—Were we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to imitate the moral Perfections God,

the beſt of BEINGS, and ſhall we degrade ourſelves to a Reſemblance of the Devil, the moſt hateful of <hi>Creatures?</hi>—Awake, O Man I from this State of Infatuation. Ariſe, conſider the Greatneſs of your Folly. You are indeed fallen from your primitive Excellency; your Nature is corrupted in all it's Powers. But God has formed a Plan for the Recovery of the apoſtate Race of <hi>Adam:</hi> Chriſt has died for their Salvation: The Spirit is ſent down to operate on the Minds of Men, and transform them into <hi>New-Creatures:</hi> Shall the Love of God be deſpiſed—the Merits of Chriſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valued—the Influences of the Holy Ghoſt be reſiſted—and you periſh at laſt, notwithſtanding the Miracles of divine Grace for your Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very?—Had you rather Devils ſhould triumph in your Ruin, than Saints and Angels rejoice in your Salvation?</p>
                  <p>YOU will doubtleſs ſay—God forbid this ſhould be my Caſe.—But allow me to aſſure you, this muſt be your inevitable Deſtiny—if you neglect your immortal Concerns—ſpend your Time in the Vanities and Diverſions of Life—diſregard the Service of your Maker and Sovereign—live in thoſe Sins againſt which the Wrath of Heaven is denounced —There is no Medium—Every one of you muſt be perſwaded to give up yourſelves to the compaſſionate <hi>Jeſus</hi>; experience his ſaving Power reſcuing you from the Dominion

of Sin; and be made Partakers of the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Influences of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi>; or remain under the Wrath of God, and ſuffer the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Hell through immortal Ages.</p>
                  <p>FOR what do Mankind neglect their eternal Intereſt? A Stranger to human Nature muſt ſuppoſe it muſt be for ſomething of ineſtimable Value.—No—It is for the Pleaſures of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate Hour, for the Joys of a laſcivious Moment, for the fordid Gains of Avarice, for the childiſh Amuſements which take place on this Theatre of Vanity.—For theſe Heaven is renounced, Hell is choſen.</p>
                  <p>SUFFER not, O my Brethren, <hi>the God of this World</hi> to blind your Eyes; attend to <hi>the one Thing needful.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>WERE we condemned to periſh without Remedy, it would be cruel to attempt to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb your preſent Repoſe—Were the <hi>great Salvation</hi> unattainable by the Children of Men, all Exhortations to ſecure it would be imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and abſurd. But this World is the Region of Hope: While we reſide upon Earth we are Candidates for an heavenly Inheritance: Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals of Grace are made to Sinners of every Order and Character: They are both invited and commanded to accept the Great Salvation. —Thoſe who are involved in the deepeſt Guilt, and pining away in Indigence and Miſery,
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:013514_0110_0F90F03B6D2AF530"/>
are to be compelled, by all the perſwaſive Charms of divine Grace, by every Argument that can gain the Attention and Influence the Choice of a rational Creature, to accept of Life and Happineſs.—It was our Wants, and not our Worthineſs, that engaged our heavenly Father to form the Plan of our Redemption — It is to extricate us out of Miſery, and not to reward our Virtues, that a Savior is provided for us. The only Qualification a Sinner can have antecedent to an Union to Chriſt, is a deep Senſe of his Miſery, a Deſpair of all Relief in himſelf, a Willingneſs to receive a Supply of all his Wants from the Fountain of all Good.—Therefore, <hi>Whoſoever will</hi>—is the Language of eternal Love. It is an undoubted Truth, that none periſh under the Advantages of the Goſpel, but in conſequence of their own voluntary Choice: By a poſitive Act of their Wills they reject Chriſt and the important Bleſſings He offers to their Acceptance: He refuſes None that rely on his Power and Grace; but affectionately calls all <hi>weary and heavy laden Sinners to come to Him,</hi> and kindly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, <hi>I will give you Reſt.</hi>—The whole Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Believers on Earth, and the radiant Aſſembly of glorified Saints in Heaven, bear their united Teſtimony to this conſolatory Truth.—In the Character of guilty Creatures they caſt themſelves down at the Feet of an Almighty Savior: encouraged by the unlimit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Calls of his Word, they committed their

                  <p>IF the <hi>King of Kings</hi> hath publiſhed a royal Proclamation, inviting his rebellious Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to return to their Allegiance and receive, not only a free Pardon, but the Dignity and Privilege of Favorites—We may be aſſured, without Danger of Deception, that thoſe who obey the Call, ſhall obtain the promiſed Mercy. —It is beneath the Character of the Deity, to amuſe his Creatures with imaginary Hopes, or diſappoint the Expectations of thoſe who rely on his faithful Word. <hi>The Strength of Iſrael will not lie:</hi> The immutable <hi>Jehovah</hi> will not repent of the Purpoſes of his Love.</p>
                  <p>To confirm our Faith, we may take a View of the Conduct of our divine Maſter, when he condeſcended to be an Inhabitant of this inferior Earth: None were rejected, that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to Him in their Diſtreſs:—All were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that came to Him in the Language of humble Faith. The moſt deſpicable Objects

were received with condeſcending Goodneſs, and reſtored to Health and Vigor by the Greatneſs of his Power. The vileſt Sinners were delivered from the Dominion of their infamous Luſts, and aſſured of the Forgiveneſs of their aggravated Crimes.—He is now the ſame mighty and compaſſionate Savior He ever was: The Dignity to which He is advanced, has neither diminiſhed his Power, or abated his generous Concern for the Welfare of Mankind: —He is equally willing to hearken to the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicating Voice of his diſtreſſed Creatures— equally willing to deliver them from their Guilt and Danger.</p>
                  <p>WHO can diſpute his Power, when all Nature obeys his Laws, and the moſt perfect Orders of Creatures are governed by the Direction of his Will!—Who can queſtion his Readineſs to apply his Power to relieve thoſe who confide in Him!—Behold! the Sufferings He endured —the Blood He ſhed—the Death He under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went for the Salvation of a guilty World:— Every Wound diſcovers the Compaſſions of his Heart; His expiring Agonies purchaſed eternal Redemption for all who place their Truſt in Him.</p>
                  <p>HE was <hi>once lifted up on an</hi> infamous <hi>Croſs,</hi> and is <hi>now exalted to a Throne of Glory,</hi> to evidence that He is <hi>able to ſave to the uttermoſt all that come to God by Him.</hi>—Thoſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

            <p>THE moſt generous Medicines, if they do not anſwer the End for which they were adminiſtred, often exaſperate the Diſeaſe, and render the Circumſtances of the Patient more dangerous: In like Manner, the Goſpel, which is deſigned to reſtore Mankind to ſpiritual Health, if it does not produce the deſired Effect, is attended with the moſt preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial Conſequences. If the Methods of Divine Grace are deſpiſed they involve us in aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated Guilt, and end in irrecoverable Miſery. The Puniſhment of Infidels, who enjoy the Light of Revelation, will be infinitely more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible than that which ſhall be inflicted on un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſtructed

Pagans. THE SON OF GOD, whom they deſpiſe, no longer reſides upon Earth in a State of Poverty and Meanneſs; but is aſcended above the viſible Heavens, and ſways the Sceptre of the Univerſe. The once deſpiſed GALI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEAN is ſeated on a Throne of Light, Angels proſtrate themſelves at His Feet, and Devils tremble at the Terrors of His Wrath. He has Crowns of Glory to reward His faithful Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and a glittering Sword to deſtroy His im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable Enemies.</p>
            <p>THEREFORE, we find the Miſery of the wicked was never painted in more terrible Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, than by that divine Meſſenger, who <hi>came not to condemn the World, but that the World through Him might be ſaved.</hi> The <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> who imitated their bleſſed Maſter, perſwaded Men, by <hi>the Terrors of the Lord not to receive the Grace of God in Vain.</hi>

Theſe Words are an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference from the Severity which attended the legal Diſpenſation. <hi>If the Word ſpoken by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels was ſtedfaſt, and every Tranſgreſſion and Diſobedience received a juſt Recompence of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, how ſhall we eſcape,</hi> &amp;c.—The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning is concluſive—the Threatning it contains ſhould inſpire us with awful Fear, leſt it be

executed upon us. The Law pronounced Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Death upon the preſumptuous Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor: The Man who violated the Sanctity of <hi>the Sabbath</hi> was immediately ſtoned: Many Thouſand <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were deſtroyed in one Day for their idolatrous Practices. The Apoſtle aſſures us, that ſeverer Puniſhments are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the profane Deſpiſers of the Goſpel —<hi>How ſhall they eſcape</hi>—This Method of Expreſſion declares, that to eſcape is a vain Expectation—an impoſſible Attempt.</p>
            <p>THOSE who neglect the great Salvation of the Goſpel muſt inevitably periſh.—To evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence this, I ſhall ſhow—This is the Sentence pronounced upon them by impartial Juſtice— God has Power to execute this Sentence— Mercy has provided no Way of Relief.</p>
            <div n="1" type="part">
               <head>FIRST, THE Sentence of inevitable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction is pronounced upon the Deſpiſers of the Goſpel by the Juſtice of God.</head>
               <p>IT is the poſitive Determination of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme and uncontroulable Sovereign of the World—<hi>He that believeth not ſhall be damned.</hi> This Sentence is fixed in the immutable Decree of God, and will be executed in the appointed Time. By Sin Man is become an Enemy to God, and if he perſiſts in his Rebellion, Juſtice muſt triumph in his final Deſtruction. God beholds his unhappy Offspring with Pity; He
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:013514_0117_0F90F5762D762F00"/>
propoſes Terms of Peace; He ſends his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors to proclaim the glad Tidings to a guilty World: Aſtoniſhing Love!—Is it not daring Impiety to refuſe the great God an Hearing?—Is it not inexcuſable Inſolence to reject his Propoſals?—This is the Practice of Multitudes—They preſumptuouſly deſpiſe his Grace:—This is plainly to declare, that they value not his Friendſhip, nor fear the Terrors of his Wrath.—It is fit ſuch obſtinate Rebels ſhould abide by the Conſequence of their own Choice.—They <hi>judge themſelves unworthy of Life eternal,</hi> and are juſtly condemned to ſuffer the Pains of eternal Death.</p>
               <p>HAD divine Goodneſs ſignified his Intention to mitigate the Sentence of his righteous Law, or grant a temporary Suſpenſion of the deſerved Puniſhment, it muſt have been acknowledged a Favor, and ought to be received with Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude:—But He proclaims complete Deliverance to the Captives of Hell—A Deliverance not to be purchaſed by us, but thankfully received.— This contains a Freedom from all the Miſeries we feel or fear—A perfect and perpetual En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of every deſirable Good.—Now, muſt not they periſh, who are unwilling to be ſaved?—Should not they remain under Guilt, who refuſe the Offer of a Pardon?</p>
               <p>MEN may pleaſe themſelves with unground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Surmiſes; but God will not ſuffer his Laws
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:013514_0118_0F90F03DAE714070"/>
to be violated—His Grace abuſed—His Juſtice inſulted—His Glory eclipſed, that obſtinate Tranſgreſſors may eſcape with Impunity.</p>

               <head>SECONDLY, IF impartial Juſtice pronounces the Sentence, the ſovereign Ruler has Power to put it in Execution.</head>
               <p>THIS none can diſpute who believe the Exiſtence of a God. He who made the World by a Command, can deſtroy it in a Moment with a Frown. His Power is ſupreme and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent: Nothing can alter his Purpoſes, or reſiſt the Execution of his Will: His Smiles diffuſe Life and Joy through all the Inhabitants of Heaven: His wrathful Preſence fills the Regions of Hell with Darkneſs, Terror and Deſpair.</p>
               <p>MEN often eſcape the Stroke of human Juſtice, by Art and Addreſs: They may fly from the Power of the mighty Monarchs of the Earth, and find a Retreat beyond the Limits of their Juriſdiction: Death always removes us out of their Reach; the Effects of their Anger cannot enter the Repoſitory of the Grave:— But whither ſhall we flee from God! To what Part of the Univerſe can we eſcape and be free from his Arreſts! Death itſelf conveys us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his immediate Preſence, and delivers us up, the helpleſs Victims of his Vengeance.</p>
               <p>IF indeed the Diſſolution of the Body was the Deſtruction of the Soul, we might neglect
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:013514_0119_0F90F03E6D6F68A0"/>
the Salvation of the Goſpel, and eſcape all future Puniſhment: But to ſuppoſe this, is to contradict the Voice of Reaſon, the Teſtimony of Conſcience, the unerring Orcles of Truth. That the Soul of Man is immortal, is a Doctrine of natural and revealed Religion.—The ancient Philoſophers were inſpired with this Hope.— Jeſus Chriſt hath confirmed it by expreſs De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations and aſtoniſhing Miracles. The Soul is not formed of the Duſt, but immediately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the Great <hi>Father of Spirits.</hi> The Body is a beautiful Fabrick, finiſhed with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate Art; but animated, directed and moved by the immortal Mind: The Body is compoſed of different Parts, and may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by innumerable Accidents; but the Soul is a ſimple uncompounded Subſtance, not liable to a Diſſolution. Theſe are ſtrong Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions in Favor of this important Truth.— But that which Reaſon pronounces probable, revealed Religion declares to be certain. The Syſtem of the Goſpel is built on this Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: They who deny it not only reject the <hi>Religion of Jeſus,</hi> but are Enemies to the Peace and good Order of civil Society.—They oppoſe thoſe Sentiments which are common to all, except the moſt abandoned of the human Race, and level themſelves with the Beaſts that periſh. Not only the Philoſophers of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Athens,</hi> but <hi>Barbarians</hi> and <hi>Scythians,</hi> will riſe up againſt them and condemn them.</p>

                  <pb n="117" facs="unknown:013514_0120_0F90F03F2D02A0F8"/>IF the Soul exiſts in a future State, it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives and acts, for theſe are eſſential to its Nature; and therefore it is capable of Rewards and Puniſhments. The God of Truth aſſures us, that when <hi>the Body</hi> deſcends into <hi>the Duſt, the Soul returns to God that gave it.</hi>—To God—to triumph in his Love, or to experience the Effects of his ſevere Diſpleaſure:—While thoſe who embrace the great Salvation, <hi>enter into the Joy of their Lord,</hi> they who deſpiſe and neglect it muſt ſuffer <hi>eternal Deſtruction from the Preſence of the Lord and the Glory of his Power.</hi>—If the Juſtice of God hath pronounced Sentence againſt them—if He has Power to execute this Sentence—there can be no Hope of Eſcape, except ſome Method is appointed for their Deliverance.

of condemned Man, was the higheſt Evidence of the Divine Benevolence, and will be celebrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Tranſports of Gratitude, through un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſing Ages.—But if this Love is undervalued, if Mercy is inſolently deſpiſed, and the great Sacrifice for Sin rejected; there remains no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource; the Criminal is placed beyond all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of Pardon.—To what Sanctuary will he fly? The Law pronounces the terrible Sentence, Juſtice demands immediate Execution, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted Mercy increaſes the Severity of the Puniſhment.</p>
               <p>SHALL Chriſt again deſcend from the Throne of Glory, and <hi>Tabernacle in Fleſh?</hi> Shall the Prince of Life again ſubmit to the Stroke of Death; that the Deſpiſers of His Merits and Righteouſneſs may be ſaved?

                  <p>DO you diſpute this?

                  <p>IF our corrupt Reaſon is to be advanced to the infallible Chair, and the Articles of Religion are to be explained according to it's Dictates, many of it's ſublimeſt Truths will be pronounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed falſe, and it's ſelf-denying Precepts accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated to the Genius of a degenerate Age.</p>

They diſſipate their Thoughts upon a thouſand Objects, and live without Retirement or Reflexion.—They contemplate theſe viſible Heavens and meaſure the Magnitude, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate the Diſtance of the Stars; but give themſelves no Concern to ſecure an Entrance into the <hi>Heaven of Heavens,</hi> the Habitation

                  <p>THIS careleſs and ſenſual Courſe of Life might perhaps admit of ſome Excuſe, if at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with no hurtful Conſequences; but ſince it is inconſiſtent with all regular Hopes of Salvation; ſince, if not awakned out of it, we remain the Children of Wrath; every conſiderate Mind muſt condemn Sinners of this Order, as the greateſt of Madmen.</p>
                  <p>WHAT would you think of a Priſoner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined in Chains, who knew the Day of his Trial was approaching, that Sentence of Death was ready to be pronounced upon him; and when once pronounced could never be recalled, but would certainly be executed:—If in this melancholy Situation he was aſſured that a Way of Eſcape was provided:—But inſtead of improving the Opportunity afforded him, he

diſregarded the Meſſage, and ſpent his Time in Sports and Diverſion, till the fatal Hour arrive which excludes all Hopes forever!— Would not every impartial Obſerver pronounce his Conduct the Extremity of Madneſs?</p>
                  <p>THIS is but a faint Image of the Madneſs which poſſeſſes the Hearts of ſecure Sinners.— As much as the Puniſhment of Hell is to be dreaded above the momentary Miſeries of this Life, ſo much greater is the Folly of thoſe who neglect <hi>the Day of their Viſitation.</hi>

            <head>SERMON VIII. The JOY of FAITH.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>1 PETER, I. 8.</bibl>
               <q>Whom having not ſeen ye love, in whom though now ye ſee Him not, <hi>YET BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIEVING YE REJOICE</hi> with Joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable and full of Glory.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>TO rejoice is agreeable to all Mankind; though there are but few, who have a juſt Foundation for it. None have a Claim to this Privilege, but thoſe who are in Friendſhip with that adorable Being, who is the Fountain of Felicity to all his Creatures. All the human Race are become Enemies to God, through the Depravity of their Natures and the voluntary Tranſgreſſions of their Lives: A Reconciliation muſt take place, otherwiſe the Enmity will be perpetual, and the Miſery of Man irrecoverable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="128" facs="unknown:013514_0131_0F90F57EB9038CF0"/>IN <hi>Chriſt God is reconciling the World unto Himſelf:</hi> None can rejoice in God, but thoſe who are intereſted in His Dear Son: He has made Satisfaction for the Sins of a guilty World; but thoſe who do not receive Him as their Savior are deprived of the Advantages which flow from his Merits and Mediation: He hath purchaſed every Bleſſing for his People, but thoſe who are not united to Him by Faith, <hi>are Aliens and Strangers from the Commonwealth of Iſrael and the Covenants of Promiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ST. PETER, in the Words of my Text, deſcribes the Character of true Chriſtians, and declares their Privilege. That Savior who was once an Inhabitant of this inferior Earth, but now <hi>ſeated at the Right Hand of the Majeſty on High,</hi> is the Object of their undiſſembled Affection: They view Him by Faith, in all the Glories of his Perſon and Character; <hi>and believing they rejoice.</hi>—The Words of my Text teach us this Truth, which ſhall be the Subject of our preſent Meditation—
<q>ALL true Believers have a juſt Foundation for Rejoicing.—</q>
            </p>
            <p>TO illuſtrate this, let us take a View of ſome of their important Privileges.—Their Sins are forgiven—Their Perſons and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances are accepted—Their Natures are
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:013514_0132_0F90F58252A0D450"/>
ſanctified—They are the Care of a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed Providence—Nothing can do them any eſſential Hurt—All Things will conſpire to promote their real Good—They have the aſſured Proſpect of immortal Glory.</p>
            <div n="1" type="part">
               <head>FIRST, THEY may rejoice that their Sins are forgiven.</head>
               <p>THIS is the Covenant which God eſtabliſhes with them through Chriſt their exalted Head: <hi>I will be merciful to your Unrighteouſneſs, your Iniquities will I remember no more.</hi> To learn the Value of this Privilege, let us conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Number and Aggravation of our Sins. —But <hi>who can underſtand his Errors!</hi> Who can recount his continual Deviations from the Law of God, the unerring Standard of our Duty! In many Things we all offend, in every Thing we fall ſhort: The Defects which attend our beſt Performances are highly crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal: The Defilements which accompany our pureſt Services are juſtly offenſive to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted Majeſty of Heaven.—What ſhall we ſay of our preſumptuous Violations of the Divine Commands!—Theſe are committed againſt Light and Love; not through involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Surprize, but deliberate Rebellion: They are peculiarly diſpleaſing to God, and call aloud for Vengeance.</p>
               <p>HOW aſtoniſhing is that Grace! which par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons all theſe Sins of every Order and Degree, with all the heinous Circumſtances which
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:013514_0133_0F90F5838069D9A8"/>
attend them.—With what admiring Gratitude muſt we rejoice in that God, who declares, <hi>He is merciful and gracious, abundant in Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Truth, forgiving Iniquity, Tranſgreſſion and Sin!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>TO increaſe our Gratitude we may conſider, the pardoning Mercy of God is not barely a preſent Benefit, but attended with the moſt laſting and ſalutary Effects. It aſſures us of immediate Safety, and preſerves us from future Condemnation. The Sentence of Abſolution is paſt in Favor of every true Believer in the Court of Heaven, and will never be revoked, through the varying Scenes of the preſent Life, or the unchanging Ages of Eternity. Well might the Pſalmiſt triumph in his Happineſs, and pronounce a Bleſſedneſs on the Man <hi>whoſe Iniquities are forgiven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>LET us ſuppoſe a Malefactor condemned to ſuffer an infamous Death; the Day is come; the appointed Hour approaches, in which he muſt deliver himſelf into the Hands of the Executioner; he beholds with weeping Eyes and a trembling Heart, the ſolemn Preparation made for his Puniſhment.—If in the critical Moment a Pardon arrive, which delivers him from all his Diſtreſſes and Fears; will not his Heart leap for Joy, and Nature ſink under the exceſſive Tranſport?—But God beſtows a more ineſtimable Favor on the true Believer.— He delivers him not from the Pains of a

Secure of an invincible Friend, we need not fear—the Lightnings of Heaven— the Shakings of the Earth—nor the Flames that ſhall conſume this habitable Globe.— Let the <hi>Sun</hi> be covered with Darkneſs, the <hi>Moon</hi> withdraw her Light, and this material Univerſe ſink into Ruin:—Let theſe <hi>Tabernacles</hi> of Clay be deſtroyed by the Stroke of Death, and this beautiful Arrangement of <hi>Fleſh and Blood</hi> return to it's original Duſt:—Let the illuſtrious Day appear, when the SON OF GOD ſhall deſcend from Heaven in radiant Majeſty, and ſummon the trembling Nations to ſtand at his impartial Bar:—The true Believer <hi>will lift up his Head with Joy</hi> amidſt theſe aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing Scenes, and with a Voice of Triumph congratulate the Appearance of his GOD and SAVIOR: Clothed with his Righteouſneſs, he fears no Condemnation; animated by his Spirit, he is ſure to be found among the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his Friends.—If the Judge is his Friend, what can prejudice his Happineſs?

               <p>WHILE we reſide upon Earth, we neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily partake of thoſe Miſeries which are inſeperable from a State of Mortality; but when removed from this <hi>Valley of Tears,</hi> we enter on the true Felicity and Glory of our Natures.

               <p>THE happieſt Condition on Earth is not equal to the magnificent Promiſes of divine Grace, nor anſwerable to the ſublime Hopes which God has implanted in the Breaſts of his People. Though their Joys are ſuperior to

               <p>WELL <hi>may the Voice of Rejoicing be heard in the Tabernacles of the Righteous.</hi>—Have I received Jeſus as my Savior?—Has a View of his Glory inſpired me with unfeigned Love to his Perſon and Character?—Is his Salvation more precious in my Eſteem than the deareſt earthly Enjoyments?—Do I value <hi>his Favor as Life, and his Loving-kindneſs as better than Life?</hi>—Then let me rejoice that God has opened my Eyes, to diſcern the true Value of Things, and directed me to chooſe that <hi>good Part that can never be taken away.</hi> After a few Struggles more with a corrupted Heart, a few more Selfdenials in an enſnaring World, I ſhall enter upon a State of Exiſtence, in which my Nature will be perfected, my Joys ſincere, my Happineſs complete, without Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and without End.</p>

                  <p>DELUDED Mortals are prejudiced againſt the Ways of Chriſt; they imagine they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet with Thorns, and that thoſe who walk in them muſt bid Adieu to every agreeable Enjoyment.</p>
                  <p>BUT, this is a fatal Miſtake: Our amiable Maſter conſults the preſent Comfort as well as future Welfare of thoſe who enroll themſelves under his Banners.

                  <p>THE Pleaſures of Sin are indeed inconſiſtent with the Character of a Diſciple of Chriſt.

The Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Religion, may be compared to the <hi>Path of the Juſt, which ſhineth more and more to the perfect Day.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>HOW conſolatory are the Diſcoveries of the Goſpel!

                  <p>THIS is the Deſign I have been carrying on in ſeveral Diſcourſes; and certainly Nothing can be more worthy the Attention of a Being in a State of Trial, and deſigned for an eternal Exiſtence.

                  <p>THINK, O my Brethren, how full—how free—how unlimitted are the Calls of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Mercy? With what Authority does God Command!

                  <p>REVIEW the unſpeakable Bleſſings which will be the immediate Portion of thoſe, who receive this great Salvation with Humility and Gratitude, and labour to obtain it with indefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigable Zeal and Diligence.—<hi>Being juſtified by Faith in Jeſus,</hi> they become Members of his ſacred Family, they enjoy the Privileges of the Children of God, and in the Relation of Children are Heirs of His heavenly Kingdom.

                  <p>BUT if Men bar their Hearts againſt the Impreſſions of incarnate Love, and give the Bleſſed Savior a final refuſal; <hi>God—His elect Angels</hi>—and <hi>the Aſſembly of perfected Spirits</hi> will rejoice in their Damnation—May infinite

                  <p>BUT make a Pauſe—Bethink yourſelves before it be too late: You have no Time to trifle—Your <hi>Life is as a Vapor,</hi> and may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire before the Dawn of another Day: Or, if your Time upon Earth is lengthned out, a provoked God may <hi>ſwear in his Wrath that you ſhall never enter into his Reſt.—Conſider this, ye that forget God—Kiſs ye the Son leſt He be angry, when his Wrath is but kindled: Bleſſed are they that truſt in Him.</hi>—</p>
